http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-st-augustine-i-95-saint-augustine,Best Western St. Augustine I-95,4.0,$$,14,"On a recent stay, I work for a company where we need housing for a few months at a time. With that said, we hadn't stayed at a Beat Western in awhile, and I wasn't sure about the place at first. But here are some of the Highlights and Low points during our three month stay:Low Lights: 1.) if you are a person with neck, back or nerve issues, I do not recommend the beds. They are very stiff, blankets are thin, pillows not supportive. Bring your own. 2.) No Microwave3.) Bathtub leaks/drips not fixed (we stayed in room 144). 4.) Front entry door sticks, hard to close.5.) No air vent in any of the bathrooms.6.) Rooms are small7.) No comfy chairs or couches in your room for relaxing. 8.) computer chair and desk do not pair well, as the chair is too low and your PC sits up high to type. Not very ergonomical. 9.) Room walls are thin and can hear next door people. Highlights: 1.) Staff is friendly 2.) Housekeeping is available for any extras needed for your room. However, a few times the room was cleaned but the beds were not made. 3.) Updated tile in bathroom4.) New carpet in rooms5.) Fridge is available upon request.6.) Very Clean 7.) Breakfast room is good, but wish they had more healthy choices besides carbs. 8.) Overall price you pay, is good if you want to shop at the Outlet, or got to downtown St. Augustine.After a recent stay at another Best Western I was reluctant to stay at any Best Western again. I took a chance and I'm do happy I did.To stay in town it was $70-120 higher than here. I usually stay in town but this hotel is only 15 min. away and you're right across the street from the outlets. It's the best of both worlds!It's only 2 floors and on the small side but for a place just to lay my head it was ideal.        Everyone at the front desk we're professional and helpful. There was always someone there 24 hours and there was someone to assist with my suitcases. I received the exact room that I had reserved. The room itself was on the smaller side but certainly was sufficient. The linens and decor were modern with bright lines. It was absolutely spotless in every room! Bonus was a new electrical strip to charge your electronics. Housekeeping was available if you needed them and were helpful. The only thing missing was a fridge but for one night I could do without it. What a refreshing change of pace from the last Best Western I stayed at. Make sure you make reservations early as they may be full.It is Definetly not a 5 star hotel, but it serves its purpose. They let us check in around 11 am which was awesome! And the staff was very friendly. Room and bathroom  were very very clean and no smell at all! The inside rooms look way better than the outside, we got a room with pool view which makes it better. It's located 12 min away from Castillo de San Marcos and all other attractions, so location is good. We got the hotel through Hotwire at a great price. I would stay here again. I'm giving 3 stars because the outside doesn't look like a 4 or 5 star hotel, but the rooms are definitely very good. And it's a green hotel, so thumbs up for that!!!Bathrooms have been recently updated &amp; are Clean. Only problems: low placed shower head &amp; no exhaust fan. Bed Linens are modern &amp; fresh. Easy drive in to the historic district. Several fast food chains in walking distance, but the restaurants in the historic district are more than worth the drive. Check out Columbia. We were in room 217, 2nd room from the stairs and we could hear people loudly stomping on the metal stairs at 6am. Maybe when they remodel the exterior of the building, they could consider an update &amp; install a quieter stair systemSpending two nights at this hotel, we found our room ready when we showed up early. That was great after driving all night. The lady at the desk was friendly and efficient. Our room is very basic, but there is also nothing to complain about. It was clean, no odor, and even though the hotel is pretty much full, it's very quiet. The king size bed is comfortable and has 4 pillows.  This hotel is on the outskirts of town, but very convenient to the highway. It's a 10 minute drive to get into town, no problem. They offer a complimentary breakfast, but there are other options within walking distance. I would not think twice about staying here again, great place, great value. This is not a high end establishment, but for a budget place to stay it is a great deal.We stayed here about 4 years ago and thought it was pretty good for the price. We stayed here again just a few weeks ago after their renovations and it was spectacular for the price. Clean, modern and quiet. They have a great breakfast in the morning with eggs, sausage, waffles and the usual cereals, yogurt and pastries. The staff was very friendly and helpful and again, the room was very clean. Well worth the price and just off I-95 so the entire area is easily accessible. Only about a 7 minute drive into the historic area as well. We will most definitely stay here again!Great Price and Tanya was very nice when we checked in and when we called . Me and my wife called other motels and everyone was rude but her nice demeanor sold us to stay here . We are from L.A. Cal. so we have been driving slot I would definitely stay here again.  She was probably the best one to take our call all trip long.Thank you again Tanya keep up the great work.OVERALL What can you expect from an inexpensive, dog-friendly motel? Stinky rooms, that's what...at least the rooms they allow for dogs. We stayed here because it cost less than other places, so we saved money, AND we were able to bring our dogs, saving us money on boarding. SERVICE Good. The flexible and friendly service/management made the overall experience not so bad. BREAKFAST The continental breakfast was the typical carb-fest with no meats but not terrible - there were hard-boiled eggs and sugary Borden yogurt, a waffle iron, and a selection of breads and cereals and juice. The breakfast area was mega crowded and tiny, though! THE ROOM Stunk, but we could breathe. Tiny bathroom. Damage from previous occupants' pets, including a hole in the wall. One bed had black dog fur on it and our dogs are white/cream colored, so I don't think they changed the sheets. Of course there were urine smells, but also a musty/mildewy type odor. But hey, whatever, there was a large nice TV, clean starchy towels, and overall it wasn't awful. LOCATION Not far, maybe 10-20 minutes, from most popular St. Augustine attractions. BOTTOM LINE If you need a dog-friendly cost-effective stay, this isn't your worst option.This was a nice hotel, the price was great! The rooms and bathrooms were newly updated and the beds were cozy. If you want to go to St. Augustine to see the sights, I'd recommend picking a hotel more in the city. This one is off I-95 and its a bit of a drive to get into the city. What we saved in hotel fees, we spent in gas driving back and forth. Next time I'll stay at the other best westerns that are actually in the city and you can just walk the whole time you're there, not drive back and forth.We recently stayed during a convention in St. Augustine and this place was easy to find right off the interstate and easy to get back where we were going. Very close to Taco Bell and Denny's (walking distance) and actually pretty good rooms.  Though we did have an issue the second night with the smoke detector, they came up quickly to fix the issue. Pros:Pretty comfy beds (me being pregnant this is an essential) Nice Clean roomGood free internet (didnt drop nor did we have issues connecting) Good breakfastNice well lit bathroomCons: The breakfast area is SMALL, its hard to eat comfortably unless you eat outside the area. If you can afford it, eat at Denny's which is really good.No amenities, needs more than a hair dryer and coffee maker, please to put in a fridge? All in all it was worth the price we paid for it, and they are very reasonable with pricing and offer a military discount. They didnt disturb the room like we wanted and we werent disturbed much at night so its definitely a good place to stay.Great hotel! Right off the I95 about 10 minutes from historic St Augustine. Clean and the staff is friendly. I had the pleasure of checking in with Dora. There is a Denny's and a Taco Bell next door and you can't beat the free wifi and parking right in front of your room!Pros:King sized bed upgrade was worth it (although put us in the back of the property). Staff was delightful and quick to help. Room was clean and looks like new TV's were recently put in. Wi-fi is also free but could be a little faster.Cons:They don't have fridges in the room, you have to ask for one to borrow for your stay. Bathroom is a little cramped (door comes within a hair of the toilet). Also, had to kill a huge-ass roach.Overall, it was a good stay.",,,,,"['recent', 'work', 'company', 'need', 'housing', 'months', 'time', 'said', 'beat', 'western', 'awhile', 'sure', 'place', 'first',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/howard-johnson-johnson-st-augustine-i-95-st-augustine,Howard Johnson Johnson St Augustine I-95,1.0,$$,12,"doest get one star because i got the room for 40 bucks on hipmunk and the king bed was comfy and the hot water worked. otherwise wifi is broke, no towels in room, staff is pretty gross, and this place is ghetto. wont come backBeware!! Do not stay here!! Decided to come to St. Augustine one night earlier so we needed to find a cheap room for just one night.. We paid $110 for ONE night to stay at this trash heap. Check in took 20 minutes+ due to the employee not having a clue as to what he was doing, also talking on the phone while working. Once we finally did get to our room, the door was OPEN, my boyfriend walked in first to make sure no one was inside. It was empty but there was a screw driver next to the toilet, a rag shoved into the tub, and a plunger... It was DISGUSTING!!! We had to wait in line again (at this point there are at least five people ahead of us). It is ridiculous to have to wait in line again when it was there stupidity to give us a room that obviously has major issues. I told my boyfriend that we should just stay somewhere else but he thought it would be okay if we just got a different room. The second room did not have bed bugs (the only plus I can think of). While in the shower the light cover fell off the wall because it was being held to the wall with duck tape. The hand towel had a long hair sticking out of the weaving. Gross. I always bring soaps and shampoo/conditioner when traveling which is good because the size of their shampoo could probably only wash an infants amount of hair. Pathetic. Do not stay here!!This place was absolutely disgusting. There were stains on the bathroom wall near the toilet that looked like someone smeared poo on it . The floor near the toilet was weak and felt as if it was going to give at any time. The coffee maker looked as if it was never cleaned. The microwave was rusted out on the inside. The lampshades were torn up. It appeared that the room had not been vacuumed or swept in ages and the smell of the mildew was too much. We paid $85 for the night..it wasn't worth $8 a night. Don't even slow down near this place ..just keep going.I, like some of the other reviewers, got this hotel for a discount from KAYAK. I know the other hotels in the area are pricier, but please, just bite the bullet and pay more.First off, because I checked in early, I had to pay an additional $20. It shouldn't be my problem that they're unprepared and I have to pay more.Second, there was NO COMFORTER ON OUR BED!!! Granted the sheets were thick, but for $20 more, I could have stayed at another hotel with a comforter on the bed. I think they used the comforters to create curtains for the window.Third, the TV sucks! Some channels have lines in the TV, the audio on some channels sounds like loud white noise to where you can't hear any of the actors talking and other channels are just static. Fourth, the Wi-Fi signal is so weak that it's basically non-existent. Clearly, the owner here doesn't give a f*ck about its customers! Fifth, there were bugs in our bed. Nuff said!Sixth, the sink was linking and its a good thing I unplugged the hair dryer otherwise I would have been electrocuted. I really wish I just shelled out the additional $50 for a bay front hotel in St. Augustine. If you're looking for a good hotel, please don't take these reviews lightly. Just suck it up and go with the more expensive option. Hell, if I knew whoever was reading this personally, I might give them the money myself to go get a better hotel! (You can take that last sentence lightly, but that's all! Lol)If I could give no stars I would! The first room we got had roaches in the bed, not just 1 or 2. There was a ton of them! The next room looked like a blast from the past! They advertise flat screen tvs and remodeled rooms, we got a old desk and dresser with a box TV. Then our room keys wouldn't work so we had to go back to the office and get new ones. No house keeper ever came by so new towels? Nope! You would think the front desk would care about these issues, right? No, they acted like we complained about the color of the room. THERE WERE ROACHES IN THE DAMN BED!! Do yourself a favor and never EVER stay here!!I would say this place is laughably awful except after leaving you feel kind of itchy which isn't so funny. They come fully equipped with a TV from the mid 90's about 7 channels work well, the shower took forever to get hot and the staff in the front office was slower than frozen molasses. This place is perfect if you're a trailer trash Harley rider who's life goal was to own a motorcycle rather than a proper non movable home. Howard Johnson should cut the cord on this location.Another reviewer wishing there was a no stars option. Rooms were filthy. Did not bathe my children as I figured it would actually make them dirtier. Skipped the shower for me too. Breakfast guy utterly failed food safety 101 as I watched him wear the same pair of gloves to take out garbage, touch every handle and door knob in the place, and then handle all the bagels. Rather peeved that I paid $70 for this dump, but every other hotel was filled. At least my son threw up on their sheets last night, ketchup and bbq sauce, we had our revenge.At first, I thought this would be a fine place to stay. Once we got there, we soon realized there were cockroaches. A lot of them. Everywhere. I told the front desk and they said they couldn't comp me anything because I bought the reservation through a third party (Priceline) and ""my rate was already discounted"". It turns out my rate was the same as they were advertising out front so that was a lie. They offered to move me to another room but the whole place had bugs so it didn't make sense to move. I won't stay here again. Only redeeming quality was the breakfast was good.How do I give a place 0 stars?? This place is horrible. The advertised ""kitchenette"" is false. There was mold in the fridge and moldy coffee in the dinky coffee pot. I really wish I had taken pictures of everything. No one will believe this! Wifi does not work. It is dirty. Has not been vacuumed or swept for years! No clean towels are given and hair (and boogers. Yes, boogers) from previous tenants is everywhere! I went to get two towels from the front and it took her 20 minutes to get me TWO STINKING TOWELS since there were none at all. The ""breakfast"" is an absolute joke! It ends at 9am and by 8am, nothing is left and the people at the front counter don't fill anything. In one instance, the clerk lied to another saying that he had refilled the line and it was a lie because we had been there and nothing was touched. Added to the fact that he was SLEEPING at the desk(there are witnesses), he was lying. If I can attach a picture, I will! In one of our rooms, the ceiling was literally cracked around the entire tile making it unsuitable for habitation. Our family rented three rooms that were scattered throughout the premises(after being promised they were side by side) and whenever we used the phones, there was so much static, it was basically an exercise in futility. The only good thing I have to say is that there were no roaches that I could see. That would have been the final straw for sure! I honestly do not know what the cleaning people get paid for here. The linen has cigarette burn holes and stains all over it. I'm so glad I always bring my own blanket and pillow to hotels. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. If absolutely necessary, sleeping in your car is probably better than this dump. It needs to be shut down or get new management. It's ridiculous.Checked in 3-3-14, lobby a/c broken. Cranky attendants. Asked for non smoking room, got smoking. Room smelled of mildew. Dirty tub. Empty coffee maker at breakfast. Will not be coming back.This place is a dump. The lobby was dirty. The exterior was dirty. The door to my room had a taped on number plate and looks like the police kicked it in at some point. The furniture is old and badly worn. To top everything off, the room was dirty and had a bad smell. I stayed because I was too tired to look elsewhere. There are lots of other hotels in this price range that are clean and respectfully maintained. AvoidWhat ever you do, do not stay here!! This place is not even worth $20 per night!! This is a franchise hotel so it is run by who knows who..obviously people that don't care about cleanliness, or customer service..the rooms was very dirty when we checked in.. from the walls, the the floor..they put us in a cleaner room that was non-functional..if your going to run a hotel using a big company's name..you should represent that company to their standards. .!! Got my money back for some of the days from the manager who had a ""I don't care attitude"" makes me think should I ever again stay at a Howard Johnson at all in the future. .!! My advice if your staying in the beautiful St. Augustine area, spend a little more for a different much nicer hotel/resort.",,,,,"['doest', 'star', 'room', 'bucks', 'king', 'bed', 'comfy', 'hot',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/country-inn-and-suites-saint-augustine,Country Inn & Suites,2.5,$$,13,"The hotel was clean, price was fair, and we enjoyed our stay. We only had one minor hiccup the first day due to a slamming door that our room was adjacent to. I guess the arm closer for the door broke and it would slam and shake the wall anytime someone went through it. We were able to move to a different room the next day and I saw someone working on the door to hopefully get it fixed. The staff was awesome, everyone seems to take pride in their work there. The breakfast was also very good.I'm not one to be too negative when reviewing, but this location does not meet the expectations a Club member has for a Country Inn and Suites, especially given the room's cost.On our vacation trip along the east coast of Florida this week, we stayed only at Country Inn and Suites. This night's stay was our most expensive, and yet it was our most disappointing.The interior itself seems incredibly dated and in need of serious updating. Carpet needs to be replaced, and the air is musty. The nicest part was honestly the parking lot which seemed new. The bed was comfortable, but the AC unit under the window was incredibly noisy when it ran. My son, who generally sleeps like a log, commented on difficulty sleeping because of the AC unit. Just overall it felt somewhat rundown.The pool and hot tub seemed fine, but they are outside right next to the main road out front. There were no towels there.One positive was the workers. They seemed willing to engage patrons and looked to help. Oh and the breakfast was good for the most part with the eggs and sausage being hot.The location is great in way of proximity to various sites in St. Augustine; however, I will not choose to stay at this location again.Well I agree with everyone above.  Definitely a place to crash and leave immediately.  Our room had a mildew smell and the bathroom was in need of alittle help.  The decor was about ok.  I wish I would have read the reviews on Yelp before I booked this room through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>. Yelpers are usually more honest about their reviews. St George inn or The Cozy Inn are probably better hotels.Lost a star immediately for having all fluorescent lighting in the rooms. If they want to save a buck and ""save the environment"" then use candles and lanterns. I absolutely hate fluorescent lighting; it's cold, abrasive, horrible on the eyes, and can give some people headaches.Next, the first two rooms they gave me had door and window issues. There were actually gaps between the door and frame and the windows' locks were not secure. Many of the window locks that actually did work were not locked to begin with.After we finally settled in, we found the A/C to be a bit loud, but it was tolerable.The redeeming factors were the staff and the free breakfast. The staff was very motivated to make sure we were happy and the breakfast had a good selection and was well-maintained. And my wife was impressed that they had Pantene bath products. These three things gave them a 3 star rating instead of 2.Just make sure you check the doors and windows before you leave your valuables in the room, especially if you are on the first floor.First floor, room 108. Strong musky smell upon walking into the room, almost as if the toilet flooded and the carpet wasn't properly cleaned. The AC makes a horrible scrapping noise and doesn't retain a true temperature, so I sweat most of the night. Overall, worst hotel experience I've had in a long time. I only give it two stars because of its location. One mile away from all the shops and restaurants.Awful stay here. The fire alarm went off at 2am. We were told it's because the control panel is in the main entrance door way and someone got confused and hit a button to be buzzed in. My response was than someone should move the panel ! The cited code was the reason it is there, but that's a bunch of bull.Location is ok.Service was ok.Inside of rooms was very dated and in need a a refurb. As you can see from my pics tub was nasty.Singed a waiver agreement that the price total was 167 a night then the morning of checkout they slipped a bill for 197 dollars under my door. The added state tax.... this is in Florida and city tax on an in packaged itemFor a hotel that says they've recently undergone an update... They need another one. The hotel was clean, comfortable, but the rooms were outdated. In my King room, there was a huge gap along the wall where something seemed to be missing. The art work was a jumble of images that didn't go together and was aesthetically displeasing. The AC.. while set to 66* didn't seem to get below 70* and left the room feeling damp. I will say though, that the breakfast was amazing. There were scrambled eggs, sausage and french toast.  There were pastry and doughnuts, cereal and juices, and there was no issue with getting what you wanted.I m here a lot on business and this is the best hotel for the price (on a weeknight, if you clip a coupon from a motel magazine or find a good price on orbitz, you can get nightly rate for around 100...in winter, even lower!) First-- staff is SO friendly.  Conner on evenings--- OMG --- she will go OUT OF HER WAY any way she can to make you feel welcome. Even the night shift tried to help me get some breakfast as I was leaving before breakfast started (5:30 am!). The business center and workout center get the job done and are clean. The bed is very COMFY with  a plump duvet  as the bedspread that I love.  Bathroom looks clean and updated to me.  Nice complementary parking and walking distance to good places to grab food.  I plan on returning to COuntry inn and Suites for vacation--not business-this summer in St Augustine and couldnt be more excited!DAY 1:Well....we usually stay at a Hampton because we find them to be pretty consistent. Checked in and place needs an update. Mildew smell in hall on first floor, parking access was not that great, room feels damp, wi-fi connection was difficult to access. Hope things improve......DAY 2:Well giving 2 stars because breakfast was good, although the space to dine is very small making seating difficult and access to the buffet difficult. Room was cleaned well but still feels damp. Wi-fi hit and miss the whole time. At times not able to access at all and other times it would just boot you off.Can't say I would recommend staying here since you can find better accommodations for the same price. Must agree with others about remodel and not that great a place to stay.This hotel is too over priced for the outdated look. The room seemed clean however the bathroom towel has some yellow stains and light gray old stains. Even one towel was damp. Called down to desk who had some unpleasant responses like ""I don't know about that I'm not in housekeeping and they don't come in until ..."" Had ask twice for fresh towels to brought up to room. One person took shower at night and other in morning and both times we had to run water 5 mins before it got hot and had to turn it all the way up on hot. Sink water never did get hot. Mildew in shower. Ok stay. Have seen better years ago with Country inn but lately they have failed me and my guests every time.Nasty, is the first word that comes to mind as I am writing this review.  The bed is lumpy and smells of mold, the bathroom is dirtier than a public restroom at a bus station.  Avoid this place at all cost Yelpers, it's a pit, let my experience save you from this nightmare.Not a bad hotel, but a bit overpriced.  Our base rate was $103, but the $20 fee for an extra person brought our total bill with taxes to about $140.  While we had a one bedroom suite with a pullout sofa, it sounds better than it actually was.  The hotel was on the older side and a bit run-down....again, not bad, but not great.  The room was clean, had free Wi-Fi and a nice, free breakfast.  My mom and sister loved the waffles and sausage.  In my opinion, this hotel would have earned an extra star if the base rate was in the $70-$80 range.  Let's face it....when you stay at a hotel, the bottom line is cleanliness and value.",,,,,"['hotel', 'clean', 'price', 'fair', 'enjoyed', 'minor', 'hiccup', 'first', 'day', 'due', 'slamming', 'door',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fiesta-ocean-inn-and-suites-saint-augustine-2,La Fiesta Ocean Inn & Suites with Beachfront Bed And Breakfast,4.0,$$,16,"A a child in the 1970's, I stayed at this hotel with my family every summer. I returned in September after 40 years to find that the atmosphere was still the same. The rooms have been beautifully renovated but the spirit of the place, and the beautiful beach is the same as I remember! The staff is caring and friendly and very knowledgeable about restaurants and things to do and see in the area. I highly recommend this hotel.Was good for the location and the price. The delivered breakfast was nice but not enough to make up for the lack of sleep. The bed was rock solid and though the a.c. was cranked all night it never cooled the room. And a working a.c. is the one thing that should be mandatory in any hotel in Florida. I loved being able to walk down to the beach, it was the best part. But the room was tiny, and even worse the bathroom was tinier. Was awkward stripping out of a swimsuit and trying to de-sand in such a small bathroom. Next time we're in St. Augustine we'll seek other accommodations.Stayed here on several occasions, and have had both friends and family stay here.  We have stayed in Suites and the Inn, and all have been superb.Great location, love the heated pool and the gardening around the property.  It's clear the owner values what he does and takes pride in it.  Highly recommended.Stayed here for 2 nights overall great stay, got king partial ocean view , short walk to the beach which is beautiful.  The staff were very nice and breakfast is free and delivered right to the door you can pick the time for delivery, they call when they are on the way.  5 min away to downtown. Only downside the room did have a moldy odor but after turning on the air it went away. Its not a 5 star hotel but its a decent place to stay we enjoyed our time.This hotel was booked by relatives from out of state so I did not know what to expect when my wife and I agreed to book there as well for the weekend. We were very pleasantly surprised. The property had a great location on a beautiful stretch of beach. The staff was friendly and attentive. The rooms weren't large but definitely served the purpose. While no beach chairs/umbrellas were provided by the hotel, it was convenient t rent them from the local vendor who delivered/set them up early in the morning.. The property was convenient to many local restaurants and the pristine state park. About the only minor negative that I can think of was the lights from the mini golf place next door coming through our back window late at night.  We will come back for sure.My boyfriend and I used Expedia to book this hotel for our anniversary weekend, and I have to say I was pretty disappointed by what we saw once we got there. There were several other locations nearby that were less expensive for what we got for this one, and I just feel as if we were a bit mislead by the description on the site. The hotel is definitely dated, and if you can catch it on a good deal night it's totally worth it for the service alone. However, this hotel is NOT truly a beach front hotel, but NONE of them are in St. Augustine. You aren't far from the beach, but it's good to know upfront that you will be walking to the beach, and you cannot see it from the hotel rooms. When I think of beach front, it means I can leave my patio door open at night and hear the waves crashing against the beach, not that I can sorta see a beach off in the distance. The other reason we booked this place is because they had a heated pool, and we knew it'd be too cold to swim at the beach. We were going to stay in town, with a hotel that had a heated pool for about $20 less per night, but wanted the romantic feel of the beach for our anniversary. Well, I stuck my foot in the pool water and it was FREEZING!!! I told them at the front desk two or three times and they told me the heater was working. NO IT WASN'T!!! Because on the last day of our trip they had a repair guy out there to fix it!We got to pick our breakfast from a menu, and that was ok, they brought it to our room. They really didn't offer much of a selection. I am not against tipping, I was in the service industry... But I am just as happy to walk my happy self up to the desk to get my own breakfast. I don't like tipping someone to bring me a bagel and a muffin... seriously. It's a ways from town but you can get a trolley ticket for $30 per person if you want to leave your car. All in all, I was not impressed and I will most likely never stay here again. The service was ok, and I think there is a better value to be had elsewhere.This place reminds me of the old days--and that's a compliment.  The entire staff is genuinely friendly and helpful.  Although it wasn't in perfect shape, the room was very quiet and comfortable.  It included a fridge, microwave, free Starbucks coffee, free wi-fi and a nice flatscreen.  In the morning, a small breakfast is delivered to your door--which was really convenient and a time saver.  The hotel has two washers and dryers and they sell laundry detergent in the lobby.  It's a very short walk to the beach and a ten minute drive to the old town.  I would certainly stay here again.Hubby booked this place on-line and had no idea what it was like. It's small. Our room was near the office so it was a bit noisy at times. We have usually always stayed in condos when we travel. Don't expect that here. On the good side you can tell the place has been renovated. It's clean. Nice bath linens. Nice pool and garden. But no beach view. I had foot surgery so the walk to the beach was a bit difficult but not completely unmanageable. The beach is drop-dead beautiful. Bring your own beach chair. You'll want to spend some time out there. Great beach for walking. Sadly I am unable to. But all in all you can't beat the beach here. So as far as amenities, the place is nice, but not quite up to my overall expensive tastesStayed here for two nights during an impromptu beach trip. The front desk was super helpful. The room was basic+...the bed was comfy, the AC worked great, the TV was nice and had good channels, took a great bath in the basic tub, there's a mini fridge and microwave. All great. Easy 3 minute walk across the dunes to the beach. Breakfast each morning is definitely a nice touch. I'd stay here again!Definitely a place to stay for a week or so, savoring the old fashioned Florida beach feeling and visiting St. Augustine at night.Friendly staff, delicious fresh-baked scones and muffins delivered to your room (part of the free breakfast), comfortable rooms, spectacular beach, easy parking and beautifully landscaped grounds, convenient to St. Augustine (the beach bus will pick you up right in front of the hotel).  What more can I say?Some things that may be a con for some: a very active mini-golf right next door (which also serves great soft-serve ice cream) and you do have to walk across a lawn and over the dunes on a boardwalk to get to the beach.  Most of the rooms do not have a view of the beach for this reason, but anyone who frequents St. Augustine knows this to be true of most hotels in the area.  The hotel has an associated bed and breakfast that is closer to the beach proper but I wasn't able to visit it.  The staff really impressed me with their friendliness and efficiency:  breakfast was delivered to the rooms promptly at the time of our choice and the scones and muffins were warm and tasty.    The rooms were comfortable and the ones we had (garden view) had nice private patios/balconies.  If you stay in the area, order from Verrazano's pizza delivery--they have the most incredible pizza!  Their salads are also fresh and a perfect accompaniment to their pizzas.My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an affordable, pleasant, and clean stay in St. Augustine.We got our first impression of the hotel before we even crossed into Florida.  Due to a snowstorm and illness, we needed to stop in Georgia for a night on the way down.  I called La Fiesta, expecting that I would have to beg them to hold our room for us since we would be arriving 24 hours later than expected.  As soon as I explained our situation to the woman on the phone, she said she would go ahead and check us in and we could arrive any time.  (Our stay was prepaid, but I have encountered hotels that will not hold your room for you past 2 AM on the first night of your reservation, even if you have paid in advance.)We stayed in one of the queen rooms in the pool area.  These are their cheapest rooms, and they are small, but they have recently been renovated and are clean and comfortable.  For a couple, the size is perfect.  And we really appreciated that the floors are all tile--no nasty, grungy hotel carpet!  The bathroom fixtures are not new, but again, they are clean and functional, and that's all I need.The staff was always very friendly and helpful; we stopped in the lobby almost every morning and got great recommendations on things to see and places to eat in the area.  They deliver complimentary breakfast to your room every morning, and while the menu is very limited, it's worth it for the delicious, freshly baked scones and muffins (not to mention the fact that you don't even have to get out of your pajamas for breakfast!).  Our room was very clean every evening when we got ""home"" from sightseeing.  And when we discovered that our mini-fridge didn't work, the staff promptly replaced it.  They never treated us like second-class guests because we booked our stay at a discounted rate through Priceline.  (Again, I wish I could say this for all hotels...)The grounds are beautifully landscaped, and if you can afford to spring for one of the garden- or ocean-view rooms, I'm sure they're lovely.  Our only view was of the parking lot, but we didn't care since weren't planning to spend much time in our room anyway.  The hotel is on the ocean side of the highway, and the beach is just a short walk over the dunes via a private boardwalk.  (Keep in mind that almost ALL ""beachfront"" hotels in St. Augustine are really on the other side of the dunes from the ocean.)I give La Fiesta five stars because of the combination of affordability, cleanliness, comfort, beachfront location, and helpfulness of the staff.  It's not a fancy hotel, but my husband and I have no reason to stay anywhere else in St. Augustine from now on.  We will definitely be back.My partner and I stayed at this hotel this past weekend.  I decided to book this hotel based on reviews I found on Yelp and Trip Advisor.  Overall, this was a great place.  I usually only stay at chain hotels such as Hilton or Marriotts, so was leary about staying at a ""local"" hotel.  The La Fiesta changed my impression.  The front desk clerk was extremely friendly.  I didn't get his name, but he was working last Thursday around 7pm.  From there, we went to room 211 which was a King.  This room looked recently remodeled.  The bathroom had nice tile and fixtures.  The room was clean and quiet.  Everything worked well.  We were able to walk over to the beach and enjoy some time there even though it was cold.  My only complaint was that they only have 19"" tv's in the room, instead of 32 or larger but they were still flat screens.I thought it would be pretty crappy since its one of those tiny family owned hotels. But no it's so clean, nice and a great location too. Even though only more expensive rooms have balconies and all you get is a small window , the room itself is nice even though it's pretty tiny. However there is no old furniture and everything looks new and squeeky clean. No wonder it's the winner for this year for,i believe it's, trip advicer. You also get breakfast brought to your room every morning. You can pick 2 things on the menu and pick the time you want it delivered, you'll get a call in the morning and next thing you know the food's at your door.The pool is huge and always heated, you don't need to ask anyone to open it and wait for it to heat up, it's always done. We went in winter and even when it's pretty chilly outside the pool still works even though there's noone in it.I loved the location, there's a little walkway through which you get to the beach and on the way to the beach there are benches where you can just sit and relax. Also the hotel is pretty close to different places like a couple of shops and restaurants. Overall i'm satisfied with it, and if you want a relaxing peacefull vacation, this us for you.I rented 8 rooms for one night for a church group. We got in the first day very late and everyone went straight to bed.  The next morning I asked for a late checkout and was told no.  Ok no biggie but then we were told that we needed to be off the property by the 11am checkout time.  I waited over an hour to talk to the owner and I was again told that we were to large of a group (19 people in 8 rooms) and would ""tax the hotels facilities"".  I asked why if check-in was not until 3pm how we would tax their facility considering most of us were going to be on the beach and she responded that I should of purchased another night for all 8 rooms.  We were not even using their parking facilities, did not use the complementary breakfast, and had not spent a moment using either their pool or beach at this point.Simply put, I've traveled with large groups for many years, several times a year and have never been told this.  We ended up moving down the street to a competitor.  When they found out how we were treated they let us use their facilities for free.The owners excuse for not letting us stay after checkout was bogus.  Either they did not want the ""catholics"" there or they were upset at having a number of Hispanics staying at their hotel.  There is no way having people on a beach would tax their facilities.  AVOID this place like the plague!We were treated like garbage at this hotel.  Despite the fact we had 8 rooms and had only used the facility to sleep one night, the next morning we were told we needed to leave the facility by 11am and would be denied access to the pool / beach after checkout.Often you can find a nice, family owned place that does good business...This establishment is not one of them. If you are looking for professionalism and friendly, warm management to complete your St. Augustine lodging experience, don't bother with La Fiesta. Its not competitively priced for what you get.I decided to stay at La Fiesta Inn for our last Thanks giving vacation, and I'm so glad I did! Though it's a bit of drive to downtown, but after spend almost whole day in city, I think it's nice to get away from hustle and bustle. This Inn has decent and clean room, great service (they deliver the breakfast to each room every morning, you choose your own time), nice landscape with mini putt-putt &amp; pool (too bad, i didn't use them), and good access to the beach. There's lots of nice restaurants around the area too, so you won't have difficulties to find food once you already in Inn. They have free shuttle to Old Town Trolley tours (I'm not sure about the schedule, but you can get the schedule flayers at the front office). Definitely a nice and affordable place to stay.",,,,,"['child', '1970', 'hotel', 'family', 'every', 'summer', 'returned', 'years', 'find', 'atmosphere', 'still', 'rooms', 'beautifully', 'renovated',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/anastasia-inn-saint-augustine,Anastasia Inn,3.5,$,9,"My husband and I checked on a Monday evening and left the following Saturday morning. The internet stated one price and offered a discount on multiple nights. We arrived at the motel and ended up paying about $18 extra (total was $320--still a great price!). The website did not state we needed to book online to get the discount but, apparently, that's how it worked. The manager seemed preoccupied when we arrived but he was still friendly. Over the following days he seemed to be friendlier so I know the hubby and I just caught him at a bad time. The housekeeper was very friendly, too, and very attentive.Our room, 208, was very clean. No dust or dirt anywhere. No towels with stains. The TV, AC and mini fridge worked great. The motel internet worked great every day except for Monday night after 10pm. The connection kept coming and going. The shower head needs to be replaced but it worked just fine. The blanket was a little itchy, but the sheets and mattress was comfy. They offer free soap and shampoo. The free breakfast was cereal, bagels, muffins, milk, orange juice, and coffee. Though some people complain about a cold breakfast (spoiled people!), my hubby and I enjoyed it very much. It lasted from 7:30 to 9:30am. We didn't have to go out for food, so money well saved. The pool is about half the size of a regular-sized pool, so it was pretty small. It was clean and quite though. All in all, we would stay here again if we ever returned to St. Augustine.We stayed here on the first floor, for a one night weekend get-a-way. The room had a king sized bed, a micro-fridge, and a microwave. The room was clean, had no odd or offensive odors, and the bed was very comfortable.The location, if you are a walker, is *perfect* for downtown excursions. You are about 1 mile from the marina (where I wholeheartedly recommend the Schooner Freedom sails; particularly sunset sails). What better way to see St. Augustine, than leaving your car at your hotel, and enjoying everything downtown has to offer, without adding parking to your expenses (or breaking the bank to actually stay downtown?)If you book a month ahead of your stay, there is also a discount for the room fee.The man who checked us in was very friendly, and pleasant to talk to. As another reviewer said, the pool is small. About 10' by 10' and a little over 5' deep. We don't use hotel pools, so it's size doesn't matter to us whatsoever.Competitively priced, clean and convenient. Would definitely stay here again, and would definitely recommend to family and friends.Road trip back home to Jersey from west palm beach, could not resist stopping through St. Augustine. OMG what an amazing town.  Needed a night to stay and found this little motel in 5 mins from town center, very affordable and very clean.A get what you pay for hotel. Clean and the price is right. Very small pool out front with 2 tables and four chairs. Only one table has an umbrella. There two floors and all the rooms face the road which is just across the parking lot. Free Wi-Fi and contential breakfast starting at 7:30am at the office. Ice maker is on the first floor by the office. TV is Sanyo old tube model about 24"". Room had small table, arm chair, dresser, small refrig, tiny microwave, and small closet.  I want a cheap budget place and that was close to the Bridge, Lighthouse, etc. and this fits the bill.  If you plan to hang out there, it's not the place for you, but if you a clean, cheap place, this is it.Like others have said ""You get what you pay for"" . This is NOT a high end place. It is relatively clean. The office and maid staff are very helpful. Faucet in the shower can use some work. Swimming Pool was clean if not very big. More jacuzzi size. It is a older hotel. Short walk to Mellow Pizza (YUM) and to a very clean laundromat. If you want to use WIFI you have to be close to your room or the office... does not work by the pool area.You get what you pay for and this was worth every penny!  We were on a budget and we got a clean bed, microwave, fridge and free wifi!  What more could you ask for!Best thing about this hotel is its location. About 2 blocks from the Bridge of Lions, where you can easily walk to downtown St. Augustine. It's less than a mile from St. George Street, and a nice pretty scenic walk over the bridge (and you don't have to fight traffic). Also, there are several restaurants located around the hotel, including Blackfly, GAS, O'Steens, British Pub, Raw Martini, etc. Plenty of things to do. The hotel (motel?) itself is clean, but nothing fancy. I would definitely go back, but I would bring my own pillows and my own towels. The pillows were flat and the towels not absorbent at all. We visited in February, so no swimming for us, although the tiny pool is heated. You must check in before 9pm, but we were running late and the office guy stayed until 10, which we appreciated. He was friendly and helpful, giving us a map of the area and letting us know that the sightseeing train shuttle would pick us up out front if we wanted to do that. The small continental breakfast is just muffins, bagels, coffee, juice, cereal. It does the job when you are hungover! Each room has a microwave and fridge, and there's a handy cabinet to store your food/liquor so that you don't lose your bathroom counter space. Each room also has a tub/shower, but the water pressure was pretty low. Someone else must have been taking a shower at the same time as me and finished, because mid-shower I was finally able to rinse my hair at an acceptable rate. The tub has a nonslip mat inside, but it looks pretty shady underneath that. Therefore, you couldn't pay me to actually take a bath in that tub, but as long as I can shower I'm good to go. Completely served our needs of being inexpensive ($75 a night), clean, and most importantly close enough to walk to the bars and stumble home. Would stay again!I second Jenny's comments. By far, the best thing about the place is the location. There is no view from the hotel, but walk a couple of blocks and you are on the river. Cross the bridge, and you are in downtown. Walk the other way a mile and you are at the lighthouse. A little further still, and you get to the Alligator Farm, then Anastasia Park, and then the Amphitheater. There are several restaurants nearby, but I recommend going to downtown instead. The room itself is about what you would expect from an economy motel. Clean enough, but certainly not spotless. The towels were pretty scratch, and the bed marginally comfortable. The shower pressure was also just enough. The wi-fi password was the hotel phone number, but no one told us that, so we had to call the ""emergency"" number to get it. They didn't even have it on the wall in the rooms.The owners let us checkout a little late (45 minutes) and we were able to keep our car in the lot after checkout so we could go eat some food downtown, so that was nice. I was able to book the room for under $60 on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a>.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-saint-augustine-beach-house-saint-augustine,The Saint Augustine Beach House,4.5,$$$,18,"First time staying here, will definitely be back again. Very friendly staff both in office and kitchen. Hotel is clean, comfortable, as close to the beach as you can get, easy walking access. Breakfast is included and is wonderful! Great home cooking, and baking from Janie. She is a sweetheart,  as is all the staff.We actually stayed at the sister hotel down the street and loved it!!!! Both hotels are dog friendly so that is why we stayed there... The Vilano gardens inn was a cute little remodeled old motel, rooms were very nice and clean... The breakfast in the morning is at the other hotel and is AMAZING!!!! The beach is also dog friendly and our dogs had a blast! Only a five minute car ride into old town Saint Augustine from here... It was really a perfect vacation... Can't wait to come back!Stayed at the Vilano Beach Garden Inn just down the street that is run by the same company.  Very nice and professional staff, nice and clean rooms, pet friendly hotel.  Simple accomodations but everything you need, nice linens on bed, tv, small frig, microwave, coffee maker, tile floors-no rugs to trap smells.   A fenced dog area with poo bags. The only minus was the air conditioner unit.  It was very loud and the air never got cold.  Maybe it was just the one in our room.  Made for a restless sleep.  Publix a block away, pier a block down the street and the beach a couple blcoks down the street the other way.  Five minutes over the bridge to St Augustine.My family and I really enjoyed staying here! Perfect location, great staff, great breakfast, comfortable and spacious rooms. We are looking forward to coming back and making this our ""TO GO"" place in St.. Augustine. We booked 3 rooms for a special birthday weekend. It couldn't have been a better choice for us. I can't wait to book a room for a girls weekend! 3 or 4 of us could totally sleep well here.I will be back!Great location helpful pleasant staff very pet friendly and the absolute best breakfast in town. Don't miss the home made yogurt.  Apartment like rooms very clean with fab ocean views. Love this placeMust update- only because I had not tried the breakfast yet. This is a must! This wonderful lady that makes breakfast should be running a restaurant! Her bread pudding is to die for and I don't like bread pudding. Scones, quiche!! And I hear we missed the banana bread? I'm ready to move here!My wife,dog and I really enjoyed our stay. The hotel seems family owned and everyone is very friendly and accommodating. Our room was very clean and well appointed and a home cooked complementary breakfast which was awesome. The hotel is right on the beach and very close to Saint Augustine attractions right over the bridge. We will definitely return for another stay.We did a short ""in-state vacation"" and were in Saint Augustine from Monday 06/29/2015 through Thursday morning 07/02/2015. We booked our room over the phone and Phillip was very accommodating and professional. We ended up over at the Gardens (just a short walk from the main hotel), but boy was that a blessing. The room was very large and gave us plenty of space for the dog and kid. In our room there were no closets or wardrobes, so be prepared for that. The bathrooms were small and even ""tight"". Furnishings were comfortable, although I would have liked an easy chair or recliner in order to watch TV (the room was lager enough to handle it comfortably). If you stay at the Garden, you have to get your ice, breakfast, and any ""special"" request needs from the main hotel.  One of the greatest highlights was the breakfasts cooked by Janie. My wife stated she would move in permanently just for that. Janie's cooking was very impressive, and her demeanor was fantastic; customer service at its finest. This is not your ordinary ""free"" hotel breakfast. The location of the Beach House and the Gardens is perfect. You are a five minute drive to down town and 15 minutes to Saint Augustine Beach. The Publix supermarket, restaurants, fishing pier and of course, the beach are in walking distance (5 minutes or less) from either locations. We were able to receive decent rates for our stay. There are cheaper hotels in the area that accommodate  pets, but this was by far the best bang for our buck.Absolutely beautiful location.My husband, mother and I drove over for the weekend with our two dachshunds. I was in the market for a beautiful view of the beach (for my mom, who was visiting from MO) and a pet friendly hotel that wouldn't give everybody fleas. I can ABSOLUTELY recommend the St. Augustine Beach House for all of the above. The rooms were spacious, clean, beautifully remodeled and had a stunning view of the beach. After checking me in, the receptionist walked me to the door and gave a short tour of the room. The staff was super friendly and eager to recommend pet friendly restaurants in the Vilano Beach area or the Historic District. Apparently we now get an additional discount on all of our return visits. I would absolutely stay here again.RIGHT on the beach! They love my doggies. Rooms are gorgeous. Love, love, love this place.Good location but very disappointing otherwise.  3rd rate hotel.  Water smells funny.  Cheap decor.  Cheap towels.  No real soap/shampoo, etc.  Plus housekeeping and breakfast service are terrible.I almost don't want to give the secret away! This hotel was perfect for us. We were able to bring out dog for a great pet fee. We were right on the beach too! I loved the balcony. We had a kitchenette and pull out couch too. Our air conditioner was acting strange and kept kicking on and off all night but I think there was a power outage to blame. We were super bummed that every time we needed ice- there was none. Our fridge wasn't cold when we got there so we had to buy our own ice at the Publix. Which is within walking distance. We were close enough to the sites to enjoy them but still had a beach view. I loved this. The breakfast wasn't too good- eggos, bagels, toast, eggs, oatmeal, cereal, pretty much it. Still glad they offered it though. I am 100% sure we will be back.Perfect location on the beach and welcoming my paw friends make this top on my list. Not to mention the friendliest, people pleasers staff ever.  They hustle here to take care of you, unlike your normal chain hotel.No breakfast but they have coffee and a kitchenette. Just steps away is great breakfast and lunch cafe.Decor is not up to date but you don't care because it is clean, private balconies you do not have to see your neighbor, rooms are big, guess they use to be condos. New owners are slowly fixing the place up and you can tell it is loved and well maintained. I am so thrilled to find this place and will def return with my furry babies.This is definitely one of the best places to stay in saint augustine. From the moment we checked in the staff was more than friendly and helpful. I really have nothing negative to say. The decor is modern, there's a kitchenette, the view is magnificent, I have direct access to the beach, and our dog was welcomed with open arms. Oh and might I add location, location, location! Easy access to everything and there's a publix just a 2 minute walk from the hotel. Needless to say we will never stay anywhere else whole visiting saint augustine.My husband, son and I stayed here for a night and wish we could have stayed there more nights but had a rental property waiting for us on the west coast of Florida. The people than run this beachfront property are friendly and accommodating. The rooms are clean, spacious and all have balconies looking out to Vilano Beach. It is an easy drive to downtown Saint Augustine and has other amenities in walking distance, including a Publix grocery store, salon and shops. I unfortunately picked up a few things from Publix, not realizing that the hotel had complimentary breakfast. The hotel's food smelled so good and the staff even asked if we would like the breakfast to go as we continued our drive. We'd love to stay here again in the future and hope we can take our dog with us next time. He'd also love it there and to play on the beach. Free wifi and parking are extra nice touches. Looking forward to returning!My wife and I stayed there for a week on a business trip. Hospitality of staff is like family. Rooms are spacious, clean, comfortable and very usable. Breakfast was fresh cooked each day (we only ate the last day but had fresh quiche, freshly baked pumpkin bread, fresh/hot raspberry muffins and tasty hot sausage). Great for hitting the road on a long drive home. WiFi worked great. We had a kitchenette. Our needs were simple so we were satisfied. Don't know if dishes are provided. Quiet, right on the beach (no buildings between the hotel and the water but there is a wide swath of grasses/natural area between the hotel and the water/sand). It is a beach that you can drive on and we saw vehicles there at all hours but they were completely quiet and non-intrusive. Pricey since there was a kitchen. But we were willing to pay since it was on the water. We are easy to please because we want to be. This hotel is awesome and we will stay there every year we go back for seminars.One of my favorite places to stay for vacation. People here are very friendly and hospitable. It's always a very relaxing vacation when we stay here.Exactly what we were looking for in a short weekend trip to beautiful St. Augustine.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The location is superb, if you aren't looking to stay in old town St Augustine, yet is only a 5 minute drive across the bridge.  The hotel is directly on a beautiful beach with plenty of access and all of the rooms facing the ocean with a small private balcony.  Rooms are large and simple.  There was a small continental breakfast as well.  The hotel is very pet friendly - no restrictions - and you can walk your leashed dog on the beach.  The hotel and rooms are not especially fancy if that is what you are looking for, but perfect if you want a quiet location on the beach with very very friendly and helpful staff.  I had not one complaint which is why this hotel gets a five star rating from me.",,,,,"['first', 'time', 'staying', 'definitely', 'back', 'friendly', 'staff', 'office', 'kitchen', 'hotel', 'clean',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/penny-farthing-inn-saint-augustine,Penny Farthing Inn,4.5,$$,20,"Absolutely amazing. My Fiance  and I have a new tradition.  . The family is by far the sweetest and most lovely and accommodating I've ever experienced... can't wait to be back next year. Thanks again for the love and hugs xoxoMy husband and I just returned from a three day stay in St. Augustine.  When I was looking on the internet for a place to stay I chose Penny Farthing for the Victorian decor and the reasonable price.  I could not be happier!!!  The B&amp;B was quaint, quiet,  and in a great location.  We were greeted like old friends!!  The room was all that was described on the web site and then some.  So very comfortable and so very clean!  Each breakfast was amazing and was served so very promptly.  I loved the fact that we had access to the dining area during the evening for tea.  We even had complimentary brandy in our room!  I cannot say enough about how wonderful and pleasant the owners and the staff were.  I have stayed in many, many hotels, motels, and B&amp;B's in my day and never was I hugged upon leaving.  That is just how genuine and nice these people are.Fantastic stay!  We loved hanging out on the deck with a glass of wine and hot, fresh scones and cookies and - oh, the amazing, delicious breakfasts!   The best Innkeepers any where in the world!  So warm and gracious. Perfect location to walk anywhere.  Thank you for an unforgettable birthday!Was greeted by Marie when we arrived. She was so gracious and welcoming.  We were immediately offered refreshments and wine! The home is Victorian style. If you're an Anglophile you will love it!We stayed in The Buckingham Room. Very cozy and private.Breakfast in the morning was Eggs Benedict, my favorite! They were fresh and delicious! And served promptly when we sat down. I would highly recommend Penny Farthing for a stay in St Augustine!My fiancee and I decided to spend my birthday in St. Augustine. We found The Penny Farthing Bed and Breakfast Inn to be very quaint and cozy. Our hosts, were very nice and accommodating.  Marie went out of her way to make breakfast for us as we have specific food allergies. It is within walking distance to the historical downtown area and there is plenty of parking. Our room was great and very comfortable. We had a fantastic time and we will definitely stay at the Penny Farthing on our next visit!We stayed in the York room which I found elegant.  It wasn't in the main part of the house but off the patio.  We found it quiet enough although the walls seemed thin in the bathroom.  Overall, it seemed private enough even with the French doors.The host had British hospitality.  I enjoyed the Benedict breakfast and the wine that was setup in the afternoon to sip on at leisure.  I thought the local handmade soap was a nice accent.The location was great.  It was within a nice walking distance of the hubbub of old town but enough off the beaten path for relaxation.We really enjoyed our stay here. We went for a Friday / Saturday night stay during the Night of Lights. The house was beautifully decorated for Christmas. There is hot water for tea 24/7, and a really nice snack display in the afternoon with cake, fresh vegetables, and cheese and crackers. Wine is also available from the afternoon into the evening. Every room has two small glasses and some sherry in a beautiful glass decanter. All of the owners and staff were friendly and suggested local places for drinks and food. They also let me bring a breakfast tray upstairs to my husband one morning because he wasn't feeling good. Breakfast was excellent both days. The first day was bread pudding with a piece of sausage and a yogurt parfait. The second day was sausage quiche with potatoes and fresh fruit.We stayed in the Victoria room. It has it's own private balcony with two rocking chairs and a hammock. We liked sitting out here and listening to the church bells. You can also see the towers of the Lightner museum from this room, but the immediate street view is of an office building. The room was mostly clean, but unfortunately there was some dust in the corners and on the baseboards and the walls had small holes every so often where a picture or something else once was there. The wallpaper really needed to be updated. Also, there were a lot of knickknacks on the tables in the room which made it difficult for me to lay out my things. These things are small, and while they would by no means prevent me from returning to the Penny Farthing Inn they did detract from the overall appeal of the room.Was a nice weekend at the inn.  Nice food and nice afternoon wine and snack hour.  The hosts were great and the place is very quiet at night.Me and my girlfriend went to the Penny Farthing Inn for my birthday weekend.  The house is very nice and comfortable, and the staff is very friendly and welcoming!  The room we stayed in was very comfortable, including a fireplace for cooler nights.  The breakfasts were consistently delicious, and the atmosphere was always very friendly.  We are definitely thinking of coming back in the future!This place is WONDERFUL!  It reminded us of the B &amp; B we stayed at in England.  We arrived a little before check in time and when we called, we received a call right back that Marie was on her way to let us in.  Since there is ample outdoor furniture, we were able to use our computers and wait right on the front patio. Marie gave us a tour of the place, offered us a movie from a large selection of DVD and games and then we met more of her hospitable family every time we were in the common areas.  The room itself was LOVELY!  We stayed in the tree house and I highly recommend it if you want something romantic.  We sat out on our private balcony in the evening and enjoyed the thunderstorm. There was wine and snacks and cookies available all afternoon as well as hot tea to stay or to go.  In the morning, they accommodated food allergies and made a delicious breakfast.  I can't say enough great things about this place and the hospitality.  They literally have everything you would need an go above and beyond.  We will be staying here anytime we are passing though.  We loved it!What a perfect gem situated out of the midst of chaos, to enjoy quiet relaxing evenings on one of the many porches, yet close enough to walking distance to everything wonderful St. Augustine has to offer. The rooms were charming and decorated with period Victorian antique furniture, taking one back to an era long gone. The wine and desserts offered in the afternoons, and the amazing breakfast served in the morning are just a couple of examples of the many special touches that made our stay so enjoyable. This being said, the staff Dave and Betty, (Marie, who we unfortunately didn't get the pleasure of meeting) truly made our stay from the level of just another place to sleep, to a personal welcoming environment, where from the first moment we arrived, we felt more like returning long time friends, and not just another guest passing through. I highly recommend.Charming, comfortable ,clean and very welcoming. Penny Farthing Inn was a pleasure to stay in. We stayed in Penny's Attic and The Buckingham and both were decorated nicely and well kept, but what will truly make me return is the family that runs this B&amp;B. Matthew is friendly,polite and genuine in making sure you feel welcome. Marie was sweet, accommodating and warm. We felt as though we were visiting family. The house is large with a lovely front porch and a spacious patio deck as the common outdoor eating area in the back. There are jasmine vines that decorate the lattices and each table is covered with linen and fresh flowers in very pretty tea cups. The ambiance is relaxing and casual. I could've stayed in the B&amp;B alone without sightseeing the town and have been perfectly content.The place is so charming and romantic. Each room is supplied with some nice English sherry, and if that is now enough, you can go downstairs for a cup of tea, a glass of whine,or port. The owner is incredibly sweet. I felt like I was visiting England, really. The location is very good, right in the old town area. Breakfast is incredibly delightful..The bathroom had a jacuzzi and was very spacious, huge pillow-drowned bed...and some nice DVDs to watch.Check out my pics. of the rooms...We stayed at ""The Dawn"".We just got back from a relaxing long weekend at the Penny Farthing, Marie and family made us feel at home and we really enjoyed our stay. Our room, The York, was the smallest, but perfect for just the two of us. The bathroom was really quite large complete with a jacuzzi tub. Right outside of the York is the common deck, but we were frequently the only ones out there sipping on wine or reading a book. After trekking all over town in the mornings it was nice to come back in the afternoons, sit out on the deck and enjoy some of the wine and snacks set out.The location was perfect, close enough to the main attractions that we never used our car.Breakfast, was delightful. Eggs Benedict, french toast, and quiche on the three days we were there. It was hard coming home to just yogurt. We would be so full that for lunch we ended up just grabbing a sandwich to split at a deli so we could still have room for dinner.I can't say enough great things about my first B&amp;B experience.This is a great little bed n' breakfast in St. Augustine. It's just a block or two west of the tourist hubs, which means you don't feel overwhelmed by the writhing masses of poorly-dressed humanity, nor do you feel like you'll have to walk forever in the searing Florida heat to reach them. The owners are very nice and accommodating people with delightful attitudes and accents. We had two very tasty breakfasts there, even though they tried to sneak ham into my croissant (I'm a vegetarian) on the first day. Luckily, my fiancee spotted it just in time, selflessly devouring it before I could. She's so thoughtful.We stayed in the 'Dawn' room, which comes with its own little balcony area with a cute little swinging bench and chairs. It's beautiful, really. What makes it even better is that swing is where I proposed to the love of my life (she said 'yes,' of course, which is why this review is positive and upbeat, rather than deranged howling). The room itself has a nice whirlpool bathtub which we filled with an ungodly amount of bubbles, as required by the Cliched Tourist Mistakes guidebook we follow religiously. There's also a lot of cute knick-knacks and paintings and such. It really feels like a home, rather than an impersonal cookie-cutter suite.Food's tasty, people are nice, rooms are pretty, location is perfect. What more do you want? Go take a romantic vacation already.I agree with everyone who wrote previously. Dave and Marie are amazing and so is everyone else who worked here.   The breakfast was amazing, the Attic was wonderful, and we extended our stay an extra night. Dave and Marie have so many touches that added to our stay. The journal in the attic is so romantic and amazing (leave it for others to enjoy). Ask about the military men in the attic. They have quite the history. The jacuzzi really helped us both unwind. They offer advice on places to go and things to see. We hadn't stayed at a b&amp;b before and thoroughly enjoyed it. We felt like family. We will definitely return to st Augustine and the penny farthing.Very nice place, girly/romantic, close to shops and historical sites.  Breakfast was very nice and they leave out wine, sherry, and tea at all times, coffee and orange juice in the morning.  Nice DVD collection as well.I second the first review. Our family took up two rooms for two nights. We loved the location which was just near enough but not on top of the noisiest areas. The owners are extremely attentive and concerned with your comfort. The shabby chic vintage charm is excellent and it's a lovely respite after a long walking day. If you don't mind steps, Penny's attic room is tops. It's literally a little private apartment with a huge modern walk-in shower as well as a jetted tub and a private crows nest type porch with a covered spot. They offer a lovely breakfast but if it's not for you they will cook up something more ordinary. Coffee, tea, wine and sherry are always around for your enjoyment. You bet this will be our St. Augustine B&amp;B.Our family weekend was filled with many activities including a most important graduation from Flager College.  We chose a bed and breakfast, and most particularily Penny Farthing Inn with a roof top deck for entertaining, because we wanted all the comforts of home.  Oh my goodness, what a disappointment!  We prearranged to have the key in the room because of our late arrival (yes, we missed the afternoon cocktail party), but we arrived around six with no greeting from our hostess who was fully informed that we would have been traveling all day.  No one was there to greet us and provide information about our stay...there wasn't even a fruit basket or a plate of cookies in our suite.  The lack of hospitality continued when we were informed by phone that breakfast was served no earlier than 9 AM and there would be no accommodations for anything at our 8 AM departure for the graduation event.  When we arrived back at the Inn with our guests for our roof top luncheon, we discovered to our dismay that the room had not been attended...the bed was unmade, used towels were in the bath (but there was an tip envelope from the maid).  Also, seating was sparse because the cushions had not been placed on much of the outdoor furniture.  When we inquired about this later, the owner just laughed and said that the maid must have simply missed us.I must mention that our shower was ill-equipped as well...we found no bath products save a couple of bars of soap and samples of shampoo and conditioner encased in cardboard.Although others were in the dining room on the morning of our 8:30 AM departure, we were only able to get a cup of coffee in to-go cups with somewhat of a ""rush"" out the door (Could she have been expecting a request for monetary compensation???)I wrote to the Penny Farthing Inn when I returned home to discuss my disappointment, but am still waiting for a reply.  Such hospitality!!!I cannot fathom why anyone would want to pay a premium price for such a lack of accommodations.This is a wonderful little Bed &amp; Breakfast next to the Lightner Museum.  You can park your car behind the house and walk for the remainder of your stay.  The owners are friendly and cook a mean breakfast - we had amazing croissants and fresh fruit when we stayed there.  There is also a tray set up in the common area with several bottles of wine for your enjoyment.  I stayed in ""The Dawn"" with its own private entrance from the porch.  The room was cozy and we loved the added privacy of the separate entrance.  The Penny Farthing Inn is one block from King Street in the heart of the historic district.  I loved being able to wander through the streets as we were so close to everything.  They also offer romantic packages for an extra charge.  My husband surprised me with wine, roses, chocolate-covered strawberries and a carriage ride through town (all included in their romance package).  The Penny Farthing is also reasonably priced and they offer great specials.  When we went we paid for Friday and Saturday and got Thursday for 1/2 price.  It was a great vacation and the next time we go back, we'll definitely stay there.",,,,,"['absolutely', 'amazing', 'new', 'tradition', 'family', 'far', 'sweetest', 'lovely', 'accommodating', 'ever',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/castillo-real-an-ascend-hotel-collection-member-saint-augustine,"Castillo Real, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4.0,$$,23,"I loved my stay here. Perfect location. Steps away from the beach as well as restaurants and shopping. The bed was very comfortable and the facility was very clean. I also loved having the option of going in the outside pool and hot tub.Great location and the price was reasonable.  Service was great!I love this hotel.  It has character and is decorated in a manner consistent with St. Augustine's flair.  Got a call from the front desk while we were en route, letting us know our rooms were ready.  For a small fee you can upgrade to a room with a Jacuzzi which is well worth it.  Nice touches at the reception area: water with lemon and coffee.  Pleased.An excellent hotel, beach just a short walk away.  Loved everything about it. Stayed during January, rates more than reasonable.  Nicely decorated, lots of marble and tile.  extra clean and neat.  Comfortable beds.  Large walk in shower, a sit down vanity with make up mirror.  Great pool!  A little touch that strangely, I really liked:  ceramic coffee mugs and real glasses in the room.  There is an excellent restaurant on premises, that i would rate $$$,  You can get a great breakfast for $7.50 to $9; drinks a couple bucks more, mimosas  $5.My wife booked this hotel for us and she made a great choice.  Our room had an in room jacuzzi. Nice way to relax after a long day at the beach. On premises restaurant was great too. Would definitely  recommend to friends.Ocean views from our room. less than 1 block from the beach which is sooo wide and nice. La Cochina restaurant is excellent. other bar/restaurants within walking distance. Best part for us is the hotel is a stop for the Saint Augustine Beach Bus that runs hourly and drops passengers off at different points including the lighthouse, alligator farm, and downtown Saint Augustine 20 min away. We really didn't need a rental car for this trip. I would definitely come back.Traveling to St. Augustine was really awesome for us being from Orlando because it is a short drive for a mini weekend get away. This hotel is small and very hospitable. The room was very clean and the view was nice. Close to the beach, the only down side for me was they charge $25/per person to ride a shuttle to downtown. Driving downtown is NOT AN OPTION. NO parking and very crowded. A shuttle is the way to go but not for $50 for a couple.Horrible experience.  Front desk staff not friendly and rude manager.  Dirty carpet. They charged me $40 for an early check in, I was suposed stay for 2 nights but I had to leave on day 2. It was around 1:00 pm and I asked to give me a credit or partial credit for another visit. They totally denied and charged me full price for the second night.  I paid with my credit card at the restaurant but I have a charge or $45 from the restaurant and $1 on phone (i didn't use the phone other than calling the front desk) So I ended paying $469 for one night stay. The manager has no sense of business as u explained to her that my was a business visit and I'm planning on staying one or two nights every other month. First and last time here! The highly of the hotel is the night front desk lady Lauren. Also the hotel restaurant is amazing!Purchased this hotel on an express deal, which doesn't give you the name til after payment. The hotel is a 3 star, so it is a bit nicer than many of your standard choice hotels- has stone flooring and a cozy bed. LOVED the plush floor mat in the bathroom. The location served me well and is close to the beach.The bad: VERY noisy, perhaps the most noise of any hotel I've been in. C'mon you really shouldn't be able to hear the full conversations coming from the next room. Also, minor oversights in the bathroom with some hair on the floor and in the shower.This hotel is a nice alternative to the rental condos up and down the beach. I've never been one to want to stay in someone else's place on vacation (I always turn down relatives' offers to crash at their place) as I just really enjoy the whole hotel experience when traveling. I searched high and low for a nice and affordable real hotel on the beach and found Castillo Real. The hotel itself is pretty nice. It's a beach hotel and not super classy, but the rooms were big, the bathrooms were huge with a ton of counter space (which comes in handy when the two of you are trying to get ready-they even have a nice vanity mirror for the ladies), the shower was roomy, and the staff were all very nice. My only gripe is that the inner window curtains are sheer and the outer ones don't come together. Sooooo you get light in your room the entire night from the parking lot, moon. Whatever.  We used my hair clips to hold the drapes together so we could get some sleep. I'd go back of I were in St. Aug again. I just have to remember to bring my hair clips.Definitely enjoyed my stay here! The place was steps from the beach. The front desk lady.. Which I've forgotten her name... She was so nice, so pleasant, and so helpful! The rooms were clean, the shower was huge, and the decor was different from their usual hotels. We loved it and would def stay again!If you book through priceline beware, priceline literally ripped me off for $ 460.00. Please don't trust the priceline and buy a room directly. Priceline has booked me for two rooms but only one was available. So five of us (2 couples and a kid) are stuck in one room with one bed and no refund for two nights. Please just reserve withouy priceline if you can. We contacted and they refuse to refund a cent, avoid PRICELINE at all costs.The Castillo Real has improved quite a bit since we last stayed there two years ago.  The WIFI worked perfectly and so did the fridg.  The receptionist was very friendly and provided us with pertinent info about the hotel.Although the hotel has a breakfast, you must make your selection from a list and purchase a voucher the evening before.  I don't know if I feel like french toast or pancakes until I get up in the morning.  No thanks on that.The beach is just a few minutes walk behind the hotel.  We enjoyed our visit, and we will plan on staying here the next time we are in the area.If you are looking for a romantic getaway, this is a place to go. The jacuzzi suites are fantastic, big, clean and affordable. The walk to the beach is literally half a block off the white-sanded and pristine St Augustine coast line. The staff was super kind, friendly and helpful making sure my 5 year anniversary was as an unforgettable experience. I think they just found themselves a new loyal costumer ;-)The only downside I see to this awesome place is the service of the restaurant downstairs. They are on the rude side with overpriced/limited food choices. With good reason Castillo Real staff makes sure to let you know that they are not by any means associated.This place really was excellent. Super clean, beautiful views, very quaint, would stay again next time we visit!Castllio Real is my wife and myself's go to weekend get away place and has been for the last 10 years or so. We really enjoy relaxing on the beach and by the pool and hot tub. The restaurant is really first class, with excellent selections and fantastic deserts. We come down here 3 to 4 times a year and totally enjoy our visits. So I highly recommend Castllio Real as a Prime place to stay when you're in the St Augustine area.I LOVED this hotel! Our room was huge! Plenty of room for our family of four (2 queen beds). We had plenty of floor space, plus a desk and a table and 2 chairs. There was a nice tiled area when you walk in where you could leave all your sandy shoes and bathing suit stuff. The bathroom had a huge walk-in shower, and a separate vanity area that was large with lots of counter space. The staff was super nice and helpful. This hotel isn't ocean-front, but is a short walk to the beach. I really can't think of anything bad to say about this place! We will stay here the next time we are in St. Augustine!We had a great stay at this hotel.   The room was very clean and nicely updated.   I haven't slept that good in a long time thanks to the comfortable mattress and bedding.   Pool was small but nice.   Location was excellent.   We did eat at the hotel and although not included in stay was amazing.  Staff was very personable and accommodating.   Would absolutely stay here again.I stayed here 3 1/2 years ago, but it was such a great hotel that I thought it should be mentioned here. Great customer service, clean rooms, nice amenities  -- A bit pricey, but well worth the price. This is a great place for a honeymoon or romantic getaway. If you have a big family vacation, however, you might want to stay at a cheaper hotel. And the only thing that I did not like was that the hotel was somewhat a drive from downtown St. Augustine.Clean rooms, friendly service, and nice amenities (fridge, cable, small gym &amp; spa). Very close to everything I needed to get to while on a trip visiting family in the area.Didn't get a chance to try the restaurant, but heard great things.","Great and beautiful place to stay, great staff and big and comfortable rooms. Great for romantic get aways.On the same block as the beach (not beachfront, but you don't have to cross any streets to get there) and walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  Great place to bring the family.  The rooms and common areas are all marble floors, columns, etc.  Very elegant look to it.  My family and I had a great time.  Comfortably fit the 5 of us (although one is still in a crib).  BTW, for Active Duty Military, they offer the government official travel rate even if you're there for liesure.  (Only cost us $95/night when we were there.)  We will definitely be going back!  The WiFi must've been fixed since last year's reviewer complained, because it was strong and certainly available in our room.Very nice and clean room. Everything you would need for a comfortable enjoyable stay. I did not find one thing wrong. Free WiFi worked great. Loved the complementary toiletries. They were higher quality than I have seen in a hotel room. Very close to beach. Convenient and plentiful parking. Complimentary coffee in the lobby. Very nice workout room with stem room and sauna. We would definitely return when we visit this area again.",,,,"['loved', 'perfect', 'location', 'steps', 'away', 'beach', 'well', 'restaurants', 'shopping', 'bed', 'comfortable', 'facility', 'clean',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/quality-inn-and-suites-saint-augustine-beach,Quality Inn & Suites,1.5,$$,15,"I'm amazed at how friendly Mark at the front desk was to me and my four year old son. He showed us the room and showed me the room to see if my wheelchair would fit in the bathroom and was accepting to my service dog I showed him his papers and it was painless. The hotel across the street was very rude to me and made me feel bad about being handicapped . I would suggest this hotel to any of my family and friend  it was  spacious  and clean . Staff was friendly too ! if I had to stay across the street and see how much fun they where having at the quality inn I would have been very upset at my self for spending more money to be treated poorly ! Thanks quality inn for making us feel good in Saint  Augistine we love it here. Satisfied customerNot horrible, good and cheap, one of the online sites had it listed as a 3 star which its it allNever again this ""Hotel"" Motel ?? Front desk rude. Almost kick me out because i told them that the rooms are dirty and stinky like bleach and old shoes . A/C with dirty filter . And price ? 190$ a nite ?? YES A NITE :)) .. bathroom dirty never put my foot in . I bet if u will come with black light here your eyes will cry :)I've stayed in a lot of dives but this one takes the cake. Dirty everything. A bad attempt at an updated look using thrift store decor. Went to get breakfast at 8:30 am, got my eggs and sausage but by the time I made it around to the bread the staff was packing it up. There were still people eating but I guess the management didn't want people to have time for seconds. The only good thing was the location, walking distance to the beach.We chose this place bc of the low rate so we didn't expect much. We got even less. The pictures on the web site were misleading. The hotel is a half mile from the beach, not on the beach as the website reports. The room was clean enough but the carpet was decades overdue for replacement. And, the front desk staff was rude. Two staffers on two different occasions seemed bothered bc we were there and were curt with answers.DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOTTT STAY HERE!!!!!!! THIEVES - THIEVES - THIEVES!!!!! I'll get to that later. The only reason I gave 1 star is because I can't proceed with this review without awarding something. I'm not really overly-picky about my hotel choice usually. Give me a clean room, A/C that works, a decent price, and customer service that acts appreciative that you're there. Wow - not even close.....at least the A/C worked (ok, there's the 1 star). The kicker: upon returning from the day and after getting ready to go out that night, I went to put on my nice watch, which I had packed away in my bag. But it was gone - stolen - along with my Bluetooth headset that I had ""hidden"" together. The friggin maid(s) had gotten IN MY BAG and stole them!! Are you kidding me? Just to be sure, I tore the room apart looking everywhere in case I was mistaken. Bags, closet, bathroom, under beds, under sofa, in the bed sheets, trash cans, in my vehicle....STOLEN.Management was absolutely no help and cared little as he told me all his people had been with him for 10+ years (the 2 girls he asked about seeing a watch were 22/25 years old - what? They'd been with him since they were 12?? Lies). Police told me later that that particular hotel contracts out the maid service. So since they're not hired by Quality Inn, those particular maids may only show up once or twice a week or less. Hmm, they've ""been with you 10 years""??When I informed him that I was going to file a police report he was panicked and indignant. ""I have no one here who steals - we turn everything in that's found - we ship it to you UPS - there's no need for police...blah, blah, blah.... All lies because the Officer who came and took my report said straight-up, ""This is the #1 hotel we have the most complaints from and have to come to"". Wish I'd known that little tidbit before booking. I will sleep on a park bench before I stay at this dump again. In case you missed me saying it earlier, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We wanted a cheap place on the beach, and this Quality Inn is a national brand located across the street from the beach. But it is pretty much a horrible place.The only positives are there's ample parking, the pool has a hot tub, and the tv's are updated. Negatives:The feel of a tawdry motel circa 1960.Very dirty.Smells like cheap air freshener.Itchy beds.Gross bathrooms with weird low ceilings.No water pressure.Old towels.Grungy carpet.Musty odor.Poor lighting.There are lots of hotels in saint aug. This one is terrible.DO NOT STAY HERE - SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE!! Ok, so it might be a little cheaper than some of the other places astound the area and you may not ""require"" much to make you happy when it comes to your choice in hotels. However, my boyfriend and I stayed here for three nights and after the first day of the maids coming in to clean the room, we discovered his nice, silver watch had been stolen along with LG Bluetooth headset. Not only was it stolen, but it was taken OUT OF HIS BAG where he hid it before we left that morning for the beach. It's bad enough when something of yours is stolen, but knowing your personal belongings have been looked through by strangers is disturbing. Management was notified and his aloof and flippant attitude was disrespectful, especially after he told us, ""it could have just fallen in the trash,"" after we knew he had hidden them in his bag before we left. You might be saving a few bucks by staying here but you're not saving yourself. Spend the extra money on a nicer hotel with better standards.I booked this hotel for the 4th of July and Was a little hesitant after reading the reviews .   Decided to give it a try anyway.  Everything was fine. We were traveling with 2 dogs and were looking for something close to the beach for a reasonable price and pet friendly.     There was a huge side yard to take the dogs out,   friendly staff, across the street from the beach, and free breakfast.  rooms weren't fancy but were clean and hand a flat screen TV , refrigerator, and microwave.   This hotel is great for what you pay for. When booking you know it isn't a 5star hotel so I felt like some of the reviews are unfair.  Would definitely stay here again.HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE! I paid $100 for one night here and couldn't believe how bad this place was. The Motel 6 or Super 8 would have been better. The first room they gave us hadn't been cleaned and once we saw it we decided not to stay here and expose our young children to this place.The managers could care less and similarly to other reviews, just get offended that you complained and tell you that you might as well stay because you purchased a non-refundable room. The manager could not believe that I would rather forfeit my $100 than stay here and I told her that I would rather sleep in my car at a rest stop then here. Also, she couldn't check me out until the next day in her system, so I got no record that I was officially checked out and wouldn't be surprised if I got charged an incidental fee for a room I never even stepped in to. I called the next morning to verify that I had in fact been checked out.DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! In fact, DO NOT STAY ANYWHERE at St. Augustine Beach that is less than 3 stars. The 2.5 star rating may as well be a 1 star in this area. Go for paying a bit more and actually feeling safe and being able to enjoy your stay.This property is a WRETCHED MESS! Try the Best Western down the street instead! It's clean, well maintain a just a few dollars more.The only reason I gave it 1 star is that I had to give it something. That said, I will never stay here, nor would I recommend it to friend or foe. After checking in, I saw 5 rooms, which all had mold &amp; mildew in the grout &amp; caulk around the tubs of each room. When I told the management I would not be staying, they repeatedly said that I might as well stay since I was going to pay for the room regardless of whether I stayed or not. I reiterated that I would not be staying &amp; asked for a business card. I wasn't given one. I asked for a copy of the receipt in case I needed to dispute the charges. At this point, I was told that they only put an 'authorization hold' on my account that would be released the next day because they would annotate the record to indicate that I had not actually stayed at the property and that no actual charge would appear. I was told if I insisted on a receipt, they would actually process a charge, so I could choose to have a receipt &amp; an actual charge on my account or wait for the hold to be released.My party &amp; I found the last available room at the Best Western down the street. It was $25 per night more the room, but it was clean &amp; well maintained.After I returned home, I called AAA &amp; Comfort Inn corporate offices to let them know of my experience &amp; the fact that I indeed had a authorization hold on my account. AAA sent me a complaint form to submit. Comfort  Inn corporate took my Complaint over the phone &amp; submitted it to the management of the Comfort Inn. The next day I checked my account &amp; instead of the authorization hold, now there was a 'hard charge' so I called Comfort Inn corporate again &amp; they said that the management of the property said that they were charging me for the room because we just decided not to stay there because we decided to stay at a less expensive property.I am not happy that the management of the property not only didn't maintain it, but gave me the run around after I tried in good faith to find a suitable room at their property. More than that, I feel that I was lied to regarding their ability to reverse the charges or not impose charges on my account. Finally the fact that they lied to corporate &amp; responded that I just decided not to stay so I could get a cheaper room when that was not true infuriates me.The only 'good' note regarding this experience is that true to their word, the Comfort Inn corporate office has issued a refund after I sent them a detailed letter along with a copy of the charge from my bank, as well as a copy of my receipt showing I stayed at a more expensive property down the street.This is where we're been staying while visiting Florida with cheap ass Skybus tickets.  While it's nothing fancy, it fits the needs.  Close to the beach?  Oh, yeah!  Close to downtown.  Moderately.  Close to the only Starbucks?  It's right down the block.St. Augustine is severely lacking in having any decent resorts (the only one is a golf resort) and we ended up getting a really cheap deal via Priceline for this location.  It's been well worth it.  It looks as if it has been recently ""updated"", because ""renovated"" isn't the correct word.  The bedding all looks really new, the bathroom has a fresh coat of paint, and everything functions really well.  The pool is really simple, and the hot tub perfectly warm.While not having any really negative interactions with the staff, I'd hardly consider the customer service great, or even really good.  The continental breakfast is decent, and the coffee was really fresh.  I'd stay here again if the price was right, but I do like slightly more luxurious accommodations.I gave this place 2 stars for only one reason. They are close to the beach and the AC works well and the bed was comfortable, and the price was acceptable at 59 dollars. Now the rest of the review. I checked in late around midnight. At that point you just want to crash and watch TV. I got in my room and the first thing that went wrong is no matter what the 90's style Tube TV would not tune in any stations. After 15 minutes of dickering with it I gave up. Called the front desk and they switched me which I hate doing that late! Got in my next room and like the first one it had a funky smell. The room is not modern. The fridge did not work.  The kitchen area was old and dirty!! I don't care as I did not use it. I asked for extended check out and they said no you must check out at 11AM or incur 10 dollars an hour more for each hour after that. I surfed the net which worked okay and went to bed watching HBO which was a plus. The only station with no interference. Got up and had breakfast. They had scrambled eggs and sausage. Eggs did not taste like real eggs and were cold so were the sausage. Orange juice was not sweet and had to dump it. Apple juice and coffee were okay. Made a waffle that was good. One redeeming thing is they extended my check out to 12:30 at no charge as I am a Choice Privileges member. Speaking of which they had no free paper for me. I did not use the pool but it looked okay but very small. My advice stay inland in a better hotel and drive to St. Augustine!!!!! By the way, this is not a hotel. It has all exterior rooms and exterior entrances. I am a choice rewards member and they did not give me credit for the stay. What a joke. They say my rate was low so it does not count. I will stay with Country Inn and Suites better chain or Days Inn!!!! They let every stay count!!!!Lucky I am giving 1 star! This place hasn't been thoroughly cleaned or renovated since the 80's. Leaking ac in room, so wet stinky carpet. Electrical outlet that is black and sparks. No working laundry machines, which we were counting on because it was listed on website. Rude night manager, Raj , throws people out for complaining! Don't stay here!1. So I check in around 8pm at comfort in at st augustine beach cuz i wanted a scenic view and they try to charge me. I had to provide documentation to show room was booked and paid in advance through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotel.com&amp;s=1c9cd25474134bd332ead348e1af3dd34ef04702a504940ac882b95d1297049a"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotel.com</a>.2. I called front desk for number to closest pizza and Chinese delivery place. The Chinese place was closed for renovations and pizza place confirmed my payment info but didn't parrot back delivery address so pizza never came. I had to go food hunting after 10pm.3. Small fridge in room no microwave to warm up left overs.4. Time to upgrade to flat screen TV. Tube TVs are out.5. I come back after a busy day in saint Augustine only to find my room unlocked. Called management saying wtf? A six year employee and business veteran thought its ok to leave door unlocked while she washes my sheets. 6. Windows blinds open iPod, and iPad in plain site for all to see.7. Would I go back to comfort inn? Hell to the no.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-isle-oceanfront-resort-saint-augustine,Holiday Isle Oceanfront Resort,2.5,$$,40,"People are way to hard on the ratings. I completely understand that at a hotel or resort hotel you want what you want and you deserve it. However you have to consider what you are paying and the location. Could this hotel be a lot better with the right group of people providing excellent customer service? Yes!I stayed right after Labor Day weekend. September 7-14th paying about $630 for a partial ocean view all seven nights. That's pretty damn cheap. One of the cheapest places to stay in the St Augustine area. On arrival I was told that I would have to wait because the room wasn't yet ready. A short 5 minutes later it was ready.After a couple hours the room was still not cooling so I called the engineering department to come take a look at the A/C unit. He was able to replace, yes replace, the unit with a working one in under 20 minutes.The room was clean. The door to the balcony was a little stiff and hard to close. ( It's a hotel, by the salt water and sand- for everyone's rust issues) I even saw that someone complained about the door to their balcony on the third floor wouldn't lock. (NINJAS) The linens are dated. Pillows dated. Beds dated. As I said before, clean though. Housekeeping staff that I encountered was nice. I was not impressed by the front desk staff at all. Huge let down. Impacted my review significantly.Elevators are ridiculous on the weekends if the hotel is full. They have a pool and tiki bar. Staff at the bar was great. Came around asking if everyone was in need of anything. Pool could have been cleaner. The towels by the pool should be large and comforting. Not small and thin. Ok. Let's rap this up. This place was super affordable! Great location. Clean rooms. Having worked in the hotel industry, I would recommend more team meetings and include additional training. With the right guidance a team should be able to make the stay behind a dumpster a fantastic experience. Overall I would definitely give this place another stay.The rooms stinks and very UNCLEAN and UNHYGIENIC.Had to book last minute and was happy to have a ocean / beach at walking distance.The moment I entered in the room, there was a stink and it was like pee. It seems the bathroom curtains have never been washed and the stink was unbearable. The toiletries and towel quality is really bad.The bed had all types of hair including PUBIC hair and it was GROSS. Tha carpet seemed never to be clean and impossible to walk bear foot.The only good thing about it was that the beach was at walk able distance. For $87 per night, this was really not commendable as its not a small amount.The room service was quick when asked for extra towels.The location and view was perfect. The gazebo and short walk to beach was so nice. The pool area was one of the nicest oceanfront I've seen and what appealed to my kids. They ended up not swimming because the pool was not heated and the water was FREEZING.  The ocean view rooms were very out dated...the bathroom especially. Noises don't bother me but may bother someone else this hotel seemed to have paper thin walls. I could hear walking, water running, showers, suitcases rolling across floor, our refrigerator made a knocking sound. Little things that are not a big deal and may just have been overlooked, there was no trash can in bathroom and the cleaning people didn't re-stock the coffee, cups, creamer for our second day. I know they are renovating so I would come back if the room was updated and in warmer weather when the  pool would be warmer.  Definitely 5 stars once it's updated!It's Ok. Just somewhere to spend the night. Very old hotel, a lot of construction going on. It does provide access to beach. Affordable.Kinda dumpy and room were being redone.  I would not pay summer or peak prices.  They said we had a partial view of the ocean -- yes leaning over the balcony!!The carpets were old and ripped and the cement floors were cracked.No ""free"" breakfast here!This was a last minute reservation for 2 nights.  Room was very clean, free internet worked great,  staff is polite, beds were really comfortable.   I brought my own pillow since the last hotel we stayed at in Ft. Lauderdale was so bad, I could not use the pillows....I did not even take it out of the car this time.  In room fridge, microwave, and coffee pot.   Love the ""quiet hours"" from 11 pm-8 am.  The only issue we had was the huge pot holes on the left side parking area, luckily we did not hit them.This hotel is ok. We booked it as a last minute get away online. The best thing the hotel has going for it is the location. The pool is okay sized- but freezing! But man oh man the ocean! It has a private entrance to the ocean which is a huge plus!Hotel: definitely outdated. BUT doable. Our AC worked well- shower was fine and towels ok quality. Nothing special here Tons if parking. Friendly staff. We didn't eat at the hotel so no comment there. All in all if you aren't looking for anything special this place will do just fine. It's about a 10-15 minute drive into the heart of St AugustineWe had a toilet over flow at 11pm and maintenance came within 5 minutes to fix.I should have read the reviews on here before I made reservations at Holiday Isles. This ""motel"" is a flee bag.  You will need to make sure you are up to date on your hepatitis and tetanus vaccines if you plan on staying here.  I feel lucky checking out without getting bed bugs or lice, or tetanus from this so called ""resort"". We got a ""deal"" on a room for 2 nights and that so called deal was $107 plus taxes and a 20$ pet fee.  This place is worth no more than $50 a night regardless if it is pet friendly or not.  We could not wait to leave this disgusting place.  Rust on all fixtures, rust on doors, peeling paint, scratched and rusty tubs, tiles not clean, air conditioner rusty and falling out of the wall, the list can go on and on.  Do yourself a favor and drive past this place!!I really enjoyed my stay here. Rates were great with the AAA discount. The rooms were very standard but they were clean and had everything we needed.i think we also had one of the updated ones as they had clean, white linens, large flatscreen, and granite counters in the bathroom. We got a partial ocean view room for about $80/night. Just steps from a great part of Saint Augustine Beach and only about a 10 minute drive to downtown Saint Augustine. Seriously can't beat that anywhere in the area. Honestly, we didn't spend a lot of time in the room anyway. The poolside bar had good drinks and food too. Only downside was the pool closes at dusk, which is around 6pm in November. That was kind of a bummer, but I would definitely stay here again if I'm in the area.$120/night for being on the beach isn't bad at all. A slow ice machine is the only complaint I had. The staff is friendly and my room was clean. I recently stayed at an oceanfront hotel for $320/night and it was disgusting and falling apart so I was very pleased with this hotel.My oh My where to begin? Shall we start with the VERY few goods? Okay so the shower water is Hot! So thats a plus..The pool is decent, but no hot tub..Easy access to the beach.AC in the room gets the room cold!Beds are comfortable Fun atmosphere in the pool areaOkay so here's where you really want to pay attention...This place is super run down! The shower is literally falling apart The hotel nickel and dimes you at every turn.. Want a fridge? Shell out an extra $11 per night.. Want breakfast? That will be $10 We had to wait Entirely too long for new towels to be delivered to our room, to the point we just didn't shower after getting in the pool, and went into town for dinner. Every time you go outside the doors lock behind you, so don't forget your key... Anyways.. If you're looking for a bare bones, no frills, lay your head down and get out hotel... This miight be for you. But even you could do better.  Good luck!Absolutely hideous. This ""hotel"" was a glorified motel at best. They proudly display their 1 AAA star on the counter. When we arrived the parking lot was completely empty, I went insideTo check in and there were no other guests in sight and the two ladies at theCounter didn't look up until I said ""excuse me"" . They checked me in and gave me a partial ocean view room which I paid 120$ for. We took the elevator up (which is in the back of the building) and the second I stepped in I wanted toThrow up!! It smelled like armpit and sewage in there!!!!! I held my breath every time I had to use the elevator! The room was okay very shabby oldFurniture dusty bed the door toThe balcony was very rusted and would barely open. No central AC just those small ones attached to the wall.Cheap towels and cheaper soap and the thinnest toilet paper imaginable. Rusty tub and shower head. This is all acceptable for a motel not an ""oceanfront resort"", so please get it together and either upgrade this place or callIt what it is, a motel, and don't you dare charge guests more than $50 a night.Stayed here for 2 days. Not the most impressive hotel I have stayed in BUT if you have a need for something, like light bulbs for your lamps or batteries for the TV remote control they are at your door within minutes. Check-in is at 4pm and the hotel is BUSY so you may NOT get into your room at 4. So don't show up at 1230 and start complaining at 405pm that your room is not ready. Just because you show up early doesn't mean we are going to start the party early Just For YOU! Laundry room had several washers and dryers.... Unfortunately only one dryer and one washer was working.I would give Holiday Isle 3 stars if we didn't have a serious issue with breakfast on our first morning. I think the cook may have either quit or left. Our waiter ""bless his heart"" was having a hard time keeping up with the 3 or 4 tables he had. We were there for about 1 1/2 hours. Food was cold, apple juice was watered down, our waiter didn't know how to make hot chocolate.  When I told the front desk about the problem in the kitchen they didn't seem t concerned. $40 bucks for a meal that was inedible just ""ain't right""BUT it really is a short walk to the beach and right down the road is Salt Life restaurant that we went to twice!!! In the other direction is Publix and dunkin donuts.If you want a place that has no amenities this is your place! What was I thinking????Check in staff was great, the beach was perfect. The hotel does not look like the photos. It is old and run down, elevator was ridiculously slow, the stairs were creepy, the coffee pot broken and the outlet sparked when we plugged it in. There were power bars everywhere. The bathroom smelled sour. I felt I had to wear flip flops in the shower. We stayed one sleepless night. Thank goodness we found another place to stay.My fiance and I visited St.Augustine for a weekend staycation ( we're from the Orlando area). We arrived a little early and were pleasantly surprised when we were allowed to check in and landed an ocean front room! As the weekend went on, I found myself frustrated with certain details. First of all, what constitutes a ""resort""? A poolside bar? The pool is alright. We had fun despite the fact that it is average sized and lacks a Jacuzzi. Not to mention the lack of a poolside bathroom! You're expected to walk to the lobby to use the restroom. You know what that means...more pee in the pool than usual! Sorry, but it's true. We were also excited for the live music in the""lounge"", which turned out to be a joke. Friday night and it was absolutely empty. Downtown historic St.Augustine is about a 20 minute drive and that proved to be a good time. As far as the rooms go...they were average. Relatively clean despite the questionable body hairs found once the sheets were folded down. The elevator ( yes there's only one) is soooo slow! Also, even though we had an ocean front room, we were located right across from the ice machine ( which is in the hallway, not its own room) and it would wake us up at night and in the early morning. The paper thin walls also made afternoon naps impossible. Overall, we still had a good time. This place is ON the beach with direct access, so you're really paying for location. Just don't expect a resort experience.We stayed here from December 14th to December 16th 2014, booked thru Expedia, and got an amazing deal for our money. We didn't even needed to pay for the reservation, they took the reservation, and we paid with cash when we got there.The Hotel is located at an amazing spot, with private entrance to the beach. We got there, and the gentleman at the front desk told us they had upgraded up to a room with a refrigerator and a microwave. Woohoo!!! It was really cold to use the pool or the beach, but we did went for a walk at the beach with my husband, at night, and it was delightful. Can't wait until we get to comeback during the hot season!We all got to relax and enjoy the short stay, we took very hot baths, beds were super comfortable, good service, very clean. Overall, it's great for families that are on the go, and want a hotel that is clean and comfortable. Will be definitely staying there again next visit to St Augustine Beach.My first experience driving up to the hotel, we were not impressed with the outside view for the price that we paid. The parking area has a lot of holes that need to be fixed. We paid $170/night for an oceanfront room. Apparently, these are the most expensive rooms in the hotel. Why in the world would you put an ice machine and soda machine right in front of the rooms?... Every time someone came for ice or soda, of course, the noise would wake us up!!! If this sounds like an issue for you, you might wanna stay away from rooms 534/535 and the nearby rooms. Same on the rest of the floors, most likely. Floor 2 for sure. The bathroom we found to be clean, upgraded, although the floor looked disgusting in both bathroom and bedroom. Those carpets need some serious cleaning or better even a replacement!!! The towels are old and disgusting!!!!! The bottom of the bath tub was messed up, it was gray.The beds are comfortable but all the pillows in our room were about a foot long. Believe it or not! Our room came with a fridge that was rusted on top and hadn't been defrosted in a long time. Well, at least we had one. The elevators have got to be the slowest in the world!!!! Took us about 10 minutes at least to get in it and downstairs from the 5th floor. The ocean view was amazing, though. The only good thing. Although the balcony door was rusted. The tiki bar was not open once in the whole weekend, we assume due to the weather. And the pool looked very dirty. They bill you as soon as you check in and charge your card the full amount. Overall, this hotel needs some serious remodeling and upgrading. Definitely would not stay here again.I purchased a deal through LivingSocial for a weekend stay. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. The place is completely run down. The walls are entirely too thin!! I could hear people walking in the hall and people in the room next to me. I read a review that mentioned this prior to my stay and they were spot on. You don't really realize how extremely annoying it can be to hear other people's interactions until you experience it. And that I did! There was blonde hairs in the bed, that definitely didn't come from me! (Gross) And I suppose it's great for those with pets to come across a pet friendly hotel but walking through the halls with people and their large dogs wasn't very pleasant. Definitely wouldn't stay here again but the location was very convenient for the attractions that we visited.We stayed in the pool/ full ocean view               PROS:-beautiful view -Super friendly staff they are there for every need. -Mostly clean it is older so some dirtiness is expected. -Close to so much putt putt, food, historic sites- pool is clean and good size. -kid friendly.                       CONS:-Room kind of small for my family - no microwave-no bathroom by pool have to go back to room or lobby. -in our case they were an hour behind checkin time and our 4 pm checkin turned into 5 pm checkin.","The good points are that it is in a great location directly on the beach and very close to historic St. Augustine.  Their breakfast buffet is also pretty good.The not-so-good points are that it is bit of a ""tired"" hotel that could use a little TLC.  There are no extra's like a drinking glass in the bathroom, or extra towels - but you can ask for the extra towels at the front desk.  Don't expect pool or beach towels either (be sure to pick up a few before heading outside)If you are looking for an easy place to crash for a night or so, you'll be fine.  If you're looking to be pampered in the slightest way, you'll want to go elsewhere.Dated but clean and comfortable rooms. Well worth the price for the area. Beautiful beach. Trolley service to the old town. Would stay here again.I recently stayed here for fur nights over Thanksgiving. Here are the pros: Great location, very nice pool, friendly front desk staff. The cons: Room had a stale odor almost a smokey smell. The next day I switched rooms and was upgraded to a room with a fridge and microwave. However, this room also had a similar odor as the previous room. Later on that night, I found out the TV did not work! I told the front desk the next morning and they promptly corrected the problem. This hotel needs to be upgraded and the rugs either replaced or seriously shampooed. They justdon't pay attention to details...On this edition of: ""How saving a few bucks, goes wrong."" I present: Holiday Isle Oceanfront Resort.Planning a nice, simple road trip from Miami to Charleston St. Augustine was our first stop. We left Miami at 7:30pm and would arrive there at about 1 AM. Checking out at 8AM to head up to Savannah. I figure, oh a cheap hotel, would do. Only a couple of hours to bathe, sleep, and head out. WRONG. I have had the great fortune of picking stellar hotels (even when on a budget). Always clean, safe, not in the lap of luxury, but comfortable. I should of investigated deeper. Read more reviews. WHERE DID I GO WRONG?Paid about $85 for the night WITH a discount coupon. (I have stayed in places for less, which were leaps and bounds better than this place.)We arrive at 1am to check in. Tired. Ready for bed. And check in takes close to 20 minutes. It wasn't the sweet lady behind the counters fault....she was trying. But they seem to be using an extremely old computer system and since it was a ""new day"" she couldn't access our reservation. this gave me a chance to look around. The place is OLD and in desperate need of renovations. They do allow pets - for an extra fee of course - which I thought was cool.Finally she figures out our reservation and we head to the room. We pass some bell carts on the way that were either extremely dirty or that was plain old mold. YUCK, thank god we didn't need them.Walk in the room and got kicked in the face by the smell. It wasn't a rotten smell but it sure was distinct. I examine the room. Rusted all around the top of the bathroom door. Carpet looks dirty. Bathroom wasn't too bad, but the towels didn't smell clean, they didn't smell bad either, just not that CLEAN smell you want when using towels. The bed board was all scratched up. WHAT? How do you not fix something as obvious as that? The TV was old and the reception was spotty. The bed wasn't comfortable, the pillows were horrible. I can go on and on.We checked out as fast as we could in the morning and headed out. NEVER again will I make the mistake of not properly researching rooms.THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE!!!I I wasn't expecting it to be a resort or anything, but I couldn't believe how run down and gross this place was. I paid $150 for 1 night and it wasn't worth $35. Having the direct access to the beach was very nice, but the pool area and the rest of the grounds are disgusting.You can hear every word that is spoken in the rooms next to you and the front desk  does nothing if other guests are noisy. We had our young kids trying to sleep and the neighbors must have had 10 people in their room who were screaming, having loud sex and looking through our balcony window. We packed up our children at 1 am and drove 4 hours home because we felt so unsafe at this place (not to mention that we lost our entire payment). The office is in a separate building from the rooms, so they could care less what is going on in the actual hotel. Unless you are excited about being at a huge white trash hotel party....DO NOT WASTE A DIME ON THIS PLACE!!!$150 a night for a pool with broken light so no one can swim at nightRoom carpet dirtyHead board falling apartThin walks you can hear everyone around youThe Good:Great locationBeach AccessPool and outdoor areaIn house restaurant and barEvent spaceCourteous staffThe bad:I did not like the layoutAll the exterior doors lock so if you forget a key its a real painThe elevator was small-ishThe hotel nickel and dimes a little too much. You have to pay extra for fridge, mircrowave, flatscreen etc.I am only giving this place two stars due to the beachside location. The property is in poor condition. Won't be back.The location is awesome.  Right on the beach with a very pleasant deck and walkway.  The ""Beach Bus"" to St. Augustine picks up right in front of the hotel which makes it super convenient to get into the city for the day.  The beds and sheets were fine. But - the hotel is in serious need of updating.  Towels were old and shabby, the elevator was having issues, everything needs to be perked up.  It works because the location is so awesome, and it seemed clean.  But could use some work for sure.Is the place old? Yes but you have to experience the view. Rusty doors, picnic furniture on the balconies, missing plaster yes, but none of that matters when you look over your balcony and take in the sea breeze and see beach sand blowing off the too of the dunes. Another plus is the beds are comfortable, the a/c blows ice cold and the staff is accommodating and pleasant. This place has a pool and a time bar right by the ocean. This place has both atmosphere and patina and they co mingle nicely.We stayed here recently for two nights (Fri &amp; Sat) as part of a wedding celebration. It's your average beachfront hotel &amp; I feel we received the quality we paid for. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean, &amp; we had plenty of pillows. I appreciated the mini fridge too. The beachfront access was a bonus, &amp; we enjoyed a few cocktails at the poolside bar. The bar closed at 5pm, though, which was a bit of a downer.CAUTION if you are planning a wedding celebration here. My friend got unlucky &amp; the wedding coordinator was fired the day before her wedding, as was the chef, so none of the food that she tried at her tasting was actually prepared for her wedding night. Not only that, but she had no day-of coordinator to help take care of things, &amp; the hotel charged a cash bar when they weren't supposed to, at least for beer &amp; wine. Luckily, I'm told she was given a nice refund, so the hotel tried to make up for causing havoc on her big day!My sweet husband an I have been staying at holiday isle regularly for several years and have found it to be adequate and reasonably priced in the past  however this recent stay was absolutely not acceptable.  They seem to be more interested in the the tiki bar crowd than in keeping quality clientele.  We requested and paid for a room on an upper floor away from the families with children and when we arrived we were told that the only room available was on the second of the five floors which is just above the pool and we were surrounded by small unhappy children. In fact the family in the room next to us must have been torturing their infant because the child cried  and screamed non-stop for more than two hours.  The front desk clerks were unable or unwilling to quiet the disturbance.  While the behavior of the patrons is not the fault of the establishment, they should insist that patron act like human beings and not like ill-mannered animals.  We are not an old couple, in fact quite the opposite. But our parents raised us to think of others, to treat others with courtesy and respect, and to act in a civil manner.  How in the world were other people raised?  Babies cry.  We have two of our own but we went out of our way to not disturb other people and we did not permit our children to be a disturbance to others.  Anyway, enough about that.  Beyond the noise, the hotel is in need of updating and the parking is ridiculously lacking.  I wish Managent would get with it and consider reserving parking spaces closer to the beach for those who pay dearly for oceanfront rooms. We'll be looking for a more adult oriented facility for our next stay at the beach.Pit stop on the way from Key West headed North.    We had chicken salad with cashews and crab cakes ($27).Great view of the water here, usual outdoor dining problems like flies and very bold birds that will take food right off the table.    Food was good. Nothing special...If I could give it 0 stars I would....I dont usually write nasty reviews but this one just got me ticking.... I'm writing this review because I would want to know if i were thinking of staying here, I'd like to see the good and the bad! i reserved this room out of a booking agent online, pictures seemed nice ""right by the ocean"".I check in and go into my room, first of all its dirty, gum wrappers on the floor, didnt have ANY fridge or microwave, one microwave to share with 500 people! They were so cheap with everything including soap and shampoo! It was me and my other half and we had to share 1 little soap and one tiny shampoo! Thought it was a mistake the next day, they left the same amount!The shower wall gave me shivers because there was bloody, red, stains all over it, it was somthing out of a horror movie, not exagerating!Here comes the big one! The first night we were there the outside transformer caught on fire, they let them know in the front, they didnt seem to care because apparently they are used to things like that happening! 1/2 of the hotel lost power including the side of the elevator! good thing there was no one there, or else they would of got stuck!  it was completley rediculous and unacceptable. This was one of the most unpleasant hotels if you want to call it that, more like an old home, no offence. They are just so cheap to their customers! but hey the rooms arent cheap to book, look at that! funny... **** they also charged my card an extra amount of money which i have yet find to find out about.pros:they have a cafeconscafe is overpricedpro: try an awesome place call ""Leroys"" its down the street, awesome inexpensive food :)Hotel was ""good enough""...for what we paid for it.  (around $90/night)Was royally peeved when housekeeping went knocking on doors at 9am the morning of check out just to slide the receipt/bill under the door.  Is it really necessary to knock?  Not only do I hear them knocking on my door, I heard them knocking on every door down the hall. Obnoxious.  Partial ocean view is really that - you need to lean partially over the balcony to see anything.Ice machine was plentiful. Good location.Wonderful view if you have an oceanfront room! Needs a little better upkeep, but everything was clean and the staff are all extremely friendly and helpful!We stayed 2 nights here. the room was nice , clean and had a great view !!!!  The front desk was welcoming. The pool area was clean and nice!!! The beach was just footsteps a way !!! I had dropped soda on our bed and had to call to get clean bedding, no problem i was told, with in 10 mins we had new clean bedding !!!  I just saw minor things like maybe need to upgrade a bit, but didnt effect or take away from our stay. The WIFI was strong and were surprised to have a microwave and refrigerator in our room since the web site didnt mention this .   For the price and location  . ..  we will stay here again !!! just wish since they are listed as a resort had resort type activates  why i didnt give 5 starsThis used to be a holiday inn, it now goes by the name holiday isle. Well, this place is no holiday.  It is pretty old and requires a lot of TLC that it does not get- there are many negative aspects- we would NEVER stay here again. On the plus side, they seem to have a friendly staff.This is an old hotel so it isnt the nicest, however we enjoyed our stay.  the pool is nice right on the beach with an awesome beach access.  if you like to take a late night swim, the pool appears to be open all night.  the staff is friendly and the oceanfront rooms have a great view.  the rooms are a bit noisy. the hotel is dog friendly up to 50 lbsDon't bother... this hotel needs to close down and completely renovate, rather than stay open... or tear down and re-develop. It does allow pets, but does not welcome them. It's got a great beachfront location, but is not worth the price. The furnishings are nice enough, but the public areas are worn out and dirty. The pet rooms are ground floor, parking lot view, with windows that don't open.

All the hotels &amp; B&amp;B's wanted a 2 night stay because it was the city's 450th birthday. That is All but the Cozy inn. The cozy inn is a throw back to a different era. It's a road side inn from the 40's or 50's and it appears untouched by time, however the rooms are updated. We had room 12, which on the inside was absolutely beautiful. A very Floridian theme with a tropical bed spread, and a little table. The bathroom was quite tiny, but sufficient. The hospitality of the innkeeper was beyond par! I mentioned why we were there, and she offered us a bottle of wine, we declined, but thought that the gesture was quite nice.  I would totally stay here in the future.Just what the sign says.  We only stayed one night but perfectly charming + comfy bed, good shower, adequate wi-fi.  I love the 50's architecture &amp; scale.Thank you again Cozy Inn for a great stay. This is our second time there and we will be back. Love the location, convenience,  cleanliness and wonderful people.Cute little place we stayed at for 2 nights. The best part was that we could bring our little doggie. The room was clean and bright and close to shopping, restaurants and most anything you'd need. We'd definitely stay here again!A perfect little roadside motel/inn that reminds me of what my family used to stay in when we traveled across the country when I was a kid. If you're looking for a fancy hotel with a gym and spa, or an exceptionally quaint bed &amp; breakfast, this isn't it. But what it does offer is good accommodations at reasonable rates. The room we stayed in was had a queen bed, a small table with chairs, and a small but serviceable bathroom with a shower.  Our room was set back from the road a bit, so we did not notice any road noise as others have mentioned.  Everything was clean and orderly, and we never felt like we were needing anything more.  For well under $100/night, this is a great value in a fairly pricey tourist town.The downside of the great value is the distance from old town.  It's far enough that you won't want to walk, and parking in St Augustine is a hassle, especially with 3-4 hour street limits.  Your best bet is to call for a cab. as it costs maybe $5-7 to get anywhere. You could also bring your own bicycles if that's your thing, as it's free and parking is plentiful. Overall a great little inn that offers everything you need, and nothing you don't, for a great price.""Very much enjoyed!""My father and I stayed here in a one bedroom suite while visiting friends in St. Augustine. It was perfect for us! I gave my father the bedroom - and I slept on the pull out couch in the living room. We only stayed one night - but it was so nice. Christine was delightful on check-in, and we were delighted to find our suite was more like a small ground floor apartment, directly across the street! Our suite included a lovely front porch with wicker furniture. The kitchenette was a full kitchen actually - though we didn't need it. We were quite comfortable and I could have enjoyed staying here for a week.... \  I did greatly appreciate the coffee maker - ready to go before we headed off to our breakfast with friends.  I will say - I read another review talking about the street traffic on the main road right in front of the room where we stayed - but HONESTLY - we did not notice any annoying level of  traffic sounds. We stayed on a Friday night - so perhaps truck traffic was lower - and on Saturday morning there was little traffic until around 9:30 (just as we were leaving) - but it was delightful.The bed, my father reported was most comfortable - and while no pull out couch is great - my night's sleep was just fine.  There were televisions in both the living room and bedroom - so we each enjoyed some late night tv.  The bathroom, I'll admit, was a bit small and in need of an update - - but over all the accommodations were really quite nice and a tremendous value.Our friends were part of a (sell out) convention group at the Renaissance at World of Golf roughly 20 minutes north. - We could have stayed at MANY hotel/motels closer to them - however I chose this for the reviews and the 'suite' set up and price and I am so glad we stayed here! It was so much more relaxing - and spotlessly clean - just a far better experience than any 'typical' hotel/motel experience.  Next time I'm in St. Augustine - this will be my home away from home.I am so glad that I found and booked our stay at The Cozy Inn. I surprised my husband and upgraded at the last minute to the Honeymoon Suite for our 8th Anniversary. I called and spoke to Christina the morning of our arrival and asked for the upgrade. I had originally booked on Expedia so I wasn't sure of the process. She held the room for us and when we got there she had everything ready. Our Suite was located across the street from the office in the historic house portion of the inn. The suite was called ""The Royal"". We had the entire second floor of the home to ourselves. When we arrived at the top of the stairs and first laid our eyes on our suite, my husband and I were pleasantly surprised. It was very clean, spacious &amp; bright. There are several skylights throughout the suite that let in natural light. We entered the kitchen to find a bottle of wine from a local winery and two glasses with a personalized card for our occasion. The kitchen, dining and living area are open concept with a small nook with a desk as well. The only thing that area was lacking was a three prong plug for electronics. They had a little extension cord running behind because there's no outlet on that wall. The bedroom had a King bed and traditional furnishings. The tub was in the bedroom to the right as you entered the double doors to the suite. It is tastefully situated in a way so it is somewhat off of the bedroom but open to it. There we found his and hers robes. The only suggestion I have here would be some bubble bath or bath beads/crystals. The bathroom off of the suite was spotless and bright. A nice bright skylight in there as well. A heads up, The shower is really small. One person at a time for sure. Not long after our arrival, we decided to go in to the shopping district. We were locking up and we're greeted by the owners of the cozy inn. They asked if we found the accommodations satisfactory and wanted to welcome us. Very nice couple. They also suggested some local favorites for us during our stay.After a long day and a lot of walking, we came back to our suite. It was almost too quiet. In the morning it was not so quiet though. This was really the only annoyance for me. I was woken up to a dog continuously barking. There is a vets office next door who does some boarding. This is not something that would keep me from staying again. Just thought I would mention it.Check out was quick and easy. It was a great stay. If we stay in St. Augustine again we plan on reserving this suite. We really enjoyed it.. My husband was pleased and that's not an easy task! Our next stay will include a 10 percent discount. Thanks For making our 8th Anniversary a memorable one.The name of this motel is cute, but nothing is cute about highway traffic at 4 A.M.Situated on top of a busy main road, semi trucks and cars with loud stereos whiz past at all hours. If you are not bothered by that type of ruckus, then the Cozy is a great bet. It's close to the main areas but not down in the historic district, and the rooms are clean (as in, smelled like the chemicals they'd used to clean it - so it must be clean, right?) and comfortable. The window air conditioners could stand to be upgraded (they're the kind that blow the window curtains up, thereby defeated the curtains' purpose), and there was loud hammering on the exterior of my unit at 8 AM. Overall my stay was fine though - my earplugs and white noise machine did the trick. The free WiFi was a nice touch. My travel companions did not have hot water in their room in the morning, however...This place is the best!!! Rooms were affordable, impeccably clean, bed was very cozy, and the staff was so so friendly!!! I will for sure be back to stay with them!! For the rest of our road trip we will be avoiding big hotel changes and will stay at small family owned hotels. On a side note I learned this place extremely pet friendly!! For an extended stay I like the fact that the pet fee is a one time fee.Stayed here a couple years ago, so things might be different now.  The parking lot is a bit on the small size and we drove a van, so parking was tight, but I am really good at backing in, so I didn't truly have a problem.  The effiicency room we rented was nice.  Bed was soft enough.  Nice bathroom.  Small, but adequate kitchen.  The microwave plate wouldn't spin, so we burned the microwave popcorn, but eh, no big deal.  The place is located in a decent area.  The trolly stop isn't far.  Someone else mentioned the chemical (clean) smell in the room.  We noticed that tooo.  Not too overpowering, but strong.  Our room was underneith another room and I think the people living there were moving out the next day because they were very loud.  Moving furniture and walking all around up there at very late hours of the night.  At least till midnight.  We were tired from touring the city, so we were trying to sleep at midnight.  We mentioned this to the office upon checkout and they were super nice and apologetic.  They told us we should have said something to the office staff when it was happening.  We didn't because we figured it would eventually stop.  They gave us a nice bottle of wine for our troubles.  Would stay here again, if our favorite accomodations were not available in Crescent Beach !We love it here! We always stay at the cozy inn on our weekend getaways. The place is very clean which is a must for me (I guess for most people), the staff is helpful and friendly. It's a home away from home for us. We walk to all the attractions from our hotel. It might be a bit long for some older folks or people with children but just fine for us. We usually dine at the at the Raintree Cafe which is a few blocks away. Definitely walking distance and definitely worth checking out. Can't wait for our next getaway to visit the Cozy Inn.Our second time staying at The Cozy Inn in St. augustine. There is nothing that I could ever say that would be better than ""wow""!!  The best of the best!  My husbands birthday weekend we traveled from Fort Lauderdale to spend another stay at this beautiful little piece of heaven and were welcomed again like royalty!  Our daughter in law and granddaughter came over from Tampa to join us for a day and evening and the owners of the inn made sure our rooms were right near each other and treated them so well.  The rooms, all of them are charming with modern decor and updated appliances for the little kitchenettes that come with all the rooms.  All the conveniences that you need for a stay over are here.  Of course pets are welcome as long as you make the inn aware you have them.  I could go on and on, but I think everything has been stated.  If I could give 10 stars, I would.  We are looking for a home in st. Augustine and will be making a few more trips up here, we will stay here each time we come, without a doubt!  Thank you, don't change, we love your hospitality, see you again soon!This is by far the best hotel I've stayed at. They do allow dogs which is perfect. The location is 1.5 miles from shopping, restaurants and the castle. The hotel was extremely clean. The sheets smelled like Downey fabric softener. I will stay here again and highly recommend it to everyone.Place was clean and pampered. No problems. Has free wifi. Had great time.Having spent many vacations at 5 star resorts around the country, one of the main things I am looking for is cleanliness and service, and this is the CLEANEST place I have ever laid my head. The staff was top notch and went above and beyond for my wife and I to accommodate us and make our stay a great one !!They would have received 5 stars except the shower was a little small for my 6ft. 200lb body to get around in ... oh well, thats my only complaint here. Within walking distance from a couple of other chain places that were more expensive and looked a little run down for my liking. This is a family owned, quiet little gem that deserves the high rating it has received from me and several others from the trip advisor (which is how i found the Cozy Inn)Just a short walk from the Fountain of Youth and from 2 of the starting points for the tour trains that take visitors around town. We took our bikes with us on the trip to be able to bike up and down all streets to see things up close and go at our own pace. 5 minutes from Cozy Inn to anywhere you want to go via bikes.This is a true gem !!!!Awesome find! We were looking for an affordable, clean, convenient location in St. Augustine and this is it! Walkable to downtown, or a very short car drive. Extremely clean (we were wondering how you even get showers so white)! Really nice staff. I wish we could find Cozy Inns everywhere we vacationed. The rooms aren't very spacious, but for the price, location, and amenities, we couldn't care less!Stayed in the Cozy Inn Motel for a weekend getaway and when I first saw the pics online I thought how small the rooms are but I figured it was affordable and close to where we want to be. When we got there it was late and the lady at the front office was very helpful and nice and had a cool dog that had its hair shaved like a lion, it was awesome! When we got to the room we were pleasantly surprised at how much bigger the room was...the pics online doesn't at all show that! Our stay was awesome and would definitely stay again and also recommend the place to family and friends!!this place is so clean....everything is pristine....the staff were so accommodating...family owned business...support the locals and stay here you will not be disappointed!!",,,,,"['really', 'know', 'expect', 'wanted', 'take', 'paramour', 'away', '45th', 'birthday', 'since', 'never',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/peace-and-plenty-inn-saint-augustine,Peace & Plenty Inn,4.5,$$,17,"Excelent, place, excelente breakfast!  Glenda the owner is super nice. We come back for sureMy husband and I had the pleasure of staying in the Peace &amp; Plenty Inn as our first Bed &amp; Breakfast experience.We were warmly greeted at the front door upon arrival and given a quick tour of the common areas and then taken to our room where Glenna gave us a map of the area and explained a little about some of the places and offered to make any dinner reservations etc. should we need them!We stayed in room 7, the Happiness Spa Suite which was located behind the main house in the Carriage House. We couldn't have been more pleased with the room! The pictures on the website of the room are lovely, but the room was SO much more beautiful in person! It is SO clean and modern and very quiet with it's own exterior entrance, which we found we liked the best since we tend to stay out a little later than most people do! But the entrance to the room was still inside the B&amp;B's courtyard area, which was also beautiful and serene.The courtyard area featured several seating areas, all equipped with very attractive outdoor furnishings that looked like they were brand new. There was also a gas fire pit under the pergola, there was an adorable little greenhouse and two huge fountains that were very so calming to sit and listen to!Complimentary soda, beer and wine are available at all times, which we so appreciated! Then cakes, sherry and port are served every evening at 6pm. We couldn't get over how delicious all of the goodies were! The coconut and carrot cakes were our favorite. We also had never had port or sherry and were a little intimidated at first, but came to realize we love port!Breakfast was also phenomenal each morning! We got to enjoy fresh fruit, quiche, strawberry waffles, eggs benedict and the most delicious turkey sausage we'd ever had. They also had some very unique fruit juice blends that were excellent!The staff was very pleasant and did a great job of providing us with everything we needed! We even accidentally locked ourselves out one morning but were back in immediately after Glenna gave us a spare! Glenna, the innkeeper, was genuinely warm and pleasant. She made herself easily available but was not a nuisance. (We didn't expect her to come tuck us in at night, as I fear some other reviewers may have desired?) She greeted us by name each morning at breakfast and asked us how we were and we would pass by her a few other times throughout the day as we were coming and going. We enjoyed a nice conversation and a good farewell as we left at the end of our stay and were made to feel as though we were family.Soon after leaving, I even received a call from Glenna that I had left a piece of jewelry and she mailed it back to me right away!But most of all, the location of the Peace and Plenty Inn was perfect. It was located right in the historic district, just a few minutes walk from many of the sites and attractions and a block or so away from one of the Red Train stops, which was how we did most of our traveling in St. Augustine. The Peace and Plenty is right next door to a few other bed and breakfasts but I genuinely think the Peace and Plenty was the nicest looking (and had better parking!)For the price, this place is unbeatable! We will probably never stay in a hotel again, we are now B&amp;B fans!My husband and I, along with our two dear friends, chose St. Augustine for our annual Christmas get-together.  We spent 4 nights at Peace &amp; Plenty the weekend before Christmas, and just checked out today (Christmas Day).  I miss it already!The location is perfect, in Old Town and in walking distance to everything. Over the course of our 4 nights/days we never moved our car (one parking space for each suite).  We strolled everywhere!Glenna is a wonderful hostess, providing thoughtful insight into places to visit and how to get there. Each morning, she'd ask us about our plans for the day and if we had any questions, and in the afternoons she'd welcome us back. We really felt like we were ""at home"" in her home.My husband and I stayed in Tranquility Suite #4, and our friends were next door in #3.  Both are upstairs in the main house (as is #2).  We loved #4 as we had a full private balcony with chairs and table to enjoy our mornings with coffee and our evenings with wine.  Our friends loved #3 for the super comfy King-sized bed.  Their suite was very light and airy with windows that really brought in the light, and I especially liked the size of their bathroom.  While our bathroom in #4 was smaller, and our bed was a Queen, the balcony is the reason I would book this room again.  If it was the dead heat of the summer, however, I doubt we'd use the balcony much, and would probably opt for another room instead.We also toured #2 while there was no guest staying in the room.  This suite has a large sitting room with TV.  There was no TV in the bedroom, so the TV watching would really need to be done in the sitting room if this is an important feature for someone.  Other than that, it was a spacious suite also, and very nice.  Legend is that this suite is where Sophie Decher is sometimes seen.  Sophie was the wife of Conrad Decher who purchased the house in 1895.The breakfasts changed each morning, and were another thoughtful touch to our stay. Food was served elegantly, and we appreciated the quality of a gourmet breakfast as opposed to a continental breakfast anyone can find in a hotel.Each evening brought us to the living room to create small plates of desserts and pour a glass of wine (red or white wine, Coke, Diet Coke, bottled water, cans of beer were all available at all times with port and sherry only available in the evenings).  We enjoyed the space here with the Christmas tree, but most often enjoyed our goodies on our balcony before retiring each night.Some have said the carriage house is more private, however, we did not feel any lack of privacy in the main house at all.  There are only three rooms upstairs, so there is no foot traffic to speak of.  The house is a quiet space, and you can see the commitment to ""Peace"" in everything from the scents, the light music playing at breakfast, the artwork in the rooms, and the overall decorating schemes which varied from room to room.There is no doubt in my mind that we will return. I really wish it could be sooner rather than later!SPECIAL NOTE -- The Peace &amp; Plenty Inn is one of the houses on the Holly Jolly Trolly route during the Nights of Lights.Booked a room on a whim and got an excellent deal on a room (three room suite!). The staff is very cordial and polite, but not the overfriendly type that intrudes or is too involved. We were given plenty of privacy, but knew they were there to assist if needed. The house is absolutely beautiful and decorated in the most charming way. We were in love with all of the decor and little trinkets found throughout the inn. Be sure the checkout the garden which has a lovely fountain that practically sparkles at sunrise. Breakfast was a tad disappointing and felt rushed, but the waiting staff was very enthusiastic. There is self serve coffee in morning and sherry/wine/beer at night! However I recommend going out for coffee instead if you are a coffee snob, because their brew wasn't very good. If you are the type to sleep in, I would strongly advise you to not get a room on the first floor. There is a lot of ruckus between the kitchen prep and the stairs as early as 6AM. If that's too early for you definitely avoid room Harmony #1 and book one of their other wonderful rooms.All in all we had a lovely stay and would recommend it to anyone! Great location, view, and value!This was a stop on our honeymoon trip, and it was phenomenal! The folks here were more than accommodating and hospitable, and the location is in perfect walking distance to the main sites. We stayed in a suite in the carriage house (behind the main house) and it was breath-taking. The garden courtyard was beautiful. The freshly-made breakfast was delicious. It would be hard to beat this place! We will definitely be going back.My boyfriend and I stayed at Peace and Plenty for two nights. We were in the Serendipity Suite, which is a pet friendly room. The room was quaint and lovely. The room overlooked the beautiful garden area and fountain. The amenities of the room were average, including TV/cable, small iron/board, hair dryer, and travel sized soaps, etc. The bathroom was big and included a hot tub (you want to bring your own bubbles) and you can't use it after 11pm. The bed was comfortable and so was the couch in the small living room area where the TV is located. The only issue we had with the room was that both my boyfriend and myself were very allergic to something in there. Perhaps a cat was in there at some point, even though the owner attested that cats weren't allowed, but that's all we're allergic to. Even our dog was sneezing and had watery eyes all weekend. That was really the reason for 4 stars. I think because it's all carpeted and fairly old, there may still be pet dander or fur buried deep into the fibers. I did find pet hair on the blanket. Thankfully we found some Claritin in a nearby store. Breakfast was served until 10am, which is a bit early to end for us people who take advantage of sleeping in. Also, not much of a variety. You either eat what they're serving, or have cereal. Our first meal was a cheesecake crepe with fruit and blueberry sauce. I am a vegetarian, so I didn't get any sausage links. I did appreciate that they took that into consideration. There was also juice, coffee and an array of hot tea to choose from. The house itself was lovely. We did not go upstairs to check out the rest of it, but I'm sure it was nice. The dining area was large and had various neatly decorated tables. The parlor was my favorite area. Each evening, cake, sherry, and port was set out for people to enjoy. It was a great place to chit chat with other guests. The cakes were store bought, but displayed nicely. The sherry was tasty and we enjoyed having it while classical music played in the background. Also, complimentary drinks were provided throughout the day and night including water, sodas, beer, and wine. Overall, our stay was good. Glenna, the owner, was nice and helpful. She answered all of my questions quickly and accurately. I definitely recommend this B&amp;B to anyone wanting an affordable and comfortable place to stay. The house is only a couple of blocks away from the main area in historic St. Augustine, which made it easy to come back and forth.We stayed at the Peace &amp; Plenty over Christmas weekend.  We arrived on Saturday and left on Christmas Day.  We were greeted warmly by Glenna who was an amazing hostess.  She was a great source of information about the town, places to eat, things to see, and details about some of the towns history. You could ask her anything and she probably knew the answer.  The house was a charming historic home and had a cozy holiday feel to it as it was wonderfully decorated for Christmas.  This made our Christmas just right and exactly what we wanted.  We really got lucky that we were on the best decorated street in town.  So much so that the Holiday Trolleys pass the house every day.  We stayed in room #3. Our room was very comfortable and the king bed was extremely comfortable.  We stayed in the main house and I felt right at home.  We really enjoyed the complimentary wine and treats offered every night as well.  The breakfast changed each day and the menu was displayed at the front door each night so you knew what to expect the next morning. Everything we had was wonderful. Next time we are in St. Augustine we will definitely return to the Peace &amp; Plenty B&amp;B.  Thank you for making our holiday so special!My husband and I wanted to get away for a weekend after the start of the new year. We felt so, so fortunate that we found availability at such short notice. We stayed a Thursday and Friday night at the Peace &amp; Plenty Inn and could not have had a lovelier time. We were greeted by Glenna who took very good care of accommodating us. She showed us around the inn and took us to our room, which was waiting for us with two (Hershey) kisses! She was extremely helpful in explaining as the error, as we really hadn't done our research. She provided us with a tourist map which turned out to be a life saver and also gave us coupons. She recommended us trying the Ice Plant for dinner one night, and that ended up being a highlight of our trip. We definitely would not have known about it without her. The house itself was perfect. We stayed in the Serendipity #2 room. It was clean and well decorated.  My husband kept walking around saying ""this is so fancy!' In fact, my husband asked Glenna right away if she happened to have availability for an extra night (unfortunately she did not). We couldn't get over the fact that we were in a house. We were never disturbed by the other house guests and didn't even know they were there (except at breakfast of course).The breakfast we had each morning was meticulously prepared and so delicious. The first morning we had strawberry waffles and the second morning we had quiche that was to die for. Whoever is doing the cooking is doing a great job! Each night there was port, sherry, and cake served in the sitting room which was really nice. Unlimited beer/wine/soda is always a big plus, too. The location of P&amp;P is ideal. It's within walking distance of just about everything. You only have to drive if you want to go over the bridge (such as to the lighthouse or alligator farm). While staying at P&amp;P we never moved our car once! We saved going to the Lighthouse til our day of checkout. I only have two small complaints (and they clearly didn't take away from my rating). First, the beer/wine/soda is kept in a small refrigerator downstairs. The fridge wasn't very cold at all. We would grab a can of whatever and stick it on ice in our room for awhile before drinking it.  Second, the shower in the room (we stayed in Serendipity #2) was laughably small. It was smaller than a cruise ship shower! You couldn't  even bend over - in fact, I don't think all people could even fit inside. This might bother some people. We didn't really care because of the fact that there is a giant jacuzzi tub in the bathroom to make up for the small shower and that was very nice.Great place to stay in St. Augustine.  We stayed in the Nirvana(I think that's what it's called!) suite.  The bathroom is totally updated with an amazing shower with rock wall.  There is an outside seating area with a small fire pit and chandelier.  There is a cute cat that stays outside named Starsky.  There is complimentary beer and wine and great breakfast. The inn keeper is really nice and she gave us a coupon book and tips on where to eat.  My husband and I can't wait to go back.We have stayed at seven other bnbs in St Augustine... this will be our top choice of return picks!  Location is just as good as any others, but quieter than on A1A.  A five min walk to historic area at the most, but the decor, finishing touches and amenities put this at the top. Although there were three small negatives, we would not call them downfalls or anything worth passing this by.  There was construction next door and at the carriage house during our stay which took over parts of the garden area but it was done with by evening...still a heads up would've been nice since those rooms were still ones we had considered and were available.  The hostess was nice and very helpful but there was some warmth lacking for some reason.  Last of all, we would have liked to hear what was being served for breakfast before it was out in front of us, which the other guests benefited from...only because of dislikes vs allergies....of course we could've asked after the fact for no apricot/ sauce but hated to be a pain.  Now, back to THE reasons to stay here... location of course is very good, price is very competitive and actually a benefit to consider, ambience is lovely...all the perfect touches and then some, they know what they are doing he like a well piled machine.  The amenities of help yourself to the soda, water, beer, wine, ice, etc anytime is such a pleasure.  The pre dinner or post dinner dessert time is long lasting and delightful,  but it would be nice if the hostess socialized if no other guests partake at least when it starts like other bnbs.  The rooms were luxurious.... quaint, comfy, nice amenities, beautiful view if you get a balcony, great beds and fireplaces.All in all, we would pick this again over Casablanca, City House, St francis, Powder House, etc. Its a winner without question.  Enjoy!! p.s. Dinner at Collage was the very best in st Augustine, bar none!Peace &amp; Plenty is a solid 4 star Bed and Breakfast. It is one of the cheapest B&amp;Bs in the area, and you get most of the perks of the other places. Here's the breakdown.ProsCost: We paid $89 plus tax off season for a nice room with a full kitchen. Now most people don't want to cook on vacation, but I love cooking, so to have a kitchen I could make a small meal at 2 am was fantastic. But even the other rooms were not much more if you don't want to see a stove during your romantic get-away. Comfort: The bed was nice. The room was pleasant. The bathroom was cozy. There was a little courtyard that was somewhat enjoyable. Location: The house is two blocks from the Lightner Museum and four blocks from the river. ConsService: The owner is pretty stuffy and definitely not warm. She runs things more like a hotel than a B&amp;B. I am not saying she was mean, but don't expect a hug when you walk in the door. Food/Drinks: There is free wine and beer available in the main house all day, but it is really low quality. There is evening snacks with port and scotch, but also the drinks were not good quality and the treats were ok. The french toast for breakfast was very good, but somewhat small portions, and the accompanying sausage was Jimmy Dean-like frozen sausage. Again, nothing was bad, but just not stellar. But for the cost, it was to be expected.Ants: There were a few carpenter ants that were on the wall in the bathroom next to the tub. This is an old house, like everything in St. Augustine, so it is no surprise. But still, I would have preferred no ants. Overall, this place is a great deal. If you are comparing staying here to staying at the Hilton for the same price, I would take this place in a heart beat. But if you are looking for an uber-romantic stay in tranquil St. A, then there are better (though more expensive) B&amp;B options in the area.Hands down the best B&amp;B to stay in St Augustine. Very close walk to historic square, Lightner Museum, Flagler College, shops and restaurants- plus free parking. Furnishings were elegant, cozy atmosphere, very warm and kind innkeeper who answered all of our questions and made some great recommendations for local restaurants and sights. Plus the room prices are very competitive- you get a lot for your money here. Complementary beer, wine, sodas, coffee, tea and snacks in the parlor- and a tasty breakfast in the morning which we had delivered to our room. Jacuzzi tub was quite nice and we had a great view from the balcony. A real gem for romantic getaways. We will definitely be back!My boyfriend and I decided to stay at our first bed and breakfast for Valentine's day this year and oh boy did we make a good decision. After hours of researching we landed on the Peace and Plenty Inn. We were greeted by our hostess who was very informative and knew just about anything you wanted to know about St. Augustine. She gave us a tour of the Inn and then showed us to our room, which was lovely. We even had our own private balcony and Jacuzzi. She gave us maps of the area and recommended places for us to have a romantic dinner. She then left us to get settled and we relaxed on our bed for a little before sightseeing. It was so big and soft, we wanted to take it home with us. The bed was not complimentary but there were complimentary drinks such as beer, wine, soda, water, coffee, tea, as well as after dinner desserts and sherry and port. We were the first ones to break into the desserts and it was all done with so much love and care. Also while we were snacking our hostess gave us a Chocolate Heart as a gift and said ""Happy Thanksgiving"". It was so funny, such an odd mistake to make but we all had a good laugh over it. After the laughing and during the snacking I was able to look at all of the records of the house. A thumping good read if I do say so myself. Really neat to stay in such an old place. And our B&amp;B was not advertised as ""Haunted"" as many are but it sure looked it. It looked like one of those places you see on the ghost TV shows, but I didn't want to know until we were leaving because if it was I didn't want to see something everyone else said they have seen. I wanted to see it on my own.Our room came with everything we could have needed from soap to bath-robes. There is a great view from the balcony. The decor was very nice, I got a chance to glance into other rooms at the end of our stay and it seems as though they all had different themes. There was a marching band suit outside of our door and it freaked me out a couple of times but I got used to him. Also some dolls I wasn't really a fan of but it was nothing personal, I just don't care for dolls.The next morning we had breakfast in the dining room, we were treated to a variety of breakfast foods like cereal and fruit, but the real treat was the Waffles! We had to wait for a little bit because I'm pretty sure there were only two people back there tending to everything. But it was so worth the wait. It was like they found a way to batter and deep fry butter. So crunchy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. It was perfect. I wish I could have them for breakfast every morning. Also I loved the back round music and the art on the walls. Very classy. Another great thing about B&amp;Bs is that the majority of the patrons are older. So even though we are in our early 20's it's nice that everyone else is 60+ because that way you don't have to worry about loud drunkenness while you're trying to relax, which I'm sure at first they were concerned about us being that way but we ended up making quite a few friends from this trip. So the answer to the big question, is the Peace and Plenty Inn haunted? Yes! But just in one room. Which room? Well that's for me to know and for you to find out. But don't worry. She's very nice. :)I love this b and b. Breakfast is great. Close to everything. Free alcohol is always a plus. Wife is dairy free and they accomodated her with no issues all week. Cat on site, but not inside. His name is starsky. Grouds are nice. Room was clean.For the price you cannot beat this B&amp;B. Great location, walking distance to almost everything. The room was nice and room service cleaned everyday. The breakfast was good, my wife says great. The fridge was stocked with soda and other drinks for free. Cake and drinks in the evening, we don't drink, but the cake was good. For around 100$ during the weekdays you can't go wrong...we stayed in the carriage house and liked the extra privacy..My wife and I stayed here.I think I liked it more than she did. We had a nice room, the bed was comfortable, and while the appointments were old / antique, that goes with the whole B&amp;B atmosphere. It is practically in the downtown square of St Augustine, so all of that stuff is easily walkable. The B&amp;B has free parking. The breakfast was quite good.This was the first bed and breakfast I have ever been to. It was so neat not having the typical hotel experience in this great city. The Inn is very well kept and during Christmas it is well decorated inside and out. They offer breakfast in the morning which can also be delivered right to your door so you can have breakfast in bed. I would recommend staying out in the carriage house on the second floor in Rhapsody Suite #6. It is absolutely amazing. I will definitely be back in the future. The staff is caring and willing to accommodate any request, such as birthday cakes, champagne, wine, dinner reservations, tours, ect..

http://www.yelp.com/biz/jaybirds-inn-st-augustine-3,Jaybird's Inn,3.5,$$,37,"I enjoyed my stay at the Jaybird's Inn. I got the recommendation from Yelpers, and I made my reservation on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a>. They attempted to call a few days before to confirm my reservation, but they didn't leave a message. I called them back (just in case), and everything was fine. I was only there in the evening to sleep, so I can't comment on anything but that.LOCATION: It's located 1.7 miles from the heart of St. Augustine's historic district (I.e. Flagler College). It wasn't hard to get there, and I Ubered most of the time. They said it was okay for me to leave my car there. It's located near some train tracks, so as some Yelpers said, you'll hear the horn until around 11 PM and beginning at 7 AM. I'm not a late sleeper, so that didn't bother me. If it does, bring some ear plugs. Also, this is not too far from a main road, so you will hear some traffic at night. No big deal to me.THE ROOM: I stayed in a room across from the restaurant. They were nice and renovated. My room was a bit warm/humid, but I ended up turning on the AC and that solved the problem. The rooms were clean, and the beds were very comfortable. For the price, you're getting a great value. I didn't have any issues with getting hot water within 15 seconds. They have a lot of amenities, such as a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. SERVICE: The front desk was very helpful. Everyone was nice.There's breakfast included. I was able to watch Netflix on the wifi, just make sure you are connected to the wifi that has a stronger connection to where you're located. I'd probably stay here again.I stayed here with my GF when we were in St Augustine visiting her family.  The inn was nice with a very helpful staff.  The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable.  I don't usually like staying in motels in the middle of a bustling city, but this place was okay.  The decor in the rooms was updated, nice tile floors made the room feel cozy.  The lighting system was well done, with backlit wall features and a good color palette.The motel is in the on the corner of two busy streets, so you will hear road noise all night.  A train track is also very close, so at least twice we are awoken to a loud rumbling train speeding theough the night.  The continental breakfast is mostly self-serve waffles and yogurt.  Not bad, but nothing special.We enjoyed our time here and the staff made us feel quite welcome for the three nights we spent with them.TL;DR: Good staff, okay amenities, bad location.Pros:  the staff was very friendly and helped us get to our touristy destinations with much grace.Cons:  the toilet was it bolted to the ground; it's good that neither of us got drunk, we may have broken the toilet trying to take a poo.  The bed had no headboard and was not bolted to the wall; every morning we woke up about a foot from the wall with our pillows on the floor.  All the pillows in the hotel were so tiny that we ended up buying some at Walmart.Super cons: finally, the art.  These hideous vulture pictures hung on the wall and watched our every move.  We had to cover one of them with a Walmart bag to keep our sanity.Hotel was really nice the parking is really cramped but the rooms a re well worth it rooms are clean and appear to be recently remodeled and the hotel was decently quiet it is close to the local attractions and it is decently pricedThe stay I had at the Jaybird's Inn was pretty mediocre until I had a problem. The staff at Jaybird's Inn is getting the 1 out of 5 stars here. Their ability to deal with a problem is absolutely horrible. The rooms looks fine but the walls are paper thin so if you plan on watching TV, you had better turn it off before 9pm or the noise complaints start coming your way. I could only recommend this hotel to someone staying by themselves with the intention to go to bed as the sun goes down.St. Augustine is a fun place with lots to do, but please don't waste your time at this hotel if you want to have a great time.Cannot say enough good things about this place.  Wonderful staff; wonderful rooms and a wonderful time.  We have returned three times and all three times we were impressed.  The restaurant there is wonderful too.Any time I can enjoy a sound sleep while away from home goes a long way towards making me think favorably of the place where I am staying. And a good night's sleep is exactly what I enjoyed here.Jaybird's Inn is a moderately priced, conveniently located and all-around solid place to stay while in the St. Augustine area. Perched along the busy multi-lane Ponce de Leon Blvd., it might be wise to request a room far away from the heavy traffic. It helped alleviate some of the sound from the surroundings. A nice neighborhood and another commercial strip is just behind this inn so there are lovely places to stroll and run nearby. Nice not to be locked and blocked in by a network of high speed highways.The inn has bikes or you can bring your own which might be the best way to really get around this somewhat compact city. I saw a good number of folks leisurely cycling which suggests the area may be more bike-friendly then most.I liked the overall look of the room which featured flooring rather than carpeting, lots of lights, a good size desk with comfortable chairs, a coffee maker, microwave and mini-frig, spacious shower and a stylish color scheme. The room charge includes a continental breakfast which was basic but quite adequate with baked goods, yogurt, make-your-own waffles, cereal, oatmeal, coffee and juice. There is a lovely pool area and even a fitness room with some weights, bands, stability balls etc. on site. This would seem like a great place for people who don't need room service or a lot of luxury but want a comfortable, contemporary place to stay that can be the perfect hub for a day of sightseeing, outlet shopping and taking day trips to the beach.Big plus and points for the quantity and quality of the bathroom towels that were thick and plentiful.From the Outside this place looks ehhh and the parking is tight. But on the inside this is a Fantastic Hotel. Clean Rooms, Quiet, and affordable. Its about 2 or 3 Miles from the Historic District but extremely easy to Uber or walk from. Would definitely  stay here again.Don't let the motor court exterior fool you.  This IS A MODERN boutique Inn.  Fully updated, totally clean, very comfortable with lots of space in the King rooms.  Upgraded beds and pillows!  Activity center is sparse, outdated and in almost fair condition.  If you are here to workout, then consider run on beach or state park trails.    Friendly helpful staff from check in to dinner.  Food is very good, oversized portions, reasonably priced and quick in/out.  Good lication, quiet rooms aside from a once daily train whistke.  Definitely recommendWe got this room through a Priceline Express Deal.  They run a great motel.  It is a motel, so there is some road noise, but it wasn't bad.  The breakfast was excellent and the staff was extremely helpful.  The room was clean and well furnished.  The water was a little slow getting hot- but if that's the worst thing you have to say about a motel, you're doing pretty good!  We had a great time in St. Augustine.What a great find!! We stayed here for a wedding and were very, pleasantly surprised!! Our room had ample parking spots available directly in front of it. The room was very spacious and updated. Most importantly, it was clean &amp; fresh!! We had a great stay.  The staff was very friendly and polite.Excellent place to stay.  Just short of 2 miles from Historic District,  The room was immaculate ~ very clean and comfortable.  Shower was a bit of an issue as water got all over floor.  Need to adjust that and was advised management was aware of issue.  I would also like to see a curtain or some kind of door at the bathroom vanity to provide more privacy.  With a family of 3 or more staying in a room, there was really no where to comfortably dress/bathroom very small.  Wifi is a little weak.Other than that, we were very pleased with the motel and the staff was exceptionally helpful and friendly.We were advised the motel is expanding as well.I would stay at Jaybird's Inn again ... Exceptional value for the money.I love jay birds I'm only sad that they no longer allow animals due to health compliance - the atmosphere outside was supposed to dog friendly. I sincerely hope they change that because really was a plus!Exactly what we were looking for. I was never a fan of exterior door hotels but would definitely do this place again. Recently renovated and well worth the $80.I was shocked at this place.  Room was like new renivated. Restaurant was great. I will return.Pros: redone not so long ago looks neat inside,Can bike to everything in st Augustine.Breakfast was nice.Pool is. Nice Restaurant was nice next door.Cons: bathroom or AC kept making a loud noise every 5 mins.Near train heard a loud horn through the night.Shower leaked all over place they need a bigger certain.If you're looking for a clean comfortable place for a couple of nights, stay here! It was well kept and recently renovated. The only cons were the shower curtain was a little too short and water came out all over the floor and the train noise which most people have mentioned. We didn't try the continental breakfast but jaybirds restaurant right across the way has awesome service and food! Upon check in at the inn they give you 10 dollars off your Jaybirds breakfast for every day you're booked which was an unexpected treat!There aren't many absolutes in this world. Most of life is a balance of art and science. But there are a few basics when it comes to lodging. There's cleanliness and comfort, the ability to sleep in peace, and basic services like making the bed and changing the towels. Jaybird's fell apart on two of the three. Here's the story.When we arrived at the Jaybird's we were surprised at a few things. First, they bill themselves as a ""Boutique Hotel"" but are, in fact, a motel. There's nothing ""boutique"" about the Jaybird's that I can tell. You'll also note that, though some booking websites say the motel is in the historic district of St. Augustine, they're a bit more than a mile and a half from the the central square on the larger of the two highways that run through town. It's not really walkable by any normal standard - you have to either bike or drive into town, or take the tourist trolley, which does stop at Jaybird's.Reception was friendly enough, and fairly simple. They do have you sign an agreement not to smoke in the rooms, which is fine - though when we got to our room there was a burn on the bedspread. It was either an iron or a cigar - hard to tell. The room itself, on the other hand, was way less than what we expected. It was clean enough and the bed was okay, but we had the pleasure of some piece of mechanical equipment above our room that let off a loud buzz every 2-3 minutes. The best way to describe the sound is to have you imagine the buzzer at a sporting event or on a game show. Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. all night. We rang the front desk, but there was no answer and it was unlikely that they could do anything about it, so we lived with it. For two nights.And then there's the housekeeping service - or I should say lack of service. After the first night we got up, showered and dried off with the sandpaper towels. As we were ready to leave a young man knocked on the door and asked if we wanted housekeeping. We said that we did, and to give us a minute. We left and assumed, wrongly, that we'd have housekeeping. When we returned at 10pm we found our bed unmade, towels unchanged and everything exactly as it had been left. And the Buzz was still there. I so wish I could post an audio clip of this noise. It's unbelievable. But since the housekeeping staff apparently doesn't visit the room, they probably don't know about the noise.One other note - the wireless network is very slow and wide open. Do not do anything on this network unless your computer is well firewalled and you're using https:// websites. The fact that this place is #8 of all the hotels in St. Augustine is shocking. Either the other hotels really suck, or this place needs a few more reviews.----Postscript: Having read the other reviews after posting my own, I see that there's one other that references the buzzing noise. It's apparently a widespread  issue through the hotel. This is clearly a problem for the Jaybird's. For this reason I strongly suggest steering clear.Second Postscript: On checkout I let the manager on duty know about my complaint. He did confirm that the buzzing noise is a known issue and that there is an A/C setting that sometimes helps to resolve the issue. He credited me $35 (I would rather have had the sleep, but it's a nice gesture). Recommendation to avoid stands, however, until this issue is resolved.Judging from the outside, I was wondering what I got myself into! I was pleasantly surprised when I walked through the door. Clean, modern and spacious. No cheesy carpet, duvet covers or wallpaper here.  It's a few miles from the city center, but only a 5 min drive and they have free bike rentals (4 hours).  Great value for the price.My family and I just came home from a 2 night stay at Jaybird's.  I did have some reservations about staying here because of the mixed reviews, but it definitely exceeded my expectations for a non-chain hotel.  As other Yelpers have shared, the lobby is gorgeous and the rooms nicely decorated and spacious.  The room did feel very clean.  They are all outside entry, which I usually avoid because of paranoia.  The doors need an extra push/pull to be sure they are shut and locked and they do not have chains or those locking brackets that I usually see in hotels.  I never felt unsafe, but I thought it was worth mentioning.  The beds were very comfortable and I had a great night's sleep.  I heard no buzzing (mentioned in another review), but we were on the 2nd floor on the odd side.  I did, however, wake up to the dump truck and train on Monday and Tuesday.  That is no fault of the hotel, but just know that the outside rooms makes outside noises more noticeable.  The Inn is about a mile and a half away from historic downtown, so the free bike rental was an added benefit.  We remembered to bring our daughter's little bike, so we were all able to ride downtown together.  There are other sites very close to the inn that can be walked to easily, such as the Fountain of Youth and the Old Jail, as well as Fort Menendez.  There are Trolley Tours that will pick you up there, too, so there are plenty of options to get around.  Jaybird's is not very close to the beach (about 10-15 minutes by car), so if you're planning on doing a lot of beach going, this probably isn't the place for you.  They do have a pool, which is small but sufficient.  It was very cold, so I don't think they have a heater (unless it just wasn't on).  As mentioned by other yelpers, the breakfast consists of waffles, cereal, oatmeal, fruit, and other standard continental fare.  We appreciated having that meal to start the day so we could start site seeing earlier than if we went to a restaurant for breakfast.  As their motto says, it's for active people.  If you are planning on lounging resort-style in the hotel, I wouldn't recommend Jaybird's, but if you're looking for a good night's sleep in a clean hotel after a day of site-seeing and shopping, this is the perfect place!","You will get your money's worth because there are little things that mean a lot -- and there are also little things that you should be aware of. Jaybirds is considered a ""boutique"" hotel, but that might be because it is not a chain. Beyond the spacious lobby and books and magazines for rent, it's not boutique. The hotel looks more modern on the website than in person.Rooms: It's clear the rooms were updated recently in many ways but more work needs done. Doors are warped, bed frames and headboards make lots of noise and this is a two-story hotel with no elevator. Our A/C blew ice-cold all night, the TVs work, there are plenty of outlets for device charging. And -- not to be overlooked -- our room was very clean. Plenty of towels, nice soap and shampoo. Some rooms have balcony chairs and tables (good for smoking or a nightcap). The King Suites have no views. The windows are high on the wall and are there only for natural light. Otherwise they're bunkers (which isn't all bad).Service: No complaints at all. Everything was prompt from reservation on.Location: It's near a train track. You're going to hear the whistle and train roll through at 7 a.m. It's not ""My Cousin Vinny,"" but you probably won't sleep through it. If you stay at the front of the hotel, you'll get some road noise. Pool: Yeah, well . . . it's located around the backside of the property next to a road. No rooms overlook it. The pool itself is small, has umbrellas for shade and an underneath area for shade. No one would stay here for the pool.Food: Breakfast buffet is less than standard fare (waffles, cereal, muffins, pastries -- no eggs). The restaurant next door is a major plus. It's a classic diner that also does a lot of pizza. Food is good, not great, service is excellent, and there's a full bar.Jaybird's Inn is a small paradise in a sea of shifty looking or overpriced hotels on Ponce De Leon. The rooms are fairly large, very modern, and extremely comfortable. I also really like how the rooms have wood floors which just gives the rooms a styled look, like they really put a lot of effort into making this not be the normal motel you might encounter. The beds are super comfortable, it doesn't feel like a million other people have slept in this bed before you. The breakfast is continental and nothing to write home about but sufficient. There is also the hotel's restaurant right next door that I have yet to try but has great reviews on Yelp.  Overall this place is great and I will absolutely be returning! The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is while there is free wifi here, it's poor and I get a faster connection just leaving it off. Either way, thanks to Jaybird's in for a great stay and a lovely weekend!Fresh, clean and spacious, and newly remodeled with Eco-consciousness in calming colors. Cozy beds and a nice bathroom with a powerful shower. Mini kitchen area with microwave, fridge and coffee pot with Starbucks pods. Some road noise was an issue, but it is a motel, so that is to be expected. Not sure I would stay again as I am a light sleeper.Really enjoyed the free bike rental. Cool lending library and office center in lobby. Breakfast was just ok, mostly bread/cereal, some fruit would be nice: styrofoam is not a good choice for a ""green"" hotel.Cheers-The hotel staff was not only rude, but outright mean. The room smelled musty and the fitness room stinks. The wireless was out. Highly recommend avoiding this place!!Quite unusual nice &amp; modern interior design, very affordable price :)Truly recommended.I see why there are excellent reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor. Great place, clean, friendly, cold, comfy. My daughter and I are driving from Fort Lauderdale to South Carolina and wanted to make a pit stop in St Augustine. We found this inn on trip advisor. Glad we took the chance and booked it. Funny story: when we made the first turn into the parking lot, which we thought was the Jaybird, there was a motel that looked a bit run down and we thought ""oh it can't be as bad as it looks, the reviews were excellent."" We parked and walked around but could not find the office. We then looked across the street and there was the very nice looking Jaybird Inn. Phew.  So glad we pulled into the wrong lot first. We were cracking up and so worried the place was going to be a dump. We drove across the street and told the girl our story. She said it happens to a lot of people and then we were all laughing. The staff here is great!  Close to townI stayed in this hotel three times during biking trips to Saint Augustin. I have been happy with the service and cleanliness of the Hotel, but what has turned me off is that they have shared my cell phone number with marketing companies and now I received unsolicited phone calls to my personal device. When I tried to denied access to myself, they have asked me if I am the person that stayed at Jaybird's Inn on such and such dates and then they go on to offer some special package or prize that I have won. I don't need this kind of aggravation to my personal time and consider this a disruption to my privacy. I will not stay at this hotel again and I am sorry for it. If you do, please be aware of how they handle your personal information.Charming and clean, some tech problems like crappy wifi, and it seemed like the cable would go out every 15 min. The breakfast is coffee, cereal, and self made waffles, these were all good. Beds were very comfortable and the AC didn't smell like musty when turned on, that's a big plus for me. I would stay here again, in fact when in St. Augustine I wouldn't stay anywhere else, affordable, close to everything, and bed bug free ( we looked close with flash lights and magnifying glass)Just OK, nothing special.  Room had a musty odor from the air unit.  Complaint at front desk went unanswered in the four days there.Very clean. Very friendly staff. Lobby has books, coffee, huge tv. Great price. Convenient parking. The restaurant was super close, very friendly staff. We had the lox bagel and we got $10 off from our vouchers. If we are back in the area, this will be where we stop!Walls are very thin and the even numbered rooms have a musty dampness to them. My sister stayed in an odd numbered room (on the opposite side) and it did not have the same issue with smell/dampness. Also loud near the road and had strangely small pillows for a king bed. The price is reasonable, however.We booked this hotel based off a friends recommendation. We were nervous because it seemed like it might be too far away from Old Town. In the end, it didn't matter. The floors was so beautiful, the rooms, blankets, and shower were so clean, and the overall decor was just beautiful. We slept like babies last night, and for $100 I couldn't ask for more out of a hotel! Also, Starbucks for the morning coffee was an extra nice touch! Kudos, Jaybirds Inn!Very cool retro motel that's been redone with all modern amenities. Those who may be dissuaded from staying in an outdoor entrance hotel, fear not. It's away from the downtown scene, so it's quiet at night, unlike staying in a B&amp;B in old town. It's a bit of a walk to the historic center, but certainly doable.Went with the family and we were very happy. Just needed a place to crash one night so we could check out St. Augustine the next day before we continued our road trip. Everything is new and clean. It looks like what it was-- an old motel that's been very well renovated. My kids loved the shower-- it's huge. The price as right and it really was exactly what we needed.Lovely job of upgrading an old motel, rather Euro-style... modern, lots of plugs and USB ports, large accessible walk-in shower, fridge &amp; MW. Free loaner bikes. If you want more than a muffin, pop across to the same-named resto (15% off for guests). Friendly. Location means a bit of road noise and maybe too far to walk to old town for some.I needed a place to stay that was handicap access for my mobility deficit and within a budget. Found it!The Inn is updating rooms and they look very nice. Bed and pillows were really comfortable, they had coffee maker, tea and coffee, and fridge. NiceThe only issue I had was the accessible shower stall did not have a place to put soap/shampoo etc. Accessible showers helps people  like me, who have a difficult time stepping over side of tub and not necessarily have a chair.  The water also got all over the floor despite all efforts to point the shower head different ways and curtain closed.This is the first review I've ever written for yelp, because YES it deserves one! For the price (super reasonable) you get way more than you pay for (around these parts anyways).  I've stayed at five star hotels around the globe, and I'm not above staying in a dump if the price is right, but this place is a win.  The rooms are spacious, super clean, and the floor is tile (not dated), so there is no gross carpet to worry about.  The bathrooms are a little small (walk-in shower good for old folks), but uber clean and stocked with more than enough towels from my son, me, and my hair! They have wifi, a business center, and I plan on renting a couple of bikes (free) from their activity center. The pool, though a little small, has 2 entrances with steps and even has a chair lift for the not so mobile, and it's clean. They also offer a continental breakfast that isn't too shabby, waffles, yogurt, fruit, cereal etc... Other little goodies, they have a book exchange if you run out of things to read while on vacation, they have a wall of books people have left behind for other guests.  You don't even have to leave one or return it.  These business owners took a likely once seedy motel and turned it into a respectable and nice place to stay, they have earned my business and a review!",,,,"['enjoyed', 'jaybird', 'inn',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-hotel-and-suites-st-augustine-hist-district-st-augustine-2,Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites St. Augustine-Hist. District,3.0,$$,34,"We had an awesome time. The staff was friendly and attentive to our every need. The bartender was nice, we enjoyed a full bar. Hot buffet breakfast also good and only $12.99. Rooms are spotless. Definitely returning.I do love Holiday Inns.. I've come to expect nice staff, a clean room, and a nice, comfortable bed.Our room was clean.. but that's just 1 of 3 key ingredients.  Clean room is great though; it looked nice and fresh, and spotless.  The staff here is mediocre. They don't give IHG members water at checkin (the little things do count, you know).  They don't smile.. and they're not always at the front desk.. someone should always be there so people aren't waiting around forming a line. The worst part?  The sheets.. soo bad.  Scratchy as hell.  Seriously, I woke up several times in the night just because of those darned awful sheets.  Those are not normal Holiday Inn sheets.. they can't be.  They're tone-on-tone white striped, with 1 green stitch across the top.. and they feel like sandpaper. I didn't take a photo of the bathroom.. It seemed mid-renovation.  Pretty ugly - Mismatched.. I'm assuming that will be fixed soon because everything else was clearly newly renovated, looks fresh, pretty, and clean.I'm writing this review from my phone using its 4G, as there's no internet at the hotel. There's been no internet in the last 40 hours that I've been here. The front desk constantly say the technician is on the way. I think the technician is driving here from California. The front desk staff are not very nice. They aren't flat out rude, but they make it clear calls about the internet are unwelcome. I give them two stars for two reasons. First the rooms appear recently renovated and second the staff in the restaurant are super nice. I highly recommend staying elsewhere.More like 3.5 stars. This place was undergoing a painting session when we booked this hotel so the room smelled a bit funny. The overall look of this hotel is great. The sheets are nice, has updated furniture, and breakfast was amazing for the price we paid. The bed was not as comfy as I thought it would be - kind of hard and I sort of felt the springs a bit. The pillows weren't that bad, but not the best. There was a fighting session with the toilet because it would not flush and it would take forever to flush. We were afraid it wouldn't flush. These rooms need a big bathroom makeover and the carpet was gross. We wore our shoes in the room. The linens were clean and they give you a wipe to clean off the remote which was a huge plus for me. Paid and extra $10 for 2 people for the breakfast which without question is worth it - bacon, cereal, eggs, etc. I thought our stay was OK. The staff was nice and check in was easy. I would not pay more than $125 a night to stay here though. Pretty close to downtown area. You could walk (long walk) but I wouldn't unless you know for a fact that there's not going to be ANY parking.125 night a year traveler. This hotel is very clean and close to the city. The rooms are clean and the service is excellent. The man at the front desk was very accommodating. I am a spire member with IHG so your accommodations may vary. We had a late flight today and he gave us a later check out with out issue.If you were to come here for any reason come to eat Derricks food I hope the management realizes what they have here. The man is a true chef his food is off the charts Roger the bartender  is a real great one also. But did I mention Derricks foodThis seems to be a running theme in my hotel reviews lately: Cheap, clean and convenient. There is a lot to be said with those three C's though when you are trying to save a bit of cash, but still want a decent place to crash. Looks like this location is doing a bit of renovation, and it was looking pretty good! Even better, there were no loud noises or construction happening while we were there. Which, is was a super short stay, as we were only there for a quick sleep. We were down in St. Aug for the night, for some dinner and drinks, and wanted to be responsible adults, so we booked the room and hailed a cab. As I mentioned, room was clean, bed was comfy and I was a little surprised to see Bath and Body works travel size products in the bathroom. (No weird off brand stuff that leaves your hair feeling like straw!) Yay. I think this room was about $60 a night and is fairly close to downtown. If you are a tourist looking for more of a beachy stay... this won't be your spot, but probably about a 20 min drive to the beaches. But downtown is super cool, and only a few minutes away. (I wouldn't recommend walking though.)Absolutely awful experience. Had to book here last minute b/c there was nothing left available in St. Augustine. Now I know why! There is not enough parking to accommodate all the guest rooms. I saw black fungus around the sides of the pool. And then my wife found a mushroom growing out of the carpet in our room!This hotel is definitely not to the quality we normally find in a HI property. It is definitely not in the historic district. We checked in at 8:30 ready for a quick swim only to learn that the pool was ""closed for maintenance"". We asked how late breakfast was served and were told 11:00 AM. We slept in and were at breakfast at 10:30 to be told that they were no longer serving (other patrons were still eating). Never ceases to amaze me when a hotel spends the money on new carpet and paint and furniture but doesn't bother to replace the bathroom floor. Grout is filthy and TP dispenser is covered in rust. My advice.... Skip St. Augustine and go to Savannah. HI Historic downtown is fabulous in Savannah!I stay here frequently for work and all of the room doors seem to be installed upside down, as each of the handles to the 10+ rooms I've reserved could only be opened by:-tactical training -psychic powers -HoudiniHowever, the cleanliness of the place and the friendless of the staff (thanks Qabid) more than make up for the nightly tug-o-war I have with the door to my room!Their wifi only works in 20 second spurts (then out for 10 minutes), I've been using my ATT WiFi this whole time (3 days straight). There's other reviews about this so they've obviously not taken any action to resolve it (not fix it, resolve it). There are tiny ant-like bugs everywhere. You can tell there's fresh paint on top of nasty doors and walls. The breakfast is not free (this is the only holiday Inn that I've been to still doing this). You can hear people talking in the hallways like their standing at the foot of your bed, crazy loud...maybe the doors don't close properly since being painted over? The comment about the toilets not ""flushing"" is true, it just sort of swirls around (hope you're not planning a romantic trip). The location is at the very edge of where you'd want to walk from, about 1.2 miles to the edge of the downtown area (don't walk on ponce). In the dark, it looks like a shady area with homeless people popping out of the dark spots. Worst, we booked a king room and they lied telling us we didn't, just to put us in a double queen (they over booked and didn't want to apologize), I have an online booking receipt that says king. The rate was high for comparable holiday inns I've stayed at, but oddly good for this area....which is overpriced compared to spots like even charleston or savannah... Im always trying to convince my wife that holiday inns are great value, but this stay set my argument back a lot. Along with the nasty food (everywhere, no matter the price, it was nasty) this whole trip gets two stars. Sad because there's some nice history here to see. Glad it was only a weekend trip and not longer.I stay at Hampton s all up and down the east Coast ... NEVER NEVER have I been in a room where another bed was put in the room I assume for more money.. You just about had to crawl over the bed to get to another one. ( See pictures) so the story is..A few nights ago I stopped at the Hampton Inn on Ponce de Leon in St Augustine. I asked the rate and because, the rate was reasonable I said great 2 nights please . Later that night I checked my bank account and I saw that I was charged much more than was stated lets say about $120.00 dollars more per night. I called the front desk placed the phone in the room on speaker so that my wife could hear . The front desk Associate said  "" I have no problem correcting that"" . The next morning I checked the charges again and nothing had changed . I walked down to the front desk and spoke with a Associate that said "" he was not working and he would"" check on that"" later that day I stopped by the desk and was told that he ""spoke with everyone concerned and they knew nothing about that rate""  Not to mention this but the room was so small that you had the crawl over the bed to get to the other side of the room. I have stayed at Hamptons for years near have I seen a room like this. So far I am being cheated out of over $100.00 a night and had a cracker box room. If they are doing this to me they have /will do it to other Guests.?STAY AWAYI wish I had taken photos because this hotel was recently renovated/remodeled within the past year or so. Friendly staff, nice sized rooms and great rates all close (1mile) to the attractions. It's a bit farther than other hotels so keep that in mind if  you plan to walk.Picked this hotel because of its proximity to the touristy part of St. Augustine. We weren't more than 5-10 minutes from anything we wanted to see. They also offer a government/law enforcement discount which includes a daily pass to the hotel's buffet. The only reason I'm not giving this hotel 5 stars is because our AC  wasn't working correctly. We walked in the room and it felt like it was at least 75 degrees, but the thermostat said 65. (It was set at that and would not go lower.) We closed our blinds to cool off the room, but it wouldn't get cold until the night time.The TV's are nice with a good selection of channels, including HBO.I'm not sure if this is the case in every room, but our shower/water faucets were set opposite (cold was hot and hot was cold). My husband burned his mouth on the water because we weren't aware of that.The buffet was decent, but I don't think I would have paid $12 for it. The waitress at the buffet was nice and attentive. Perfect for those people wanting to explore and not spend much time in the hotel room.Overall a nice hotel. I've noticed some insects roaming around, some not so small, which isn't good to see. The biggest thing that I can not stand about this hotel is the absolutely terrible internet speeds. Both wireless and wired connections are almost unusable because they are so slow. They advertise ""high speed"" internet but I can load pages on my cell phone twice as fast without wifi(which doesn't even work on my iPhone, actually makes it slower).The marketing of this Holiday Inn says Historic District, but that is pushing it at best. It is nit walking distance to the Spanish Quarter, so prepare to battle &amp; pay for parking each time you go to the main attraction area. The staff were friendly, but this location needs major work to update its rooms and the basic functionality of the amenities.The hallways smelled of smoke and the breakfast was, well, a hotel breakfast. Kids under 13 eat free, which is nice for families with multiple children. The beds were comfortable and the towels were nice and thick.The wall-mounted hairdryer overheated after ~3 mins of use and the front desk does keep extras for back-up; my hair was awesome for dinner out :/!! Maintenance came by and said they could not do anything because they have a full house. The lights built into the headboard did not work, which is a minor annoyance. The pool was under-filled and probably too warm because of a combination of FL heat and too little water. The ice machine was also constantly empty or not producing ice on the first floor. We reserved a suite because we have four kids. It sleeps six, but when we pulled out the hide-a-bed couch it was broken and ridiculously un-sleepable -- even for a small child. My daughter slept on it in the couch position; luckily we did not have our fourth child with us. For the price, more than $200/per night, I expect a higher level of accommodation from Holiday Inn.I can't  say enough  good things  about  this  hotel. From the  moment  I walked  through  the  doors  and saw the  beautiful  lobby, to the  second great  impression  by George, who is the Manager and checked  us in himself,  set us up  with beautiful  rooms, and proceeded to offer  a  smile and a  hello whenever  we ran into him. The fruit  infused  water was a  very nice touch, the buffet  breakfast  and staff were perfect. There is  not one thing  I can think  of  to improve.  This is by far the best  Holiday  Inn I've ever  seen.  I would  absolutely  return! But most especially, thank you  George.  :-)I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The staff were warm and accommodating (yay for checking in early), the interior was fresh and clean (newly remodeled), the available Wi-Fi was good, and this hotel was within walking distance of everything we wanted to see. I would definitely stay here again on a future trip to St. Augustine.The cinnamon-apple air freshener in the rooms was overpowering. We were allowed to move to a different room but it was just as bad. Otherwise clean &amp; good location. But seriously the air freshener was THAT bad....I've stayed here twice, both times with our two small dogs. It's not a super fancy place but the location is good (within walking distance of the historic district - like 0.5 a mile away), the price is ideal and the staff bend over backward for you. And if you have pets it's ideal (nice big grassy area next to the property). They also have free breakfast and computers you can use. Love it!","Unlike the other reviewers we thought the hotel was clean and well maintained. Its centrally located to downtown, Flagler College and the historical attractions. Much to our surprise, the breakfast buffet was good. The food was well seasoned and there was a good variety of options. The ""concierge"" was an uninformed salesperson, she provided no assistance to us. We gained much more information from the front desk agents who were very knowledgeable about the city and its attractions.Not what we expected from a Holiday Inn. A huge mistake on my part doing a on line booking. Pictures are deceiving and the room is Dirty from the carpet to the bed cloths. Even several pieces of the furniture is dirty, surely won't walk bare footed on the carpet. The hall carpet is clean and looks great and the entrance is nice but the room is a dump. The broom closet style room is small enough that one would think it would be easy to keep clean. My first experience was a snobbish one from the desk clerk and the lemon juice that was available was a jar of warm water and a few sliced lemons tossed in for color. First sip went to the trash, that was alone an insult. Pictures show a nice front of the Hotel in actual reality there is an auto repair facing directly in front of the hotel on Ponce De Leon Blvd. The Hotel is directly behind the repair shop like an alley cat hidden from sight except a huge sign that says Holiday Inn and Suites. These pictures on their site is not showing this in the photos. There is a Days Inn next to it has a corner lot with a Denny's  included. Well we are stuck here for four nights and am not a happy camper. This Holiday Inn is not a three star Hotel I would not have given it a one but that was the only choice. Last time I shall stay in any Holiday Inn anywhere, over rated and over priced.This hotel was about a mile away from the downtown area of St Augustine where we really wanted to stay, but it was priced so low that we couldn't make the argument to spend $100 more a night to save ourselves a little walk.  The hotel is gorgeous and the room was very comfortable and nicely equipped with coffee-maker and mini-fridge.  Convenient parking and friendly staff.Friendly staff, good location.Beds were hard and the noise from the next room through the connecting door of a couple in a domestic disupute as well as one of them sobbing all night long made our stay there less than enjoyable.It's on a busy road and not close to the main attractions. It's a long walk to anything worth seeing. My customer experience was an all time low. There are many other quality choices for the money.A fine hotel if you're spending a night in St. Augustine.  Standard rooms, staff was helpful when I needed them, but the location is slightly far away from the fun stuff in St. Augustine (or what I perceived to be fun.  I was only there for a night!).This hotel was nice the room was comfortable.  We got the king jacuzzi tub room, the bed was comfortable and the tub was also great.  The room was clean also.  The tv did Stop working but we didn't really need it.  The staff was very nice from check in to check out.  We needed toothpaste and they gave us a travel sized tooth paste for free.  It is decently close to the historic district, the website made it seem like it was my much closer.  I would come back here If i needed but I would try to look for something more walking distance.Good location, decent rooms. The breakfast buffet was pretty good, but not free. We didn't have any problem with the internet connection.This is your standard Holiday Inn property.  Nothing special or out of the ordinary.  You would want to stay here for the great location.  It is within a 15 minute walk to the historic area of St. Augustine.  The staff was nice and no problems staying here. Some people may prefer a location a little bit closer to the action in the historic district.  But if you don't mind walking and the price is right, this is a great property.3 1/2 stars.  This hotel is in a good location.  It was a short drive to the area with all the cute restaurants and bars.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, which is the most important thing to me when staying at a hotel.  I would stay here again.Too many (loud young) school groups and internet connection just sucks.Clean rooms, great location, nothing special but hey, it's a Holiday Inn.Room was clean and smelled good. Bed was probably the most uncomfortable I have not slept in for a while! Staff were friendly, breakfast was excellent and the location was good. It was a little far away to walk to the attractions but there was a free taxi (tips only) which we used many times. The 'concierge' is a sales rep for RCI - don't get taken in. Overall the hotel was good and not overpriced.I'd agree with 3-1/2.  Very pleasant personnel, perfectly nice  room, good experience.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/howard-johnson-inn-historic-st-augustine-saint-augustine,Howard Johnson Inn - Historic St Augustine,2.5,$,18,"Okay look. Let's be honest here. This hotel isn't pristine by any means but for theLocation and price it's perfect. The rooms are very clean and extremely spacious. Yes there is rust in the shower.  Yes maybe the hallways are rundown. We have stayed here a half a dozen times and everything is always clean and fresh. The staff is wonderful. The continental breakfast is lovely. The location is awesome. Stay here every time we come to town.If they spent as much time on their rooms as they spent on the front gardens this would be a great place to stay. If, but they don't. The rooms are dingy. The bed was uncomfortable. The bathroom faucets,  tub and sink were about coming off the wall. There is no door between the tub, toilet room and sink room. Tile is grungy throughout. This place is in serious need of a makeover. We stayed here for our wedding at the Fountain of Youth two years ago and it wasn't great then. We stayed again for sentimental reasons on 5/18 &amp;  5/19. They started working on the roof at 8 AM on Tuesday! This could be a great place, could be, is not. Needless to say we will not be back.Location wasn't in the heart of downtown but within walking distance of the Fountain of Youth. Both trolley companies (on/off tours) stop at hotel because of a tourist attraction on the hotel grounds. We got a room with 2 double beds. One was squeaky and one was fine. Found dead bug near A/C and a daddy long leg spider in the bathroom. Common I guess. Room was clean and yes it's old but for the price...very reasonable. Closest ice machine broken but one near lobby worked. Didn't try the pool. Continental breakfast was meh with yogurt, cereal and fresh fruit. Coffee was so bad we had to go elsewhere. I liked the orange and apple juice best. They have ice water 24/7 seasoned with orange slices served in 6 ounce plastic to go cups. Housekeeping always happy to provide extra towels or soap. Didn't watch much flat screen tv but did use the wifi.  Had to login daily though.This hotel is old, old. This is the historic HJ near downtown, not the other one closer to I95.  Rooms have not been renovated probably in 20 years, no kidding. Bed was clean, pillows lumpy foam rubber.  Bath tub was stained gray from dirt in the room.  Took a shower, walked across the carpet and feet felt dirty.  I wiped them off and showed my husband.  Told him not to walk on the carpet or set anything on the floor.  CARPETS ARE FILTHY.  The shower curtain must have been hung by a 10 year old.  It doesn't even close on either side because the bar is on crooked.  No where in the bathroom to put toiletries as there is only a small sink with no counter space.  Towels are hard and scratchy and the size of a small workout towel.  But, it is close to the action and downtown.  They got you as far as location.  But, I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends or family, period. Complimentary breakfast is minimal.  Go out for breakfast if you want to eat well. The only cool thing about this location is the 600 year old tree on the property.First off, I would like to say that it was nice we were able to find a hotel on such short notice on a Friday evening. However, it was NOT worth almost $80.To begin with, the room was decent enough. Two beds, and it smelled of bleach which let me know it was clean. What I did not like, was the hair I found in the thicker comforter. EW.The most awful part was the bathroom. A broom closet was bigger than this thing. Being pregnant, I could barely get in there to sit down and every time I tried to stand, I would hit my stomach on the sink, which was LITERALLY six inches away. If that wasn't bad enough, there were no floor mats, or warning signs to let guests know that the floors get EXTREMELY slippery when wet with steam from taking a shower.Because of this, my husband took a shower, and ended up slipping, and because the bathroom was SO SMALL, he fell on his back on the step leading into the shower and hit the wall. The bathroom was LITERALLY 3.5 feet wide and hard to maneuver in. His back is completely bruised and cut up from falling and he was barely able to walk the rest of the day OR day after!!! I thank GOD that he took his shower first, because if I would have had the same luck and fallen, I could have lost my unborn child!When we went to management about this the next morning, she was barely apologetic and didn't even offer to comp the room. She just tossed us an incident report and gave us the hotel business card, instead of maybe putting down the hotel information. I was APPALLED that she didn't comp the room or even give us a bit of a discount after what happened to my husband and how he was obviously hurt(he could barely walk due to being in so much pain!). We will NEVER go back to this establishment EVER. I am tempted to file a lawsuit, but the problem is, I'm more worried about it happening to other people than actually suing. Like I said, what if it had been me, or even an elderly couple and one ended up with a broken hip or dead? Or what if my husband had cracked his head on that step and not hit his back??On top of it all, the ""continental breakfast"" was just stale cereal and stale bagels with crappy orange juice and metal tasting hot chocolate.NOT $80 worth and NOT EVER worth a second chance! And the absolute WORST customer service!Well, you are located in a great spot and right next to the country's oldest tree. Ripleys Believe it or Not is a short walk and all of this town's best eateries are not a far walk at all. We were greeted with respect and given a quick summary of the hotel. Roughly 30 minutes after we checked in, the front office called us in the room to see how we were making out. They informed us of all the coupons in the lobby we could use during our stay in st augustine.  Talk about great service!The room we stayed in was the one king bed, but might upgrade to something fancier next year. The bed is soft and, the room seems clean. Amenities in the room include free WIFI, refrigerator, microwave. One issue was that many of the outlets did not work in the room to charge your cell phone. There is also a nice swimming pool, laundromat, continental breakfast and coffee provided 24/7. For the price, you can't beat it! The room could use a few upgrades. Not the prettiest bathroom, with minor rust, chipped mirrors, tiles dirty. I'm still glad I lucked out in choosing this hotel and would strongly recommend it to anyone who stays in St. Augustine, not concerned with staying in a high end room.This place is a complete and utter crap hole... I didn't make reservations for this place and I would not recommend it to anyone. the toilet seat in my room must be at least 40 years old. The time has not been cleaned out since the previous occupants and they have the nerve to charge over $90 a night. ... I have paid a lot less for nicer accommodations. Looks nice from the outside but leads me back to the old theory of not judging a book by its coverAfter trying to get a room at a less than honest hotelier in the area (read: ECONOMY INN) we drove up here at 2:45am just looking for a place to stay one night since our reservation to Casa Monica was for the next day and we got here a day early. They gave us a great deal that included breakfast. OK so breakfast is only cereal, bagels and some interesting looking oranges, but it tides you over until lunch. It is within walking distance of the Fountain of Youth, and has free parking, a pool and is clean albeit not updated. The one con is that housekeeping walked in without knocking first as we were all trying to get ready. OOOOPS!-Safe.-Clean-Modestly priced; -ADA bathroom available.-Easy to find; on trolley route.Safe.Parking just outside our door.  Well lit.  Enough folks walking around to feel safe.Clean.Sheets were clean and fresh.  Plenty of pillows.  The towels clean but well worn but not yet frayed.  Beds firm but not hard; slept well.  No smoke fumes apparent.  Modestly priced.ADA bathroom for 3ppls @$60/+tax/etc.  There were other hotels w/ same or a bit cheaper pricing.  Bathrooms were updated and easy for ADA needs.  Nice heater/fan that helped during crisp morning.  Heater worked well and wasn't too noisy during chilly night.  Simple breakfast - modest bagel/bread offering, cold cereal, oranges, coffee/teas.  Easy to find; on trolley route.Located near downtown but not really walkable to downtown.Trolley is a bit pricey ($25ish/adult for 3day pkg) unless you are staying a few days but there are maps in lobby to aid with public parking.  -600yr old oak tree in parking lot (they should really clean out the crotch of the tree - another tree is growing in the debris)-Nice chairs/tables to sit under tree and enjoy the weather.-pool looked nice but it was way too cold for our use-manager was welcoming, informative and phoned over to ask if our room was okay within 10min of our getting situated.  Everything was ducky.The Oldest City in the Country, 2 Florida Beaches within 15 minutes or less a Pool ,a Jacuzzi, a great location and a great rate! Oh yeah, did I mention, there is a 600 year old tree in the parking lot? A tree that was there when Juan Ponce De Leon discovered Saint Augustine's famed Fountain of Youth. Sounds great right? That's what I tell myself every year I come back as do many others! Every year while in the pool I talk with people that come year after year from Australia to nearby Jacksonville! Is it a Five Star Hotel ? No? Its a Howard Johnson's! Sure you could pay more than a $100 Dollars or more a night at another Hotel or a stuffy B&amp;B but, why? I would rather spend my money on dining or attraction's. Or  the flight.So.... check out the pictures and the facts about this place maybe I will see you in the pool next summer or before....For the price, it was big, clean, and the beds were comfortable. Breakfast was lackluster, but everything was okay for the price.this place was perfect for the price.room/sheets were cleanbathroom was cleanit was nice and cold in the room. a/c worked properly....KEY for florida. this is close enough to St. Augustine to walk but i probably wouldn't. there was a small pool. didn't use it but looked ok.The boy and I wanted to spend a quick night out of town. I looked for a B&amp;B, but most of them were expensive and would not let you book for just one night. I checked out some of the other hotels, but they just seemed too much to spend for one night. We settled on the HoJo after a great rate on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>. The room was clean, the staff was friendly, and the parking was FREE! It does have more a motel feel and not so much a hotel feel, but for the price it was fine. Beware - the trolleys do come by beginning at 9 a.m. and might wake you up. You may not be in such a good mood if you are sleeping off a dinner of wine, wine and more wine.Great value for the price! - Room was spacious and clean- Laundry facility convenient- free wifi- free parking- convenient to downtown... and surrounding areas- beautiful historic ""Old Senator"" tree in the parking lot!- free continental breakfastPerfect place to stay if you're site-seeing in St. Augustine.Reserved a block of 20 rooms for my wedding in September. Signed an agreement stating that my status was definite, that it expires on 8/15/13 if there are remaining rooms not booked and I put my credit card on file to act as a guarantee. Within a matter of days, my whole block was given to ""another wedding party that needed additional rooms"" and there was nothing available to me. There were 3 reservations already made which I stated not to cancel and they were canceled the same day. I was then told again that nothing was available, only to go online and see a few rooms available for $258 a night. They were charging me $60 a night. Convienently Mumford and Sons just announced a concert that weekend when they cancelled my reservation.. sounds like they just wanted more money! Regardless that is absolutely no way to do business and now I'm screwed out of a hotel for my friends and family unless I want to pay double or more.review due to reservations being cancelled for wedding.Older motel right on the edge of the downtown core.  It's really an easy walk to everything you want to get to in St Augustine even if you're an out of shape 40's guy like me.  The rooms are good size, clean but not fancy &amp; the AC works but was a bit loud at times.  We didn't use the pool but it looked clean, there was a free breakfast of sorts (bagels, muffins etc.) and the trolleys stop right in the middle of the parking lot so easy access if you buy a pass.  Overall very good for an economy motel, please note ECONOMY MOTEL.  If you are accustomed to the finer things you may want to look elsewhere.DON'T GO TO THIS HOTEL EVER!!! It's nasty, smelly, dingy, grimy, old, inconvenient location. You cant ride trolley without the stickers. Had to drive to old jail anyway. Rooms are disgusting and smelly. The layer of dust on lamps. The heat lamp in the bathroom was useless unless you want to start a fire. I felt like I was in a super 8 motel. Maybe that would have been better. I have stayed in better places for $54 super sale dollars a night! Not worth the money if ur looking for any kind of comfort. Staff was not friendly. The indian guy at the counter barely said a word to me since he was always on the phone that did not sound like business calls. Nights are usually over $90 a night. Please go somewhere else!",,,,,"['okay', 'look', 'let', 'honest', 'hotel', 'pristine', 'means', 'price', 'perfect', 'rooms', 'clean', 'extremely', 'spacious', 'yes', 'rust', 'shower', 'yes', 'maybe',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-and-suites-saint-augustine-north-saint-augustine,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Saint Augustine North,4.0,$$,16,"The room was pretty nice and the bed was comfortable. The place was clean. The maid did not leave us cups for the morning coffee so check to make sure you got all you need before turning in. The breakfast was okay but I personally prefer waffles to the pancakes they had. One word of caution, stay away from the eggs, they tasted spoiled.I stayed at this hotel a number of times and have always been happy with the accommodations and service. It's a few blocks away from the historic district, but I think they make up for it in price and ease of getting in and out very quickly. The rooms are always clerk and are well kept for a typical Florida, high humidity location. Not a bad location, you can't go wrong by staying hereUmmm...weird check in manager! Went out to eat came back in, waiting for elevator he came bye and said hey room # not kool for woman standing alone with take out plate!I always look for details.  The staff was nice, the price was right, the indoor pool was great, the b-fast was OK, the location was fine.  What I did not like and I told them:1.The shower faucet was backwards or plumbed backwards.  When you turned it to cold it was HOT and HOT was COLD -- irritating.2. There was an uneven poured floor straight down the center of the room. It was about 1/2 inch lower on one side than the other.They owners also own the Courtyard down the street.  The project manager did a poor job of checking out the building of this 3 y.o. place.But whatever ... I did not go to St. Augustine to sit i the room!Great hotel and friendly staff. In-door pool and great breakfast. Matter of fact. They have a pancake maker. You press a button and a minute latter, you have two hot pancakes.Oh, yeah! Bonus for me... There's a Comic Book &amp; Toy Show here!!!Clean hotel right off 95. Much nicer than anticipated. Fourth floor room was quiet and a nice free hot breakfast was included. No complaints.Holiday inn express has great prices and alway keep things simple. Decorated really nice..love the metallic flooring and furniture. Hot breakfast is included and tasted great. Service refilling stations should improve though. We had to wait for coffee to be refilled and lines were way too long. Room standard..sort of musty..very cold. Clean though. This hotel good for stopping off the highway.Our recent stay was very much enjoyed.Check-in: pleasant, quick and professional.Rooms: spacious, very clean, large bathroom. Bed was firm (quality), sheets crisp &amp; clean. Bathroom had lots of soft towels, and well laid out. Carpets clean and in excellent condition.We made of the use of the guest laundry. All machines were $2.00 each so stock up on your quarters. VERY clean with no lint anywhere.Complimentary breakfast: large room with a great variety of foods; french toast, scrambled &amp; hard boiled eggs, sausages/biscuits/gravy, oatmeal, cinamon rolls, and assorted cereals. Coffee was fresh. Room attendent was very attention oriented by ensuring everything remained clean &amp; stocked.Check out quick &amp; efficient - just drop off the keys as you walk out the door.Will definately stay here whenever we come through this way again!We were in town to see the Christmas lights and found this reasonably priced hotel.  I wasn't sure what to really expect but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a new hotel and the rooms are spacious, nice big bathrooms with granite counter tops etc.  The staff was very nice.  The kids liked the indoor pool.  The free breakfast was great.  They had eggs, sausage gravy, bacon, cereal, fruit, fresh made pancakes, juices, bagels etc.  Something like that would have cost a family of 4 at least $40 at a casual restaurant so it was awesome to just go downstairs and enjoy it.I would recommend this hotel to you if you are looking for a nice casual hotel.  I will go back next time I am in town.Standard HIE. nice clean rooms, free breakfast, and good location.  Close enough to the historic district, but cheaper than the HIE in the historic district.Great front desk service and it's located next to a restaurant within walking distance.  Great pitstop on my Southern tour.Very nice hotel for the price.....even during spring break.  Indoor pool was good if you don't want to get sunburned.Very clean and updated hotel, which happened to be conveniently located near our our business in town.  We were the only business travelers though. Wifi didn't work, unfortunately, and my room smelled a bit musty like a locker room until my nose got used to it (maybe this is a southern thing due to the humidity?).Very nice hotel.  Clean everything. Nice Pool.  The internet was soooooooo slow.  I don't think I have ever seen wireless or wired internet that slow.We stayed here for a weekend trip to St. Augustine and this HIE is as good as it gets!  Everything about this hotel is VERY clean and well maintained.  True, that may be because the hotel is relatively new, but nonetheless it made for a wonderful experience.  The front desk staff was extremely helpful and very accommodating.  The room was very well appointed and had a modern flair to it and included a microwave and mini fridge.  The hotel also has a mini market in the lobby that has a great selection of snacks and microwave dinners.  There are also complimentary breakfasts every morning which includes more than the typical Continental Breakfast.  The location of the hotel can't be beat either.  It's right off I-95, directly next to the Prime Outlet Mall (which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it!), and within 10 minutes driving of downtown St. Augustine.  By comparison, the price is a few dollars more than the other hotels in the area, but it's definitely worth the extra $2-3 to stay in a place that's clean, comfortable, and close to everything that matters!  One thing I will say to watch out for is the limited parking.  There seems to be JUST enough parking, and if you come back late from dinner, you may find yourself without a spot.  Luckily, we didn't have that happen to us, but we did take the last spot in the lot at 11:30 pm.  Other than that minor issue, this place will get my business again.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-st-augustine-i-95-st-augustine,Courtyard St. Augustine I-95,4.5,$$,26,"This hotel provides easy access to the outlet malls, Starbucks (very important!) and the downtown area.   We stayed 4 days here for a family weekend.  At first we considered staying downtown but I am soooooo glad that we didn't because the parking and traffic congestion in the historic district and surrounding areas is ridiculous.  The hotel is super clean and new looking. We had a king with a super comfy mattress and very fast free wifi.There is no breakfast included but you can get an overpriced bite to eat at the Starbucks cafe in the lobby.  Cracker Barrel is an easy drive, too.Lastly, the staff was super friendly. The hotel sponsored this free craft night in the lobby.  I thought we had to pay but the couple running it said the hotel paid for the price so we figured, ""why not?""  It was a great activity for kids and their middle-aged aunties!  Lots and lots of parking. Free. Easy.If you need to stop on your way up or down I-95, this is a good option.   Location is at the same exit as two outlet malls, 5 miles from World Golf Village, close to a Starbucks and just 6 miles to downtown St. Augustine giving easy access to the many restaurants there.   The hotel is either new or newly renovated with all the features of the latest Marriott Courtyard.  There is no complimentary breakfast but you can order what you like from the restaurant.  The lobby is very large with a TV section and several areas to chill out.Super nice staff, even e-mailed my bill upon request. The room had a really high pitched hum the whole time I was there, which was pretty loud. I turned the tv up pretty high in an attempt to drown it, unsuccessfully. Also, the location of the tv with it's roll out stand made it a really awkward location for watching tv in bed. Otherwise, very nice play to stay. Oh and free wi-fi, which is always awesome!I being a Marriott platinum member I found this hotel to be a little disappointing. Upon our check-in we were met by a somewhat rude receptionist. To make matters worse, we  discovered that our reservations were incorrect and the hotel would not find a way to get the rest of my team on site with a military rate for the duration of our stay. So we all decided to check-out early and move to the Renaissance. The rooms at the courtyard were clean and well kept, with exception of the dirt glasses and ice bucket in my room.This place was phenomenal not only did they have great customer service but the rooms were super clean. All accommodations were met on every level I wish I could have stayed longer however I was in town on business.  The hotel is right down the street from a mall outlet so all needs were met.beautifully decorated. nice kitchenette in room. lobby cafe with good food. right off route 95.Okay, I have stayed at Courtyards and many other brands for many years as a business traveler.  I have to say that this place was very clean and I was impressed with the accommodation and room and staff.Why do I give it a 3*?  1. I don't like the expensive Bistro concept - they used to have an expensive buffet, but the Bistro is really expensive and while nothing was wrong with the food ... the McDonald next door was just as fine of an option.2. They offer NO ""free"" always available coffee.  Yes, they do ""sell: Starbucks coffee for $3.00 a cup, but ""no free coffe?"" Come on....I've stayed here a number of times. And twice in the past 2 weeks. The suites are large and very quiet. In fact I needed shampoo and was yelling at my husband from the shower but he'd shut the door in the suite between the bedroom and living room and he couldn't hear me. (Or that was his excuse!)I'm weird about germs and wipe down the remote, switches etc when I stay in hotels and the wipes didn't pick up any visible grime from any surface. It's not a super fancy place but it's clean and quiet and I'm always happy with it.This was our first time staying at Courtyard..Room was nice, except for the super hard mattress... spent 3 very uncomfortable nights....like another marriott that we have stayed at, they have a couple of bottles of water in the room.. I thought,, what a nice touch !! Until I saw it was $3.50 a bottle..  we brought our own water.. no free breakfast like so many places have, but that was ok...theres a Dunkin Donuts just down the street. When I gave the woman at the desk my key at checkout.. she just grunted at me... thats ok too... we wont be back !!!!There were two deciding factors for choosing this hotel on our trip to Saint Augustine:1. My husband had accumulated several free nights on his Marriott rewards. 2. This was the only Marriott hotel with rooms available over the new year holiday. What earned this hotel 5 stars was that they serve Starbucks coffee.  And they are the only people serving Starbucks within a million miles of downtown Saint Augustine... or at least within like 40 miles.  My GPS and Yelp search didn't find any other. The hotel was clean and newly remodeled. The staff was great- very child friendly and accommodating.It was less than 10 minutes from all the fun tourist attractions.Pros:Great staff.Beautiful, clean, and spacious rooms.Complimentary breakfast for rewards members.Awesome gym.Cons:Breakfast gets busy and there seems to be only one person taking orders, cooking, and serving.Tv channels are limited.Not much close by within walking distance.Newly decorated, friendly hotel. Convenient lovation with 5 star service. The breakfast was delicious and I appreciated the Starbucks coffee!WOW! Simply loved this place. Great price for what you get. It's a BRAND NEW hotel, everything is new and clean. The decor is modern and refreshing. There is a [modern] asian theme running through the entire place. The front desk is updated and simple. The room we stayed in was very clean, neat, and looked new. The bathroom as well. Service was perfect. Everyone was very nice and helpful.The hotel is located one mile from the Outlets. It's right off of I-95 and it's very easy to get to downtown St. Augustine. Just ask the front desk, they'll give you a map and show you exactly how to get there. Didn't try out the pool or fitness center. They have a bistro open for breakfast and dinner. They serve Starbucks coffee. I really loved this Courtyard. $87 for one night. That is damn good if you ask me [at least for a NEW, CLEAN, and MODERN hotel]. Will definitely come back and stay here.Nice hotel. Newer, clean and nicely decorated. Impressed with the service by the staff at the Cafe. Beds are comfortable and rooms are quiet.This hotel is very clean and close to the outlets. The staff was extremely professional and courteous. I must say that I was impressed even with the manager who asked me if I had any issues or problems with my stay. He wanted to make sure that his customers were completely satisfied with the hotel. Nice dining area in the lobby that stays open pretty late if your craving for a snack or a beverage.We have been coming here occasionally now for several months. The staff is great, professional and friendly. Rooms are always very clean and lobby area also. Some renovation going on now, but they try to make as small of an impact as possible.This hotel is legit, ya'll. I've stayed in a variety of mediocre hotels in my day and for the under $100 a night price point, this is your winner. The location of the hotel is less than ideal for those visiting downtown St. Augustine and the beaches, but for the price I'm willing to take the hit. The interior (of the hotel and the rooms) was beautiful and the front desk staff was exceptionally friendly. Unfortunately, the cleaning staff wasn't so up to snuff and left a note saying they ""couldn't make our beds due to a laptop on the bed."" Really? REALLY? I understand that people are very nitpicky about their items being handled and are worried about theft, but come on. Somedays all that was done was the toilet being cleaned. Oh well, at least the beds felt like heaven. Otherwise, the hotel was fabulous. The gym is a little small, but they do offer weights and a few cardio machines (all with personal tvs) and it was never busy. The food downstairs was delicious and they offer a nearly full Starbucks menu. Most importantly, the wifi was always fast and reliable!I am proud to call myself a Marriott girl because I always seem to have good luck with them (NO! I don't own stock in Marriott - and I am quick to whine on the rare occasion I do get a bad one).   This hotel is one of the reasons I stay loyal to Marriott.  I usually stay a block down the street at the Fairfield Inn, but I got a better rate here (altho a tad high), so I gave it a try. I am glad I did. It's a pretty new hotel (3 years old) and very well kept. It's conveniently located right off the interstate, and about 5 or 6 miles into downtown St. Augustine. Plenty of free parking at the hotel.The room was very nice, bigger than older Courtyard I have stayed in. The bathroom was very nice with lots of towels, and the vanity was inside the bathroom. My room had a mini-frig, coffeepot, and microwave.The bed was firm and comfy with clean, fresh linens and lots of pillows. There's a workdesk and flat screen TV. There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel. The front desk staff was very nice both when I checked in and when I asked some questions. I have no complaints at all.There is a coin operated washer and dryer on the first floor.This hotel had something different. Rather than the usual Courtyard restaurant with the buffet, this one had a counter where you could order breakfast. It closed at 11 and reopened in the afternoon for sandwiches and such. It was nice, but the breakfast is not included in your rate unless your reservation says it is. I had the breakfast included, and it was made to order by a nice lady who ran the place very well. There were plenty of tables to sit out and the breakfast was delicious! Again, it is made to order. I like this new set up for Courtyards; it seemed very efficient. There's also free coffee in the lobby.Oh, one more thing. This hotel is very very close to the Prime Outlets shopping mall. It's not as close as the Fairfield Inn, but less than a mile away from the outlets.I got a good rate, but it was still a little high for my taste (it did include the breakfast for 2). But, this is the going rate for St. Augustine, and it is certainly a lot cheaper than the hotels downtown.I was so impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff.  When I first came in, seriously early (10a) I asked if I could leave my things with them because I didn't want to leave it in my car while I went to Old Town.  They said they actually had my room ready and had been waiting for me (?!?  Read on to find out)When I got up to my room, along with all the other complimentary items and a beautiful room, I had a red rose on my pillow.  When I called my husband to tell him I'd gotten in safely he said he'd called all the hotels I was staying at on my trip and this was the only one that would get a flower and leave it in my room for me.Topping all this off (in my poor, lobstery, white girl opinion) is that they offered me free aloe for my sunburn when I came in from the pool all red.  Bless these folks!The room was beautiful and the front desk clerks were super nice. But my happy experience ended when it came morning time and I met the breakfast clerk. I ordered the same coffee I ordered the night before but instead of tasting like Starbucks it was gross. I also ordered a parfait. When I got to my room and tasted it, you could tell the yogurt was going bad. Upon looking at the date I noticed that it was made two days ago!! When I went back down for a refund I explained that it tasted funny and that it was two days old. The breakfast lady started with ""yeah but..."" Before the male front desk clerk interrupted me by offering to replace it. I didn't feel like tasting multiple ones to get a fresh fresh one so he gave me a refund. While waiting for my money I noticed that all the rest had today's date on it. They sold me an old one when they had fresh ones. Then when my whole group went down for breakfast my cousin started the entire ordering process first. Everybody in our group and all the other guests that ordered after her got their food before hers was ready which is ridiculous. They didn't even apologize for her wait!","This was a clean excellent hotel with an $84 price tag ($96/tax).  It's six miles from downtown St. Aug (we appreciated the quiet) but across the street from the outlet malls and right off the interstate.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Large room.  Great bathroom.  Comfy beds.  Everything seemed new.  Two computers in business center.  On site bistro for breakfast and lunch--and wine bar at night.At 2 a.m. a sulfur smell of the extreme degree infiltrated the room awaking me.  It was extreme and ""choking"".  It took 2 hours to dissipate.  This smell is smelled occasionally on the drive down 16.  Not sure if it's a local water source or a chemical rend-off from a factory.  (bad eggs smell).   The hotel would not acknowledge an awareness of the event.  It was suffocating and I would not want to endure it again.  This is the only thing keeping me from marking this five-star.Nice hotel rooms   Clean  have Star Bucks coffee in lobby   Close to downtown but do need to driveI stayed there for Labor Day weekend 2013, and I give the hotel a high rating. To start, the sign is easily visible from the road (Road 16). The parking lot has plenty of spaces and no valet/no need to check in your car. The hotel lobby and rooms are very clean. My room had two queen size beds plus an office desk for computer work, so this makes it easy for me to work. The room also had a closet to hang clothes and a refrigerator that kept food very cold, They allowed late checkout at 2PM instead of the normal at Noon (just ask for this if you need it, and it should be free if they are not otherwise busy with many guests). Their lobby has small cafe to make some meals for breakfast and lunch, and the prices were fair. The people who work the front desk and cafe were very polished / friendly people. A traveler's note: when you book a hotel like this, which is 2-3 miles outside of town, sometimes the prices are better and the staff helps you more. They try harder to earn your business because they are outside of town. It's not always that way at hotels in general, but it is certainly a factor here! I read some other postings on this hotel, and people said it's not an ideal location if you're visiting St. Augustine. I don't understand this. If you have a car, it's no problem. Driving to downtown was about 10 minutes away (east on Road 16 and south on San Marcos). I would have paid 2X or 3X if I stayed close to the downtown area. I'd rather save the money.The staff was welcoming and friendly. They also assisted us on numerous occasions in finding local spots we needed to get to, such as Epic Theatres. The rooms were painted lively and clean. The linens were fresh. The hotel offers Starbucks products and a mini grocery area that is accessible at all hours with the front desk clerk. This hotel was very close to all the local area such as the light house, the beach, down town, etc. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to town on a budget or on a short stay. Fantastic service. We will stay here again.NEW hotel with modern look and great Starbucks coffee. Hotel is located 1 mile from Prime Outlets. Hotel is within 10 minutes of Historic Downtown St. Augustine and Flagler College. Wi-Fi &amp; hi-speed internet, fitness center and heated pool. The Bistro serves up good food and cold beer / wine.",,,,"['hotel', 'provides', 'easy', 'access', 'outlet', 'malls', 'important', 'downtown', 'area', 'days', 'family', 'weekend', 'first',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/bayfront-marin-house-saint-augustine,Bayfront Marin House,4.5,$$$,34,"Great location and a great staff. The staff loves their job or at least they fooled all of us. The rooms are great and not just clean, but super clean. The breakfasts were great with many choices. You turn in your breakfast order  the night before. Cake or cupcakes with coffee at night. You can eat inside, on the porches, outside or in the gazebo. The view is to die for. There is much to do and see in the town.Parking is a long walk but not too bad.The down sides: all street parking is metered $1.50 for 3 hours, the max you can stay in that spot. Parking enforcement starts at 8am.Transportation is way over priced so we mostly walked, very healthy.January 2016. Spent two nights in the Marie Antoinette room.  Overall happy with our stay.  It was my husbands birthday and the staff arranged for a little decoration in the room (balloons, cake, champagne). The breakfast each morning was just ok. There is a choice from a hot item or fruit, oatmeal, and bagels as an alternative.  The room was very impressive however the bed was a little on the uncomfortable side and could be over due for a new mattress.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and will surely be back in the future.What a cute B&amp;B!  I decided to book a room to stay overnight in St. Augustine to attend a friend's wedding.  I was booked in the Coquina Suite for a single night.  When your reservation is booked, you will receive a confirmation email.  Definitely read the email.  Seriously.  There is lots of good logistical information you will need.The Inn does not have on site parking - it's about 2 blocks away and the only reason for a star deduction.  But they really do everything in their power to make it easy to get in/out.  Checking in there are two reserved spots on the street right in front of the Inn.  I was checked in within minuted, a staffer gave me a map, showed me the parking lot, gave me my breakfast choice ticket, a Restaurant Times magazine and walked me to the room.  I unloaded my luggage and then parked my car.  There are marked spots in the parking lot for the Oldest School house lot.  Again, not super inconvenient, but in the unseasonably blazing hot weather we're having right now, I was definitely glistening by the time I returned to my room.  Spots are clearly marked in the lot and you'll need place the permit given to you at check-in on your dash.My room was super adorable.  The Coquina suite has a small entry way, a small bath with a shower, then a small room with a day bed and two person jacuzzi tub and finally the bedroom at the back.  There was a lot of natural light, the room had 2 cushy robes to use and lots of cute antiques.  There was a TV with cable, a phone for local calls, and individual thermostats.  There is a nightly happy hour from 5-7.  I poked my head in, grabbed a small snack and a glass of white sangria and headed back to my room to get all dolled up for the evening.  I ended up forgetting something in my car, so I did have to hike it to my car in a fancy dress and that was annoying but my fault.  There is some street parking not far away and next time I'll probably try to grab one of those spaces first.  After attending the wedding, I wandered back to my room around 1am.  They have movement sensing lights that kicked on as I walked up to my room so that was a nice touch. My breakfast choices were quiche or yogurt and fruit.  I chose yogurt, eating outside on the patio, and chose my preferred breakfast time.  I snagged a table and took a seat enjoying the view of the water across the street.  Within a minute, a staff member asked what room I was with and just a few minutes after that my breakfast arrived.  As requested, I had a small bowl of greek yogurt with a nice selection of fruit surrounding it, a small croissant with butter and jelly, water, and a big mug of hot chocolate.  I spent probably 45 minutes enjoying breakfast, chatting with other guests, and met the owners who were very nice and asked how my stay was going. Since I live so close to St. Augustine, I haven't stayed at a B&amp;B before.  Bayfront Marin was super cute, very comfortable, and I'll definitely book it again.    They also have lots of options to add on to your stay to up the romance quotient if you're traveling with a partner.Wonderful B&amp;B! The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are gorgeous! The breakfast was great and the happy hour was awesome! This B&amp;B has a waterfront view and is within walking distance of Castillo de San Marcos and many other attractions. I will definitely stay here again!We drove 5 hours to meet with Mike the owner of the Bayfront Marin House 5 months out from our rehearsal dinner date. Bayfront's gorgeous. Mike agreed to dates and we booked the entire Inn for 2 nights with our rehearsal dinner being on the lawn. so we thought. I sent out invitations and our website recommending people stay at the Inn. When my guests called to book rooms, guess what, No record of our party.  In fact, they had already booked out the bridal suite we wanted with outside guests! I called and spoke with Brian, event manager, he was very apologetic and assured me ""this is not how we do business"" and got the remaining rooms blocked and offered us a second Inn (Bella Bay) for our guests as well. My bridesmaids tried to book rooms at Bella Bay, guess what, It's already booked out with another wedding! I called Brian again, ""this is not how we do business"" Mike must have booked it and didn't tell anyone. AGAIN! So now I'm mad, but Brian tells me that I have to bite my tongue and go to Mike with kindness if I want to have my event at his property (it's already on all the invitations and people have already booked rooms at the Inn). BTW, this is my rehearsal dinner for about 50 people! NOT wedding! Over the course of the next couple months our guests have problems booking rooms because the night time desk person has no clue what is going on so I keep getting texts and calls from our guests with confusion and frustration. I call and email and ask about room bookings at least weekly to see how many rooms are left. Brian lets me know what's available and I have them booked. One month out I find out the Bridal Suite is now open because the guests shortened their stay. It's too late to book a $400 room now since we already rented a house. The SUNDAY before the party (THURS) he tells me I have 2 open rooms on Thurs and that we are responsible for them (approx $550) and we are responsible for that bridal suite as well that was never available to us (almost $400/night room).  I felt robbed! Felt taken advantage of. This whole time I have to bite my tongue because they hold all the power with our party!  We agree to split the difference and take the bridal suite for the 2 nights and they agree to drop charges for the 2 open rooms on Thurs.  I had been asking for weeks for an itemized bill... never got one.  I had to go through room rates, and emails to come up with a total for the party and room rentals.  I was then told that my guests would need to pay the remainder of their room balances prior to them checking in because the ""owner was uncomfortable with that amount of money sitting out there."" I had to call all the guests individually and let them know that their cards were going to be charged the remainder amount before they even check-in!!! WHO DOES THAT!  The party came... it was beautiful.  Brian was amazing... I hope he finds a job somewhere else!!! Weekend is over... check my AMEX statement... you guessed it.. Not the dollar amount we discussed. Weeks go by of me texting and asking for a final bill.... I STILL DON'T HAVE ONE!!!  So we disputed the charge with AMEX.  They refunded a couple hundred dollars to us saying they charged us for an extra room, but still won't produce a final bill.  2 stars because it's beautiful!  I would think twice before I held a large event there... they aren't organized at all or prepared!  Good luck to Brian!This is the BEST B&amp;B I've stayed at, hands down. We came here on our honeymoon. The room is beautiful with a fireplace, whirlpool tub, and private balcony. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The breakfast choices are top quality deliciousness and their Happy Hour (included in room cost) offerings are equally yummy. They also offer guests free use of their bicycles to get around the city. The grounds are lovely and well-kept.I think this place is a four stars plus - they do so many things right and truly make the Inn a lovely place to relax and enjoy a getaway to St Augustine.  I chose the room on the website, it had nice decor and a large garden tub in the corner of the room. It was on the lower level - perhaps a little extra noise but nothing substantial. The front office was very helpful and answered tons of questions and offered good suggestions of where to eat and how to get there .  Check in was fast and easy, first impression of the Inn from the outside was very charming with a garden in full bloom, a hammock and gazebo. Parking at no extra charge is off premises approximately a five minute walk.  The room was immaculate and the website pictures accurately reflected the colors and decor.  The bed linens were very high quality, nice comfy pillows and an elegant bed coverlet.  Plenty of extra large towels for both the tub and shower area, high end bath products to match.  The complimentary happy hour was charming, nice home made Sangria as well as wine and beer selections, dainty appetizers. Nice to sit in the lovely garden in the afternoon having a drink with a water view... The night was quiet, the bed comfortable, I wish we could have slept in but there was so much in town to see that we arranged to have breakfast in the gazebo at 8 am. My husband mentioned to the staff that it was my birthday and ordered champagne with our special breakfast. We had delicious  eggs Benedict, oatmeal, croissants and fresh fruit   - it felt truly special and the service was excellent - the breakfast was part of the to price.  We saw the sun rise from the hotel garden and we both felt this quaint charming hotel will become a yearly tradition for us.This is the first bed and breakfast I've ever stayed where I can say I actually loved it! It is so unbelievably charming inside the rooms and on the grounds. Rooms are well appointed with everything you could need. Beautifully decorated, obviously new ""old style""  bedding and bathroom fixtures with room to move around. And everything works! Immaculately clean. Tiny white lights outline the buildings, porches and trees add to the romantic, surreal ambiance. Charming outdoor seating amid colorful plants and flowers. Helpful, accommodating and efficient staff. Delicious breakfast and Happy Hour wine and hors d'oevres included in the room price and not to be missed. They even allow the patrons to enjoy these in their rooms if you want some quiet time or if you're hungry but don't feel like getting dressed yet. Great location to walk to the sites and restaurants. On the negative side, parking is at a distance. There's a drop-off area in front of the inn to discharge passengers and luggage, but only two spaces are allocated for this purpose. A free parking lot is a few blocks away. I suppose this can't be helped since this is how the city is set up. It's important to know this but Bayfront Marin House doesn't volunteer this information, so the patrons find this out from reading reviews or in frustration at the time of check-in. Once that obstacle is overcome, the rest is easy.Having stayed at about 20 different inns &amp; B&amp;Bs in St Augustine over the years honestly this one had among the top if not the BEST customer service.  The breakfast was way more than you could ever eat and very good- definitely homemade.  The social hour had lots of options for food and drinks including cheeses, meats, dips, hot &amp; cold apps and wine, beer and sangrias and of course coffee, tea, etc.  The innkeepers were so helpful ahead of time with potential plans we had set as well.The run some great specials during off season and weeknights so be sure to check out their website and facebook pages.  I highly recommend them.  Our stay in the Lindsay Michelle room was extremely comfortable and beautiful!  I added some pictures so check it out!Very impressed with this B&amp;B. Everything was great! The food was amazing, very clean rooms and grounds. Quiet, romantic, pretty view of the bay, perfect walking distance to all the tourist areas. Highly recommend.I am surprised to see the low reviews on here. My husband and I have stayed here three times and always had a wonderful experience. The Marin is in a beautiful location and very quiet and relaxing. However, old town is just a short walk away with great restaurants and shops. The breakfast has always been amazing. Someone else said the food seems store bought, but I have to disagree. Everything I've eaten here was fresh and homemade. I definitely plan to return again.This was the most amazing vacation trip! From the continental breakfast, happy hour, and the amazing location right on the beach. Definitely worth it!Best stay here! Everyone was so sweet who worked at the inn and the room was magnificent. It was clean and kept up so nicely. The breakfast the next morning was delicious and we were so impressed with the overall stay. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a romantic, well taken care of stay!This is a real gem. It's beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous. So comfortable and clean and spacious, each room is unique and beautiful. The grounds are lovely with lots of books to chill out in.  The staff are wonderful. They pay such incredible attention to the guests. It's our second time here and they are like part of the family. They are warm and wonderful and remember everything about is. It's our second time there and it's just as magical as the first time. He breakfasts are incredible and there's a happy hour with sangria and yummy food to nosh on. This b&amp;b is unlike others. It's an absolutely wonderfully restful and get away!Bed: Comfortable.  There was a king bed in the room with a huge wooden canopy- very beautiful.  The carriage trail was right outside our room, so we drifted off to dreamland with the gentile patter of horseshoes on the ground.  It sounds like that would be annoying, but we actually found it realy cool-like we were transported back in time- and it was also oddly comforting.Room: Very clean, tastefully decorated, not too frilly.  The tub in the bathroom was a little scraped up and that was the only part of the room that I wished had been cleaned a little better prior to our arrival.  They provide comfortable robes which is a nice added bonus.Breakfast and happy hour: Mostly lacking. Store bought foods, nothing tasted homemade except for the sangria at happy hour.  There was plenty of food to eat in terms of quantity, but nothing was amazing.  We have stayed in many B&amp;B's and I wonder if we have an unfair standard in mind.  But the breakfast left my husband wishing we had paid less to stay at a different place and go to one of the yummy cafe's in town for a good quality breakfast. We don't need or want quantity, quality is way more important.  One thing I will say about happy hour is that their red sangria is really, really good!Location: Superb, parking is close by, all of the main drag restaurants and museums are walking distance, and the B&amp;B is right next to the water. The location is really beautiful.HINT: It was hard to find the parking at first- the person who answered the phone was not very helpful when we asked for directions and sounded annoyed. To her defense, we didn't do our homework prior to arriving and should have looked at the confirmation because it says where to park and how to check in.Service: Personable, but did not really feel special because of the huge size of the B&amp;B.  Along those lines, it felt more like we were staying at an Inn than a B&amp;B.We are definitely B&amp;B people, BUT, we will probably a hotel next time.  There are a few really delicious-looking breakfast spots that we would like to try, and the price of lodging in St. Augustine makes it difficult to justify planning it any other way.This was my first bed and breakfast experience so I didn't know what to expect. Everyone was so nice and the property was beautiful! Great location to great restaurants and shopping!  We stayed in the captain henry's suite on the second floor. The view was beautiful and the outdoor seating was great. The happy hour in the evening from 5-7 was awesome!  Sat outside enjoying wine , beer,  and lovely bites. The breakfast was amazing. on the first morning the hot item was a sausage, onion, and cheese omelette. Really yummy! The second morning, the hot item was  a Belgium blueberry waffle and bacon.  It was fluffy and had the perfect amoumt of blueberries.  Like I mentioned earlier everyone was so nice! My husband and I cannot wait to stay here again.  I will recommend this bed and breakfast to everyone!My boyfriend and I recently stayed here as part of my birthday celebration. I'm a big fan of B&amp;B's and this one was excellent.We checked in with no problems and the woman working there walked us up to our room. We had the Forrester Suite. I had chosen this suite since it was the only one that had the jacuzzi in a separate bathroom. A lot of B&amp;B's have jacuzzis as part of the bedroom and to me that's kind of tacky/weird. The room was beautiful and very well kept. One of the reasons I had picked Bayfront was for their nightly happy hour. From 5-7 p.m. each night they have drinks and goodies in their dining room. There's a nice variety of finger foods, beer, wine, sangria and a special dessert. One night they had margaritas and these peanut butter jelly sugar cookies that were to die for! We loved sipping on our drinks while swinging on the porch swing by our room looking out at the bay.The first night we fired up the jacuzzi and it was LOUD...we hoped we weren't disturbing our neighbors, but we didn't get any complaints. Jacuzzi was a lovely way to relax...wish they had candles/bubble bath in the room! That would have been a nice extra touch.During the day when people are moving around we could hear people go up and down the stairs and talking. No matter though since we weren't in the room much during the day. Just a note for those who might be easily bothered by noise.We met one of the owners one morning, who introduced himself at breakfast. He was very nice and gave us some recommendations on a beach to go to (Anastasia State Park).The only thing that we didn't really like was that they require you to plan out your breakfast the night before. Including where you want to be served and what time. When we're on vacation we don't really like to follow a set schedule and would have preferred a ""breakfast is from 8-10 a.m."" kind of routine. They do this so they don't make too much food and waste it. I can totally appreciate this...it was just hard for us to figure out an exact time that we wanted breakfast. You can choose to decline breakfast, but don't! It was delicious each morning. Perfectly fluffy banana pancakes one morning and a yummy quiche lorraine the next.Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay again!This was probably the best B&amp;B I've stayed in. Everyone was very friendly. The room was pretty, clean, and the bed was great. You have an awesome view of the bay and you can walk everywhere. They also have bikes to use for free to get places you don't want to walk (like the distillery) . The breakfast is good. And they will even make it fresh for you when you didn't show up on time because you pub crawled too much the night before. They have happy hour from 5-7 with great little homemade snacks and beer &amp; wine. We didn't want to leave.This is where my husband and I spent our honeymoon and it was AMAZING!  Beautiful historic house right there by the bridge of lions.  The owner came talked with at breakfast one morning and gave is the backstory and we chatted a bit.The room was beautiful as well.  Most of the rooms have a hot tub and ours was great!  We stayed in Stephanie's Hideaway.  Very cozy and beautiful room!  The shower had dual shower heads so we could shower together.  The food was really great as well!The b&amp;b was VERY close to everything really in historic St. Augustine that you'd want to visit (except the lighthouse, and if you really really wanted to you could walk there too).DEFINITELY going back!Definitely hoping back for anniversaries!My wife and I drove up from Lakewood Ranch (Sarasota Area).  We love St. Augustine for the culture and fine dining.  The Marin House is a fantastic place to stay when enjoying the city.  The owners and rest of the staff are fantastic.  If there is anything you need they take care of it right away.  The rooms are nice and clean and you have a great choice in terms of size and price.  We stayed in #2 which had a nice balcony that is private.  The room was quite large and had nice places to store our clothes for the few nights we were there.  We stayed one night in another room and there was no place to really put our clothes;  not a big deal for those who pack light...  not the case for us when it is quite warm during the day and very cool at night.  The breakfast is awesome.  The main entree is portioned just right and delicious.  If you want more of something else you can easily order it the night before when you take your ticket down.  The Happy Hour is so nice!  We met several nice couples there.  The parking is off site,, but safe and convenient in a parking lot behind the Oldest House.  Thank you for a fantastic time!  This is much better than a chain hotel!","We stayed there for 3 days including Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and then went over to the Villano Beach location owned by the Bayfront Marin. I would do the same thing again in a heartbeat. The St. Augustine location is within walking distance of the entire downtown area yet your views are of the waterfront. We stayed in room 2, second floor with a private corner front porch. Sitting out there was beautiful. The sunrises can be viewed from the porch. The food was great at this place. Breakfast was  wonderful, so delicious and can be delivered to your room if you'd rather not eat in the quaint dining room. The happy hour was lovely with beer, wine and great food snacks. A nice way to meet people. You have a selection of places to sit outside. The building was beautifully decorated too; several people would stop to admire and take pictures. The beach villas were perfect. We had an ocean front on Villano Beach. Some of the units , just a few yards from the beach, have small private pools which is something we will return for. The beach villas are only a short drive over a bridge from the downtown area. You feel like you are in a different world.  There are some restaurants  nearby as well as a Publix. A bottle of wine and platter of shrimp and cheese is all you need. The view is spectacular and you also have your own outside private sitting areas as well. The staff at both locations was so accommodating , attentive and friendly. The owners make themselves readily available and are invested in your satisfaction. We will be back to both of their locations.My boyfriend and I stayed in the Forrester Suite for a weekend get away. The room was beautiful, comfortable and clean, as shown on the website. The staff is amazing so friendly and accommodating-made us feel beyond comfortable. I can not emphasise more about how the staff really went above and beyond to make sure our stay was hassle free so we could focus on relaxing and indulging. The social hour had a amazing food spread buffet style with lots of options for beer, and wine. The breakfast was out of this world! SO MANY options and everything was delicious (I basically sampled the whole menu) from having the out door sit down dining table service, to the quality and selection it felt far from the normal free continental breakfast experience. Also during breakfast the owner made a point to introduce himself and start a very sincere getting to know one another conversation, going into detail about the interesting journey of acquiring the property with his wife, his  love for his occupation really showed through. Everything combined made it a happy, charming, comfortable experience.This get away to the Bayfront Marin House was a gift from my husband's awesome coworkers.  We got pregnant than got married..They way it's suppose to be right?! Well after the wedding we didnt' have plans for a honeymoon but they were generous enough to get us two nights at this bed and breakfast.Here's what I remember.  Our room was nice and cozy.  The shower was really small. Everytime I bent over my but hit the wall but hey I was preggo! I took out the shampoo holder to make more room.  Our room had a hot tub.  We totally used it than afterwards we remembered that being preggo in a hot tub is not a good idea.  My baby ended up fine.  Still its a romance kill.Breakfast was decent.  You fill out a slip and check off what  you want.  I think I checked everything off.  Hello Happy Hour! Free beer and wine! I was preggo and my husband seemed to be the only alcoholic drinker there so he was having a ball! While I munched on the delicious mushroom dip.  I think I ate all of it.Oh ya they have bikes.  While they may not be in the best shape they work and it's freeeeeee.  I was 5 months preggo at that time and still trying to be active so we borrowed the bikes and went everywhere we could in the early afternoon.Parking parking parking...I remember it was a few blocks away.  So the hubby had dropped me off in the front with our luggage left to park and walked back.  The walk back creeped me out, it's by the St Francis Inn and there's hardly any lights.We walked pretty much everywhere.  They only time we used the car was for a late dinner at the Rain TreeOther than that I'd come back.  I just wonder what other B&amp;Bs have to offer now that we had our first experience.We stayed here for 1 night before moving on to their Beachcomber cottages on Vilano Beach! Both places are spectacular. The breakfast was awesome, happy hour as well. We stayed in the Lindsey Michelle Room at the B&amp;B and you must check out the cottages they own.  We stayed in the Royal Palm suite with panoramic views, fantastic. Staff is also extremely nice. Will be back!!!!Wow, just wow.  My wife and I have stayed in numerous B&amp;Bs over the years and this one is, by far, the best.  Period.My wife and I stayed with them for her birthday weekend.  We booked for two nights and took advantage of their offer to extend for another night at a very good price.  The first room wasn't available for all three nights, so we spent one night in the Francisco Marin room and two in the Burgess Cottage.  They even moved our luggage from one room to another.  The Marin room is beautiful, to be sure, but the Burgess Cottage is wonderful.  If it's available, book it.  You won't be disappointed.We checked in about 5pm, so just in time for Happy Hour.  They have a great selection of beer, two sangrias, red, white, and blush wine, and some great homemade snacks.  The staff is absolutely charming.  Our hosts and the owner circulated during the happy hour, making us feel like part of the family.  Very personable, thoughtful, and professional.  We also decided to bring our dog on the trip and everyone was wonderful and accommodating to Wallace, our terrier.  The staff offered a list of dog friendly attractions and restaurants upon check-in.  There was a limitless supply of peanut banana dog treats and the entire staff seemed to love animals.  I think Wallace would love to return as much as we do.We chose to take breakfast on the patio every morning.  You can't beat the view of the bay and the cool breezes.  The food was very good.  A nice variety from day to day, so we didn't get tired of anything.  They are very efficient and the service is quite good.  I would, without hesitation, stay at the Bayfront Marin again.  It's quite close to us, they have excellent rates, and you will not find a more professional and courteous staff.  Stay Here!I stayed here while attending a wedding at the Sanchez House next door. The service was very accommodating and friendly, the staff is a highlight of the place. I stayed in the Bridge of Lions room which was spacious and elegant, while my parents stayed in the Marie Antoinette room which is a real stunner. They had their own private balcony overlooking the bay, providing a real private treat and a great place to hang out.It has a great location for visiting the historic district and was overall a very pleasant stay.As far as breakfast goes, they were helpful with providing foods for dietary restrictions like gluten-free and wheat-free.It doesn't get much better than this place. You feel like you're on your honeymoon once again. So romantic and beautiful. Close to all the sites and you'll love the staff.WONDERFUL!  This was our 6th trip to St. Augustine and our first stay here and we won't stay anywhere else! This was our first stay at a b &amp; b and we couldn't have been happier. The room was lovely and the service excellent. I read some earlier reviews, and they must have done something in the kitchen, because our food was excellent.  Also, the happy hour was a fun touch!We stayed here in early January for a group event.  This is a great month for St. A as the nights of lights are still going on - when almost every tree, window, roof line and rail are outlined with white lights in the old city - very romantic.  The Bayfront Marin House is located on the quieter end of St. A, but still close to our favorite bars and restaurants and wonderful for walking through the charming narrow neighborhood streets of the old city.  And the view of the bay and the Bridge of Lions is spectacular.  The roomy courtyard gives you space to relax and enjoy the slow pace of St. A. I enjoyed working with Mike at Bayfront picking out rooms for each couple - everyone was very pleased with their room.  We first took all the ones with king size beds - ours was the Lyndsay Michelle on the second floor.  The weather was not really nice enough to enjoy the great porch seating area this time, but on another trip, it would be a great private gathering area.  It overlooked the inn's courtyard with the bay in the background.  Very quiet and roomy - it has an extra bedroom which would be nice if you brought kids - but maybe not another couple as you had to pass through it to get to the bathroom.  The best room views were probably from the Marie Antoinette on the 2nd floor and the King George below it on the first floor, both with queen beds and nice private little porches for a front row seat on the whole bay view.  Both had nice bathrooms, but the KG had a great shower made for two.  All the rooms were comfortable and beautifully furnished - reminder - these are mostly furnished in antiques and the inn is old!  If you are expecting shiny and new - stay at a hotel and not a B&amp;B like Bayfront Marin House.  Breakfasts were lovely and filling, with a different main dish served each day - like french toast, eggs benedict, or hashbrown casserole, and you could choose alternatives and extras - fruit, toast, oatmeal, cereal, juice,etc - as much as your wanted - the staff wanted you to be satisfied.  And you chose when and where to eat: the garden / gazebo area in the courtyard, or if the weather is not so nice, the gathering area by the office.  Or you can have it brought to your room but I think there is a charge for that service.  Chatting with fellow inn guests is part of the fun here. We met several nice couples, some whose company we enjoyed for drinks at the happy hour and later at the taverns down the street like the Cigar Bar or Hensley's tavern.  Speaking of the happy hour - they go beyond the usual bottle of wine.  A red and white sangria, wine, several beers, and different snacks each night - cheese balls and hot dips or meatballs, mini eggrolls.   Enough to keep you going till your supper.  The staff were all very friendly here too. I have stayed in many nice B&amp;B's in St. A, but the combination of the location, view, amenities, staff and atmosphere make the Bayfront Marin House my favorite so far.  I think each of us in the group left planning our next visit to St A and the Bayfront Marin House.Beautiful inn. The room that we stayed in was so nice because we could see the bay. The staff and owners were very sweet. Whatever problems we had; were handled with a very immediate and a positive response. The owners Sandy and Mike were great because they came out and spent time speaking with every guest. Bayfront Marin's ""Happy Hour"" was great; the homemade Sangria was out of this world good. They also had a good variety of beers. The appetizers were great as well. Their homemade truffles were so rich and creamer it just melted in your mouth. Oh so delicious! Overall, great little place to sit and relax and take in the little gem  called St. Augustine.This was my first time staying at a bed and breakfast(I had been begging my husband forever and he finally took me much to my surprise). First off when we checked in I personally didn't think the women working behind the counter was to friendly but maybe I'm just sensitive anyways the room was pretty nice kind of standard but not bad, the social was my favorite thing no one socialized with one another but the drinks and desserts were very good. The worst part of the experience was the breakfast(which I was really looking forward to) it was the standard badly cooked eggs and sausage links with some alright sides...didn't live up to my expectations but maybe better luck next time? Needless to say I wouldn't recommend staying here.The best b&amp;b I've ever stayed at.  The owners are the some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  The full breakfast in the morning was fantastic.  The wine/beer/snack for happy hour wasn't bad.  The bed was so comfy and I miss the Jacuzzi was so clean and spacous.  The room was beautiful.  Everything that was included (wifi!) the price was great.  We drove to St. Augustine but ended up leaving our car parked most of the time and just walked to the shops and restaurants.Oh man this place was great!  The staff were super friendly. The view was wonderful and all of the extra amenities like breakfast and happy hour were perfect and really good homemade sangria which hit the spot after driving all day.  I actually liked that the offsite parking was a very short 4 minute walk from the hotel.  I was on vacation and wanted to be free of keys and cell phones.  Besides there are a ton of shops and restaurants within walking distance.  St. Augustine is wonderful on foot because you notice the little timeless bits and pieces that cars don't let you see.  Anyway, the customer service was perfect, our room was perfect and charming, the patio furniture and gazebo were perfect and wonderful for socializing which I noticed almost everyone did.  We stayed on the second floor which I would recommend because of the view.  Now we have our little getaway place in St. Augustine because we will come back and will always stay there.we stayed one night at the Marin House. We had to park about 3 blocks away from the hotel in an offsite parking area. We got the ""fishbowl"" room otherwise known as the Napoleon Room. I would not recommend this room. it is on the corner where everyone walks by and 2 walls are all windows that passersby can look into. not at all private. We asked to move but the hotel was suddenly full (even though when I reserved my room on thursday- for saturday night- the hotel was half empty. in February when the town was dead) We added a couples massage to our agenda through the hotel. Hands down it was the worst massage I have ever had (since when is pinching allowed in a massage!!! unbelievable). We did not stay long enough to try the breakfast, but I must say that the room was spotlessly clean which was much appreciated.",,,,"['great', 'location', 'great', 'staff', 'staff', 'loves', 'job',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/super-8-st-augustine-beach-saint-augustine,Super 8 St. Augustine Beach,3.0,$,11,"We stayed here during the 450th anniversary of St. Augustine and the prices I thought were incredibly reasonable for that timeframe and now reading other reviews I hear they are even cheaper normally. This hotel is great if you keep the mindset you get what you pay for. It was an economic option that didn't smell weird when you walk in the door, over all cleanliness was good minus the few hairs we would find throughout the room and the wifi was good. Service at the front desk was super quick and we got our room with no hassle. The hotel was very close to two things we wanted to do, go to the beach and visit the Salt Life restaurant. Both within walking distance! It was raining super bad when we got there so that was a no go but the restaurant had college football on and good drink deals so that made up for it. The beds were very firm and I would recommend bringing your own pillow because those are just as firm. My wife wanted to make sure I put this in for all the females out there, the hair dryer did not have a guard on the back so it sucked in her hair and burnt it a bit I guess. Other than that she had a good time too though. We would be back again for sure, I would say this place is worth the money, but you do get what you pay for.OK for the money.  Close to beach.  Clean.   Safe.  Not the 4 Seasons but its good enough for a short weekend stay near the St. Augustine Beach pier which is across the street.  Pro's.....reasonable, fridge, microwave, parking, clean, large rooms, spartan but clean bath, free but inconsistent wifiCon's....could use new carpet and freshening up, breakfast was prison like.  Good restaurant only two doors down toward the traffic light.Very simple, clean and economic hotel. I love it and will back soon.The wifi was Excellent.Pet friendly! Super clean. Showed up without a reservation and got a room right away. Liked it so much I stayed an extra night. Even had a mini fridge, coffee maker and microwave. Too cold to check out the pool but a nice feature if I returned in the summer. Location was great. Bars/restaurants within walking distance. Beach access about a block away. Definitely will be back.For the price that we paid, this place deserves a four star.check in was easy although a bit awkward for the simple reason that the check in guy was sheepish. But oh well... he was nice enough for me.CLOSE TO THE BEACH ... I mean, five minutes walk and BAM! there is the beach! although they dont have the actual 'ocean view' I am not complaining. I got this hotel room at $50 a night on a weekend, so I am happy.The location is safe, and the place was packed when we were there ... For the cheapness of my stay, I have to admit that I felt quite safe here. Their patrons, I assume, are about middle class (based on the cars that were parked.)The breakfast they offer is no shang ri la ... actually it was borderline BLAH since it was the usual cheap crap like bagels, cheap muffins, regular coffee and orange juice ... maybe something more, but it was youre bare basics. anyways, I wasnt too bothered because I wasnt expecting much for 50 bucks a night.Our beds were comfortable, rooms were neat, no funny smells although the toilet flush thingamajig was broken, but luckily, hubby is a handy man and we got that solved in a Jiffy. The bathrooms were clean, but the TV was crap ... then again, they have free wifi so we just watched off of our tablets ... seriously, tvs in hotels are a thing of the past!Anyways, all in all. I like it. and as always, bring your own towels and extra sheets and pillow cases ... NEVER EVER under any circumstances, regardless of where you are, EVER TRUST hotel/motel towels and sheets.Horrible customer service at this hotel - pay the extra $10 and stay somewhere else.  The front desk clerk was probably the least helpful person we have ever met.  We ended up not even staying the night after 2 hours of going around with the front desk clerk to confirm the reservation we booked through the <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> app.  The hotel was poorly kept up and the minute we pulled up to the front we regretted our choice (you get what you pay for) so we were glad we didn't stay.  The front desk clerk denied our request for a refund on the room on top of everything else - so we paid for two hotel rooms by the time everything was said and done.  Drive the 0.5 mile down the road to the Comfort Inn and stay there!  Nice staff, quick check in, cheap rates, and nice rooms.Very dirty eating area.   Creepy.   Smelled like smokers had been in room, even though said non smoking.   But hotels very high , over priced in area , so cheaper ones are pretty bad.  This one added to my top 4 worst hotels ever.Obviously it is a Super 8 so don't expect anything too fancy. The location was fine but the pool is not really usable for lying out. Our room smelled weird and we were told they had no other rooms to move us to but the complex was blatantly not full. The manager, Sue, was unfriendly and abrupt. She made sure to shut down the entire breakfast at 9:30 on the dot - she didn't even leave the few pieces of bread out to be finished. Made sure Super 8 wasn't losing any money to its guest.I booked this through orbitz, and with most hotels, that I use orbitz for?  they hate outsiders booking their hotels...   usually, that conversation doesn't come up, until after I've been there for a few days, AND usually, I don't use orbitz.  however, I was making reservations for up north, where I couldn't find ANYTHING that I could afford, so I went with orbitz.  they offered to help me find a place that took dogs up in virginia, and then asked me about the rest of the trip.  So this place came up, and I booked it.I booked this pretty far in advance, thinking that I wouldn't be able to find anything in peak season.  I also called and confirmed this reservation THREE times to make sure all was in order.  I even dropped a night, thinking we'd hit biloxi on the way back, just for fun.however, I must say, the attitude that I got checking in?  was shameful.  I must say, if you buy into a hotel chain, you must comply with what they offer.  If you don't want to run your hotel like that?  then buy your OWN hotel, and deny outsiders from booking.  DON'T take it out on your customer, and then try to extort more money from them at check in.Right off the bat?  in an empty hotel?  the lady at the desk?  she didn't want to give me a room.  she claimed she knew nothing of our dog, and they had no dog rooms.  (mind you, just days ago?  I confirmed this reservation)  She also said there was a fee for the dog, WHICH I knew about, because it says $15 a night.  They tried to get $20 a night from me, and I stood my ground.  She basically tried to make me feel like I had no room, and if I did?  there was no room for the dog.  If I wanted my dog?  then it was more...  then her child began to give me the what for.  then after she and I cleared the air, her husband came out and started in on me.  WTF?I made a reservation, I paid it, and I'm here.  here's your extra $30 for my dog, can I have my key?I got into my room, checked with orbitz, who got two nights paid from me, and no dog charge on it...  so I'm fine with that.  I had to make sure I wasn't being charged twice.then the retired folks with two dogs?  came over and asked us about our dog.  They had a similar reservation, and told $15 as well, then they were told they had to pay $20 a dog.  so these snow birds paid $40 for one night, for their two little dogs to stay with them.I don't like starting out on a wrong foot.  I also know that if I had called on my own?  I probably would've gotten the room for even cheaper. (or the same)  and that money would've been a profit for these folks.  HOWEVER, I booked through an agent, and I really don't appreciate the attitude at the beginning of my stay.   And their child?  its none of his business.  that was over the top rude.now lets get back to the revue.  the rooms are nice.  spacious.  refrigerators, hair dryer, double towels, a bathwater pool, and a jacuzzi.  microwave.  nice.  very nice.  you can walk to the beach, its just a great deal.I will avoid the breakfast, and avoid any conversations for my two night stay with the owners of this establishment.  I will caution anyone who decides to stay here?  to book direct, and not through a travel agent, or suffer the wrath of disappointed hotel owners, during peak season.  (or any season for that matter)  I stay at super 8's because they take dogs, they advertise it, and each one has a little different price for your four legged friends...  but I've never encountered such chaos at check in, never.  It was unneccesary, because I'd already paid for the room, and it was uncalled for, just to make a point because its a recession.  I realize these folks feel ripped off by an agent, but the point of this?  its policy, and if you don't want to adhere to it?  you need to learn more about corporate policies.  Trying to ruin someones vacation isn't a nice thing to do.also, if you use a credit card HERE?  you will be charged double for about a week or so, so they can collect some sort of interest on it.  also, in case you break or steal something, which is standard.    also take note, any gas stations here in the south, that are credit only?  will put a $60 hold on your card, regardless of how much gas you buy.recession?  or republican state?  you tell me.aside from all my rant?  I would definately stay here again, but I'd do it on a drop in basis only, with cash only in hand, no credit card offered.  From what I can see?  there are plenty of rooms available tonite.We were only going to be in town for a couple of days and we had plenty on the agenda for our time in St. Augustine so where we stayed really wasn't a priority. As long as everyone in the group had a place to rest their heads at night we were happy. I must say that I am incredibly impressed with this hotel. A super 8 is an economical place to stay so you'd never expect there to be such specious rooms, new/modern furniture inside, new-looking tiles and rugs, and employees that are truly there to make every guest feel like they're the only ones in the building. Even the maid's were just the happiest people ever. It was so refreshing. I have stayed at WAY more expensive places and been treated ;ole dirt on the floor even though I was dishing out the big bucks. Here, it was just a joy to talk to ANY of the staff.The only thing about this place that wasn't really spectacular was the breakfast, but, its hotel food.. what can you expect. lol This place is located minutes from all the attractions in St. Augustine. they have all the amenities that any bigger hotel would have, and also.. I wish I had written down the name of it but its the first place on the brochure binder inside.. quite possibly the best pizza I have had delivered. Ever. I enjoyed my stay here very much and intend on recommending this place to my family should they ever come visit.Recently, I was headed down to the beach for a night of drinking, and didn't want to drive home, and was looking for a place to stay on the island. The Hilton and Hampton Inn were both booked or too expensive. I drove in to the Super 8 just down the road, and BAM! Plenty of cheap rooms available.Now, the rooms are cheaper for a reason- it's a Super 8, and you're not on the beach side of A1A. A lot of the hotels were charge a lot more because they ""own"" their own beach, and a lot of the rooms have ocean views. Since I basically needed a bed to crash, the view wasn't as important to me - Super 8 it is!Overall, it was a pretty decent stay. The room was clean, fully stocked, and the bed was comfortable. For anyone who needs the info- it's about a 300 foot walk to the public beach, and it's next door to a convenience store which is nice, and within walking distance of many clubs and restaurants. Being a Super 8 however, there's no real frills- don't expect a flat screen HDTV, the ""continental breakfast"" is cereal and orange juice, and it can be sometimes hard to locate someone to help you at the front desk.Overall, though, my stay was great, definitely worth the money. It was much cheaper than the other hotels in walking distance - the rooms may not have been as nice, but it was clean and comfortable, and within walking distance of many drinking establishments and the beach.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-historic-bayfront-saint-augustine,Hilton Historic Bayfront,4.0,$$$,38,"Location is fantastic. Bayside and within walking distance of shops, restaurants and the major sights. It's pricey compared to other options and the property is small. If you can luck into a room with a balcony like we did it's a plus. The majority of the rooms did not have a balcony so ask or if you checkin non the mobile app I can tell you rooms 132. 133, 134 do so it gives you more space.A small hotel.  My husband (who stayed in Hilton's when he traveled extensively for work) was very disappointed and felt this location was not up to Hilton standards).   I agree with another reviewer that the parking ($24/night) was a little steep.  Most of the high-end hotels charge for parking, but usually $15 - $20/night.   The rooms were small but nice, although the bathroom was in need of updating.2 major complaints:1)   The water pressure in the showe was terrible.  Very poor shower-head2)    The coffee crafe in the lobby was empty when we gathered to meet our group in the morning.   We noted to one of the staff, but it was never re-filled.The positives were free Wi-Fi and free bottles of water in the room.The layout of this place is pretty cool. Really like the historic decor of the hotel. Room was clean and service was good. It's totally in the heart of the festivities.Location is very convenient. It's right in the middle of everything. The Castillo is across the street and lots of restaurants and shops nearby. The hotel definitely needs a little love. Walls in hallways need to be painted. Lots of touch ups needed. For this price range in hotel I would think they would keep up with maintenance. The beds are very comfortable but when it comes to housekeeping.... They fail miserably which is why I wouldn't come back and I'm only giving them 2 stars. There was popcorn in our bedside table. Probably left over from last guest (or who knows how long it's been there). It was never cleaned while we were here. When beds are made in morning they just pull covers up and throw pillows on top instead of properly making bed. Isn't the whole point of spending extra money on hotel vs renting something to have someone make your bed for you? Bathroom cleanup isn't much better. They just took the used towels. No tidying up of shampoos/soaps as they normally do at hotels. When searching for hotels I looked on Yelp and saw some of the negative reviews. I chose to book it anyway since they had some great reviews and location was very convenient. But now that I've stayed I really wish I had booked a different hotel. There are a ton of inn's and other chain hotels in this same location.Loved Ivana at check-in. She took care of us and gave us a great room for our 10th anniversary!  Room 141 is on the ground floor near the pool so especially if you have young kids and want your things to be nearby, you definitely want this room!Pool was great! Overlooks the bay and chairs were so comfy!Decor/furniture were all modern and valet guys were super friendly!Spectacular. I arrived after sunset on a long drive from New Orleans. (I couldn't appreciate the full beauty until the following morning.)The valet attendant was inside but immediately helpful. The front entry is small but the Spanish-style charm is welcoming, as was the gal at the front desk. I took my belongings to my room and came back down to find a place for dinner. I found a spot in the block just behind the property, and the same gal from the front helped direct me there. I walked there and back by myself alone at around 9pm and felt safe.My room was nothing shy of lovely. I'd forgotten I booked a room with a whirlpool tub. And there was a quaint balcony with a decent view. I imagine it's a great spot for breakfast or an evening cocktail.The cleanliness was top notch. You forget how important that is until you don't have it, so it's worth acknowledging that this place is kept in prime condition. When I left the next morning, I was able to appreciate more of the beauty in day time. And, again, everyone was helpful and friendly: the gentleman at the front desk and the two valet attendants, one of whom remembered me from the night before.The hotel is only two stories high, to be expected from a beach front property. I had problems with a different three story property feeling (and smelling) like an old motel. This didn't at all. It truly lived up to the Hilton name. I wish I'd have been there longer to enjoy it.If you're going to stay in downtown St. Augustine, you might as well have waterfront, right? And the Hilton is a terrific place to spend a few days while visiting this historic town. We asked for one of the rooms right on the street with a balcony and enjoyed our entire stay.Highly recommend this upgrade if it's in your budget. You can have your own outside patio facing the water for those evenings sipping on wine and watching the sun go down after all the daytime tourists have gone home. So relaxing (and romantic) watching the lights downtown, bayfront bridges and the gorgeous boats go by against the backdrop of the night's sky. Very special and worth the money.Easy and friendly valet parking available with excellent customer service. Perfect location and walking distance to where you want to be in St. Augustine. Adorable hotel. Absolutely fabulous location!Excellent service and location.  Room was clean and very comfortable.  Internet was reliable and fast. We were fortunate to get a room with a balcony and a bay view.  We would definitely stay here again.  We stay at many Hiltons and this is right up there with the best!Had the chance to stay there during my visit to Saint Augustine. I was extremely happy with the location, the staff, and the room. I will recommend this hotel to anyone, and will be coming back , and staying there again.Super Hotel! Stayed 3 Nights.Most of the staff was excellent!! Valet Service was friendly, welcoming and knowledgable. Rooms were clean and spacious. I did not try any food while I was staying at the hotel and do regret it because I heard some amazing things. The only noticable issue I found there to be was the pool. During the first two days I noticed a green mold/bacteria in the hot tub. I mentioned something and it was gone the next morning however there was alot of sand on the bottom. The pool was dated. Room ammenities were vast and lovely. Free Wifi that did not work so well. For such a small hotel having 72 Guest rooms it should be simple to accomodate all rooms. More devices needed for signal strength.Would stay again.This Hilton is best for a tourist because of all of the sights, places to eat and activities. For me, a business traveler it definitely didn't suit my stay.Regardless that's not why the low rating, there were situations that were irritating. A major issue was that I paid extra for the bay front view and when I showed up, I was given the bay front but the balconies are openly connected. It was also next to a very busy road and where tourists/tours walk by nonstop. I really couldn't leave my blinds open since it was the 1st floor and open view. Consider that it's not a peaceful bay front view, it's actually of a road and interrupted by people ALL the time and THEN the bay. My balcony was also the corner walkway for hotel guests to get to the sidewalk so I had twice as much foot traffic right next to my room. I really am not exaggerating, the tourists were a 24 hour pain in the a$$. People were able to smoke cigarettes, hang out in front and stay on the sidewalk to stop and talk or take photo ops of the area. I sat on my porch for awhile when I decided I was over sharing my stay with strangers...definitely not okay.Next stop: the pool. That was a total joke. It was so small that 2 kids were enough to take over the pool. Maybe I could sit on the edge to enjoy their splashing. No thanks!Next? The gym! Okay, it wasn't bad! The machines were pretty good but definitely a small gym. It was clean and empty during my workout. The Tvs on the machines didn't have a signal but there was a giant hd tv. Room service and food was okay....no complaints. The front desk was super friendly and so was the rest of the staff. The valet was a forced fee and there wasn't a number to call on my card so you're forced to go ask for your car and waste time waiting for someone to get it. I'm not even sure how that's considered valet?! Isn't the point to have my car ready so I can grab it and go. When I told the valet guy I forgot something about an hour after he parked it he asked if I'd go get it, handed me my keys and told me my space number. He was nice but dude, your job is to handle my car. I just shrugged it off and grabbed it. Strange 'valet' though and I saved the tip for myself. Shoot, I'd hire me. I was quick for a first timer. Note to self: Add valet worker to my resume tomorrow. Joking, of course :)The area is the prime reason to stay. It's not secure or peaceful and the pool is tiny so I won't be back...ever again but if you want to be the best location to the touristy places it is worth checking out.The staff were all awesome, and very personable, great stay.  The rooms are a little on the smaller side, but that is to be expected here.  I usually try to avoid hotel restaurants, but this one was very good, and our waiter was excellent.Staff here was so much help!!! I needed some papers faxed and they accommodated me. The valet guys were all over making sure everyone was accommodated for in a timely manner. I got free breakfast vouchers and a balcony where I did all my work for the day!!! The rooms are super clean and so much shopping and eating within walking distance!Hit or miss with service. Beautiful location, especially facing the water. Haven't tried the restaurant yet but looks good and has great reviews.Stayed for the 4th of July, as I didn't want to deal with traffic getting in and out of the fireworks at the fort, which are a great show. Got a chance to burn some Hilton Honors points, and it was worth it. Rooms were nice, views were of the bay are great. location, location, location. The only drawback of the stay for me, is the air conditioner doesn't have a always on mode, for the ambient noise. Front desk staff was helpful, pool was a bit small, but you can't expect an Olympic size pool when you are in a historic district folks. Beds were comfortable, late check out is a bonus. Will definitely come back next year.Stayed 2 nights in this St Augustine hotel. It is small, quaint, and blends in to local Spanish historical flavor.  Room was small and a little dated but adequate, bathroom was more modern and very clean. Just a side note - the USB port was disabled on the TV, and I had planned to review some important work videos. Why is this necessary? The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the location perfect for walking to just about any venue.. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in a city like this. There are other more 'motelish' properties nearby, but the hilton rate was fair considering it was a full service hotel. Parking rate is high but it seems many brand name hotels are doing this unfortunately. But again with the great location we never had to take the car out until checkout. Love this city, we will be back soon.This facility was very weak for a Hilton. It's a great location, but the building was dated and in poor condition, and the room was downright tawdry. For the price, I was pretty bummed.I am oly reviewing the restaurant in this hotel: Aviles.  This is my 3rd visit.  The first two where great meals.  This time when we made reservations we were told that is was ""some great steak and seafood."" AWESOME!! But when we got there we found that what they meant to say was that NOW on Saturday Nights, they only do steak and seafood and the regular menu was not available.   We went with it .. we ordered the seared tuna for an appetizer ($13), split the Prince Cut Filet ($30) and it can with one side which we chose the lobster mac and cheese.  But added haricot verts, for $5 extra.You were allow to have as many accompaniments with the steak as you wanted: Garlic butter, onions mushrooms, Bordelaise Sauce and others.1. App was great!2. Steak cam out as ordered, rare, and my wife wanted onions and mushrooms that also can out but were COLD (odd since the menu says everything madeto order , the I was told my Bordelaise Sauce was not ready but would be in a few minutes and the waitress did not want our food to get overcooked sitting under the heat lamp, so she brought out what was ready.3. Large pieces of lobster in the mac and cheese w/ lobster, but no cheese and rather bland at best.4. the side of green beans, amounted to 7-10 haricot verts!5. All the items were placed on one plate -- my side should have come on the SIDE.6.Still waiting for my rich Bordelaise Sauce ... what i got was a broth with chopped onions and shallots and NO flavor ... Bordelaise Sauce should be smooth rich texture that coats the steak .. what a disappointment!  Plus I had nearly finished my steak!The Hotel is 4 diamond from AAA ... I asked them ""how long have you been changing your menu on Saturdays - I was advised only 4 weeks.  Several customers came in and left when they were told that the Saturday menu was steak and seafood.I feel more like a 3.5 star for this visit as the other 2 would have been 5's.A great location in St. Augustine.The hotel is top notch in regard to cleanliness and service.Breakfast was good with eggs cooked to order. Being a Diamond Member mine was provided at no cost.The location is perfect, just valet ( my only deduction) and walk to anything.Keep in mind that I hate valet only parking but if you are familiar with downtown historic Saint Augustine then one would understand.A refer? Yes.Great Place.This place is overpriced.  Okay if you're a tourist with money to burn, but for the price go to The Best Western just up the street.  The room was spacious, but it was noisy outside.  The service was MEH. Our 2nd night ended up being quite a bit more expensive then our first night.  Our room wasn't made up until we asked for it to be done late on the 2nd day. There was no effort on the part of the management to do anything about this. The restaurant is very expensive and you have no choice but to valet park your car ($21 a night).  Our TV wasn't working well but we fixed it ourselves.  For the money this place wasn't worth it.  We will save our pennies and go elsewhere.We felt nicked and dimed at every turn.I expected so much more for the money. I will say that the hotel staff (the housekeepers, etc. i.e those that aren't making any money) went above and beyond our expectations.  But Hilton...YOU DISAPPOINTED US.  Big time.","Great location. Clean. Nice and helpful staff. My only complaint would be the air conditioner. When running, it sounded like a small plane was landing in the room. Will be a deal killer if every room is like that...What a great place. Billing itself as the smallest proper Hilton in the Americas, it has been designed to fit nicely into St. Augustine's historic district.  We opted for a room with a private balcony overlooking the water.  We had a beautiful view of the Bridge of Lions and the island on the other side.Inside, the room was clean and nicely appointed.  The fact that the hotel's 72 rooms are split amongst several small buildings add to the sense of privacy.Parking is valet only and costs $21 per day.  Here is where we lose a star. To me, valet parking should be a convenience, not a requirement.  And if you're staying at the hotel you don't really have any other parking options anyway. To me it's like renting a jet ski for the day, only to find that they're charging an extra $21 for getting it wet -- it's an unnecessary extra fee that you HAVE to pay if you want to stay there, not a convenience charge like they try to make it sound.  I'm angry about it, and I even knew about it ahead of time.  I'm sure some people don't notice it when they book, I feel bad for them finding out at the front desk.Alongside the front lobby of the hotel is the Aviles restaurant.  Like most other proper Hiltons, as well as most Doubletrees and HGI's, this hotel offers free breakfast for 2 people for each night you are staying if you are a Gold tier or higher HHonors member.  The breakfast at Aviles is as much as $17 per person, so that can be a significant savings.Too bad more than half of those savings are eaten up by the ridiculous parking fee.  Not that I'm bitter.The infused waters, great staff, and extra appointments always garner an extra star at Hilton hotels. The parking fee here is pretty steep. If I were here on leisure I would park somewhere else after unloading my stuff. You can walk everywhere from here. Go out the back door and hang a right. Everything you could want is right down the old streets.The smallest Hilton in the Americas is not at all small in terms of quality.They have valet parking that is not included in your room charge. So please take note of this if you're going to stay here. We already knew ahead of time, and actually found it to be more convenient than we had imagined. The concierge and valet folks are extremely courteous and allowed us to take things from the car if we needed to, and even let us leave the car there while we spent the check-out day walking around town.The rooms may be smaller than most Hiltons, but they do not lack charm, quality, and most importantly, cleanliness. Our King-sized bed was comfortable, and the Bayfront view did not disappoint. Do keep in mind that the bayfront is across the busy street from the hotel. Nothing is right up along the bay except for the road and Castillo de San Marcos. But what a great view of the Bridge of Lions nonetheless.What a convenient location this hotel is in, too! We walked back and forth between destinations and nothing was too far or strenuous.I would've given this hotel 5 stars if not for a very confused and perhaps somewhat inexperienced staff member at the front desk when we were trying to check in. He seemed to be reading things wrong left and right, and even misinformed us as to where our room would be. Luckily, the clearly more experienced staff member came to his rescue and all was right again.Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that's planning on staying in St. Augustine and willing to spend just a tad more than just any ol' hotel or motel. It was worth the price.What a great experience! The staff was very welcoming, and the property was beautiful. We only stayed one night, but I wish we could have stayed longer. Everyone we encountered--from the front desk to the valet and even the restaurant staff--was friendly, courteous and efficient. This is the way a hotel is supposed to run.The Nicer hotel to staying in St.Agustin In the middle of everything. We enjoyed. I know that the price for the valet it's over but onetime you parking you can walk thru the city we not problem everything is around the hotel. Which it's make it very practical. The rooms are very, very cleans and safe you will feel very comfortable.Having stayed at zillions of Hilton's around the world, this one is certainly quaint... It is possible to get a room with a balcony. Other than that, it's really about location, which can't be beat if you want to visit St Augustine. Everything is within walking distance. Kinda ironic since the valet hides your car away safely... You won't need it til you leave. :-)nice hotel, i enjoyed it a lot, the restaurant inside could use a little price reduction, it was justtttttttt a tap too muchI stopped at the Hilton Historic Bayfront for a quick visit to St. Augustine.  Tiny by Hilton's standards, the hotel still provided everything that we needed for our visit.  Our room was comfortable, with a balcony overlooking Matanzas Bay.  It was unfortunate that the door to the balcony was broken so that only a small bolt lock kept the door closed but the room still seemed relatively secure and the door stayed shut when closed.The room itself had two comfortable queen sized beds, a writing desk, and a couple of chairs.  The room also comes equipped with a good sized TV and a mini-fridge for stocking your own beverages.Room service operates only from 7am until 11pm.  It would be nice if they started earlier and ended later but it was quick when we called.As others have noted, this hotel is within walking distance of just about everything in Old St. Augustine so it is a great location for anyone who likes to walk.We would definitely stay here again.This review feels very redundant but everyone's pretty much covered it already... great location, $21 per day valet-only parking (but you won't need your car), excellent rooms, nice staff, so-so amenities. So nice job, yelpers... you nailed it! Keep up the good work.What a great hotel. From the Valet to the FD to the wait staff, everyone is extremely nice and friendly. Will be back for sure. Wonderful breakfast too and it was free because we are Hilton Honors Diamond members which was a great perk. Balcony in our room allowed for us to leave the door open and enjoy the breeze and the noise from below while relaxing. Great getaway for our anniversaryVisited for a weekend. Overall it was a pleasant stay and we would stay at this hotel again. While we were highly impressed with some of our experiences others were rather disappointing.Pros: Front desk staff was top notch. Among the most pleasant and professional we've experienced anywhere in the world.Valet service was also excellent. Quick, efficient, and professional.Location can hardly be beat. Right in the heart of St. Augustine.Cons:Maintenance is clearly lacking. Broken shower rod barely attached to the wall. Rusty vanity mirror also barely hanging onto the wall. Cracked tile, etc. These are simple fixes yet they go unaddressed.Several dirty drinking glasses (presumably from previous guests) sitting on the floor outside of the door to our room when we checked in. We half expected to open the door and find the room still occupied.Breakfast buffet was one of the worst we've ever encountered. Pancakes were cold and hard as rocks. Similarly, what we think was French toast was cold and solid. The pan that once held potatoes sat empty and ignored throughout the entirety of our meal. Grits were cold. Truly bad.There are ash trays on the balconies outside of the non-smoking rooms. So, if you wish to enjoy sitting on your balcony you may be subjected to someone four feet away smoking on the balcony next door. The ashtrays should be removed.Rooms small. Beds comfortable. Valet parking required is a pain and expensive. Location good but touristy...a bit tacky too..price for room high..noise level is high..could use new carpet in some areas.  The extra price for the balcony is nice facing the water but then you have parties to contend with. Probably not worth it in the end.As most Yelpers and reviews noted, the small pool, smaller rooms, limited HHonors Gold perks (only 2 free breakfasts) and parking score some lower points. But location, location, location. Did I say great location in historic St. A? We had a great view of the fireworks poolside. Service is great! That made up for most things that may be lacking. The GM was making the rounds at breakfast, hotel housekeeping staff were attentive, and restaurant service was great. The morning buffet was smaller than other Hilton hotels and made to order eggs and waffle maker sometimes got behind but their professional service was outstanding. Balcony rooms are a plus but expect it to be harder to get or comes with a premium. You can park in the city lot or in the trolley lots and tool around by foot or trolley as most everything is accessible with a short or minimal walk. I'd come back again without question.Nice hotel.  Not beautiful, but very nice.  The view was great from our bay front second story room.  We asked for a quiet room...what did we get?  A room next to the elevator where loud conversation took place every half an hour.  Can you say 'thin walls'?   Parking and breakfast buffet was steep.  Parking fee was mandatory.  Skip the buffet.  So many other cute places to eat.My girlfriend and I escaped to the Hilton Historic Bayfront for a romantic overnight getaway, and we weren't disappointed with our stay. If you've been in old-town St. Augustine you've surely seen the hotel, located right across the street from the Fort and the Bridge of Lions. The price was a tad high, but we got the last room available at a reduced price, so we can't complain. The hotel was decorated for Christmas very nicely and added to our visit. Check in was easy, but one of our biggest gripes comes from the fact that they force you to pay a $21.00 valet parking fee. I personally feel like if I'm shelling out $140.00 a night for a room, you ought to be providing the parking for free - especially since they use their own private parking garage anyway.I didn't see a pool anywhere, but I did see signs saying there was one. The valet service was quick and there was no damage to our vehicle. The hotel includes a restaurant, but after reading several negative reviews on Yelp and other sites, we opted to visit A1A Ale Works instead. It's just a short walk across the courtyard. Our room was located at the very back of the main building, which felt private, and was definitely quiet. We had a King size bed and hot tub in our room. The hot tub is more like a two person Jacuzzi and it took FOREVER to fill up. Well not forever, but at least 30 minutes we had to wait. There was very little water pressure out of the faucet, but no big deal. The shower had good pressure. The room was very nice, with nice furniture and a big comfy bed. Everything was very clean and new looking. There was a hidden mini-fridge and a coffee maker with two mugs and two travel cups. We thought that was neat. The room had a nice plasma TV, but it's wasted on crappy standard def channels. My biggest gripe overall with the room is that the air conditioner is VERY LOUD. Every time that sucker kicked on during the night it woke us both up. Unfortunately it's still 80 degrees here in FL even with Christmas two days away, so it was kicking on and off a lot. Overall we enjoyed our visit and when we were asleep we were comfortable and cozy. I'd recommend the hotel for a nice overnight, but I'm not sure it's great for extended stays (especially with that daily parking fee). P.S. Beware, they will charge your credit card $20.00 to cover any incidentals you might rack up. We assume this is to cover PPV movies (which run at $16.99 a pop!) but still it's inconvenient to have $20.00 locked up for ""3-5 days.""Really a nice hotel with a great location.   Parking is $21/day but your vehicle is safe in their underground garage.   Just wish the front desk staff were as helpful and friendly as the valet parking guys. We checked in ~ noon.  I've been a rewards member for over 20 years and just wanted a room with a balcony.  You would have thought I was asking for the the moon.  They finally admitted there might be a balcony room available later in the day.  So, we left our stuff in the lobby and got a call that they had one for us.   They did - overlooking the entrance/parking area...  Won't be back -the other hotels the B&amp; Bs offer more for your money.I got married a few weeks back, and since the reception was held downtown, my wife and I wanted to get a hotel in historic St. Augustine, so we would be able to go out on the town and enjoy our night, and not have to drive anywhere. Like most places downtown (and since it was a holiday), the Hilton required a two night minimum stay, but it was still less expensive than the Casa Monica or other hotels in the area.Check in was easy- the gentlemen at the front desk was VERY friendly and helpful. Room was very, very nice. King size bed, recliner with ottoman, flat-screen TV, HUGE bathroom, and an awesome balcony which looked out over the bayfront. Had an amazing view of the Bridge of Lions and the Castillo, and it was a great way to enjoy your morning cup of coffee.Room was clean, well-stocked with a TON of amenities, and the bed was super comfortable. Pool was relatively small, but looked clean and well-kept. Also had a cool memorial where they had kept steps that was the location where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr was arrested during a protest in the 60's. Nicely decorated hotel that fits in nicely with the downtown historic motif. Price for the room was definitely not cheap, however for the location, the fact that it was a holiday weekend, and it was my honeymoon, it was definitely worth it.Restaurant located in the main lobby, as well as the room service, was pretty pricey, but they offered up some nice food selections- but with all the great restaurants in downtown SA, you shouldn't really bother unless you want straight room service. Parking is mandatory valet, and at $24 a day, that's upsetting to a lot of people- understandably so... also remember parking downtown is a NIGHTMARE and can be VERY expensive if you don't find a good spot, so as long as you're not driving anywhere, it's cheaper and easier to go that route.Had a great stay here- everything I wanted and more. Would definitely recommend for anyone staying downtown- if you're willing to pay the price. There are other hotels up the road, you'll save money, but definitely won't be as nice, and the location of this place can't be beat. My only complaint is knowing that some of my money has made it to Paris Hilton's pocket for some reason, but I had a nice enough stay that even that won't bring me down.",,,,"['location', 'fantastic',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/casablanca-inn-on-the-bay-saint-augustine,Casablanca Inn On The Bay,3.5,$$$,35,"We stayed here for a long weekend, for my sister's wedding. The inn does have an amazing location! The breakfast was good, but isn't necessarily included with your stay though...you get a credit towards it that doesn't cover all of it. We stayed in room 12 and it was kind of a strange room. The front room with the gigantic jacuzzi and furniture crammed in it was completely useless. The shower was teeny tiny. I will say, the bed was super comfy!!We enjoyed our stay, but compared to other bed and breakfasts I've been to...this one just lacked the charm and luxury.We came to Casablanca inn on the bay for Brunch after a night in St. Augustine. It was a lovely place to arrive at, but there was just Something ... off... Not sure. Our server, Bryan was good. But he wore his sunglasses for every interaction.. except when he dropped the bill off. I ordered the omlette and it was tasty, but the potatoes were cold. The boyfriend ordered something else, and his eggs - which should have had liquidy centers were hard. That was disappointing, but the coffee was good.  What's really sad is that they charged $2.00 for toast.1 star because no high chairs at the restaurant  and no changing table in the bathroom. Breakfast was ok, a little pricey. The restaurant has a hint of dirty. Beer bottles and cigarettes lined the flower beds and the corners of the patio dining area.Had a relaxing stay here. Location is close to everything downtown!We got a ""special"" for our room at $200 a night (supposedly $269 a night) however I think they say that to everyone.Either way it was an okay price since you get $15 in bar credit per night and $25 in food at their restaurant, Brunch, each day.Overall though, for the convenient location and perks of the bar and brunch place being connected, we enjoys our stay.The rooms were a bit outdated but they have been renovating. We stayed in the Coach house so it was an easy in and out of our balcony to the main road. The bed was a sleep comfort bed and it was comfy! Our room had a jacuzzi in it. It's not a huge one, but enough for two people.Parking is not on site, but they have a parking lot for guest to park their cars for free. It's about a block down. This isn't a problem because once you park you never really use your car anyway since everything is walking distance!This place is also pet friendly. We didn't bring our dogs, but it's always nice to know they have rooms that accommodate to this option.Thank you Sandra for assisting us this weekend!!!This place deserves negative stars! I booked at this place because it is supposed to be a nice waterfront B&amp;B. There is no parking near it. You have to park blocks away in their reserved area. Not only that but there is a huge tree in the middle of it so I had to do a five point back-in turn to squish between 2 cars while avoiding a tree. Now I'm all about saving the trees but get real if you are going to put a parking space there. Service SUCKS!!! This place is run by a bunch of dumb college kids who are more concerned with their social life on the clock than attending to paying customers. Myself and several others got no service after being seated out front and when going inside to the bar to order got yelled at for not sitting at a table. Sorry kids! Tried that! Sat there for 10 minutes waiting for your lazy asses to stop chit chatting at the bar. The room is nice but not secure. Got into my room &amp; housekeeping left the exterior door unlocked so the whole city could walk in. Then went to get ice from the ice machine, and slipped and fell on the tile floor because it was wet due to dropped ice that had melted on the tile and they have no rug in place. STAY AWAY FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY &amp; SECURITY!!!Oh, by the way Cassablanca...thanks for the bruised knees! Thanks to your reckless incompetence I now get to ""enjoy"" my vacation walking around on 2 bruised sore knees. NEVER AGAIN!!!!Good service and good menu. Great view of the water. Tried the beignets, good but a bit dense. Tried the croque madam which was very tasty but missing the ""crunch"" of the bread since normally they are toasted but flavor was really good. Nice way to spend a morning in st. AugWe had an extraordinary time at the Casablanca Inn. Beginning with calling late and needing a room and Katie being wonderfully nice, above and beyond, we just loved it. Everything about the place was great.Katie behind the desk and George running the bar were excellent and made us feel very special as guests. The room was great, and cool, and clean. They give you a breakfast credit and a bar tab credit. Additionally, they give you free parking. If you are a bourbon and scotch drinker, the bar has a very good array and selection. I personally loved the decor, woodwork, and art.We read a few negative reviews and noticed they were older. Apparently, if some things had gone wrong before, they were addressed and corrected.Kudos and many thanks to Katie and George especially for the outstanding service, and we will most definitely be back!The Inn is at a great location, maybe the best in St. Augustine. We arrived in our room to a chilled bottle of champagne.  We thoroughly enjoyed sitting on our balcony, out of the traffic and the river of people on the sidewalks, watching the activity. The view of the bay and the carriages across the street was lovely. Our room was great, very clean and well decorated. There is also a ""carriage house"" in back of the main house where the rooms are literally one step off of Charlotte street and looked like they could be fun to stay in as well. The free breakfast was good:eggs Benedict, potatoes, sausages and pan cakes.The downside: The price. I don't think the normal price is all that bad but due to the time of year and the particular room we stayed in I thought 400.00 was a bit much for what we got. I paid more to get this room because of the ""private"" balcony. Unfortunately, the balcony is also accessible from other rooms along an out door walkway and because of a broken divider chain, most of the people staying in those rooms thought the balcony was for their use as well. After my husband rigged up the chain again we didn't have anymore unexpected visitors. Also, one of the locks was broken on the balcony door entry and while the maintenance person was made aware of this, he did nothing to fix it. There was a second lock on the door that didn't look too trustworthy so before we went to sleep I pushed a chair in front of the door with a lamp on it which would crash to the floor if anyone opened the door. (My homemade alarm system!). Parking is somewhat inconvenient. The lot is actually about a 3 minute walk from the Inn. But I really didn't mind. It is a very old city after all and things were just built differently back then.  As for the staff, the housekeepers were very friendly ladies. The bar staff on the other hand, were very rude and would practically yell at you if you didn't take a seat quickly.While I actually overall enjoyed staying there this one time and only because of the location, I  will not choose to stay there again on my next trip.We were greeted and given a beautiful table but it took almost an hour for the breakfast to arrive. The menu sounded delicious but the food all arrived cold and frankly, just fair. Disappointing and frustrating. (We didn't stay in the hotel but just came for breakfast....) waitress was lovely but clearly overtaxed by the concept of taking orders and remembering who got what. PS the toast basket sounded like a cool concept but it was boring and cold. Bummer. Oh, and skip the smoked trout Benedict. Gross!What a disappointment. We arrived at the Casablanca Inn and was told that our room wasn't ready. Front desk stated they would call us when room was ready.  Not a problem. We decided to grab some lunch and wait for a call. Four hours later we still had not received a call so we checked back with front desk. They said that the room had been ready for a while but forgot to call. Was given an information sheet for the different amenities at the Inn which including Wifi login. Attempted to logon only to find out the password didn't work. We called the front desk to see if there was a problem with wifi only to be put on hold until we finally hung up and went to the front desk. She stated that wifi password had been changed and she wasn't aware of it until we inquired. Disappointed coffee maker not included in room especially for those rooms not attached to main house. We did have breakfast at the inn. The food was cold and over cooked. Poached egg like a golf ball and omelet was like rubber. The potatoes included in each meal were over seasoned hard and dry. We expressed our dissatisfaction to the server who offered no help to remedy the problem. About the same time we overheard the table behind us expressing dissatisfaction with their breakfast as well. Parking is free however the designated parking lot for the Inn is about a block away. Pick up and drop off is behind the Inn in alley way which accommodates 2 cars at best. We were excited about staying at the Casablanca Inn based on their website however looks were deceiving.Avoid.  This is the first review I've written with this warning.  So much fail in one place.We decided to try this place on a Sunday morning.  The hostess was totally, completely clueless and did not have the first idea how to greet guests, seat them, get them menus, and notify the server that they had a table.  So, after failing to even say ""hello"" the hostess wandered inside (we were out in the al fresco porch area), then wandered back out, showed us to a table, and wandered away again.  She did not give us menus.  About fifteen minutes later a harried server (not ours, apparently) stopped by and asked if we'd been helped.  ""Not yet,"" I replied.  ""Did you seat yourselves?"" she asked.  ""No.""  She bustled off and a few minutes later the hostess brought us *one* menu.   One.Finally our server stopped by.  He asked us what we wanted to drink and if he could bring anything.  ""Another menu would be nice,"" I said.  He told us that a large party had just come in and they had all the menus.  Eventually he brought another one out.I must say, the coffee was good.  That is the one redeeming feature of this visit.The food took a while.  When our server brought it out, he asked if he could get us anything else.  My BF had ordered breakfast, but his toast was missing.  He said, ""My toast.""  The server turned to get it, then came back to the table.  He said, ""I forgot to ask, did you want white or wheat?""  (this was at food delivery!)My hamburger was well done.  I always order hamburgers medium.  I realized the server had not asked how I wanted my meat cooked.  The pickle was dry.  I don't believe I've ever seen a dry pickle before.  It makes me wonder how long our meal had been sitting under heat lamps.My BF did not have a knife with his silverware.  The server did not reappear until we had nearly finished our food.  My BF spread his butter with his fork.I would have complained to the manager but I suspect management, or lack thereof, is the source of the problems.  We will not be back.Heard a lot of good things about this place.  Walked up no greaters told to seat ourself. We got the French toast it was ok but they served with cold syrup (not a fan of it cold) we also got the Cubano it was pretty damn good. Service was ok had to ask for the standards sweet n low, ketchup (cold) etc... Mayo was on the table sitting in the sun kinda scary egg product and all.Champaign waiting in room upon arrival, all the comforts of home and more, and a view of the bay that is to die for. First B&amp;B experience, and we love it here. Super location, close to everything and the Tini Martini Bar and outdoor seating downstairs is hoping at night with live entertainment. $15 credit at the bar each night you stay here. Could it get any better? Probably not.The Casablanca Inn really is very charming. The location can't be beat, free parking, credit at the martini bar, it's fantastic.  The staff were all VERY kind and helpful.  Even at 10:30 at night when I couldn't seem to figure out the AC/Heat combo window unit in my room, the bartender stopped running around to help me.  The con? Room #2.....it's RIGHT next door to the kitchen.  Until well past midnight there were banging dishes, people talking really loud and things being slammed. Outside of my room is a small deck walkway and someone dropped something that sounded like it weighed a thousand pounds, right outside my door.  I was up anyway from a late evening so I ignored the noises, but if you get in early or want a quiet getaway, do not allow this room to be assigned to you.This had to be one of the more interesting experiences out to eat. Took over an hour to get brunch. Eggs and bacon? The excuse was ""the cook walked out""... Right... In sure. Anyways bill came and they took 25% off. Really?!?! As someone who runs a restaurant I'm ashamed there was even a check after the long wait and sub par service... No manager in sight.I rented room 5.  I knew it was small and I was ok with that. We had to call 3 times to find where we were supposed to enter, park, check-in. Website said there was a loading zone in front. Nope. I stood in front of the Inn for almost 20 minutes waiting on someone to speak to me.  No one did.  I made eye contact with the same server 3 times. Nothing. I finally walked around the block to the rear where I still had trouble finding a proper entry or signage directing me. Parking was a nightmare. I went in what seemed to be a back door to a bar propped open for ventilation and climb through 2 different parties of people to find the check in desk. I asked that a manager speak with me in the morning about my troubles. The room was advertised with a private porch, which was a small chair, table and ashtray crammed into the corner on the entry stoop, which was slippery from the dripping patio above. (Not as shown in photos) The entry door was in what seems to be the utility courtyard, adjacent to the bar back entry/exit very near the trash. (Assuming since the clanking of beer bottles never ended)  Of the 2 keys only 1 worked for the room. The wood floor has a giant water stain in the entry. The room smelled of mildew and rotten fish.  The bathroom floor wasn't very clean with a rather gross something in front of the shower. No hot water.  The last thing for me was when I discovered the sink doesn't drain.  Gross.  We were here for a grand total of maybe 3 hours, half of which we were gone to dinner.  The 2 staff members I had interaction with were clearly young and immature and in no way deserving of ""managing"" such a bustling place.  When I went to turn in the keys and say we were leaving I was told a manager who could authorize my refund wouldn't been available until Monday.  You are a bar, a restaurant, AND a bed and breakfast, yet no one with the authority to refund my horrible experience or apologize for it is available until Monday? Glad I live in Jacksonville and the hour drive home was totally worth NOT having to sleep in your establishment or even try your food. (Website says breakfast is included but at check in that's not the case, its a food voucher for their restaurant).  I feel super bad for the people who came and had to endure the farce that is The Casablanca Inn On The Bay Tini Martini Bar Jubilee...We didn't stay at the B&amp;B but in regards to the restaurant, the food was mediocre at best, overpriced and not as warm as it should have been when it arrived at our table. The hostess failed to inform us before we were seated that there was a ""backup"" in the kitchen and the waitress only told us about it after we had ordered drinks. In case you were wondering, there are no beers on draft at this place and they can't serve liquor on Sunday until 1 pm. The smoked salmon Hemingway eggs Benedict barely had any smoked salmon on it and it was $14. Also, the place had a pretentious vibe. Overall, not a good value for the money.What a romantic place! The bay view is wonderful. I stayed there during the boat regatta at Christmas. I will definitely book a beautiful room there as a,holiday tradition!We spent our last morning in St. Augustine here.  The inside of the restaurant was packed, so we took a risk with the 50-degree weather and braved the empty patio.  The wonderful manager came out and pulled a patio heater next to our table.  He apologized for any slow service and explained that they just underwent a management change and this was reopening day.  Within a few minutes, our server, Rose, came out.  She was great!  Very friendly and cheerful!  The menu itself made it hard to decide what to order, everything sounded delicious.  We had mimosas and coffee with our Pear &amp; Brie Omelette and TABLE Sandwich (tomato, avocado, bacon, lettuce, egg).  The food couldn't be better!  Despite the weather, the restaurant has an amazing view of the St. Augusting fort and bayfront.  This is definitely our new go-to spot for brunch next time we're in St. Augustine!I have to give the manager, Amanda, huge props! After having been given the run around around by a few other B&amp;B's in town I was loosing any hope we'd find a room, but Amanda went above and beyond to help my husband and I get a room at the Inn during the GOTR Stopover this past weekend.  Big thank you Amanda!!! This was our first B&amp;B experience and we really enjoyed our stay. The room we stayed in was cozy and comfortable, almost like we were staying at a relatives home. The bed was a sleep number bed and one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in while at a hotel. We had a semi private porch with comfortable chairs and a love seat outside as well. Oh and almost forgot to mention you have actual KEYS to your room. When is the last time you had a key to get in your hotel room!? We just thought that was really cool. Breakfast in the morning was served buffet style with fresh fruit, muffins, eggs, home fries, sausage, blueberry pancakes and a few other things. For beverages you are offered coffee, tea, water, OJ and mimosa's. They have seating on the porch overlooking the bay or inside as well. The staff and chef were great and made you feel welcome to be there.The bonus feature to the inn is the martini bar on site and as a guest you get a $15.00 credit per night, per room to spend at the bar. The bikini martini was my drink of choice during our stay and WOW was is good. They have a huge list of martini's, there is sure to be one to please everyone. If martini's aren't your thing, they also have a good selection of beer. Again, just like everyone else, the bartender and waitstaff at the Tini Martini bar were wonderful. Thank you to everyone at the inn, you have customers for life!","Great location. Great views. Awesome holiday decorations. Amazing customer service. Great value. Delicious breakfast buffet included, plus TWO Mimosas per person, in addition to the $15 drink credit at the in house Tini-Martini Bar. Great art. Good clientele. Very quaint, cozy rooms. Must stay place! I would return.The Inn is on the bay; however, since we were staying one night, they would only rent us the room in their back building. The ridiculous thing is the rooms in both buildings are the same price. Then we got a table at 11p New Years Eve 2014 at the Martini Bar attached to the Inn. Waited 45 minutes to only get attitude from the bartender when we asked if we can order directly from him. Left in time for another restaurants awesome countdown. Since we're staying at the Inn, it made sense to enjoy the martini bar attached but everyone we spoke to for service was standing around saying the same thing, ""someone will be over shortly."" Interestingly, the Casablanca gave us free drinks as part of our stay. Little did we know the joke was on us, you won't get served. The bartender would only serve the seven ppl sitting at the bar and would ignore everyone else. Definitely the last time we stay here and we come to St. Augustine often.My first B&amp;B and I was quite impressed. From TV shows, I thought they were meant to be boring and very much like staying at your grandmother's house. At Casablanca Inn, it was not what I had expected. My husband and I stayed in the room downstairs and we had our own porch. We had a gate that opened and closed so we had privacy. It was neat to just step out on to our porch and walk on to the streets. Also, our room was very nice and spacious. Our bathroom had a jacuzzi and stand up shower. Also, TV with cable in all the rooms.  Overall, I loved the location for this B&amp;B. I like having the convenience of walking to the nearby shops and bars.Found our stay no better than average.  The location was awesome which was definitely a plus.  Had a beachfront balcony room which was quaint and comfortable.  Had to let hot water run for about 5 minutes in the morning before getting any hot water.  Wifi would not work at all in room 7.  All in all a good stay. Staff was polite.  The biggest plus here is location, location, location. Venue was chosen so as to be with a wedding party.  Would stay again if in the area. But might also shop around as there seem to be many attractive places to stay here. Good visit and I couldn't otherwise berate anything at the Casablanca Inn.We made our reservations here months in advance, two separate stays in one week staying in two different rooms. Our experience here was fantastic both times, but most of our time was spent in what turned out to be our favorite room, room 10 (second floor, southeast corner of the main building).  It had a huge private balcony with chairs and a couch directly above the front patio and overlooking the water. The bedroom is separate from the living area, so if one of you wants to sleep in longer than the other, you can close the door and not need to worry about making too much noise.We were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting for us on the day after our wedding.  Free parking for the duration of the stay was also a great benefit considering the Hilton next door charges you $22 a day to park a car there.The Tini Martini Bar downstairs is great as well (I've reviewed this separately). Every day that you stay at the Casablanca, you get a $15 credit at the bar.If you're looking for a great place to stay that's right in the middle of everything, but isn't going to set you back as much as the Casa Monica and still feels more personal than the Hilton, it's worth your time to check this place out.And if you don't mind plunking down the extra cash, the two rooms on the second floor facing the water are the best rooms available.I heart B&amp;Bs!  It was very lovely to stay the night here.  My friend and I drove up to St. Augustine and we read about this place in a guidebook of hers.  We decided to park on the street and then popped in to see if they had a room available.  We stayed in one of the rooms in the carriage house facing Charlotte Street with our own little patio, which we used to people watch, read and write post cards.  The bed was comfy, the bathroom beautiful, very cute room with nice paintings.  Breakfast was tremendously good with eggs benedict and french toast.  Yum!  Parking was included and helpful in a city where a parking spot can be difficult to find.  We didn't have to use the car again until we left the city.  The staff was courteous and helpful as well.  I would definitely love to stay here again with my fh.I normally stay at the St. Francis inn but they were sold out this time, so I went with Casablanca inn. Overall, I enjoyed it. Our room was cozy and they had a sleep number bed that was very comfortable with very high quality bedding making for a good night sleep. We got a bit lucky in that the room next to us was empty two of the three nights so no noise. The final night it was booked and I found I could hear all of their conversation and it was annoying, especially when they started the hot tub at 7 am. I give the Casablanca props for their location and the bar. The location is extremely central and has a great view of the bay. The bar is a fun and lively place for St. Augustine, though I found the price of their martinis a bit high for the quality. A woman next to me ordered a makers mark manhattan, and maybe the seemingly new cocktail waitress was confused, but she said it would cost $17.50 bringing a look of horror to the woman's face. A manhattan at a Manhattan price I guess. The one glaring gap at the Casablanca is food. With the exception of a fairly modest breakfast they really don't make food for their guests. Other B&amp;Bs I've stayed at like the St. Francis really try and excel in this area to create more of an experience for their guests like that of being pampered. The Casablanca didn't show much interest in this area. I had a pretty funny moment at the Casablanca that I got a chuckle out of and its kind of  indicative.  i walked up to the front desk and noticed a tray of cookies next to the clerk. I assumed they were meant for guests since at the St. Francis B&amp;B  there was always something out for guests to treat themselves to, so I asked, "" may I have a cookie."" The young lady looked at me - paused - and said seriously "" oh, I guess you can have one."" Detecting her sincere reluctance,  I told her no need if she is that reluctant.  I expected her to correct herself and say, ""oh I'm sorry but of course you can have one."" instead she remained silent. I'm sure it was all harmless, but I found it pretty hilarious. Personally, I prefer to stay at places like the St. Francis.We've stayed here a number of times through the years and have always enjoyed it very much. This is our first visit back since they've added The Tini Martini Bar. I love everything about this B&amp;B and the staff is so courteous you feel as if you are friends, but I was completely disappointed with the bar staff. I found most of them to be rude and indifferent when we came into the bar a couple of times. This was a surprise to me because we've never experienced this while staying here. I will continue coming to this beautiful B&amp;B because it is simply a lovely place to get away so close to home, but will stay out of their new bar, not a pleasant environment.We stayed in the #30 Secret Garden room &amp; we loved it! I wasnt sure how the lay out was before I stayed here but the Secret Garden is 3 rooms hidden behind the inn &amp; carriage house, you back up to Pizzaleys which is a yummy italian place with great specials &amp; allows dogs to sit on the porch with you as you eat! I liked the seclusion of it all and I'm glad I chose this room. Its more of a small apartment then a hotel room &amp; has beautiful old wood furniture &amp; a huge sleep number bed. I happened to really enjoy the art &amp; like to read so having the porch furniture outside &amp; the sitting area in the room was very nice. The mini fridge was a nice side so we could store our yummy leftovers [the restaurants tend to close early here Sunday-Thursday which is when we stayed].The help is very friendly, the rooms are kept up well, theres maid service every day &amp;  a beautiful martini bar in the front of the bed &amp; breakfast. I'm not an early riser so I didn't get to utilize the breakfast &amp; mimosas they serve in the morning but the snack at 5 was awesome! I was expecting a couple cookies on a table but it ended up being yummy little ham &amp; cheese sandwiches + tuna salad sandwiches, pizzas cut up into small bite size chunks, popcorn, chips &amp; candy.... but the cookies were still my favorite! The only downside I found with the whole place is that the wireless does not reach the secret garden rooms... We rectified this by turning my boyfriends phone into a hotspot but I could see where that might be a nuisance to some... not me though!Room #3, great little place to stay in a town with lots to do! You get snacks at 5, breakfast with mimosas and a bar credit of $15 each night you stay!Stayed here for weekend because it is one of the only B&amp;B's that is right on the bay. Overall our stay was great. The hospitality was superb and the room was clean and beautiful with all modern luxuries. Parking is reserved for you in a special lot they have a couple blocks away - not a big deal. The breakfast in the morning was fantastic. They give you so much food and also a variety of options to suit your needs. The coffee was also great and we also got suprise Mimosas which we didnt know were included. The view is brilliant when you are eating breakfast here. The one star deduction is because of the martini bar right on the front porch (same place you eat breakfast in the morning). Its is very very loud at night and if you are looking for a nice quite B&amp;B to come home to after a long day of visiting attractions, this might be a pain to some. You do get a $15 credit at the bar each night, however we could people talking loudly from our room one of the nights. Overall I would recomend the Casa Blanca as long as you dont mind the noise at night. Ask for a room that is in the back and you will be OK.Stayed here two weekends ago (July 19th or so) and had a wonderful time!  We arrived from Winter Park around 9 pm and were trying to figure out whether or not we should stay at the Casa Monica.  We drove around and ended up down a narrow brick road where the back entrance of Casablanca Inn is located.  The vacancy sign was up so we decided to check out the prices.  I read about the Casablanca Inn on the interweb and went onto the website even before going to the Inn - the website said it was all booked so we skipped out on reserving it online.  Good thing we didn't completely take it off of our list as there were several availabilities when we actually walked in to inquire.  We looked at two of the carriage rooms and selected one of them - they were both set up pretty much the same with a sitting area that faced the cobblestone road where we could people watch while having a glass of wine.  We selected one of the rooms and got an awesome deal on it as we arrived late ($169 for the night - usually $199).  Melissa at the front desk was pretty awesome.The room was great - plasma TV, tub with jets, clean, cutely decorated.  We didn't have loud neighbors or anything so it was perfect.  The room came with a two course breakfast and drink tickets for the in-house bar (the Tini).  We had a couple of glasses of red wine in the evening and enjoyed an beautiful breakfast where we had a selection of egg's benedict, yogurt &amp; fruit with free-flow mimosas while overlooking the bay.  The Casablanca is in walking distance to all the shops, bars and restaurants.  You can hear live music coming from the bars in the area and it's great people watching.  I really enjoyed the staff at the Inn who were friendly enough to stop by and chat with us when we were chilling out on the front porch of our room.  They are really relaxed and I anticipate going back to the Casablanca in the near future.We have stayed at Casablanca twice now. First stay in the honeymoon suite was the best. It's very romantic, comes with a sleep number bed, very cozy and clean. Great staff. The sheets smell AWESOME!!! It's rather expensive, but it's worth it for the romantic bed and breakfast feel. The bar downstairs gets busy at night, but it's never noisy. Definitely recommend this place for a romantic weekend. There is limited parking, so you might have to park a couple blocks away from the place, but they assign you your spot so it's not that big of a deal.Decent for the price. We stayed for 3 nights in a room fitted with a queen size ""dial your number"" bed. Very uncomfortable. It felt like we were camping on an air mattress. Otherwise, the double jacuzzi was a pleasant addition. Breakfast the first morning was decent. The waitress informed us that they had a supply of soy milk (as we had requested). We were thrilled. She offered us oatmeal, which we ordered with vigor, and then received a bowl of raw oats! The waitress said she had never heard of oatmeal before and didn't know it needed to be cooked! We had to ask twice for our mimosas, and never received drinking water at the table.Our second morning we opted to eat breakfast at a local bagel shop.Our third morning service appeared to have improved slightly, although we played it safe and just asked for Raisin Bran and toast.They seemed to have trouble keeping enough coffee going, as I had to hunt twice for more coffee.At checkin they we're very excited to tell us that we get a $15 credit at the Tini Martini Lounge located on premises. After checking out we noticed that they only applied the credit once, although we had been to the lounge  twice.The service at the Tini Martini lounge was very inconsistent. Our first night there we were greeted warmly and served promptly. Our second night there we appeared to be a bother to both bartender and waitress. Both ignored us and then finally served us begrudgingly. We were made to feel very unwelcome and decided to leave...but had to wait 10 minutes for someone to find the waitress to cash us out.All in all, the location is great...everything else is middle of the road...and avoid the Lounge.OK - first of all, a part of me says that you get what you pay for... Made a quick last minute trip to St Augustine and literally booked this the morning of our arrival after several calls to different inns and hotels who had no vacancy.  They had a few rooms starting at $159 on up to over $200... since we were only staying one night, we figured the small room for $159 would be fine since we didn't want to spend a lot for just one night on a quick getaway.  Well, it was 'fine' but a little 'blech'... we had the Gonzalez Sanchez room which was accessed outside and behind the inn with a small window fitted with an a/c unit.  We had to keep the shades down the whole time as people would have to pass our window to get into the back of the inn from Charlotte St.  So it was dark and cramped.. The carpet showed where water leaked in from the door... whether that day (it was rainy when we got there) or previously, I don't know.  In any case, we were afraid to walk barefoot on the carpet. The old fashioned glass doorknob on the bathroom door fell off as my husband simply tried to pull the door open - it wasn't latched or anything - but the knob fell off as he pulled.  The bed was a double so we expected to be a bit cozy, but it was so saggy that we kept rolling into each other at the center all night... That, along with the on-off compressor noise of the window a/c unit made for a very sleepless night.  Granted, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in our room, but I haven't been in a room like this since roadtripping in college when we'd book a $39/night room off the highway... On the bright side, we did enjoy the little martini bar and the view from the front porch over the bay... based on other reviews, their pricier rooms sound perfectly charming... so be warned - do NOT go on the cheap here unless you want a room where you might expect to find a dead hooker beneath the bed...",,,,"['long', 'weekend', 'sister', 'wedding', 'inn', 'amazing', 'location', 'breakfast',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-spanish-quarters-inn-saint-augustine,Best Western Spanish Quarters Inn,3.5,$$,16,"The BEST Best Western we have ever had the pleasure of accompanying. Sherrie was the manager on duty and was exceptionally knowledgeable about the area and places to check out. She was also very gracious in explaining the Best Western rewards program which we were unaware of although we have stayed in 2 locations since 2016. The second floor room was easily accessible from the parking which was also spacious considering the downtown location. The room itself was very clean, modern and overall just a great place to stay. I can't leave out the breakfast, the breakfast was delicious and full of options. Continental style but with a spacious seating area, the menu included cheese omelets, pancakes, sausage, roasted potatoes, a variety of cereals, muffins, danishes, juices and milks. I had more than my share of the chocolate milks and omelets. We celebrated my wife's 30th birthday here and because of the gracious staff and overall great upkeep of this Best Western we had a more than memorable time. Thank you Spanish Quarters staff!On a recent, last minute weekend getaway with my family to St. Augustine we stayed here. Since it was so last minute we couldn't get our normal room at Casa Monica. This place was not a great place to stay at all. I would say the only reason I gave two stars is due to the location. It was close to town, restaurants, historic monuments, and museums all within walking distance. Parking...man was parking terrible. The lot was tiny and it didn't even seem like it had the capacity to hold one car per room. We had three cars between the eight of us and they were not very helpful a the front desk. This basically looks like a hotel that use to be a motel with a slight makeover. That's part of the problem also. The furniture was much too large for the tiny rooms. There was no space between the bed and desk or the dresser and beds. Either way the furniture a size just added to the fact that the room was not very large to begin with. Overall, unless you're extremely desperate and need just a place your head I wouldn't recommend staying here. Plan your trip to St. Augustine in advance to get a better hotel than this in a central location.The staff was fantastic, after an issue with our booking they were nice to enough to give us a discount. The rooms were clean but small. We could never quite get it cool enough for our tastes. Be careful in the parking lot though, it is very narrow, thank goodness we drive a small car. Overall we had a nice stay!This place is great!!! Thank you Jerry! We had pre-existing reservations that fell through and the Best Western came to our rescue! Very clean rooms, the rates are fair and they give complementary breakfast. The location is very close to old town Saint Augustine, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that wants to be close to downtown.Horrible place don't let the reviews fool you!  This place is terrible should be $29 a night! Tubs overflow cigarette smoke smelling filthy rooms old beat up rooms remotes don't work dirty carpets I almost forgot fridge didn't work either!Sherri is great, she makes it feel like a home away from home. Very close to the old city, and great restaurants.The only saving grace to this hotel is location and cleanliness of the rooms. They advertised free wifi and upon arriving the wifi was not working. They said they would get it fixed and never did. We had to take cold showers because they claimed they did not have an adequate water supply for a full house!! The only thing they were able to do for us was waive the 5$ daily parking fee. One of the worst hotel stays ever, which says a lot for us because we travel the country for 6-10 months out of the year staying in many different hotels.Where do I begin?Okay, we arrived around 4:30 P.M. on Thursday, and were greeted by the manager and desk clerk. They were both very outgoing and friendly, and promptly got us to our room. The manager explained that the hotel is newly renovated and painted and that there is a residual paint odor. When we arrived at our room, he was correct, Very strong smell from a freshly painted door...oil based paint, yuck, but he was upfront about it. The room was in Perfect order, very clean. After some time we acclimated to the paint smell. BTW, the man who painted all of the doors there is a Real Artist...beautiful work. All went well that evening.8:45 a.m. the wonderful sound of a 2 cycle gas blower right in front of our room, but, we needed to get up and get our day underway anyhow. Next thought...COFFEE!I head down to the lobby to grab a couple cups of luscious hot ""C"", walked up to a coffee ""machine"", placed my cup under the spout, poured and out comes Light Brown Coffee Colored Water!! WOW!I spoke to the manager about it and his reply was; ""Yeah, that's the way it is. I don't drink that stuff either. I have a coffee maker in my office that I use"". I couldn't believe it!So I asked, where can I find a REAL cup of coffee? Reply: "" Well, there's a Dunkin' Doughnuts about a mile up the road"".  Let me just say this: I was rudely awakened, NEEDED, NEEDED a cup of coffee and THIS is what I get???We stumbled out the door in a surreal manner, staggered down the sidewalk, and LUCKILY, right across San Marco Blvd., is a Very Nice french pastry shop with REAL coffee.Okay, so that was that...end of dilemma.We went for a walk in the historic district and had a great time.We came back a little later thinking we would relax and go online for a bit...NOT!During our entire 2 day stay (too long ), the internet did not work properly.I again, spoke with the manager and his reply was..as if canned.."" Yeah, sometimes it's like that"", but he did reset it.The ladies at the front desk were very apologetic after the next few times, and I believe that they did their best with what they had to work with, which was basically, nothing.We stay at Best Western quite a bit, and were staying this time on points earned from previous stays. I WILL say this, the general manager contacted us after hearing of our dis-satisfaction, and returned the points from the previous night's stay.The staff there are very courteous and try very hard to make your stay a pleasant one. We were basically told that the issue with the coffee machine was ""How it is"" and apparently they have no intention of changing that, so be warned...plan on getting your coffee elsewhere, unless you like hot water with a splash of coffee.SECURITY ALERT!!!   There is a gap in the curtains at this hotel. I noticed this when walking to our room; when someone is walking along the walkway ( upstairs AND downstairs), they can see basically everything in your room. There is a mirror which is perfectly located so that a person can look into the gap of the curtain and into the mirror and get a full position angle of the bed....NOT GOOD!I brought this to the attention of the night clerk on Friday night. She said she was noting it. Be sure to clamp your curtain so as to avoid this security breach.Again, the staff was awesome and the rooms clean. One can hope for some good coffee in the future, and a change in the attitude of the manager because in MY opinion....When there is an issue, That's just NOT how it is.  :)L.M.If you're looking for a place with a bed and a central location, all for one low &amp; reasonable cost in St. Augustine then this is your place.  This review gets 4 stars simply for being in the right place and doing the simple things well.You won't get luxury but your wallet will thank you for it.  This place is right across the street from Ripleys and the tourism trams.  Down the street within walking distance you have the Fountain of Youth to your left and the Fort and storefronts to your right.There is a complimentary breakfast.  Nothing to brag about but it will save you from walking far and can do the trick if you're in a pinch or not too picky.  Waffle machine, yogurt, cereal, etc.Biggest complaint?  Parking.  The lot is small and kinda hard to find.  If you're coming past the Fountain of Youth into St. Augustine towards the BW and take a right at the light (to the BW), you'll probably think you should pull into the lot immediately to your right after you turn.  Don't.  Even though there is a BIG BW sign there, it's actually the tourism center.  Go down the road a short distance and you'll see the BW on your right.  Weird sign placement.Reasonably priced, and only a block away from the touristy stuffs. Plus their newly remodeled rooms (2013) are clean and comfortable. Would stay here again.Stayed here for 4 nights. Clean room. Very close to the tourist attractions. Nice pool. Great high speed wifi (most of the time). Only negative thing was the tap water smelled pretty awful...had a sewer stench. I'm not one who usually buys bottle water, but I certainly did during my stay here. Regardless, I really liked this hotel and would certainly stay here again if I came back to St. Augustine.One of the biggest reasons we chose this motel was the proximity to the Historic attractions.  The other big draw was free breakfast.   Turns out that the location is good, but the breakfast is not. The area available for breakfast is TINY.  I felt like I was taking tea in a miniature playhouse with seven of my closest friends and neighbors from the other rooms.  The selections for breakfast are awful, with the best thing going being the waffle maker.  Unfortunately, the other customers are waiting in a tiny little line in the tiny little room to use the waffle iron.The parking lot next to the pool is very small and difficult to maneuver in.  (although it is bigger than the breakfast room).Overall, this place will do.  Next time I visit St. Augustine, though, I'll be looking for something better, unless this location has some REALLY special deals going on.BEWARE!  This hotel ends up charging your credit card AFTER check out for ""incidentals"" that they said they wouldn't charge you for - AKA parking etc...  When I called, the general manager answered and wasn't helpful at all.  He was very rude on the phone and wouldn't even hear my story and continued to say that no matter what I said they were still going to charge my credit card.Just beware that your stay will be more than you think.Pros:1. Walking distance to everything downtown, only a couple of blocks from Castillo and shops.2.  Room was clean and as expected of a Best Western3. Front desk service was friendly4. Free wi-fiCons:1. We were in front of the pool and kids were noisy early in the morning.2. Smokers not smoking in the room congregated outside the pool deck which was outside our room.3.  Breakfast was OK, had a waffle maker and some french toast in a pack that could be toasted but no hot items (I think we got spoiled in Provo, UT)4.  Pool area was very small and hard to maneuver aroundI think one of the best places to stay in the City. It's near everything and there is no need to drive and pay for parking in the city. The rooms are always clean and well stocked. The pool is clean and the staff is very friendly.After staying at this location the past umpteen times I feel like they treat us like family. Also a plus is free wi-fi, in the office the coffee flows till 10pm. IN the morning they have breakfast till 10am, and as many little coffee pods as you can ask for.Downside, no in-room movies, or HBO. Stuck watching very basic cable till the wee hours if you don't bring a portable dvd player.This is a 3 star hotel, but the location is super.  It is right on the train line (both of them) and is within walking distance of the ripley's and the fort, and even the shops.  Staff was courteous and friendly, but maintenance is not there in the evening and night.  We found our phone pulled out of the wall and it wasn't fixed until mid morning the next day. Breakfast was ok.  Facility was clean.  But if you want wifi, forget it.  We were in the room right over the desk lobby, and signal was very weak, and available only about 5 percent of the time -- it was luck to have a signal for 5 consecutive minutes, and then you could spend a long time trying to get it back -- I usually gave up after many failures.  No one in the evening had access to the router to try to reboot it",,,,,"['best', 'best', 'western', 'ever', 'pleasure', 'accompanying', 'manager', 'duty', 'exceptionally', 'knowledgeable', 'area',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/pirate-haus-inn-saint-augustine,Pirate Haus Inn,4.0,$,15,"Fantastic for families!!We stayed with Cap'n Conrad and Crew for 3 nights and loved every moment. From the decor to the pancakes to the game room filled with books and boardgames. The place was quiet, the guests were pleasant, and the price was right!Parking is limited, but that is only because the Pirate Haus Inn is right in the middle of old St. Augustine near the Castillos de San Marcos where the restaurants and shops are. Watch the video!<a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHUXThNfkbl8&amp;s=756bf59d26f18d7b410823bf88959dd0e6bb3c6fc6cb447216e0d6cabdae782f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com/watch?v=HUXT...</a>Pirate Haus Inn is a good choice for staying in St Augustine.  I really think the key thing is to be able to park your car and for the most part, not drive anywhere in the downtown area.  The Inn is very centrally located so almost anything is within a quick walk, and you can just use the car when you want to see the beach, lighthouse, or maybe a great meal at Back 40 Urban grill.Driving to the place is an interesting experience in itself.  I was not clear on the parking situation and when we arrived, everywhere was very crowded with no parking.  So we called and were told that they would have a parking space for us.  $10 a day is great.  Driving down Treasury Street is interesting.  Good thing we had a small car.The first experience in arriving the staircase.  It is both kinda whimsical and scary, it seems pretty steep. Our daily cardio was going up and down this staircase.  We got room 6, the Jungle room.  It is quaint.  As others have said, you come here for different reasons, and if you are looking for a pristine modern place, you should keep looking.  This is really more a hostel turned into a quasi-BnB....sort of. :)  It certainly retains a feel of a hostel, I would assume more so with the rooms with shared facilities.  There is a cute common area with books and games.  An outdoor deck with table and chairs, and a kitchen.  The place reminded me more of places I have stayed in Europe.Our room had the bunkbeds, perfect for the kids, though we were initially confused by the bedding.  There is a refrigerator.  Free wifi that worked well.  Limited outlets, so if you want to run something on the bunk beds, bring an extension cord.  No tv of course.  Bathroom is a bit old but still charming.  The tap handles on the tub/shower seemed barely attached.  But we had plenty of hot water and everything worked. The owners and staff we very friendly.  The guy who runs it (Conrad?) seems a great guy with some interesting stories.  We also enjoyed meeting people from around the world, and if we were here without the children, I would have liked to have spent more time socializing.  Pancakes were good, Conrad enjoys exploring his creative outlet on the griddle. :)  If you do not like pancakes, you may be out of luck, but I think they try to be open to working with you if you wanted to make something else.  Coffee is available.We did notice some extra free entertainment from people on the street, but it was not too bad and seemed to get pretty quiet later at night.  The AC worked well enough to keep the room at a good temp, specially with the ceiling fan.We could not have been happier with our stay here! Truly a gem! Such bang for your buck! Comfortable, clean, AND CENTRAL! Right in the heart of St. Augustine!.. We didn't have to drive anywhere during our visit! And cheap parking for the 3 earliest birds! The pancakes are good and the bourboney(sp?) makes them even better! We even had what could be considered a tame, little ghost encounter hehehe. But most importantly the staff was great! SO friendly and SO helpful! Oh and they leave chocalate coins on your pillow :)Captain Conrad made us pirate pancakes and gave us grapefruit his neighbor picked and won our undying affection because of it.  The place was comfortable and nice and they had community spaghetti dinner night.  There is a cute little libraryish living area and people gathered there and played guitars one of the evenings we were there.I loved the location too - right in the middle of everything.  I'm going to Florida for spring break in a month, and I was really pushing for us to go to St. Augustine moooostly because of Pirate Haus...The positive aspects of the other reviews of Pirate Haus are accurate, as are the warning that this is a hostel and not the Hilton. While we were at first very tickled with the place, two negatives have bothered us enough to be wanting to record them here.First off, we are long distance cyclists, and we phoned Pirate Haus to find a place to stay, while being blasted by wind and rain out on the trail. The person on the phone did not seem to appreciate our situation, and not only made me pull out my credit card to read the numbers, out in the rain, but warned us that the street was closed in front of the establishment - irrelevant for cyclists.But what we really did not expect was when the same fellow refused to allow us to store our bikes on the large and empty sun deck for even one minute after the rather chintzy 10 am checkout time. We asked if we could do this, the night before, and the refusal really ruined our enjoyment of the remainder of our stay.Finally, the rate we paid for a private room was the same as for some nearby standard motels, and of course here there is no TV, micro, coffee maker, etc. in the room, since there are the communal facilities.We just thought overall that ""communal"" would include some little consideration of the special needs of some visitors, like us cyclists. This town, after all, is the major start/end point of the well known Southern Tier cycle route. Although breakfast is stated as being available from 7:30 it was still not ready by 7:45. Since we like to make an early start this was a bit disconcerting' The same fellow as from last night was making the pancakes, and had a ""what's your hurry"" attitude.Pros:1. The staff are awesome...friendly, accommodating, funny, and down-to-earth.2. Family-friendly: quiet times are enforced, staff are great with kids, and place is safe3. Location is in the heart of the downtown area. You can walk almost  to all the major attractions and certainly find great food and fun.4. Rooms are large4. Basic essentials are provided5. Great price6. Good wifi7. Hang out room with TV, books, and games exists, but we did not try it out.Neutrals:1. Looks and feels like a hostel. We had a young child (less than 2) with us, so we were not looking for romance at a B&amp;B. So, no big deal.2. Pancakes, coffee, and fruit on one of the mornings were all great, but this is all the breakfast is comprised of. Adequate (if you like pancakes), but nothing fancy.Cons:1. Parking was stated as free on the reservation, but only a few pay spots existed on site and $8/day parking was available across the street (which is pretty cheap for the area). This would have not been brought up, except that our reservation said it would be free.2. Location is in the heart of the downtown area. (Yes, I already wrote this in the pros section.) Harry's restaurant and bar is located a block away and plays loud music all night. One of the nights we were there, they played until 2am. The windows do not block the sound of the music or the people walking by as they leave the area. With a small child this is not the greatest thing to put up with.The staff tried everything to accommodate us (even called the police), but the reality is that this is the downtown area and the bar is allowed to play loud music until they close.Luckily, Harry's doesn't have music every night. Primarily on the weekends, holidays, and school breaks. So, keep an eye on that and you will be okay. If you do not have young children and/or you don't mind staying up late, then this may be a non-issue.Great place, great staff. Second visit here and loved it. Like other reviews, if you are looking for a Hilton, stay at a Hilton. If you want to pay $20 per night and hang out with people from around the world, this place rocks!!I'm sitting in the fish/underwater room right now, kind of sad about leaving this place. It's like staying with your uncle, who's really into pirates. It's comfortable, welcoming, and fun. If you're looking for a chain hotel experience, and you're going to be mad because you didn't read about amenities, don't come here. If you're going to be uptight, don't come here. Do come here if you're into rad pancake breakfasts, hanging out with pirates, and being centrally located, but not broke from just your hotel rates. Do take up Gold Tooth Dave on his Walking Ghost Tour.. Because not only is he a super nice dude, he's very knowledgeable about the history of St. Augustine.  I highly recommend this place if you have kids, because they will love it. Thanks guys, we will stay here again!Listen, if you're looking for a Hilton, go to a Hilton and not a hostel.  Everyone will be happier!  If you're looking for one of the best hostels in the States, go to here!  It's location in St. Augustine is ridiculously convenient, firstly.  But also, staff has always been super nice and helpful the couple times I've been, guiding me in to find their location (that bit was tricky for me. Thanks, ""smart"" phone).  Last time my partner and I woke up there, a staff member was there, eager to make us pancakes and coffee, even writing my partner's name into hers.  I mean, personalized pancakes?!  Furthermore our private room was clean clean and really cozy.  The pirate decor is everywhere, and each room has it's own theme and really cool mural.  Ours was an underwater coral reef scene.Our mattress was ah-mazing.  Having worked in two hostels, I can say good mattresses are not typical.  Our private bathroom was nice and clean, shower was piping hot.  Pirate Haus is a great stop for me every time I head Souther than South, and I've never been disappointed.Either you're going to like this place or you aren't. Used to staying in five star hotels? Head somewhere else. Are you more laid back and just looking for a place to crash at the end of the day? Take a chance on the Pirate Haus.The rooms were huge, the management was friendly, the beds were comfortable and the price was right. Two friends and I stayed for two nights and enjoyed ourselves.The best part of the Pirate Haus is the location. You're within a five minute walk from everything there is to do in the historic district. Cab rides to the beach were $10 for three of us. I would recommend staying in the historic district and cabbing to the beach, not vice versa. The food in the historic district is delicious, and there isn't too much to do by the beach (except, of course, swim). Management was happy to answer any questions and point us in the right direction for food and drinks. I'd stay here again.Located in the heart of Historic St. Augustine, this Inn definitely has character. You can literally spend hours just examining the miscellaneous pirate paraphernalia randomly displayed on the walls. Three of my girl friends and I shared what is known as the ""Jungle Room"" and man, that's not just a catchy name. As soon as we opened the door we were greeted with a 360 degree jungle mural. Awesome!  The room contained a bunk bed and a double bed. When split four ways, it ended up costing each of us $25 - not bad at all!The website boasts an all you can eat pancake breakfast but us ladies weren't ready in time. Also, shirts are for sale! (No, not ours... the Inn's, of course!)FYI - Although this place has a sort of ""hostel"" feel, it was made very clear to us that it is a family-friendly inn. The walls are paper thin and saying things like ""pissed"" will get you a talking to (or maybe the manager just didn't appreciate us). Overall, a great place for a very reasonable price!I never stayed at this inn, however I have been inside and I have also experienced the management who owns this establishment and I must say, why go anywhere else, the owner is one of the most laid back but serious guys you will meet. He takes the ""Pirate Haus Inn"" very serious and it is truly for those who have a pirate in them.It is built in Saint Augustine in the Historic part of the city and this place truly has character.Must warn you though, this place has stairs when you first arrive, it's on the second floor of an establishment, there is a rail that goes up the stairs, so you can take your time to get up the stairs but that is the only way in or out!Loved this place! Family and solo traveler friendly in Historic Downtown St. Augustine. Enjoyed meeting other guest in this relaxed &amp; friendly inn. Cute seeing kids at breakfast wearing their Pirate Pajamas and enjoying Capt. Conrad's famous pancakes! Great coffee and excellent location. Don't miss this place.""Arrr!"".... almost. Frenchie and I came here while on our extended roadtrip this summer. It was pretty sweet- even though the owner pirate was having phone company issues when we arrived... we got settled.The guys who live and work there are the chillest bunch I've met in awhile and we would sit in the kitchen drinking our ""pirate rum"" and talking.Eveyone has got that chill attitude.. that surfer-like chilltude.The best parts? Free pancakes- all you can eat. It's right in the heart of St. Augustine.The worst parts? Fleas.. I think. Something bit and itched- and I've heard there's a lot in Florida.Other than that the place was super sweet... complete with Pirate decor and the ""arrr""tastic staff.Appreciate the Captain's hospitality and look forward to the chance to give the Haus another chance.  All the fundamentals are there for a great experience, location, facilities, fun theme.",,,,,"['fantastic', 'families', 'cap', 'crew', 'nights', 'loved', 'every', 'moment', 'decor', 'pancakes',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-st-augustine-i-95-st-augustine,Fairfield Inn & Suites St. Augustine I-95,4.0,$$,13,"Nice hotel, brand new, nice clean rooms AC works a little too well, bathrooms are big and nice.One bad thing, not all the rooms have an in-room safe. I did not care to leave my things at the safe by check in desk.It has an small pool and offers free wifi and breakfast with your stay, wifi works very well and it is fast. The breakfast buffet is really good, it offers warm and cold items, but the dining area is too small for the amount of people that goes to eat there.Overall a nice hotel next to I-95 and very close to St. Augustine.$175 for the night is way to much for this type of room a old mattress and a small room,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You saved us from our initial reservation at a seedy ""resort"" hotel  that looked like it was a scene straight from Cops...We were in town for the Gentlemen of the Road festival and amidst the literal town-takeover, you all kept your cool. were super duper friendly, and offered up a nicely appointed hotel room with all the amenities that we could ask for in an affordable price range.You can clearly tell that this is a newer property and that it is very well taken care of. TIP: There is a small business center located across from the lobby that is a nice spot to print out any agendas, send emails, or hop online. TIP2: This location is also right down the street from an upscale outlet mall that included Kate Spade, Gucci, and Saks.This is a top-notch hotel and great value for the money!  The whole place is pretty new and clean and very classy decor.  The rooms were comfortable and very quiet with firm beds and spacious bathrooms.  There is a small fitness room which was nice.  The hotel is situated next to a cute lake where you can take a stroll around and if you walk 3/4 of a mile you can walk down to one side of the outlet malls.  The hot breakfast was excellent--would probably get a bit boring after more than a couple of days but there is quite a selection--boiled eggs, omelettes, 1 protein that rotates (we saw chicken sausage, turkey and bacon on 3 different days I believe), a hot waffle maker, juice machine, breads and bagels and muffins, cereals and fruit.  The service is friendly and everyone went out of their way to be friendly.  Even the patrons were really kind.  Great stay and great hotel overall!  The only downside is the location--it is off the beaten path if your goal is to hang out in the downtown area of St Augustine as it is a 10-15 min drive but if you don't mind not staying in the heart of things, this hotel is a great deal.Very comfortable, clean and close to the beach and the outlet malls.  Staff very nice.  Rooms small, but adequate. Breakfast like and other for this lower end stay.I would have no problem staying here again.Was a last min vacation and was great the check in was fast and easy. The beds was a great sleep and breakfast was goodGood hotel for the price and location. Clean rooms, the king suites have a fridge, microwave and two TVs. Good use of space. Fast check in. Free breakfast which is standard hotel breakfast fare. Some fruit, breads, oatmeal, and some hot meat/egg items. Coffee is decent. Pool looks private.This location is brand new.  It passed the initial smell test and the smell test in the room.  No odors.  Clean rooms, clean hotel and an awesome breakfast that is included in the price of your stay.  Scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, Fresh(make'em yourself) waffles, sausage patties until you burst.  A great way to get the day started if you are sightseeing in St. Augustine.I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the decore of this hotel and our rooms. It was really great. My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary as we went sight seeing and the bed was super comfortable. We had a king size bed and our room had a little seating area and they also had two tv's in the room. The best feature we liked was the iHome that you can plug your iPod into or in our case oir phone so that we could blast music if we wanted to. Breakfast was great as well! The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because our room was very warm most of the day even when we set the temperature to its lowest setting before we left to go around town. It took all night for our room to cool down as the a.c. unit is controlled by a wall control versus the regular way. So if you don't  want to be hot than I suggest setting the a.c. to low and watching to make sure your room is cooling.LOVED the king suite.  Memory foam mattress was so awesome, my husband and I totally want to buy one now!  Also, the suite was split into two separate areas with a half wall.  Area one was an office desk and sofa bed and chair with a TV, and microwave/fridge.  While the bedroom area had the bed, small closet, and another TV.  The hotel was brand new and decorated in a modern style with shades of green and orange.  The pool and gym looked nice, and made me wish I'd actually packed a bathing suit.  And the free breakfast was fabulous.  Breakfast area as well stocked with a waffle maker, sausage gravy, assorted breads (including bagels and muffins), Jimmy Dean prepackaged breakfast sandwiches, cereal, oatmeal, grits, and toppings for oatmeal (nuts and dried fruit), fresh fruit (apples bananas), light yogurt, regular yogurt, milk, juice, and fruit salad!  GEEZ!  Also, the Wifi is free, and actually quite fast!Will definitely stay here again, as it is close to the I-95, outlets, and only 5 miles away from historic St. Augustine and the beaches.Were very disappointed on our fourth visit to this motel.. The bed was as hard as a board,, pillows like sandbags,, chair and couch in sitting area , very uncomfortable and hard.. what happened??  did you change mattresses since last fall????  we always loved this place....Excellent - hotel must be brand new.  Nicely decorated, clean, and the receptionist was friendly and knowledgable.  Great find for a very reasonably priced hotel!It isn't a top of the line luxury hotel by any means, but thats not what I was expecting of it. You really can't get any better for a mid level hotel. The staff was phenomenal. We didn't get to the hotel until 4 am and even then the guy that checked us in was friendly, helpful and willing to answer questions. My wife has some medicine that needs to be refrigerated, so I originally asked about getting a fridge. He didn't think they had any available. Later, when I explained what it was for they immediately said they would find a way to get us one regardless. Within 10 minutes they had brought one to our room. The rooms are spotless and very modern looking. There is no question of cleanliness or bugs. I couldn't have asked for a nicer, more convenient stay. We also got a room here close to spring break for only $55 a night through Priceline!! The next time I am in the area I will definitely look first at this Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-saint-augustine,Hilton Garden Inn,3.0,$$,17,"Beautiful hotel close to the beach and great places to eat. The room was huge with 2 comfortable queen size beds. The bathroom was so big that it was perfect for 3 adult women to get ready in. Each room has a Keurig but additional coffee is available in the lobby. The hotel was newly renovated with free parking. Only wish was that the pool would have been warmer. The ocean was warmer than the pool. The weekend front desk staff was friendly and accommodating!The hotel was physically appealing. The area is nice as well, although it's a bit out of the way to downtown St. Augustine. Publix, and a couple of restaurants are in the same area, so you can walk to them. The staff was friendly and helpful.It was $160 a night and we were upgraded to a suite for free (Hilton Honors Member). The suite was large - a seating area, desk, TV, sink. A hallway lead to a large bathroom. The tub was peeling a little, but overall the bathroom was in good shape. The bedroom was fine, but the cooling unit was in a small closet in the bedroom and it was very noisy. They have adjustable beds, which allows you to have a firmer or softer mattress. I don't feel that my bed was working properly.Having a balcony was nice, but there was no view from our room.I liked that there was a hot tub, but the pool area and pool itself were small, so it became crowded very quickly.We were so excited to finally be staying in a place with a spa, only to find they have dish towels for beach towels. We weren't too impressed with the maid service, they kinda made our beds? They did the bare minimum. Great location, just right across the street from the beach. Use the flags to cross the street, it's fun! The front desk people were very nice.We had a great time at the Hilton Garden Inn!  Although I can't comment on the breakfast or gym, I found the front desk staff very friendly (Lamar) and the room was great!  We were upgraded to the birthday suite since it was my birthday weekend. I was impressed with the towel animal (like a cruise ship! :P) and the cleanliness of the room in general.  The location was across the street from the beach too which was very nice.  Overall, I would stay at this location again.The fitness center is only cardio machines.The breakfast is probably the worst I've ever had at a Garden Inn. The location is great and the staff is friendly but I'd recommend trying somewhere else.Today I noticed my DL was missing so I called the Hilton Garden St. Augustine Beach where I stayed a few weres ago on Sept. 1, 2015 and recall being asked for my DL at check-in.  I asked for a manager but was told I could only lv a voicemail today for a manager.  Dustin is the person who answered the phone this afternoon.  I told him I believe I handed my DL at checkin and asked whether it was there.  He immediately said ""no.""  Then he went on to say he wondered where it could be and eventually asked for my LAST NAME.  I told him my last name and wondering how he could say ""no"" before adking for my last name I cpmmented ""that would be a good place to start with my Name.""  He broke into bold laughter and I reminded him sternly that ""It's NOT funny.  I don't have my Driver's license.""  To that he continued laughing and argued with me, ""well you're Yelling at me and you accused me of STEALING your Driver's License.""  I neither yelled at him or a cused him of Stealing.  I had, though, reminded him of the seriousness of my situation and asked how he could say ""no"" to it being there b4 getting my name and/or looking for it.  He said he never said ""no,"" yet it was what he answered to me up front and through his constant laughter he carried on another co versation apparently with someone other yhan me in which he further confused things for me by stating (to whoever else, ""it's right hear underneath.""  Realizing I was trying to talk to a kid I said I had better talk to a Manager (at Hilton Garden).  Maybe it is not there but I did not expect to be treated like this as a Hilton Honors member, etc.Room was clean. Location is ok not great.Front desk was very nice.Con (which we knew before we booked) is there is no breakfast. Continental costs $5 and full made to order $9. Not bad, but...We recommend you head into town and go to Georgie's Diner for a nice breakfast. 3 stars is accurate for this place.This place was just ok.We spent a weekend in the area since we would be heading to Jax for a football game. My husband had hotel points he could use for a free room and so the Hilton Garden Inn was it. It's about 15-20 minutes from the Historic St. Augustine area along A1A which seems to be a long strip of restaurants and non descript restaurants. Reminded me of a deserted beach town.   Anyways, for the most part, the hotel was fine. Only thing that was a semi pain was that our room was on one end of the hotel but the elevator was on the other end. It wasn't a big deal . We ended up finding the stairwell that was closer to our room so we would take that to go downstairs which led us straight to the back exit door where we parked.    The back door of the hotel was secure and entry wasn't allowed without a hotel key.I did think it was odd that there were a trillion throw pillows on the bed. I would probably not stay here again unless it was free or if I was only going to be in town for a night. I'd rather spend a little more for nicer accommodations if it was an extended stay.I know when I book at a Hilton property I'm going to get a good bed and a clean room, and this was no exception.I booked on the Hilton website, which is cheaper than any of the travel sites, and there was a ""bed and breakfast"" special that was worthwhile.  Breakfast was very good, unlike most of the ""free"" breakfasts at other places.  I used the hot tub after breakfast.  I had checked it out the night before and didn't see where the jacuzzi button was.  When I went to the front desk to ask, the man behind the counter said, ""I'll come out and show you.""  That's hospitality.I stayed here for 3 nights and found the accommodations to be fine. This hotel is right across from the beach and about 10 minutes form downtown Saint Augustine. To me, this is the perfect location. Upon arriving we were greeted and were able to get to our room fairly quickly. Sometimes when staying in hotels the elevators take forever, but not here; the elevator was working just fine and I didn't have to wait long at all. Our room was easy to find and when we walked in it was cool and appeared clean. We had to ask for extra towels and they were at our door within minutes. The housekeeping staff were friendly and did a great job. We stayed for breakfast one morning, but I wasn't a fan. I think they had a nice idea with the buffet, but there isn't that much to choose from. I would have preferred a continental breakfast. The service was fine and the food was okay, but I was not that impressed with the choices for a $9 meal. Overall, this is a nice hotel with good customer service. I would stay here again if needed.Bad check in experience had to wait an hour more for a room.  No fans in the bathroom and the beds are rock hard.Customer service is clearly not the manager's strong suit.  Don't waste your time or money here.I'm here for a wedding and the bride is about to wring the managers neck.... You would think a with multiple room rentals that they would have a little courtesy and accommodation.... Ahh no!First, I find the reception room stuffy.  There are about 60 of us stacked in here with a buffet line and dance floor (best description for the blank space in the room). Second the ventilation sucks. The caterer had Sterno for the buffet and we had to open the doors to the parking lot the vent the room. Sterno is a clean fuel, it's should not stink like that.... God forbid someone farted in there... we'd all be dead!Bathrooms were equivalent to a truck stop.  I washed the sink before I washed my hands.  It was gross. TP on the floor as if it was Hallows Eve.We cleaned the reception room up so all the staff had to do was take the trash out and deal with the tables and chairs.  It seemed that wasn't good enough for them. and that this wedding reception was a burden on the staff.Parking for visitors/reception guest is limited and to the rear of the property due to hotel guest parking..I am surprised by this place as it is a Hilton and for the area. Though this is a tourist area to a specific clientele... this isn't  Orlando and low/middle class tourist trap. For the aristocrats that come to the area, this place is a dump! There is now an ATM.  Thought I saw hot tub, but it didn't look operational.The bride did say she liked the room they had as it was very large and had a full size fridge in it for her and the kids.  And the room the bridal party used seemed spacious BUT, I was surprised by a full bed and a twin...I hate that I have to give this place a two star but ill explain.Ive stayed here before and loved it. Its relativly inexpensive rooms are big and it has lots of amenaties. Its right accross from the beach (5 minutes walking) right accross from the pier ( 5 minutes walking) and right beside the  South beach grill.  A pool and hot tub, fitness room and computer room. so with all these awsome things going for it why could i possibly rate it a two??? I had the worst nights sleep when i stayed there the last time because they apparently switched the beds they use. They now have a bootleg version of the sleep number. After turning the nob all the way down to what should have been a soft matress i still felt like i was laying on the pool patio. It was terrible and i didnt sleep a wink. Myself and my fiance' were both sore the next day and were very tired from a night of inturrupted sleep. im not saying everybody is ganna have this issue but i did. It kinda makes me angry because I like this place so much but now I cant stay there because these new beds suck somtihng awfull. So if it werent for the beds it would be a four star for sure but i cant discount the fact that I woke up feeling like I went two rounds with Mike Tyson.Nice rooms. Terrible service overall. Clearly understaffed and under trained folks working here. During breakfast there was a Person that appears to be management helping clean tables, but doing nothing to aid in customer service.  Our stay here was a gift from our dad. He booked in advace and took great lenghts to ensure we would mot he charged for te rooms, yet the hotel screwed this up and had no wayto fix it.  I've stayed at a number of Hilton Garden inns, but this one seems to be the worst run one I've stayed at.  Hopefully someone in Hilton upper management reads these reviews, as this location is in need of as segment change.  There is no appearent team work going in here and little accountability for customer service. (Even though the elevator has a sign guaranteeing  the experience).  Maybe stay here for the rooms, But patronize one of the local joints for you meals. And certainly look for alternatives.A great value. Great rates, right across from the beach, clean rooms, free bottled water, fantastic &amp; fresh all-you-can-eat breakfast for 8.95, courteous staff.What more could you ask for?We stayed here 3 nights.  If it wasn't for the fact that we have an 8 month old daughter and packing up and moving would have been a hassle, we would have left after the first night.The room itself was nice though uncomfortably hot. The AC is one of those big ones that is super loud and stays on for a few minutes until it reaches the desired temp.  Just went from hot to loud to hot again.  The housekeeping not so great.  We came back to our room the second day, dirty tub, coffee not replenished.  There was shattered glass out by the stairs from the day we got here until the day we left.  The elevator ride up to the third floor on day one smelled as though someone had just thrown up so we used the stairs ever since.  My husband did use the elevator the day we checked as we had a couple of suitcases and yes, still smelled of throw up.  The $9 breakfast is a joke and they actually forgot our order one morning. The cook was actually digging through tickets on the floor to find ours.  Needless to say we didn't stay that day and didn't go back for breakfast the rest of our stay.  The staff are nice enough and good location- restaurant next door is amazing!  But this is the worst Hilton I have ever stayed at. I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member and have stayed at many Hiltons around the world.  This was by far the worst.",,,,,"['beautiful', 'hotel', 'close', 'beach', 'great', 'places', 'eat', 'room', 'huge', 'comfortable', 'queen', 'size', 'beds', 'bathroom', 'big', 'perfect', 'adult',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-seaside-inn-st-augustine-beach-saint-augustine-beach,Best Western Seaside Inn-St. Augustine Beach,3.5,$$,17,"Melissa at the front desk was so accommodating, going above and beyond to open the pool just so I could drink my coffee outside and not wake my family in the room.  She was friendly helpful and just the best.If sheer lace curtains that do not have an option of closing and cramped parking are your thing,  this is the place for you! The parking situation is that of a college keg party at your rich uncles house in the villa  with construction workers intermingled. The room was cleanly and the bed comfortable but the curtain situation.....if you're into the voyeuristic lifestyle or a serial peeping Tom  then this is your spot because the lace curtains do not close and with the lights on, you can see all goings on in the rooms. The check in staff was friendly, courteous and made an effort to help with the parking situation, the cleaning staff however was overly noisy and almost pushy as far as check out times goes. Who wants to hear the cleaning lady cart  pull up 30 minutes before check out with a hangover? Not this couple. The location is great for tourism, biggest plus. The noisy workers who started what sounded like full room demolition at 8 a.m and the incredibly noisy cleaning staff was off putting. We moved down the street to the next Best Western (Spanish Quarters). We will give this a shot again. (No hangover pun intended).We just returned from a 4 day/3 night trip down to take care if some personal business/ vacation.  The room was spacious with a King size bed, chair with ottoman, desk, dresser, 2 night stands  &amp; a mini fridge in a nice piece of furniture.  The bathroom was large with a pocket door.   The shower had very nice European style tiling in it. The only thing I felt was missing in the bathroom was a hand towel rack closer to the sink for convenience.   The towels were tied in a cute bow when we arrived.   In case you are like me and unsure of where to find your hand towel, it's the bow part :) The staff was very friendly  &amp; helpful in many different ways that made a big difference.( they had a corkscrew for our wine we bought forgetting that of course we don't have one, very helpful with directions multiple times). The free ""continental"" breakfast included eggs, sausage and/or bacon(if u get there early enough) &amp; waffles, not to mention the usual muffins, Danish &amp; cereal.   It was a very nice spread. The rooms were very clean &amp; cleaned well each day!   My only issue really with the room was the bed was too soft for me.  I have back problems and the bed truly made it worse.  I am a unique situation though. If you are looking for an ocean view, it may be on the second floor.  I personally didn't see an elevator but that doesn't mean that there isn't one as our room was on the main floor near the pool. We would absolutely return here (hopefully they have a firmer bed in a different room so we can )Nice place. We had a king bed bottom floor. Jon greeted us and was efficient and well knowledged of the area. He made recommendations for dining. The room was clean. The floors was a laminated  hardwood appearance with an area rug. Pocket door between bathroom and living area. Definitely will be back on our next visit.Nice room, but an off smell, not bad, but like old/stale water. Breakfast area is cramped space, but negotiable. Staff was polite. Parking is available, but only one way in &amp; one way out. Thankfully staff let us check-in early without an issue. Rooms do block out considerable amount of outside noise. Great places to eat within walking distance. If I were to stay in this exact area again, I wouldn't argue staying again.This place is not worth the stay. Upon arrival the exterior looks nice and  clean. The lobby is also very nice, clean, and friendly staff. Now let's get to the not so good stuff, the room hit us with a nasty musky, damp, and moldy smell. We asked for a room transfer and the new room was worth than our initial one. Since we had already paid, we decided to deal with it. The next day room service cleaned the room, it was clear they did not care about there job, beds were a mess, towels thrown on bathroom counter. Based on the smell alone, we will avoid this hotel and best westerns in the future. The breakfast spread is decent and did have a very nice attendant working it.This place was close to perfect, the best on St Augustine Beach for the money. Reasonable priced, and the staff was great. Especially Cameron. Very accommodating and helpful at check in. The bathrooms were recently updated and clean (always a plus) and the bedding, pillows and beds were great! I highly recommend.This Best Western motel confused me.  Everything in the room was nice but the room itself was not so nice.  Like putting lipstick on a pig, if you will.  I don't have a lot of negative stuff to say other than the fact that the parking lot was tight and I had to Austin Powers my way out.  I guess the front door seemed cheap as it had no heft to it and the walls were very thin as we could hear all of our neighbors.They offer a warm breakfast which is nice but the wifi was abysmal. My wife and I couldn't even update our blog or do more yelp reviews.  We got to spend a lot of time in the hotel since it was raining and it was fine for a night.  I'd recommend the hotel if you aren't looking for anything fancy.  I give the Best a Western Seaside Inn 3 Doubledays.I give 'em a three and a half.  They have hot breakfasts, even tho they're not a Best Western Plus.Extremely dissatisfied. The room smells like a cross between mothballs and mold. A bra was lying on the floor when we checked in (hours after it had been ""cleaned"") and a used hand towel and wash cloth hung over the hangers next to the sink. The final touch was that the air conditioning unit didn't work and there was no way to circulate air through the room. Front desk staff were friendly and apologized, but said there was nothing they could do.  Because we booked through Orbitz, Best Western said it couldn't even cancel the reservation so we could try to find a better place to stay. Stay somewhere else. This hotel is not even worth the discounted price.This hotel is run by some of the nicest people we encountered during our recent road trip so for them alone I give an extra star. The actual hotel itself for me was probably a 3 star kind of place. The hotel rooms themselves are decent - clean and comfortable and along the lines of what you'd expect from a well-kept Best Western hotel. The location is also pretty nice - in St. Augustine beach, across the street from the actual beach, with a pool, and near several restaurants and bars. But, there are several places right on the beach that you could choose from. And the walls here are fairly thin so if you are a light sleep, or probably even a medium sleeper, you might not get much sleep if you have noisy neighbors. Luckily the nights we stayed no one was noisy past about 10 PM.The do have a regular continental breakfast and free Wi-Fi so those are two more pluses if you needed them. All in all Sir Nicholas and I had a pleasant stay here, but next time I'm in town we would probably be inclined to try a different spot that's right on the beach so we can hear the surf as we fall asleep.Stayed at this BW this past weekend was surprised at how nice the hotel was. The place was very clean and the staff here was great. When we arrived our room was all ready for us and we were able to check in and hit the beach right away. The beach is right across A1A from the hotel, so the only negative to that is the traffic, but people were more than happy to stop to let you cross the street. The hotel itself is pretty nice with a small pool that was perfect for a quick dip when coming back from the beach, the rooms were very clean, maid service here does a great job at cleaning your room and refreshing the supplies, front desk staff is great at making sure you are satisfied and recommending places to go for dinner and other attractions, the location is close to the historical district with a short drive across the bridge to go into town, and of course there is the beach right across the street.In the mornings they have a pretty decent selection for a continental breakfast of juices, coffee, bagels, pastries, waffles, fruit, and boiled eggs. The breakfast area and dining area do get really cramped, but you just have to deal with it. We just grabbed our breakfast items and walked across to the beach for a breakfast picnic. I'll certainly keep the BW in mind next time I visit St. Augustine Beach.I was extremely pleased with this hotel. It was clean, comfortable and located just across the street from the beach. Also, it's in walking distance of several restaurants, a nice gift shop and ice cream shop. The market on Wednesday was a real treat too! I plan to visit again soon!Avoid this place. You can do better. Trust me. Hot tub is broken. Waited for hours to check in and our room still was my ready at 3pm. The manager just shrugged her shoulders. Indifferent staff.  Bad service. They just don't care.While this place doesn't earn top ranking for housekeeping or maintenance, I give it an ""A-okay"" based on value and the supremely friendly, knowledgeable front-desk staff!  Debra is especially helpful and gives great recommendations for dining out and sight-seeing.  Hotel is walking-distance to beach and near some great eateries!The travel brochures state the hotel has a whirlpool, do not believe it . It has a small round hole next to pool that leaks , is cold, and has two jets that are just regular pool jets. Room was ok. Could not get Internet or cell coverage in our room during the nightMy mom and I stayed at this hotel for two nights on a spontaneous road trip and couldn't have been happier with the result. We had a late checkin and the front desk was very nice and accompodating. Out first room was having problems with the air conditioning (and when you're in FL during July you need AC) and were immediatly given another room. The pool was very nice, a little small, but when you have the Atlantic Ocean right across the street it's not really necessary to have a huge pool. The room was very clean and the beds and pillows were very comfortable. The beach itself was awesome, the water was the perfect temperature and there are entrances every block which makes sure that the beach doesn't get to congested in just one area. The visitors to the beach are all spread out so you're not completely surrounded by yelling kids and cuddling couples. My mom and I forgot our beach chairs and the front desk was nice enough to let us borrow an extra pair they had in their office.Each room has a fridge and a microwave and the shower is very nice. Over all I would highly recommend this hotel.",,,,,"['front', 'desk', 'accommodating', 'going', 'beyond', 'open', 'pool', 'drink', 'coffee', 'outside', 'wake', 'family', 'room', 'friendly', 'helpful',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/southern-oaks-inn-st-augustine,Southern Oaks Inn,4.5,$$,21,"So I just checked in here, let me just say YES!! Great location and the room is very clean with two queen beds both very comfortable with four pillows each. Large flat screen TV on the wall microwave fridge coffee maker iron blow dryer desk AC free wifi and free breakfast in the AM. It's quiet despite being near a busy road and the staff have been extremely nice and very helpful. Will definitely stay here again!The rooms were absolutely beautiful. Hardwood floors throughout the room and tile in the bathroom, it wasn't what I was expecting at all . When you drive up it look like a generic Days Inn or Holiday Inn, but the similarity ends there, because inside the rooms is where this hotel shines. One top of the great rooms they have a complimentary Country Style Breakfast, and it was amazing. Eggs, french toast, biscuits and gravy, bacon, and sausage. I was expecting your normal continental breakfast you usually get from hotels, which was also available. You will never need to look for breakfast when you stay here. The only down sides, was that the shower head was low flow. Also on the bed there wasn't any quilt or comforter. I like to keep my hotel rooms a bit colder, which is amazing after a long, hot Florida day of sightseeing. But in the middle of the night I had to wake up and turn the temperature up.  I know it's kind of my fault but the room was in need of something more than two sheets on the bed.Also you can get pick up by a shuttle for the Old Town Trolly, which I suggest you take. Which is amazing because the parking situation in St. Augustine is atrocious and expensive.  I will book this hotel for any future trips to St. Augustine.We stayed here from Wednesday 24th to Friday 26th June. The desk staff were extremely nice and very helpful. Our bedroom was clean, and nice. My only complain is that the beds are NOT Queen sized, but full beds. The breakfast buffet was a hit with our sons, and the banana bread was delicious. Southern Oaks Inn is really good value for money. It's near restaurants, supermarkets and the town.I'd give this place 5 starts, but hey, it's old. The room was very tidy but not quite spotless, and the breakfast was ok but not stellar. I did enjoy my stay though, and you absolutely cannot beat this place for the price!This was my first trip to Saint Augustine and this was the best rate I could find in such a short time (same day, that morning actually). I do travel a lot whether its a friends birthday celebration, vacation in other states, or even for my rugby teams when we have tournaments...I have some experience. For the amazingly low rate, we had an awesome room! Super clean and organized, a mini fridge, a microwave, a mounted tv, and wooden floors! I felt like I might've somehow got an error in my booking by how great the room was. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Also, the complimentary breakfast was more than just a muffin (like my boyfriend expected); they had the works set out for us. I was even happy they had coffee cups with lids to go. I found that to be thoughtful. I am definitely staying here again.I read reviews for this place before I booked it through TripAdvisor and it was absolutely the best bang for your buck. The rooms are up to date with lovely furniture and a flat screen TV. It is right outside downtown St. Augustine, about 2 miles away from all the main attractions. It also includes free wifi and free breakfast buffet (which was delicious). This place is great for families and I highly recommend staying here for your next trip to St. Augustine. I agree with the other reviews, when you look at the outside, it looks like your average cheap motel/hotel, but it really is beautiful inside.Stayed here several times. The rooms are clean and upgraded, staff is very friendly. It was a bit noisy in the room we stayed in this time, but not usually. It's in walking distance from downtown if you don't mind a bit of a walk. They also offer free breakfast, which is nice. I would say this hotel is a good bang for your buck in a decent location and no parking fees!We chose to stay here after reading all the great reviews. I was concerned after finding out all rooms are dog friendly but was pleasantly surprised that the room was extremely clean. I watch hotel impossible and always worry about the cleanliness of the room. I gave this room the hotel impossible clean check. I even checked the filters which look new. The hardwood floors make the room look great but off course also means no dust or even dog pee in the carpet. The pillows looked nice although I will say the white sheets had a few stains from possibly someone's mascara. The bathroom was one of the best I've seen in a hotel. However, We found out the first morning that the awesome complementary breakfast is no longer complementary. They will serve free coffee but none of the food is free. This place is someplace I would definitely stay again especially if traveling with the dogs because they have a fenced in area to let your dogs potty and get some run around time which is great!The BEST place in St. Augustine for anyone on a budget, who appreciates a great continental breakfast, and that doesn't mind biking down town or taking the trolley. 1. It is completely updated with contemporary decor and it is still very clean and neat. 2. You can have your pets here and they have a pet park. 3. There is a trolley stop there which is great, and it is a short bike ride to down town. 4. Breakfast is PHENOMENAL and the best complimentary breakfast I've ever had. Hot eggs, with biscuits and gravy, fresh coffee and people there to serve you. Banana bread, hard boiled eggs, waffles and more. Missed the bacon though. :(5. Quiet...except when people drag suitcases by your room. 6. Downside: It is a bit far from downtown unless you want to bike or take a trolley. It is not walking distance to much so it's a bit far out. I have now been here twice and love it! Great for the person on a budget. The best you'll find for a fair price.I love yo travel and visit hotels. I've always said my dream job would be for someone to pay me to travel around the world visiting hotels and going to concerts. If you know someone willing to pay me to do this holler. Anyways I am here to tell you about my most recent adventure. I had the opportunity to stay at the Southern oaks inn in the beautiful St. Augustine Florida recently. This hotel exceeded my expectations. From the outside it doesn't look like much but oh my the service is top notch.On entering we were greeted by the sweetest ladies who made check in easy and got us directed to our rooms so we could start exploring. Our rooms was wonderful very spacious and clean. Plus it came with two queen beds which was awesome. The room was fully stocked with all the amenities one could need. From towels, to bathroom supplies to my much needed coffee. Plus the bathroom was clean with no mold growing anywhere. that truly impressed me. It's all about the little things. The outside area was also clean with plenty of parking space. the pool was nice it even came handicap accessible with chair lift something most hotels don't think about. also because this hotel is pet friendly they had a dork park for walking your dog.In the morning you are offered a wonderful breakfast. Kimberly our cook and server rocked. The breakfast is better then I have had anywhere it was a full course breakfast of eggs, meat, potatoes, grits, bread, bagels, cereal, coffee, juice and lots more.I have to say this was one of the best places we have stayed at in St. Augustine. Everything was of high quality and the staff was very helpful and friendly. If you ever stay in St. Augustine look them up and oh ask for Caroline at front desk she can tell you where to eat and what to visit she really knows the area. This is definitely on our must return list of hotels.Great price for a very nice room. Great service and great breakfast as well. Highly recommended!Great hotel and very affordable! Our room was very nice and clean. Everything looked brand new. King size bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. Mini fridge and microwave in the room was a big plus! The free breakfast in the morning was way more than I expected and was really good! The location was great. Very quiet, not very close to all the people and noise, but a 5 minute drive to everything! I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be back on future trips.My husband settled on this hotel after reading many reviews on Trip Advisor and <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>.

We've had numerous problems with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> not booking the correct room (ie had reserved two double queens when we clearly requested king).Beautiful laminate floors, comfortable bed and a very decent breakfast for 'free/inclusive). The room was very clean &amp; comfortable...the Ac was working almost too good. Hubby loved the temperature, I was freezing.The front desk staff was extremely helpful, courteous and genuine. This hotel does allow pets, so if you have allergies you might want to ask for a non pet room! If you want luxury, you're not getting it in a room at this hotel. If you're looking for a 2 - 3 star room you will be very happy (as we were).How is there only one other review for this wonderful little motel! We decided to do a quick escape from the city and drove up to st. Augustine's and landed in this motel by chance.  What luck! Is is immaculately clean, and recently remodeled. All the decor is updated and new and the floors are wood. Sooooo wonderful! No stinky old motel carpets! It's run by a lovely local family and they are extremely helpful. They also cook a giant breakfast! Eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage and so much more! This place was way more than we expected to get for the money and while not on the shaft of downtown, close enough to be convenient! Highly recommend.I don't recognize this place from the rave reviews I've read. Look, it wasn't awful, but it's no 4-5 star place. Our brief interactions with staff - front desk and breakfast, they could not have been nicer. Very courteous and helpful and not just due to training but they seemed to be genuinely nice people. And they're dog friendly. But the room was cold and spartan. Basic. Nothing on the walls, fake wood flooring, minimalist in most every way. This is not to say not to stay there. It's cheap and not a bad location and let's face it, you're not in St Augustine to sit in a hotel room.Speedy and friendly check in. The room reminding me of our apartment at home. It was spotless and was stocked with everything needed. The wood floors were very clean. There was a love seat in the room that was very modern. The location is great, only about .6 miles from the downtown distict. We were very pleased with the price and room. Will be booking again when we plan another trip.The hotel is great for the price and accepts pets! It includes an awesome cooked breakfast. I would recommend it to anyone traveling w pets for an affordable but nice location.If you're a college student on that college budget but still want to go on vacation, check this place out for a wonderful stay! Southern Oaks Inn is awesome! Cleanliness everywhere! Complimentary breakfast every morning - which was amazing, by the way! People working here were extremely nice! I'd definitely return :)My husband and I like to take long two week vacations once a year and we travel by car. So we stay in a lot of hotels. We have found that a lot of the ocean front hotels are very ""gross"" and just old and not very clean. So this hotel (is not beach side) but about the cleanest I have stayed in so far on our vacation this year. For the price I think it's great. Very clean. And for those pet owners, very pet friendly. It's not much to look at as far as fancy goes, but I'd stay here again.This is the best place I've stayed in an extremely long time. I didn't have to worry about anytihng. When I got there, one of the women were waiting on me (she thought we might be related). Everyone remembered my name and I'm not sure why but it definitely ade me feel great. I booked through travelosity and when I got to the hotel, they charged me at the counter. It turned out that I'd gotten charged twice, When I found out about the charge and called the hotel, the front desk was already taking care of it. I was instructed to call the front desk and speak to a manager the next day. When I called, the manager listened to me and took care of the problem. I got a call back from the manager. He'd fixed the problem. This place was awesome. They made sure everything was great. I didn't have to worry about anything. The floors are made of wood. The air feels cleaner in the room probably because there was no carpet to hold moisture, thus no mold. The shower is awesome. It's a shower only, no tub. The room looks like you'd pay for a more expensive room, which is great because all rooms should look nice. I'm never going to another hotel room ever again when in Staint Auguatine. In fact, that wa the only one I'd been to...as I've never been to St. Augustine prior to my trip. The breakfast is home made. It was a southern breakfast. Eggs, sausage, oatmeal, cerial, home made biscuits (they were so good), milk, orange juce, yogurt...country breakfast. I think this place put a lot of pride into the appearence of their place and I appreciate it a lot.","I needed to book a hotel room for the Gentlemen of the Road concert September 13-14, 2013 with in walking distance.  Most of the hotels in the area were already booked or charging FIVE TIMES the regular rate for the dates of the concert. I always stay at a Holiday Inn Express no matter what city I am in but there was not one close enough. I was pleasantly surprised with how well put together this hotel was being that it was not a major chain! The rooms were well decorated and CLEAN! The flooring in the rooms made such a difference! It was the only hotel that I have been to with a dog park! The reviews I read before booking put me at ease. We checked in after 10p and were met at the door and kindly told what room we could find the service desk person if we needed anything. I ran into the housekeeping staff on several occasions and chatted for a bit, They were a pair a great ladies, very helpful! I noted just a few things that could have helped. 1) there was only one lock on the door. Being that all rooms are accessible from the outside there should be at least a security bar inside or an additional lock that cannot be opened with a key card. 2) There was only one curtain and NO sheer. If you wanted to open the curtains anyone walking by could see in the room. We left the curtains closed the entire time but if a sheer curtain had been there we would've used  some natural light. 3) The water kept going from hot to cold when showering and the hot and cold knobs were installed on the wrong sides. 4) There was no ice machine. This was not a big deal as the housekeeping staff pre made bags of ice. These four things did not effect my stay or impression on the hotel at all. They are just small things I am suggesting for the comfort of future guests. All in all I enjoyed my stay there and would recommend Southern Oaks Inn!",,,,"['checked', 'let', 'say', 'yes', 'great', 'location', 'room', 'clean', 'queen', 'beds', 'comfortable', 'four', 'pillows',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-suites-downtown-saint-augustine,Comfort Suites Downtown,4.0,$$,17,"Location is just a few blocks from the old city, staff was friendly and eager to help, room was clean and spacious. We worried about notice in the Halloween weekend, but it was quite (we express our concern about noise ahead of time, so they put us on the end of the forth floor).One downside: charging $10 a day for parking is lame!Horrible experience with this hotel group. I called late one night to see if they had a room available as I had not yet decided if I was going to be staying in St Augustine that night. They had a couple rooms left. They told me to give my credit card number to hold the room, and I asked if anything going to be charged and they guaranteed me no. Later I called to cancel (and we are talking within an hour of the first call) to tell them I didn't need the room, and again asked if my card would be charged anything, and again they assured me no. Well ten days later I get a charge for the room that night! I called to speak with management multiple times and I was told there only there Monday, Wednesday, and Fridays and they're in and out on those days. I still have not got a call back. Horrible customer service!Stayed here for 4 nights during Thanksgiving. I can't tell you how wonderful the staff was there. Not a sour face. Everyone made us feel so at home. We got to know their names! Their rooms are clean and maintained. Huge thanks to  Waneta who was our housekeeper. This amazing woman works so hard every day and hopefully gets all credit she rightfully deserves. Amazing. The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to all shops and historic sites. I would not hesitate to return. Oh, and price was spot on! Very pleased.We checked in on Wednesday around 6:00 pm , we got greeted right away and we had no problem checking in and I booked our stay through PRICELINE, and YES there is a $5 a night for parking but it's worth it .We walked into our room and first thing I saw was that the room was clean and updated, my girl told me that the toilet inside could have used a little more scrubbing but it wasn't that bad.We have outlets every where where we can connect what we want and they have two USB connections also where you can charge your cellphones as well.People have been nice, cleaning lady always asks if we need more towels and if I have trash ( like empty boxes and wrapping paper) she tells me to leave it that she would take care of it .Haven't had breakfast here yet, we keep waking up too late  but the breakfast area looks clean .Over all our stay has been nice and quiet just how we like it ...I will stay here again for several reasons.It locates at the downtown historical area that all must-go places and restaurants are 5 to 10 minutes walking distance.The hotel is reasonable priced accommodates for family and families. Breakfast is included and parking cost you only 5 dollar a day. ($ 189 before tax for two-beds room. Price vary depends on seasons)Room we stayed was on 4th floor and it was recently remodeled. It is clean and very quite. Bed is soft. Room equipped with mini refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, hair dryer and free Wi-Fi.Fitness and swimming pool on site. The hotel is not fancy but has all features to ensure a comfortable staying at an economic cost.Stayed here for a 24 hour trip to St.Augustine with some friends (Nov 2014.) The room was clean, comfortable and updated. The staff was friendly. We happen to be there when there was some kind of large, all weekend pirate festival just one block over, and never had any issues with noise or anything despite many drunk pirates residing in this hotel too. :)  Plush bedding, upgraded cable package, comfortable layout, plush towels.  Nice, comfortable lobby with a large TV, and decent continental breakfast.  I don't like that they charge for parking, but in that area, you'll pay a lot more to park in city parking, and staying at this hotel, we never had to even use our car. Location location location. It's a 2-8 minute stroll to several really neat historical sites, as well as St.George street with all of the pubs, wineries, shops, and great little cafes.St. Augustine is really a place where you should stay at a bed and breakfast.  But if you are going the hotel rout for whatever reason this is not a bad place to stay.  Sure otherwise is a bit over priced if you think of it in terms of what you know about hotels in general, but considering a stay at a B&amp;B in this city is upwards of $175/night (I have only seen a few rooms at that price) and usually with a 2 night minimum, this place is definitely nicer on your wallet.  Aside from not being able to get a better deal at other hotels in this area, we also thought taking a 7 mo old to a B&amp;B would be a disaster.  Toting a stroller up and down the stairs and crying baby bothering other guests was out of the question.  What we didn't want to compromise on was location.The reviews I read about this hotel were all pretty standard. The staff is friendly. The rooms are decent. The towels and sheets are clean, etc. (The only thing I might not try is the whirlpool.  While it looks nice, tubs are harder to keep clean in general, and ones with jets even harder. ) What most people might not know is that it is a family owned and run operation.  The father owned a hotel on the land and now it has been past down to the son. The staff talked about them fondly which was refreshing.Everyone that stayed there when we did were really really nice people smiling and very courteous.  Families mostly on vacation from other states and some international guests as well.  Since the town is small, we saw the other guests in town and it was a nice feeling, like we were regulars and knew people.  Breakfast is served daily usually between 7 and 10 am.  The most modern part of the whole hotel is this breakfast room.  This location offers eggs, sausage, and waffles in addition to the usual continental fare. I'm not talking omelettes and grade A meat, but this isn't the Ritz and I didn't see anyone throw their food away and the place was packed. You might also complain about the hours being early, but as previously stated I went with my baby, and he is up by 6:30 like clockwork.  While it is fantastic to be in a town where nothing is commercialzed, this also means there isn't a Starbucks open at 6 am, so an early place to go for me was a life saver.  Also, the place is full, so whether everyone is an early riser or they just want to take advantage of the food, no one here was disappointed with the quality or offers.My favorite part about this hotel is the location.  It is a brief 8 minute walk to the center of the town, across the street from Riley`s, and around the corner from the public parking garage.Overall, this is a good hotel option for anyone looking to vacation in St. Augustine.  Just north of the Historic Downtown area, including Castillo de San Marcos and all of the food, drink, shopping and entertainment stores, you can easily drive or walk to all of these from the hotel.  The hotel itself isn't the best but you don't feel that they've skipped out on the important items like cleanliness.  Because the location is very close to the Historic Downtown area there is a daily parking charge but it's $7-10 depending on if you're staying on a weekday or weekend.  Book through one of the online sites like Expedia, Priceline or a membership like AAA and there are discounts.  I would stay at this hotel again.If you are looking for a cheap decent place to stay within walking distance to all the fun that is St. Augustine I would definitely recommend this hotel. We had a group of 5 staying overnight and the room easily accommodated our group plus a few others that came to hang out with us for the evening. I arrived earlier than our check-in time and they had no problem allowing me to go ahead and receive my parking pass so I could wander around while I waited for everyone else to arrive. They also allowed our friends to park there while we went to dinner even though they weren't staying the night. I will definitely remember them in the future when I want an affordable place to stay for an overnight getaway.Wow! Moldy smell to our room. When we complained to the staff, they did apologize and referred us to the owners? Email. Never heard anything from the owner, of course. Won't stay there again.Clean, comfortable bed, new, even has a kitchenette! Great price and walking distance to everything. Even served breakfast til 1030am I think. Loved it!! Will stay here again.At the last minute we decided to stay an extra day.  $125 AAA rate for a room with a jacuzzi, which we thought was very reasonable considering the location.  Very close to downtown.  Right next door is a bicycle rental shop, which we availed ourselves of.  Lounge chairs for sunning and a pool.  Continental breakfast was par for this type of establishment.  The jets on our jacuzzi were broken.  We asked them to fix it, but didn't get around to it.  The gentleman at the desk at check-out was helpful and reduced our rate to a normal non-jacuzzi price.Comfortable, clean, reasonably priced with good service in a convenient location.  Good choice for those who don't want to shell out for a B&amp;B.found out about this place through our AAA service. Got a good price with the discount, so I was willing to take a risk.Good:--good price--good location (within minutes walk to main downtown sites)--clean rooms--parking (only $5/day)Bad:--not well decorated in lobby or rooms--very basic--do continental breakfasts always have to be so lame?--I could hear the water pipes all night...oh wellI actually discovered this hotel through their 3D building model on Google Earth.  It's a typical new and clean hotel like you would see on the side of I-95, but with an outstanding location within easy walking distance of the Castillo de San Marcos and downtown St. Augustine.  (1/4 mile)  Free parking, and decent breakfast.  I was very satisfied with the room and price, which was only $85 through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>.We have stayed at this hotel about 7 times.  While there are down sides....the walls are thin and the breakfast is predictable and average but free, overall it is very much worth returning again and again.  We love to walk and it is about a half mile from shops, restaurants and bars.  We have almost always been able to check in early and the management is very accomodating.  Price varies.....we have paid $75 and $160....just depends on the time of year.  Give it a try.  Ask for a high room facing downown, the view is fabulous.Clean, comfortable hotel. Walking distance to Historic downtown shops and restaurants. Friendly staff and nice hot breakfast. Pool was small but was not planning on using during the trip.Clean &amp; no bugs! Helpful staff. Breakfast offerings good as well. Close to an old town trolley stop as well as area attractions. I will come back.",,,,,"['location', 'blocks', 'old', 'city', 'staff', 'friendly', 'eager', 'help', 'room', 'clean', 'spacious', 'worried', 'notice', 'weekend', 'quite', 'express', 'concern', 'noise',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/inn-on-charlotte-saint-augustine,Inn On Charlotte,5.0,$$,15,"I found this bread and breakfast in Trip Advisor and it was listed as the #2 best B&amp;B in St Augustine.  This is our first trip here and as we walked around we noticed a ton of B&amp;B Inns.  There are something like 33.  The owners of The Inn on Charlotte also have a B&amp;B next door called the Hemingway House.  We would have liked to get one of the rooms with the front balcony and Jacuzzi but when we booked there was only one room left.  We were not disappointed. We arrived around 1:30 pm and our room wasn't ready until check-in at 3 but we were able to park in our spot behind the Inn and explore.  The Inn is located in the hub of the city and has restaurants right around it.  It has a large porch to relax on and they always have available water and ice tea along with pretzels and chocolate chip cookies.  They also offer a happy hour around 5 p.m. with wine and beer.  We were immediately welcomed with southern charm and made to feel at home.  We enjoyed the fabulous breakfasts offered at the Inn each morning at 9:15 a.m. and appreciated having our own dining table.  Breakfast can also be ordered and put on a tray to take up to your room.  The time for breakfast worked out well for us, even though we are early risers.  We would get up early and go out to watch beautiful sun rises over the bay and have a refreshing walk, come back for a shower and then down for breakfast.  Coffee and hot tea is available around 8 a.m.. if you wish to sit inside in the living room or outside on the porch or take up to your room.We felt total comfort while staying here and the owners were friendly, accommodating, yet not intrusive.  Our king size bed was very comfortable and the huge spa shower was wonderful.  Our room was clean and comfy with adequate plug ins for laptops and cell phones.We parked our car when we got there and did not move it until we left.  Everything is within walking distance or a trolley ride away. We were there during high season with the Festival of Lights making night walking around town a spectacular light show and festival atmosphere with trolley cars filled with guests singing Christmas songs and having a grand time.We were at the Inn for three nights and are already trying to pick dates for next year.You can not beat the location and if you like people watching get a room with a balcony. The staff are very friendly and helpful. If you like B and B's this is the place for you. The only thing I can nock them for is when breakfast is served. It is served at 9:15 which is good for most but I happen to be a early riser. The food is 5star quality.We stayed in the Anna marcotte room.  This room is perfect.  It offered quietness and your own private entrance.  The location of this inn is in the heart of the historical district.  We will definitely return.We were down visiting family and decided to stay at a B&amp;B in St. Augustine for our first night. One couple had a room inside the house and another had a room out back. We knew what we were in for, since we had booked based on the room pictures on the website. Parking was fine, we never ended up moving the car, as everything is already within walking distance. We all enjoyed the complimentary cocktail hour, light snacks and breakfast! I'd come back just for another breakfast! Hospitality was at its best here.They just purchased the house to the left and will be adding on more rooms soon, so that's a plus!Just got back from a weekend at this wonderful B &amp; B. We were here for a wedding and friends of ours stayed all over town. Throughout the weekend many of them ended up visiting our little bungalow. Needless to say everyone was envious of our quaint room, with whirlpool tub, convenient parking and delicious breakfast and happy hour.  Rodney &amp; Gerry have a great thing going here and we can not wait to book our next trip with them.  Our most difficult decision will be staying here or next door at the sister property they just bought; Hemingway House Bed &amp; Breakfast.Charming. Great front porch. Excellent location.  We didn't get more than 2 blocks away our first night. Rooms are not very large but the living room and covered porch offer space to relax. Breakfast was good both days. Parking was very convenient.The staff is very friendly and the location is excellent. I would definitely recommend the bungalow for anyone wanting a little privacy. Our room wasn't huge but had a whirlpool bath. No complaints.My husband and I stayed here in May of last year on a whim.  It was his first experience at a bed &amp; breakfast and thus began his addiction to B&amp;Bs (he still counts this as his #1).  The owners and staff were very sweet and welcoming.  Breakfast was delicious.  My husband still speaks of how delicious the breakfast was and he's the biggest foodie I know.We stayed in one of the rooms on the second floor with a balcony looking over the street. I highly recommend staying in one of those rooms (the room next to us had a fireplace- perfect for Jan/Feb). It's lovely to sip a glass of wine and just watch the goings on from above, especially during a thunderstorm.  Very romantic B&amp;B...and right in middle of all the action in St.Augustine.  I highly recommend.My wife and I recently stayed at the Inn On Charlotte and it was fantastic.  We stayed in Anna Marcotte's Hideaway and the privacy was wonderful.  The room was very clean and quiet.   The location provided easy access to many restaurants and attractions.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back again.My bride and I decided to take a weekend getaway in San Augustine and thought this was the perfect location. In the middle of downtown St. Augustine, the Inn close to everything. The service was top-notch and the staff provided everything that we needed. The complimentary wine or beer before we went out for the evening was an especially nice touch. Sitting out on the quiet patio in the morning made my morning cup o joe and paper that much more enjoyable. The Marjorie Rawlings bungalow was particularly quaint and made for quiet stay with comfortable beds. The breakfast may have been the best part. Thanks again to the wonderful staff, my wife and I will definitely be back againIt was my first time in St. Augustine, my wife and I decided to get married in the town due to its grace and beauty. We ended up spending the night in the B&amp;B after our wedding. I found all of the rumors my wife was boasting about this place to be true. The beds are like clouds, the rooms are super clean, and the shower was heavenly. But nothing beats the breakfast in the morning. The sausage and eggs make you feel like you are having sausage and eggs for the first time. The orange juice is so delicious. I gotta say that the pancakes with the banana on top was a deliciously nice touch. And the staff is phenomenal, they really make you feel at home.  I recommend this place to anyone. I fell in love with the town, but more so with this place. Thanks guys, I will see you soon.I was just thinking about places in St. Augustine worthy of my time to review and the Inn on Charlotte definitely fits the bill. My memory is hazy and at this point, I can't remember if it was December 2011 or 2010 that my wife and I stayed there. In any case, the Inn is absolutely beautiful, nicely decorated, and in an excellent location. The owners were very nice and liberal with the complimentary wine! Lastly, the breakfast was incredible and they even discussed their homemade pecan syrup with my wife. We'll be coming back here if we can escape town without the baby.We recently stayed at the Inn on Charlotte for a friend's Bridal Shower and Bachelorette weekend. It was the perfect place for a weekend with the girls! The location is central to Old Town and a perfect walking distance to everything! We had the entire Inn to ourselves, and Rod, Ann, and Jerry made us feel comfortable and right at home! When we arrived Friday, we were greeted by Rod &amp; Ann and beverages, light snacks, and cocktails (mandatory for a Girl's weekend!). Rod (a true Southern gentleman) even let us decorate for Bridal Shower games on Friday night! Rod &amp; Ann were helpful and friendly without being overbearing or intrusive, and had great advice on where to go and where to eat in St. Augustine. Breakfast every morning was to die for - the egg souffle our first morning there? UN-believable.  While we found the Inn to be perfect our purposes, it is also perfect for couples, anniversaries, or even small family reunions! Each room was private and luxurious without feeling like we would break something at every turn, and the showers &amp; tubs were truly relaxing. We would definitely stay at the Inn on Charlotte next trip to St. Augustine! Thanks Rod, Ann, and Jerry!We walked into our room and said, ""WOW""!  We stayed in Tiffany Suite and the room was beautifully furnished, super clean, really comfortable bed and very quiet.  The breakfast was served at our own table in the dining room, and was yummy!  Oh, and homemade chocolate chip cookies in the cookie jar all the time!Hospitality at it's best.  Our stay at the Inn on Charlotte was outstanding in every respect.  The room (Anna Marcotte's Hideaway) was beautifully furnished, rich with character and charm.  Great location puts you within walking distance of shops, restaurants and experiencing St. Augustine at it's finest. After a good night's sleep in a very comfortable bed, it was great to wake up to delicious breakfast (makes you want to stay another night).  The innkeepers and staff were gracious and made us feel very comfortable and welcome.  We will definitely return and would recommend it to anyone.",,,,,"['found', 'bread', 'breakfast', 'trip', 'advisor', 'listed', 'best', 'amp', 'first', 'trip', 'walked', 'around', 'noticed', 'ton',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/bayfront-inn-st-augustine,Bayfront Inn,2.5,$$$,12,"Going with 3 stars on this visit. And I'll get you the facts first: 1. This is not an upscale place, but will do if you need a location within walking distance for everything in the downtown historical district.2. Rooms are very small, so if you've got a family, or plan on spending a ton of time in your room, you may want to look elsewhere. 3. Yep, the rooms smell pretty ""Florida-y."" If you've ever lived by the beach, you know this smell: a little damp, combined with sand and salt. (Even though the location is on the bay.) It didn't bother me, but if you are sensitive to this type of thing, bring some air freshener. 4. Bed was a little hard, but I prefer them a bit firmer. And no down pillows here, so bring your own if that's what you like. 5. The internet connect is like everyone says.... not reliable and in and out. I think I had to log in again probably 15 times during our 2 day stay, so if you've got work to do, bring an air card or a router from home. We attempted HBO GO one night, and it was pretty much a disaster. Ok, now to expand of some things. This hotel has a DEDICATED PARKING LOT! In this area, this feature is HUGE, no fighting for street parking, running out to feed meters, or parking blocks away, as some locations in this area will have you do. Yes, the rooms are dated, but definitely not the worst I've seen. The bathrooms are also small, but have been redone.They have a pool! After being in a super hot bridesmaid dress all day, and dancing up a storm at the wedding we were in town for, a cool dip was the absolute perfect way to cool down after a long day. (Pool is open until 10 PM.) The customer service was super, super friendly! The doors are pretty sturdy and heavy, so when we accidentally locked ourselves out, twice in 15 minutes, they were really awesome about getting us a replacement key(s) pretty quick. They do offer a continental breakfast, but we didn't partake. If you want an awesome continental breakfast, stay at a B&amp;B. They do offer coffee and tea, so we did take them up on that. All in all, is it glamorous? Hell no. Will it do in a pinch? Yes. Would I stay here again? Yup, especially due to that designated parking lot and proximity to all the things you'll probably want to do/and see in the area. And the pricing is a little bit more reasonable than other options in the area.I was hesitant to book this hotel based on reviews but was in town for one night for a wedding . This hotel was booked solely due to the location because it was around the corner from the wedding venue.  I will be honest. Upon seeing the hotel for the first time, it made me think of a glorified Days Inn. The definitely pros to this Inn are the location and a dedicated parking lot which is complimentary so I will give them that. The hotel room itself is small but has all the necessities you will need. I personally wouldn't stay here longer than one night but that is my personal opinion.   Also, don't expect to get any peace and quiet. The walls are paper thin. I could hear children screaming and running outside . And someone peeing upstairs. Grosssssss. Don't be fooled by the website. The beach is across the street. You're not on the beach. My view was the asphalt parking lot. Now for the ""highlight"" of my stay. After coming back to my room late after attending the wedding, I noticed that there was a gurgling sound coming from the sink. I really didn't think anything of it until I walked over and noticed water coming up from the drain and it kept going and overflowed . I had to race to move all my toiletries and makeup. And the water was murky with brown particles. NOT COOL. Disgusting to be honest.  I called the front desk and the poor guy that came out was great. He cleaned up the mess and checked the sink, toilet and bathtub but he wasn't a plumber so I didn't really get any solid answers. Except that they are having plumbing issues and having work done . Which basically infuriates me since this room should never have been booked. And to add insult, they didn't have any vacant rooms to move me to.   So I sucked it up and stayed. But was leery about using the sink/toilet, etc for fear that water would come up out of nowhere.  The next morning, upon inspection of the shower I noticed hair in there. The attention to detail with cleaning was not up to standards. I met other guests at the wedding who stayed here and had similar stories (thankfully no flooding issues). I think for a hotel where I am paying over $200 a night, this is unacceptable. And to add insult, the poor woman at the front desk could only offer me a $30 credit to my card (plus tax). Yep, not satisfied.I wouldn't recommend this hotel and if you do want to chance it, bring Clorox wipes and don't have high expectations.HORRIFIC!!!!! NOT KID FRIENDLY!!!!!!!!Place is outdated.....made out of straw. You cannot walk around after 10pm because the downstairs tenant will complain.. Offered free breakfast but the breakfast lady was very angry whenever you would approach the breakfast counter. If you even think of going for seconds you will be charged for the breakfast.. We had to check out early because they completely made us feel out of place. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE A LARGE FAMILY. We booked a 2 room suite with 1 master and 2 queen beds and the complaints were unbearable.. Completely ruined our Christmas vacation. Update: I had the displeasure of speaking to the owner of this place ""VIRGINIA"" I can truly see why the staff is very rude and non-caring. It begins with the owner. She was not accepting to anything i had to say. Virginia, dont ever argue with a customer about your cheap continental breakfast when they just paid you $750 dollars for 2 nights.We checked in here - looks like a dated / standard motel but stayed at their off property - sea turtle cottage - see that review,Still giving it 2 stars, but more news... *The breakfast was okay. There is now hot meals along with the typical cold breakfast. *The Internet is awful. I think we got maybe 10-15 minutes of wifi for the entire stay. We were two doors down from the front desk.Great location. Was in walking distance to all the attractions in St. Augustine. Old, small rooms but very clean.  Front desk was very helpful. Served its purpose as we only used the room to sleep.We stayed off site at Charlotte's Cottage for the weekend and it was great! The cottage had everything we needed for nice little weekend vacation away from home. Definitely enhanced the historic feel of St. Augustine by being in an old carriage house. The cottage is on the south side of most of the restaurants and bars but we brought the beach cruisers and it was not more than a 10min bike ride from everything. Also note, that it is on the same property of a larger house about 40yards away, but we never saw anyone there.  Has a great patio to eat outside in. Only 1 bed and 1bathroom, both upstairs and the bedroom doesn't have a door. No WIFI either, which didn't matter to us cause we were there to get away, but just thought I would mention it. Overall, a fantastic, private spot for a couple or small family to change it up a bit rather than staying in a hotel for the same price.We weren't impressed &amp; would NOT stay here again. It's not upscale at all (as another reviewer claims). And definitely not as glamorous as the website makes it seem. Cons:- Every room has a view of the parking lot and NOT the waterfront (as the website says). Across the street from the parking lot you can see the water, but you wouldn't want to ""sit outside your room &amp; relax"" (as a reviewer says), because you'd just be looking at a crummy parking lot. - We stayed in the queen room, which was small, as was the bathroom. - - The room was mostly clean, except for a large white stain on the carpet and some long hairs in the bathroom (Eww)! - The room also had a very strong chlorine smell. - The continental breakfast, although free, is worth skipping. It had dry cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, toast, oj, &amp; coffee. Not even worth it. Pros:- Very affordable &amp; cheaper than other hotels in the area. - Walking distance to the downtown area. - Free parking.Very up scale decor for a small place, Rooms clean and quiet. Clean pool and two story out door deck for relaxing.Walking distance from most attractions.   Have stayed here before and will again.Clean, large room. Direct view of the bay &amp; light house. Nice folks. Average cold continental breakfast. Great location, easy walk to center of Historic District.stinky room, horrible breakfast, crappy dirty old place... don't book it!!!!Wonderful location, good price, nicely refurbed rooms, close to what's happening in St. Augustine.  They have a great second floor balcony for sitting and pondering life.  I prefer this to the Casa Monica; more casual, simple and exceptionally clean.  Good place to meet a stranger on a Harley, who offered to give me a ""private tour"".  Four hours later and lots of info on the history of St. Augustine, this kind gentleman dropped me off at my door.  Thank you stranger.  Loved the moonlit walk on the beach.",,,,,"['going', 'stars', 'visit', 'facts', 'first', 'upscale', 'place', 'need', 'location', 'within', 'walking', 'distance', 'everything', 'downtown',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/ocean-sands-beach-inn-saint-augustine,Ocean Sands Beach Inn,4.0,$$,12,"Great inexpensive hotel in St Augustine Beach. The hotel was just across the street to their private beach. The hotel and room was very clean. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. We had a jacuzzi right inside of our room. It came with breakfast. Only a few minute drive to downtown. The only issue was that the bathroom door didn't close all the way. We definitely would stay here again.Nice and friendly staff! Which was the best part of our stay. Very good location and nice private beach access. However, not worth the money. Carpet in hallways were filthy like it hadn't been vacuumed in weeks and wasn't vacuumed the whole time we were there. FYI: there are no elevators. It wreaked in the halls and in the room. Air didn't work well and was humid in the room and building. What topped it all off was the room...... Dust everywhere, crumbs everywhere (night stands and floor included) hair all over the bathroom, dirty toilet, and the bed had sand all over it even though it looked freshly made. My husband is an HVAC contractor and specificity had this to say, "" This complex very obviously has a humidity problem. The first things noticed were humidity bags in the stairwell, a dank odor and small amounts of mold growing on the caulking in sections of the complex. The real give away was the fact that the room was not comfortable until the temperature came down towards 70 degrees and lower. A properly dehumidified space should be comfortable even at temperatures between 75 and 80 degrees. This probably has a Lot to do with the dank musty odors we experienced."" If the price was lower they may have gotten a better rating as the staff and services provided were excellent.Clean.  Quiet.  Nice-enough amenities, and a sliding glass door that we could park right outside of.  ...a nice touch on a raw, rainy day!A lot of folks here seemed to come for the beach (right across the two-lane blacktop and over the dune) but we were just on our way home after a couple of weeks on the road.  My wife wanted to see St. Augustine, and I was along for the ride.  St. Aug's was well worth it, but that's for a different review.As for the OSB Inn, everything in our room was well cared for, if not brand new.  The staff was nothing if not gracious and helpful.  The breakfast niceties were all there, but they also had WAFFLES.  Yeah.  Good ones, that you had to make yourself.  If they'd have had real maple syrup, I might have gone with that fifth star.  I'm not easy, but hey:  murple surple IS murple surple, after all.  We'd gladly stay here again.There are soooo many things about this place that made our recent stay wonderful!!It was referred to us by a friend, and recommended we book our room on the 2nd floor to see the ocean over the dunes.  We got a room with a king sized bed and huge/deep jacuzzi tub to luxuriate in.  If you want to go into town and not have to worry about parking, simply ask the front desk to have a shuttle come pick you up.  The breakfast served was typical of hotel fare these days and included with the room.  They do need more room though for their guest seating.  If more than four people come, it's crowded.I would definitely book there again....and again....and again.Our room was clean and the bed very comfy!!  The staff was very helpful and friendly too.  Thank you my friend for the referral!!!Room on the second floor on the corner (224 I think?) ocean view king was totally worth the extra $24 Dollars a night. Our room was $124/night.Room was clean and the front desk staff was very helpful.Having the beach right across the street was really nice and the air conditioning worked incredibly well.The pool is small, and the love bugs were out of control while we were there but not crowded and pleasant enough.Would totally stay here again in St. AugustineOcean Sands Inn made our vacation! We booked through HotelsTonight to find this gem. The Location you can't beat! The staff there was awesome the evening lady who checked us in was so kind, she upgraded us to a room with a jacuzzi tub, when I asked about a spa, recommended a great pizza place, even helped me print out some papers I need for work. All with a smile : ) . The morning front desk management was just as kind. They told me how to look for sharks teeth, even gave me one when I couldn't find any! The complimentary breakfast was perfect. The hotel is slightly worn but not enough to complain about. Living in Miami is was very refreshing to be surrounded with southern hospitality. They really made us feel welcome. Thank you!I've stayed in a few hotels around the Saint Augustine Area and would recommend this above all others. Clearly the best thing about Ocean Sands Beach Inn is the location, you are right across a tiny street from the ocean and you get to hear the waves all day, you have a stellar view if you are on the second floor/ocean side and the beach there is calm/relaxing. The other big plus is that it's a smaller place, so not noisy or crazy and there really is nothing on the street next to you that will keep you from relaxing.The room itself was simple, clean with a fridge/microwave/keurig coffee maker and normal TV. Nothing exciting but certainly had all the basic things you'd want in a room.As far as amenities, you don't really go for that, the pool seems small but clean (I didn't get in) and the breakfast location was TINY, that became filled up with only one or two people in there, I guess that's the only drawback.For the location, price and the fact that it's in beautiful Saint Augustine, I know that my wife and I will be staying here again next time we are in the area.I stayed here thru Hotwire so I had no idea where I'd be staying except the general area. I was very pleased. The lady at the front desk was very nice, the beds were clean comfortable and I had a great nights sleep before the half marathon, And, there was a keurig in the room! And a small fridge and a microwave. No elevator but it's only two stories . Had a great relaxing nightI have to say that the ppl that took care of us at check in and check out, were SUPER nice!!!  What a great way to end your night with kind courtesy and check out with a be safe on your travels, hope to see you back.   This little hotel was not the best as far as modern, or large rooms, but the staff and the clean rooms in my opinion make up for that!! It's right across the street from the beach and you can open up your sliding glass doors to hearing waves!  They do allow pets at 20 dollars extra a night, and the beach is pet friendly!!  I am so sorry, I meant to take photos of the room but next time we are there I will.  I have no doubt you will enjoy your stay here!!! The photos I have included are right across from our room !!This was not a fancy hotel by far. However, the room was clean with a microwave and refrigerator. The staff was welcoming and helpful. The best part, literally right across from the beach. We could hear the waves from our patio and get to the beach in 30 seconds. Hotel is just 10 mins from historic St Augustine. I would stay again!You get what you pay for, and Ocean Sands Beach Inn doesn't charge much.The Mister had an emotional attachment to Ocean Sands Beach Inn after a trip here with the previous future ex Mrs Mister and insisted we go back on a recent trip to St Augustine. He told me three things: it was not upscale, it was right on the water and there might be a hot tub in the room - the middle of the room. Um. Okay.The hotel was, by our DC standards, ridiculously cheap. We had an ocean view room on the 2nd - and top - floor. The keys were super old school and the thread count on the sheets was about equal to my body weight. The towels were a little threadbare, but a note told you it was possible to buy your own at the front desk. Because it was literally across the street from the beach, it had that musty smell houses on salt water often get. The room had a coffee maker, tv, hairdrier. It was a little bit outside of St Augustine, but still a quick drive into Old Town. There weren't a lot of restaurants around, something we realized a bit too late at night. The best part about Ocean Sands is that you are just across the A1 from the beach. You can hear the waves all day and night long. We loved being able to come back from town and take a long walk along the water. For that reason - and strange dearth of upscale hotels in the area - I'd probably stay here again.My sons and I stayed here this past weekend and it was perfect for us!  Clean AND comfortable as well as convenient to everything.  Beautiful vistas from the oceanfront balcony and amazing sunsets from the pool overlooking the marsh.  The staff was nothing but professional and accommodating.  From Margie who answered the phone and filled us in on all the details about the room and area to the manager who checked us out and was very kind.  I highly recommend this quaint and peaceful inn to anyone who wants to enjoy a nice stay in St. Augustine.  Between all three of us you get 6 thumbs up!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-historic-district-saint-augustine,Hampton Inn Historic District,3.0,$$$,10,"The Staff at this location were friendly and very helpful. Its a great location based on the fact that you are not too far from the historical district, which is about a mile away. They have an awesome hot breakfast that includes Waffles, Oatmeal, Yogurt, Potatoes, Eggs, Assortments of Fruits and Pastries, and egg bagels. Coffee and Tea are available 24/7 and they have Cucumber Water which is very refreshing. The hotel rooms are very nice and modern, and Wi-fi and Cable are included. Also if you are an honors club member you are greeted with extra snacks that are provided at the front desk and bottled waters. Also they offer complimentary toiletries. Which was great because I totally forgot my toothpaste and toothbrush. Also the products they offered for Shampoo and Conditioner were by Neutrogena. Overall my stay was pleasant!We did not stay here because they were fully booked. But I will in the future upon returning to St Augustine because of Robin &amp; her fantastic customer service. We arrived unplanned on a Saturday night. She took the time to call other hotels to see about vacancies when she was very busy. Offered us coffee, water &amp; cookies while we waited. She found us two king size sweets at another hotel at a very nice discounted rate. Just for her being super friendly &amp; going out of her way to help us we will return there to stay.I stay at Hampton s all up and down the east Coast ... NEVER NEVER have I been in a room where another bed was put in the room I assume for more money.. You just about had to crawl over the bed to get to another one. ( See pictures) so the story is..A few nights ago I stopped at the Hampton Inn on Ponce de Leon in St Augustine. I asked the rate and because, the rate was reasonable I said great 2 nights please . Later that night I checked my bank account and I saw that I was charged much more than was stated lets say about $120.00 dollars more per night. I called the front desk placed the phone in the room on speaker so that my wife could hear . The front desk Associate said  "" I have no problem correcting that"" . The next morning I checked the charges again and nothing had changed . I walked down to the front desk and spoke with a Associate that said "" he was not working and he would"" check on that"" later that day I stopped by the desk and was told that he ""spoke with everyone concerned and they knew nothing about that rate""  Not to mention this but the room was so small that you had the crawl over the bed to get to the other side of the room. I have stayed at Hamptons for years near have I seen a room like this. So far I am being cheated out of over $100.00 a night and had a cracker box room. If they are doing this to me they have /will do it to other Guests.?STAY AWAYI'm a loyal Hampton customer. Unless I am looking for a resort, boutique, or other special property, I will almost always choose Hampton over other brands. I rate almost every hampton 4 stars. The nicer properties, or ones that stand out in any special way, I rate 5. The ones that fall short, like this one, 3. We chose this property because of it's location. Not exactly in downtown area, but a very short drive. Best of both worlds...save a little money, have a quieter place to stay. Had the service been better, this would have been a great choice. Checking out at this property was very annoying. There was only one person at the front desk, and he did not call for anybody to back him up when he ran into a delay with one guest. He saw that we were in a panic for time, after waiting there almost 10 minutes. He could not have cared less. Either he had no back up, or just had an attitude. In either case, he handled the situation terribly. A couple of people walked away from the counter in frustration. He pretended to be oblivious to what was going on. This property is not one of Hampton's newest or nicest. Had this experience not happened, it would have been a tough call whether to give them the 4th star or not. The bad experience made the decision much easier. One positive note: the lady working the dining room at breakfast went above and beyond and was so helpful and nice. I wish I could remember her name.This Hampton Inn gets the benefit of the doubt for that third star because even though my stay was leaning toward a 2-star stay, it wasn't really their fault.Problem is, apparently we stayed here on a busy weekend. When I booked the room, there were only two options left: a smoking room, or a non-smoking room.  The non-smoking room was $100 more (a suite, I think), putting it in the price range that we were trying to avoid, and actually in line with the much nicer Historic District Hilton.So, reluctantly we chose the smoking room thinking that at least they surely deodorize it or whatever.  And they do.  The bad news is that the window doesn't open so the room is caked with a stagnant, stale stench of a million smokers mixed with a million bottles of Febreze.  If you find yourself in a similar situation, don't underestimate it.  I'm generally not even remotely offended by cigarette smoke, and we've stayed in smoking rooms before without much issue.  But this, it knocked me back when I opened the door.  I could taste it in the morning, ick.Anyway, as I said, they get the benefit of the doubt because it's not their fault that I'm too cheap to spring for the suite (our upcoming wedding necessitates our frugality). The breakfast was standard Hampton Inn fare, and the employees were generally friendly.  The water pressure in the shower was actually above average.  Otherwise it was nondescript except for another odd smell in the hallways, not as bad as in our room but it was there.It's a Hampton! Pretty much the quality you'd expect from the brand name. Great location if you don't want to stay in the down town area but not too far away either.As Honors Club members this was the worst experience we have had at a Hampton inn no Love for members and free bugs.We were there off season when the place was half empty and were given a room the was smaller due to the vending and ice machines in the corridor.But it got worse after returning from dinner the desk on the internet center was crawling with bugs.We quickly asked for another room on a different floor.Will never stay at this Hampton inn againThis hotel is fine if you are looking for a cheap option close to the action of St. Augustine, and if you aren't looking to spend a ton of time in your hotel. Technically, you could walk to the downtown area, but it's a bit far. The staff is friendly and the check-in process is easy (and there is free coffee, beverages and cookies in the lounge). The room was about what I would expect for a Hampton Inn. It was pretty clean and had everything you'd expect in a basic hotel room, except the pleather couch in the corner really looked gross to me. There also was kind of a weird odor in the hotel. We had a lot of Hilton Honors points, so the hotel only cost $34/night. We spent the night out on the town and probably only spent about a total of 9 hours in the hotel itself. They do provide a basic continental breakfast in the lounge in the mornings. My advice is, stay here if you are looking for something cheap and basic, but don't come here if you're looking for a romantic or classy stay!This place is a find.  Small, it is clean, the people very courteous, rooms nice and Old St Augustine is a 5 minute drive.  I ohVe been to St Augustine many times before, but the first time here.  Will definitely stay again.Not the best Hampton Inn I've been to, but out of all the ""Inns""  Hampton Inn is usually consistently the best.  Clean sheets, comfortable beds, nice service.  I wasn't displeased with this Hampton Inn at all, but not wowed by it either.",,,,,"['staff', 'location', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'great', 'location', 'based', 'fact', 'far', 'historical', 'district',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/cedar-house-inn-saint-augustine,Cedar House Inn,5.0,$$,10,"We just returned from our stay at the Cedar House Inn. The first of many visits to come, I'm certain. Right in the heart of historic St. Augustine, the inn is a meticulously restored Victorian gem, beautifully furnished to create a romantic old-world experience. A great night's sleep in our four-poster bed fitted out with sumptuous linens. Breakfast was simply delicious. And Cyndi and her staff ... we feel as if we've known them forever. The loveliest people, welcoming you into the loveliest home imaginable. We've had the good fortune to stay at some high-end B&amp;B's, and the Cedar House is absolutely on par with the best of the best. We loved it. Loved every minute of it.This B&amp;B has everything. The owner, Cyndi, is very friendly and sweet and made sure we had everything we needed to make our stay comforable and enjoyable. She truly made us feel like we were at home. She even encouraged to help ourselves and have a glass of wine from the living room/lobby whenever we wanted to. Every room is beautifully decorated in Victorian style and looks very refined and welcoming. The breakfast is a real experience: prepared from scratch, beautifully presented, delicious, and fresh! Thanks Cyndi for your warm welcome and for making our stay so memorable!I've stayed at five St. Augustine B&amp;Bs now, and while you can't go wrong with any of them I think, my experience at the Cedar House was truly excellent. Breakfast was to die for and everything was just so lush and lovely and still grandly decorated for Christmas. Cyndi knows exactly what she's doing and will make you feel 100% at home. I can't wait to go back.My wife and I recently stayed at the Cedar House Inn. It was our first time at a B&amp;B and we stayed here because the reviews on trip advisor made this the number one in St. Augustine. It was everything the reviews claimed it would be and more. The location was perfect (walking distance from everything), the food was gourmet quality, and the owner (Cyndi) made EVERYTHING the best experience we could have ever imagined.  We stayed in the Sanibel Room. Private entrance (which was nice) and very clean inside and out. Free cookies and wine 24/7.  We highly recommend this B&amp;B to anyone going to St. Augustine.This place is so amazing. My husband and I stayed there this weekend and I can't express how wonderful it was. Cyndi (the owner) made us feel like family. I just wanted to hug her the minute I met her. Everything was very clean and beautiful. Breakfast each morning was honestly the best breakfast I've ever had in my life. I would stay there again just to have breakfast. Apparently she is actually releasing a cook book soon which I am super exited about. If you are going to saint augustine definitely stop by. You will love love love this place. Casandra &amp; David PerezWhen arriving at this b&amp;b I thought it looked cute. Little garden out front with a little fountain, wrap-around porch and Victorian style home. Made me feel welcome. Trying to open the front door, it was locked. You had to ring the doorbell and there greeted Ms. Cindy, the owner, by saying welcome home!!. She had a warm welcoming smile, truly excited we made it, and you could tell she loved people. She sat us down asked if we wanted anything to drink and then we discussed what the best places are to visit and were she recommended. She is truly awesome! Bet accommodating and wants us to have as much fun as we can! She gave us a mini tour and brought us into our room. She explained how to work the AC and the fan and let us get on our way. My girlfriend and I are celebrating our 2 year anniversary and the next time we come up here I will definitely stay here. Btw, in the morning she cooked us all breakfast and used real, that's right, REAL products. Eggs were not in a box, she picked her own veggies and herbs. The dishes were amazing and the group shared a few laughs. She has successfully ran her b&amp;b and it is my pleasure to be sharing my experience to you all!!My husband and I stayed at the Cedar House Inn for one night during our Honeymoon December 25th 2011. We stopped in St Augustine and had made arrangements for the night with Cyndi the Inn Owner. Cyndi greeted up promptly upon arrival and we all sat in her lovely Victorian Parlor for a chat. She gave us wonderful recommendations for sightseeing and was above and beyond helpful and charming. When we arrived at our room we were stunned, Gorgeous! With an antique clawfoot tub. If you are fortunate enough to stop in this beautiful historic city please stay at The Cedar House Inn, for you will not regret it. What an experience and wonderful start to our Honeymoon. The service was superior, food amazing and location to die for.We arrived at the Cedar House Inn and were welcomed by Cyndi into her beautiful house as if we had been friends for decades. She sat us down, gave us the best tips on what to do around St. Augustine, showed us around the Inn and made us feel so very welcome and at home. We had read on Trip Advisor about her wonderful breakfasts, but we never would have imagined (until the next morning) how correct the reviews were, until we tasted them ourselves. We stayed for several days, and each day we enjoyed a totally different breakfast experience from Cyndi and help from Gina! Each day after coming back from our ""tourist"" trip, we were welcomed back by Cyndi as she was getting the Inn ready for the Christmas light displays and she always stopped to ask about our day, offer us a beverage or some fresh baked cookies. One night we had brought back a loaf of fresh bread, and Cyndi even toasted it for us, served on a platter with her ""special"" datil jelly while my wife and I spent 4 hours finishing up a puzzle they had in the living room (with some excellent wine to boot)! We stayed in the Vizcaya, and was so pleased with the decore, coziness, cleanliness and warmth of the room. After each meal, we would return to the room to find it all made up, fresh linens, clean trash bins and even my shoes were tucked away neatly (Cudos on that)! We love that there is an internal and external entrance to each room, plus climate control for each room! We really enjoyed all that St. Augustine has to offer, never felt unsafe walking around town at night, and visited some incredible sites and monuments. Please make sure to take the trolley ride around town, it sure helps you understand about the history of St. Augustine! When we return, we will only be staying at the Cedar House Inn, thank you so very much CyndiThis is a great place.  Highly recommended.  Check out the reviews on tripadvisor.All I have to say is Wow!!.   We loved the B&amp;B.  Cyndi is a wonderful host.  She and her assistant Gina made us feel like we were staying with family.  Breakfast was to die for.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-monterey-inn-bayfront-st-augustine,The Monterey Inn Bayfront,2.5,$$,9,"The third star is for location and the wonderful sundeck that overlooks Matanzas bay. Otherwise, below average rooms, the bathrooms need some updating and it smells a bit musty. Additionally, we actually went to another hotel down the road to inquire about vacancy, apparently, they have a nice network among hotels in St Augustine and they refer each other business in the event that one of them have no vacancy. So the nice lady in the front counter at the other hotel actually called around until she found a room at another hotel willing to honor the AAA rate - it so happened it was the Monterrey. So we drive down the road to the Monterrey to check in and we encounter a snooty Eastern European dude that promptly claimed that we must have misunderstood because that was not what he committed to over the phone. Unfortunately, he forgot that we are in America and here, we are entitled to become ugly Americans when some idiot wants to start playing games and jacking up prices on a whim. So after a brief argument and some reminders about customer service, our willingness to contact company headquarters and AAA to log complaints he finally understood our plain English and honored the rate he had quoted over the phone when the fine lady made the reservation for us. Bad service and dismal conditions knock this place down to one star review, but location bumps it up significantly. Having he luxury of not worrying about drinking and driving in the Historical district is simply priceless.We've ALWAYS stayed here while in St. Augustine, and while the accommodations weren't the absolute best, the location was! Can walk everywhere from here and close to the places We love. I've definitely givin' this a upgrade , the new owners have completely redone this Inn, &amp; would highly recommend it if you haven't been here in a while. We were pleasantly surprised with the upgrade.Having been helped by a not so nice person at the front desk, we figured it would be better when we got to our room. The price for the room wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. The room was beyond outdated, shabby and the bathroom was worse. You pay for hard to get parking... FAIL. The only pro to this place is it has a great balcony overlooking the bay and its right next door to our favorite Mexican joint in St. A - Acapulco. So we can drink our pitcher of Margaritas and walk right over. Since those are really the only redeeming values of the place if you don't care about the bay, go elsewhere.I don't know about the rest of these reviewers but we had a perfectly fine experience here. The location CANNOT be beat. Short walk to absolutely everything. It was great to be able to bring our dog as well. I was worried that it would be a dive but it isn't! Maybe we just got a good room but other than it being fairly tiny and awkwardly furnished it was clean and everything works. That is really all I'm asking for when I get an $85 a night room a block from St. George street with a view of the bay and Castillo de San Marco! I will definitely stay here again. There are extra fees for parking and having a pet but it still rolls out to be the best deal in town!Total beach motel POS.  For just a bit more money you could stay in a nice place.  Water leaking from the ceiling..... just all around dirty.  PassLocation and a view. Thats all I needed.I must say that the location did appeal to me as this hotel is in the historic district and has a trolley stop in front of it.  It's a short walk to almost everything downtown.  I booked 6 nights.  When I arrived, the front desk female was outside screaming at another worker under the carport.  She completed her tirade and went inside.  I waited a few minutes to ensure she composed herself thinking I was doing her a favor.  I assumed  that she would be embarrased knowing that I had witnessed her ill-behavior. He tone with me was short and almost abrasive.  Assuming she was still worked up. I cut her some slack and didn't put her in her place.  Paying the $7/night for parking was a surprise to me.  She said that it was in the print on-line so don't tell me you don't know.  My reply, again trying to be nice, was simply that I must've missed it.  Surely, she must be correct.  Having now returned home, I have checked there website and NO WHERE is is listed that there is a fee for parking.  I had called 4 days earlier to make arrangments for a first floor room, explaining to a male with a mid-eastern accent  that an elderly aunt was meeting me there, arriving separately and she had knee trouble.  The female checking me in stated that that couldn't be because I was on the second floor.  I actually had to pull the call record up on my cell phone before she believed me.  She then made a big deal about getting me a first floor room.  She completely flipped out with the news that there would be 2 cars and I had no intention of  paying for 2 parking spots.  She stated that they never tow anyone anyways so it would be fine.  I went to the room. It was 56 degrees and took 2.5 hours to warm up.   It was older and dark, but I didn't expect more given the price for the location.  Day two - came back to the room after touring and found my window curtains wide open with the lights on and no washclothes. You could see right into the room from the sidewalk for anyone walking by.   I went to the office and got some washclothes.  I also asked that they keep my drapes drawn during the day.  She took a note on a piece of paper and the next day I found the drapes closed and had washclothes.  Day 4 I had similar service but found dizzy ants running all over the sink ledge and wall of the bathroom.  I went to the office, met a middle-eastern man.  I told him what I found and asked if someone could spray while we left for dinner.  He said ""Do you want to move to another room?"".  I told him that I was only there 2 more nights and I didn't think it was necessary with the type of ant that it was.  I really felt it was a fluke and if they could simply spray I would get over it.  I didn't see bugs anywhere else that day.  He uttered no aplogy nor did he look or act surprised.   Day 5 I found the drapes open, short 1 washcloth and hair that didn't belong to either of us in the sink.  I didn't bother getting a washcloth.  The day I left the ants were all over the dresser and there was a large winged bug in my sheets.  By large I mean over 1/2"" in length.  Enough is enough.  This was a major FAIL.  Thankfully this was not a vacation where I planned on spending any time in a room.This place has an amazing location. It's right near the Castillo de San Marcos and (more importantly) short walking distance to the historic Old Town and all it's shops and restaurants. The location is worth it (and $40-$50 cheaper than the Hilton which appeared to be the only other pet friendly place on the bay) but there is a definite ick factor. This place could be one heck of a boutique hotel if they updated it. The best I can say is that I didn't way up with my nose completely blocked from dust allergies. Oh and they did recently paint the outside. Time for them to do the inside!A dump. I'm giving it one star because you don't offer no stars. If you want to be assigned the crap-de-la-crap room, book through Expedia. Oh, don't bring your SUV tank here -- the parking is tight to say the least and not free. Only positives are great location and Mary's Kitchen on-site.",,,,,"['third', 'star', 'location', 'wonderful', 'overlooks', 'bay', 'otherwise', 'average', 'rooms', 'bathrooms', 'need', 'updating',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/days-inn-st-augustine-historic-downtown-st-augustine-2,Days Inn St Augustine/Historic Downtown,2.0,$$,21,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this Days Inn. It was a fantastic price when everything else was outrageous. It's only like a 15 minute walk from everything you want to do! The walls are very thin though, between the rooms and to the outside... Our neighbors were INCREDIBLY inconsiderate. Other than that the front desk staff was nice and they have a pool! There is also a Denny's INSIDE the hotel! Life saver! Honestly I've never stayed at a Day's Inn but I would stay here again!Me and my husband do a Valentine's Weekend trip to St. Augustine every year. This year a lot of the hotels out there prices up WAY higher than usual so we booked this Days Inn because the price was decent and close to everything (literally walking distance). When we arrived to check in the woman at the counter was very friendly. We requested a top floor room, because I have an irrational fear of being on first floors and people driving into the room lol! Our room was in a separate back side building and on second floor like we asked. When I walked in I was amazed at how large the room was! And the bathroom as well! The bed was a comfy King. Nice flat screen tv. Shower water stayed hot the whole time. Big full length mirrors. The lights were a little dim, but not a big deal. Very quiet area. I was highly impressed with this hotel. Especially for the price. Literally connected in the parking lot is a ""double tree"" hotel that costs double the price, in the exact same area.. And I doubt the rooms are much better! I definitely recommend this hotel and will for sure be using it next year! The fountain of youth is literally a block away!! And George street and everything over near the fort is literally a nice scenic 15 min walk! Not to mention theres a Denny's attached to this Days Inn, a couple blocks down is a McDonald's, Pizza Hut and Zaxbys. When I checked out there was a different woman working the counter and she was extremely nice as well! So overall great customer service! I was hesitant because of some of the bad reviews, but honestly most people who leave bad reviews are whiny spoiled people who don't appreciate anything. I'm glad I went with my gut and chose this place! Will be back!! :)This is a hotel you can stay at if you just want a place to sleep &amp; you're out and about most of the entire day. The rooms are dingy with a musty smell almost like a wet dog had lived in &amp; slept there for an entire month or so! Thanks to Febreze it made the room smell fresh but we still have to spray every so often! One thing's for sure- i ain't coming back!Rooms were nice, not too bad. Bathroom was small. Shower only, no tub. The room smelled at little weird, like a wet mildewey smell. Showers could be a little cleaner, but not too bad. Breakfast till 930.Had a great time. Nice place, room could be cleaner. But I blame my boyfriend for getting drunk and peeing in my shoes.I let my boyfriend pick this hotel and that was my first mistake. This was the single worst hotel I've stayed at. It was disgusting and needed a much better cleaning (there were long hairs on the shower wall, etc)However, the kicker was the fact that our room was next to the maintenance room for the hotel. It was easily 30 degrees warmer in the hallway outside our room. It took four hours of continuous air conditioner use for it to palatable. We turned it off for an hour in the morning while we were getting ready, and the room was already miserable. Seriously, if you book this hotel as a last resort, and get the room 215, sleep in your car. It would be a better experience.old --  motel, but within walking distance to downtown... no free breakfast.So good so far. Friendly staff. Melinda greeted us.However, it pretty much went downhill from there. The location is pretty cool and located next to a coffee shop and really not too far from downtown. We parked at a parking deck downtown and it was just as far to walk to downtown from the deck as it would have been to just walk from the motel to the deck. We could have saved ourselves some money I guess. The king-size bed is ""like our old bed"" as my wife put it and that means she did not like it. She also does not like that the sheets do not fit very well. I have to agree. They keep coming off the bed and it's hard to get them go back on. I think they are perhaps a size too small. The front desk has a sign that states there is a safe in the room and a dollar is added to the room fee for this ""convenience"" because they have had break ins before. There is no gym on the premises in case you didn't look very hard. There is no breakfast because there is seriously a Denny's restaurant in the motel right by the pool. It is so right by the pool that the diners get a view of the pool. I was not happy about that. I don't want people eating and watching me swim and I don't want to eat and watch people swim. I don't understand why this was a good idea. It just makes me think some old pervert was thinking about watching some girls or something while he enjoyed his bacon and pancakes. Really creepy...On top of this there was a large group of young people (think about 9-12 years old) all here on charter buses. They were swarming the parking lot when we returned and all in the way. They were all by the pool at 9:30 at night. You could hear them going up and down the outside hallway at night. Just not a great experience thus far. The staff are all friendly still, but there are a lot of irritating things about this motel. There is a pretty nice coffee shop next door, but the place is also pretty expensive. The internet is pretty awful. The first night we were here it was very, very laggy and it is not secured at all. The motel is located within walking distance of downtown, but you can expect a pretty decent hike.Having spent years in the hotel business I know what it takes to run a hotel and how hard it is and it is very unlike me to write bad things about hotels because I know first hand that ""things happen"" and I am extremely forgiving.  This hotel was just about the most disgusting hotel I have ever been to in more ways than one.I'm not going to write a book so here are my issues:-Clerk wrote down my whole credit card number on registration paperwork (major no-no and total breach of security procedures)-Seedy clientele-Room was filthy trash from previous guest, floor not vacuumed, sticky stuff, just gross-BLOOD ON THE MATTRESS!!!!-Called to complain to the manager, no response, called corporate, no responseDon't let them ruin your vacation...The night before coming to St Augustine (for the first time) I began to search for places to stay (near or in historic district) and I began to think either there is a special event going on or this is a very popular town... because I can't find a room.  I was able to find rooms by a couple of Interstate 95 exits (15 - 20 miles away)... no thanks.Turns out there was a special event going one which is why it was so hard to find a hotel room in the historic district;  Flagler College was having their graduation ceremonies that same weekend.I ended up finding a room on the AMEX travel website for the Days Inn Historic Downtown.  Searching info on the hotel didn't scare me off but then again it certainly didn't excite me either.  Then again this was less than a mile from the action so I rolled the dice.  And oh boy, did I ""crap"" out.Entered the lobby for check-in... other than it looking a bit dated, it was clean and the two girls at the front desk were helpful, friendly and offered to be available if  had any questions or concerns or needed any recommendations.The room wasn't terrible but then again I was just hoping the room is mold and bed bug free.  Of course the traditional musty smell (like many of these old hotels) was present.  Basically it was a typical room like any other older Days Inn.If I stopped here I'd rate them a 3 star (keeping in mind 3 stars is not bad;  after all it is ""A-OK"")... unfortunately there is a but in there that dropped me to a 2 star and I think my 2 star is being generous.My issue had to do with an outside stairway near out 2nd floor room.  This hotel is an old style hotel with no interior hallways (all room doors are exposed to the outside).  After I turned in the keys and checked out, I returned to the room, grabbed my bags and shut the door behind me.  When we turned a corner to enter the stairwell there was a lot of water accumulated at the top of the stairs... And yes, I lost my footing and yes, I fell down the stairs.  Luckily my good reflexes and with my quick thinking I grabbed a rail before any real bodily damaged occurred (though one of my bags did get a little wet).  I was shaken up but other than uneasy nerves and embarrassment I wasn't injured so I left.  I did noticed they had one of those yellow warning signs but of course it was off to the side and not noticeable coming around the corner to the stairs.  In hindsight, I should've told the clerk on-duty so an hour later I decided to call and let them know... not for a discount, not for a refund, not to threaten a lawsuit... I called so they could prevent someone else from getting injured or worse yet killed (which is not far-fetched).  I got the manager and he attitude was SHOCKING... took no responsibility and would not acknowledge anything wrong.  He just said I should've come in if I had a problem.  I agreed but take care of the problem, put a better sign out, put more than one sign, put a warning at the bottom of the stairs too, find out why the water was there in the first place, just do something.  He was just defensive and nonchalant of the whole situation.  Terrible manager.This place could use a good power-washing. For the money (we paid $65) it wasn't a bad place to stay. It just wasn't very nice. Call me crazy, but I think a hotel can be inexpensive and still be nice. The outside door to our room seriously needed to be repainted. The shower (in the VERY small bathroom) at some point had been repaired and the caulk job was poorly done. There was gum stuck to the carpet near our bed. The cable, attached to the bulky, out-dated TV had many channels that were out of service or had a picture but no sound.On the upside, the pool area was nice, and having a Denny's on site was a bonus. (We ate there and the food was pretty good.) Overall I give our stay a resounding, ""just barely ok.""We've stayed in other Days Inns before. This was by far the worst. Sign out front said ""new look"". That meant a fresh coat of paint, poorly done. Paint splatters all over fixtures, light switch covers were dingy and didn't cover holes in wall. Shower needed complete replacing, but only had a patch job. Price for one night exceeded the appearance and quality. Don't expect a lot of you do stay here. You can put lipstick on a pig. But, it's still a pig. Front desk staff were meh. Didn't even ask how our stay was when checking out.Booked off Priceline. Expected something worth the over $100 I paid to stay, but found the room worse than a no star hotel. Not only is the room rundown and the bed lumpy and noisy, the bathroom and sink had hair all over, near the coffee maker, on the bathtub (which had caulk and yellow stains all over) and black hairs on the bath towels. Dusty in a lot of spots, dark and muggy like a jail cell, cold tile floors with chips in them, messy plywood instead of an actual cupboard on the front of the sink, and horrible lumpy pillows. I'd say they should be paying me to stay in this room for a night. I'm scared to even look under the bed...The beds in this place are so bad that we felt like we were trying to sleep on something left over from the Spanish Inquisition.  Hard, lump, broken down.  The shower got water on everything but the person trying to take a shower, I've had better showers in a truck stop than we had here.  For the price they ought to at least have some kind of free breakfast.  We stayed there during the 2014 Pirate Gathering and the only good thing about it was its proximity to a great place for morning coffee, City Coffee which is right across the street from them.  I will never stay there again.The bad reviews here are not very fair. It is clean and despite being close to the road it is quiet. Staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms must have been recently remodeled because they are more modern than the images suggest. I would stay here again, for sure.For twice the price of historic Howard Johnson you get smaller, less maintained rooms, no continental breakfast and a staff that while friendly is completely clueless. I have been going to St Augustine every 12 months for over a decade and this is the first time I have made the mistake of staying here. Never again.This place needs a deep cleaning. The room smelled moldy. The room was humid and the carpet disgusting. The bathroom was not very clean and did not smell good. I've stayed at other days inn and never had such a bad experience. I brought the issues up to management and was told I could not be moved to another room. I went to a neighboring La Quinta booked a room and had a much better experience. I was so upset by the way I was treated by the days in management that I went ahead me called corporate. They said they would take note of it but the days inn are independently owned and they could not do much for me. I them went ahead and called my credit card explained what was going on and they agreed to declined payment to the days inn. I do not suggest anyone stay there. There are other better hotels in the same area for the same price.This place is awful. Not because of the rooms but the things they let happen. At 2:00 the people above us has their cars music on the max with loud bass. These stupid guys started banging on our window then when we let our dog out someone came and pissed right next to him. Then in our laundry someone put their dirty boxers in with it! This is only one night getting in at 7:30!!!!Exactly what you'd expect from a Days Inn-- a decent, clean, affordable place to stay for the night.  A non-smoking room with two double beds cost us $99 a night.  My friend and I checked here after dinner and a stroll in historic St. Augustine.  We stopped at two separate Best Westerns closer to the historic area but they were both completely booked for the night.  It's within a 10 minute drive to the historic area, the manager at the front desk we polite, the room was clean, there was free Wi-fi and the beds were comfortable.Questionable... Ants, maybe a roach, dirty, dirty dirty!  Hard to tell if it was New Year's Eve fireworks or gun shots... I saw a dope needle on the sidewalk.  But it's cheap and close....about a 10-15 minute walk to historic downtown.  Will definitely pay more next time to stay elsewhere....never staying here again.","I'd choose somewhere else given the chance, mainly because it was overpriced for the room condition.  The floors and sheets were clean and the bed was comfortable, but there were some pretty gross things about it.  The room smelled musty.  The door stuck so badly we had to kick it in.  The coffee maker was disgusting, as were the light switches - embedded dirt.  Floor boards were falling apart.  Wifi was slow, and the vending machine on one side of the place had nothing in it.  I'm not picky, but for this price ($100) I expected a lot more.  Everything else was full but next time I will drive a ways out to go somewhere else.",,,,"['pleasantly', 'surprised', 'days', 'inn', 'fantastic', 'price', 'everything', 'else', 'outrageous', 'like',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/old-city-house-inn-and-restaurant-saint-augustine-2,Old City House Inn & Restaurant,4.5,$$,53,"Great lunch experience-would go back and try dinner! It is located right downtown in a quaint bed and breakfast. The food was amazing- they had fresh bread with wonderful oil and vinegar that make there with roasted garlic. We had the fried cauliflower, which I HIGHLY recommend. My husband doesn't even like cauliflower and he devoured this app!  My husband got the nom pizza special and I got the mozzarella chicken sandwich. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent.Restaurant review: This is truly a gem in St Augustine and very much off the beaten path. We literally stumbled upon it just walking by! It's without a question on the old fashioned side of things, but hey, what did you come to this town for! It's set in an old fashioned inn.- EASILY THE BEST CEVICHE IVE EVER HAD. I mean, they just know their ceviche. Nothing else to add really other than, it's spectacular! Loaded with seafood, avocado and served nicely in a glass.- BREAD AND ROASTED GARLIC - here I am really questioning myself, how did I not come up with this myself. Just cut off the stem from the garlic and roast it in olive oil in the oven. So simple, so good.- SEAFOOD DISHES ARE AMAZING. Cod is great. The Chilean sea bass is loaded with freshness and flavor. - CREME BRULEE IS ODD. I say odd, because it tasted absolutely nothing like a CREME brulee, but was very good. Reminded me of some Eastern European pastries.- WINE PRICING IS GREAT. I knew very well most of the wines on their menu and must admit, they did not up charge much at all! If you like Chardonnay, ZD Chardonnay is spectacular and one of my favorites.To sum it up, you better be putting this spot on your must go list of dinners in St Augustine. You do need a reservation by the way.My husband and I spent Valentine's night at Old City House Inn and had dinner at the restaurants.  First the Inn, it was the MOST comfortable bed I may have ever slept in!  Lovely room overlooking the Lightner Museum.  The street was busy when you wanted it to be and quiet when you didn't.  The host was so charming and pleasant and I LOVED everyone's accents.  It was an absolutely enjoyable experience!  Dinner was another story.  We had made the reservation for dinner in the restaurant at the same time we made our room reservation.  We were verbally confirmed for an 8pm dinner.  When we went in to have some wine and cheese, complimentary for being a guest, at 5pm that evening, my husband checked on our dinner reservation.  There was none we were told and then they said that they were full for the evening.  My husband said that we had made the reservation at the same time as the room so they then realized we were guests and found us a table at 8pm.  For some reason early in the dinner, our server seemed to develop a chip on his shoulder about our dining experience.  I don't know if it was when he asked my husband if we were ready to order and he said ""please give us a few minutes"" or what it was, but all of a sudden, BAM!  It seemed he was really short and uninterested in us as patrons.  We heard another waiter explaining in vivid detail what was good on the menu, the specials, his favorites, etc... but our waiter couldn't wait to take our order and be gone from our table.  Talk about poor table side manners!   In the past our meals have always been really good. My zarzuela, or fish stew, was delish.  My husband ordered cod and scallops.  Unfortunately, when my husband went to flake the fish, it ended up being a blob of mushy fish.  You know, once fish isn't just right, you shy away.  When the waiter came by the table to ask how our meal was, my husband explained that the fish was not really fresh as far as he could tell.  The server asked if he'd like something else, and my husband said if you could just give me two more scallops, that would be great.  Right away, the server informed us that there was going to be an upcharge since scallops were so much more than cod.  We get that, but two!?!?! The waiter actually brought four additional ones with no mention of a charge.  Well, we finished out meal, and the waiter never even asked if we'd like desert.  Like I said, for some reason he wanted nothing to do with us even BEFORE the cod and scallop incident.When the waiter brought the check, there it was, and additional eight dollar charge for the scallops!  When my husband questioned the waiter he said ""this is what the chef said to charge, don' t blame me for this!"" Rather interesting since he mentioned the ""up-charge"" even before he spoke to the chef.  Either we weren't the first to complain about fish, or did he plant the seed in the chef's mind.  Hard to say, but we were more than happy to get out of there that night!Breakfast the next morning was wonderful, so I have to believe that even though the fish was smelly, our server, who shall not be named, but has a handle bar mustache, was even stinkier.We had a very nice room here. Al guests get a complementary glass of wine or beer and a cheese platter. Really great and tasteful. The room we had (a kings room) was spacy with good beds. The staff was really friendly and helpful. I'll would love to come back again.We just spent one night at this fabulous hidden gem . Wonderful breakfast and very friendly staff ...will definitely be back !Stopped in here on a tasting tour.  First off I loved the way the inn feels.  It is a taste of old St Augustine.  We were given a delicious appetizer of rice and peas with shrimp on top. They were really yummy.  We also had a sample of one of their house wines, which was delicious.  After hearing about the Inn itself we are considering coming and staying here for Christmas for a couple of nights.  We will definitely come back and try more foods from their menu as well.We stayed at the inn and the rooms and service was amazing.  I wish I could live here.I. am. in. love. with this charming place.My husband and I had originally planned to spend the weekend for our 2 year anniversary in August. But that was cut short as I came down with a horrible migraine and head-cold the first night. The first impression of the Inn we had the first time around was 3 out of 5 stars, all because our room was doused, I mean literally infused, with some kind of pungent air freshener. My husband and I are very sensitive to fragrances, scented candles, air fresheners... mainly artificial scents. I think trying to sleep in the room the first night had triggered my migraine and made head cold even worse.We were sad to leave the next morning because it was evident that I wasn't gonna get any better to enjoy the anniversary weekend. The innkeeper was very nice enough to offer us a voucher to return another time to make up for the second night we already had paid for.Just this past weekend, my husband decided to spring the surprise of taking me back to St. Augustine and we used the voucher for a Friday night. We did give the inn keeper the request, this time, to make sure our room wasn't sprayed with any kind of air freshener.  I was nervous about that and even packed enough migraine medicine.... however upon our entrance to the room, it was perfect! He listened! We were thrilled with it and we were able to enjoy our stay thoroughly without any headaches!The entire building is so adorable, the lounge &amp; bar is romantically lit at night, the dining room is cozy, and the outdoor sitting area by the small gardens is somewhat exotic.When you go to the lounge room, they bring you a complimentary tray of fine cheeses and crackers. I was so excited to have tried some fine cheese as I had never tried brie! Yum! They have wine, beer, and some hard liquor. With the candle-lighting, my husband and I felt like we had just started dating. The servers are extremely nice and well mannered.For the complimentary breakfast (between 9-10am only), they bring out 2-3 courses with a plate at a time. We absolutely loved it. The first breakfast we had was a lot of fruit, eggs, and waffles. And the second breakfast was similar but minus the waffles and more meat and an omelet. We think they offer different kinds of breakfast every morning and working with what is fresh in season.The Old City House Inn has a lot of the things that many other inns in the area don't have like: sufficient parking (some inns have NONE!), true history (some inns are cliche or overdone or even shady!), excellent food and innkeeping service, prime location (right next to the luxurious Casa Monica Hotel, Flagler College, Lightner Museum), and just a few blocks away from the touristy hustle bustle of St. George Street.We absolutely love this inn and will definitely come back to this inn whenever we are in St. Augustine. It's a home away from home!Excellent food and very attentive and friendly service. The chef went to each table and made sure the customers were satisfied. We had the zarzuela and the Herb Crusted Chilean Sea Bass with dill lemon gras sauce over lightly fried yuca and sauteed vegetables. The dessert, Italian style cheesecake recommended by our waitress, Peggy, was fantastic. It was light and fluffy with a salty Carmel crust.One of the best meals and overall restaurant experience we've had period.Great food and service. The presentation of the food is outstanding too. We were so pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. The dining room is quaint and cozy and on our list to visit when it's colder outside.This place is so unique. Rooms are very nice, we had a room with a huge bedroom, spa bath tub.Three words come to mind when reflecting on my Old City House Inn &amp; Restaurant dining experience: Flavorful, Inventive and Accommodating. Let me explain... We went here the evening before Thanksgiving, because let's be honest, who wants to cook a big meal the night before a full day's worth of cooking?!?! Well, we didn't, so my brother looked for a spot on Open Table and decided that based on the reviews and that we could get a reservation at our desired timing, that this was the spot. We parked just a few blocks away in a free after 6 p.m. lot and strolled into a cozy restaurant and I could already tell we would be pleased. They had our table ready and waiting for us, and while the restaurant is small, they maximize the space with all the table formations they have. Our waitress was friendly and kept the meal well paced. The food was flavorful - while you felt like you were stepping into a comfortable place with comfortable choices, the chef certainly knows the combinations to keep your palette interested. Our bottle of wine arrived with some hot out of the oven bread with roasted garlic, herb infused olive oil and balsamic vinegar as toppings. We were hooked at the first bite and devoured the entire plate of bread! All entrees come with a house salad, but I was able to upgrade to the soup of the day (tomato basil bisque) as I had a sore throat and was in the mood for a soup versus salad. The soup was an ample serving and stayed hot from the first to the last spoonful. I love me some goat cheese and decided I wanted to swap sides, which again they had no problem with, as I prefer roasted potatoes to squash. The presentation of all of our meals was first class - another sign of the chef's comfort with food and its artistic display on the plates (not only ours, but those of the other diners we saw coming by). I ate my whole meal, but certainly didn't save room for dessert, although I'm sure it would be equally impressive. On the way out, we saw the previously Yelped about outdoor patio space and on a warmer evening, I think this little oasis would be the perfect spot for pre or post dinner drinks, even if you still wanted the actual dining room experience for dinner itself. Word to the wise - make reservations as since they are small, it would likely be tough to just walk in on a more popular night to dine out. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal, so much so that we were still talking about it the next day!While a couple of the dishes were good and the desserts were good, my swordfish was so dry it was inedible. But what really upset me was that it was my parents' 50th anniversary and I called ahead to tell them, asking if they could do anything nice. I talked to someone who assured me they would make it special. Our waitress, however, didn't even know it was their anniversary and when I told her it was, she still charged us for the desserts. I would not recommend this place to anyone.Sooooo good and great service. If you're stuck on ordering the sea bass is delicious!Took my wife for her birthday. Kind if hidden and off the main drag . Blown away by the vegetable beef soup made with filet mignon. Surprised by the Tamarindo sorbet to cleanse the palate in between soup , salad and entree. The beef tenderloin was simply out if this world for this area. I thought I was back in the City or in the Midwest. Flavor , texture , presentation was a chart topper. Service was very good .. Don't miss it if your in St Augustine . I'm going back...For my birthday last weekend, a dear friend of mine took me to St. Augustine for the day. Upon our arrival, the first place that we went was to Old City House Inn and Restaurant. If it hadn't been so hot, I definitely would have preferred to sit on the beautiful patio, but that shall have to wait until the Fall or early Spring. From what I've seen of the dinner menu, it's rather expensive, but if you go here for lunch, you are provided with a ""Bites"" menu which is basically smaller portions at a lower price (around $6) per plate. The one thing that irked me about the menu was the amount of items that are unfriendly to those of us with lactose issues/allergies. I don't need special treatment, but I expect menus to be somewhat well rounded so everyone can have an enjoyable meal. In any case, I digress, this did not take away from my experience on this day, but did limit my choices. I had my heart set on a salad. I debated the Tri Colore Salad, which is radicchio, arugula (my absolute favorite green), endive, and white balsamic vinaigrette. I just couldn't bring myself to order this plate at $9 when I could get all of those ingredients so much cheaper at the store. What I ended up ordering was the Melon, Artichoke, and Chorizo Salad from the Bites menu as my appetizer. It was the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and spicy. All three flavors worked together splendidly. Along the lines of appetizers, we had also been served some rather fantastic garlic, along with olive oil and a balsamic reduction to go with our bread. The garlic was roasted while still within the clove itself and was some of the best that I've ever tasted. As we planned to walk around St. Augustine for awhile after lunch, I chose a main course that would be light on the stomach. Grilled Shrimp with polenta, which is actually listed as an appetizer, was my choice. While the polenta was a bit heavy, the shrimp was grilled to perfection. After finding out that it was my birthday, the waiter thanked me for telling him and went off to the kitchen. Just after we were given our check, he came out with a special birthday dessert: passion fruit creme brule. A spectacular end to a great birthday lunch.Nice place that used to be horrible. It's in a great location, but even so, I stopped going there after a couple of dismal overpriced meals and a business lunch where nobody got what they ordered, the food was inedible and it took us almost a half hour to get the check and correct the errors on it!  So the new owners have a lot to overcome.I think they'll do it! The food is excellent. We had a sort of tapas lunch, with wine, of course, and everything was excellent. The fried cauliflower is a treat and the cod fritters weren't fritters but large excellent pieces of cod. The star was the Spanish tortilla, which wasn't the simple egg and potato dish, but s fluffy quiche-like dish with a variety of perfect vegetables.  Dessert was their version of cheesecake, recommended by the hostess, and it was truly fine.The service was great and the price  was reasonable for the quality.  My only reservation was the interior of the restaurant, which hadn't been changed probably since the early 90s, when the old owners bought it. Very stodgy and dull. And I saw people on the street peer inside and then go away. Other than that, it's fine, highly recommended (by me!) and ... I hope they get a remodel soon.My only complaint was I couldn't stay longer! Such a fine establishment. The innkeepers have quite a gem here. The rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable. We regret missing dinner at the restaurant, but will definitely dine there next time. We had coffee and dessert, and drinks. The staff was wonderful, and each person went out of their way to accommodate us. We will back and recommend this as the ace to stay in St Augustine!I wish I could give this place a 5-star review, but it's just not going to happen yet.So this place is definitely a gem - albeit a well-known gem. Its frequented a lot, mostly by locals, sometimes by tourists. We stopped by here as a quick stop for some drinks at the bar before walking anymore in the heat (interesting fact, the week of June 27th saw an above-average solar flare). I love the way these older buildings were constructed - they are all about ventilation without the need for artificial AC. The smells coming from the kitchen about knocked us down from how mouth-watering they were!We were seated quickly even though the lunch rush was picking up. Luckily there was a table for four open, which interestingly enough is really difficult to find seeing how the restaurant is better suited for couples.One: Food was amazing. It was so fresh you could basically hear our food breathing, and the taste of everything together just made a hit with my family. I will never looked at bacon the same way again!Two: The atmosphere leaves something to be desired. There was just a certain something about the place that felt off - it may have been the wall color, it may have been the standoffish way the locals eyed everyone around them. Either way, it was dealt with and didn't take away from our overall experience.Three: The service was speedy but very quickly dropped to a crawl. And herein lies the reason for 4 stars. While we were seated and got drinks quickly, it quite literally took forever for a server to come back and either refill our drinks or take our orders. I understand a lunch rush in a touristy city in a well-known restaurant can be daunting, and I know servers always get a bad rap. Here I do have to say the restaurant for the most part really works hard for and deserves that fifth star. Once the speed during the lunch rush is resolved, I'll be giving it that extra star.Overall, price was what I expected. Free dessert wine was a nice surprise (I know my step-father said something about the speed of the service to the manager). I WILL come back to this restaurant when we're back in the city, but I'll probably be eating here before/after the lunch rush.The food was delicious - I only wish we had more of an appetite for lunch! I just had the tomato basil bisque and it was some of the best I've tasted! They also bring out bread and olive oil/vinegar with a roasted clove of garlic. It made my day - I love roasted garlic and most places do not serve an entire clove with the bread! I would love to go back for a full meal because there were quite a few great looking dishes. The ambiance was lovely as well and it was a nice quite spot for lunch before heading to the Lightner Museum and Flagler College tours!","This beautifully restored Inn located in the middle of the old city is welcoming and genuine. The staff have a culture reflective of the owner Juan who is passionate about services in all respects. We had a wonderful experience and highly recommend it for the experience, people, food, presentation and professionalism. We look forward to our next visit.Stayed two nights, great location. Included is a happy hour and breakfast. Worth your money staying here.  Juan is the innkeeper and made our stay here WAY WORTH WHILE!!!  TIP.... FREE PARKING AND BICYCLES! Have fun here!Excellent service and gourmet cuisine in one of Florida's most beautiful cities! Highly recommend their specials of the day! A rare find.Excellent food and service! best naturally made sangria Ive ever had in Florida. the food is very fresh and tasty.Excellent.  Looks like a stuffy little place but it is very elegant and refined.  Food was incredible.  Service was fantastic.  Small intimate setting.  Attached to a small Inn.  Small seating area so make reservations.  Also.  Parking is a nightmare so be prepared to hunt for parking.  We got lucky on a metered space right in front of the location.We stumbled upon this gem for dinner by accident. First of all, the waiter Max was attentive and delightful. Secondly, kudos to the chef. Each course was better than the last and the presentation was just beautiful. The ambiance was also very nice. I had the escargot appetizer. It was AMAZING. My husband had the crab bisque. It was out of this world. The fresh bread is served with flavored olive oil, roasted garlic and balsamic reduction. Heaven. We each had a house salad that was tasty and the perfect portion size so as not to be too filling. I had the papaya vinaigrette on mine and my husband had the sun dried tomato dressing. Again, fabulous. Max then brought us each a serving of peach sorbet served on an orange slice with mint to cleanse our palates. I've not had a palate cleansing sorbet served to me in easily the past 20 years. We each had one of the night's specials. I had the swordfish and he had the seafood past. The portions were very generous, delicious and beautifully presented. We were stuffed but how could we not have desert here?!  I had a baked wine infused pear and my husband had layered chocolate mouse cake. Both phenomenal. Our bill was right around $100. I would recommend reservations and there is parking nearby. This place is not to be missed.What can you say about perfection.  The food is outstanding as well as good service.  I had the escargot and they were perfectly cooked.  The Halibut, which was a special was out of this world.  Great little find.This is my first 5 star review because everything was excellent-service, food and ambiance. To start the roasted garlic, olive oil and balsamic with the bread is perfect, we had our 9 year old daughter with us who devoured this (always a good sign). All of the entrees come with starter salad so between the bread and salad there was no need for us to try any appetizers. They had 5 options for dressing, our favorite was the papaya dressing, it was sweet but complimented the salad well. Then came the blackberry sorbet palate cleanser to prepare for the delicious main course that was about to bless our taste buds. My husband and I had the sea bass layered on top of fried yuca and asparagus in a herb, lemon butter sauce. The flavors and cooking preparation of this dish was superb. My daughter had the filet served with potatoes au gratin and green beans - all cooked perfectly. There was no room for desert since we all cleared our plates. I highly recommend this restaurant and we will be back anytime we find ourselves in St. Augustine again.UPDATE (5/31/15): Went back to Old City House this year. Oh. My. God.It was our anniversary. Christopher upgraded our room to the St. George room, the most gorgeous room I have ever stayed in on a vacation. They left us champagne, an anniversary card and some fruit. We went to dinner at the restaurant and enjoyed a delicious meal. They surprised us with amazing cheesecake for our anniversary.If I could leave 6 stars, I would! ---This was our first time in St. Augustine. We loved staying here. The staff was very friendly and gave us great recommendations on things to do (and to avoid). Juan and Christopher, the innkeepers, were very attentive and nice. The location is perfect. It's right next to the Lightner Museum and a short walk from the fun stuff. If you sit outside for breakfast, you have a nice view of Flagler College. We loved the complimentary parking and free beach cruiser bikes to ride around town. The food is phenomenal. We decided to eat lunch after checking in. My husband had, what he called, the greatest chicken sandwich of his life. I had seared tuna - which was excellent. Breakfast the next day was fantastic. Also: The presentation of the food is beautiful. They really do have a talented chef.We also enjoyed the wine &amp; cheese hour. Free wine/beer/cheese/fruit is always fun.Our room (the Cordova) was very clean and smelled so good. I liked how the balcony was right outside our door. The bed was comfy. My only gripe about the room would be the pillows. Maybe it's my personal preference, but I don't like really fluffy &amp; firm pillows.Overall: 5 stars! We will be back for sure...next time longer than 2 days/1 night!Great place. I've stayed at a lot of places, this has been one of the nicest. Older building so loud pipes and outside noises and poor water pressure. All made up for with personable friendly owners, clean, location good and great food.Good service, nice presentation, but the flavors fell flat.  The seared tuna was competently done, but the service on a plate with pedestal made it tricky to share on a table already pretty crowded with a cocktail and wine and the complimentary bread (which is ok, but nothing special).  My roasted garlic salad dressing (house made) had a greasy texture that was off putting but the greens were fresh and attractive.  They served a raspberry sorbet as a little amusement between salad and main, which was a nice idea but was executed in what was becoming a pattern of ""not quite right.""  Our entrees took a long time to come out and showed it by having cooled beyond my taste though my companion was satisfied (I'll admit I like my food served hotter than most people care for).  He had a pork shank special that looked phenomenal, but the mushroom Marsala sauce was incredibly bland.  I had the beef tenderloin which was slightly more done than I expected but tender.  The potatoes gratin were runny on the bottom, dry in the middle, and a glob of gooey melted cheese on top.  I make better at home from leftovers.  We skipped dessert and walked down the street to the Chocolate Turlte where we were wowed with wonderfulness.I only have experienced the restaurant but I am a repeat guest.  Good, fresh food and owner Juan is a true jewel.  He makes a point to engage his guests and cares about the quality-everytime I go there, he is there and very hands on.My favorite dish is the white fish served with hearts of palm. Never had a dish that I didn't enjoy and I think this is a charming inn at its BEST!Truly a great restaurant experience with creative attention to every detail. Great wine choices at a decent price. Amazing cheesecake-a wonderful surprise that we happened upon by accident! Loved St. AugustineMy wife and I have been dining here for 20+ years. We know there have been changes in ownership over the years but the quality remains. We celebrated our anniversary there Wednesday evening with the trout and sea bass both being excellent. The portions and service were excellent too. Our secret place in the oldest city.WOW! One cannot fully express the joy of this B&amp;B. Clean, awesome innkeeper, central location to all the shops and restaurants. This is a top notch B&amp;B. The restaurant looks quaint and the food looked delicious. We opted for a local raw restaurant for our supper, but we had a delicious cup of fresh, homemade hot chocolate with some rock candy as a spoon. My wife FULLY enjoyed the eggs Benedict for breakfast, and they made gluten-free pancakes for me with maple syrup. A fruit cocktail was served in a cocktail glass, and endless coffee, tea and orange juice quenced our thirst.Book your next stay here, we literally had the whole inn to ourselves, only one other couple down the hall. You won't regret it!Recently, I had the unique opportunity to stay at the Old City House Inn &amp; Restaurant located on 115 Cordova St in Saint Augustine, FL.The Old City House was originally constructed in 1873. The exterior is an example of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture.  Legend also has it that a ghost of a Spanish Soldier still guards the archway, unaware that he was killed by the misfire of his own musket.Before I arrived, I was kind of stressed.  Later that evening, I had to give a presentation for work. Plus, I had fifty important unread e-mails in my inbox. However, when I checked-in, all my stress soon vanished. Parking was readily available, the innkeeper had my room key and paperwork ready, I was offered a very lovely ""free"" glass of Pinot Noir and my suitcases were quickly brought to my room. My room was charming and cozy. The floors were made of wood, the bathroom was clean and modern, fresh orchids were on the dresser, the Wi-Fi signal was strong and the atmosphere was incredibly quiet. I detest noise pollution and I didn't hear a single sound except for that of the fan overhead. The room reminded me of guesthouses in Europe. I smelled and sensed ""history"" in the walls. Indeed, the history of Saint Augustine was with me. Later, I took a little stroll. The entire building was adorable and tranquil. The outdoor sitting area had a small garden filled with orchids. That evening, after my presentation and after hitting the local bars, I headed back to the Inn. I saw the innkeeper outside drinking a red wine and he invited my to join him. Together, we sat for thirty minutes at a black iron table overlooking the Lightner Museum talking about life, wine and the history of the city. It was pleasant. Even though a Spanish Soldier haunts the Old City House, I still slept very peacefully and unfortunately didn't see him. In the morning for breakfast, the very handsome cook and server (from France I think) brought out 2 courses with a plate at a time. The first breakfast was a lot of fruit, eggs, and waffles. The second breakfast was a savory enchilada. In sum, the Old City House Inn has sufficient parking, excellent food and service.  It is also pet friendly and it is right next to all the attractions. If I could suggest anything, it would be to have a newspaper outside the door of the guest-rooms in the morning.  I would have loved to eat breakfast and drink my coffee while reading the Wall Street Journal or New York Times. It would also be nice to have a small pool near the garden.I will definitely come back to this inn whenever I am in St. Augustine. Too many cities are littered with your average chain hotel without any charm or individuality. The charm and beauty of the Old City House Inn &amp; Restaurant adds a lot of value to the city.This review is based upon my experiences at the bed and breakfast.  Although I have not had the opportunity to have dinner at the restaurant, the menu looks really good.After having bad experiences at several bed and breakfasts around the downtown St. Augustine area, we finally came across Old City Inn who fortunately had some last minute availability.  The location is perfect, tucked just behind the fancy Casa Monica hotel.  Walking out the door, you are a one minute walk from Flagler College, Bridge of Lions and some of the nicer bars and restaurants (JP Henleys!!). During the day the sightseeing trains frequently pass by, but I don't think they run at night because I have never had any noise issues.  Also being off the main roads there isn't too much noise to keep you up at night.The rooms are quite spacious and include a comfortable bed, tv, bathroom/shower.  We have stayed in three of the rooms, but generally prefer the Alcazar as it has a private entrance up the side of the building.  The rates are reasonable as well and they frequently run specials on their website such as stay 1 day get another free, 20% off, ect.  I think they also have last minute rates if you call up the night of. We have had some terrible breakfast at other establishments in the downtown area, but the breakfast at Old City inn had always been quite good.  And as the name would suggest, it is included in the price of your stay.  You can choose to sit inside or outside in the front or courtyard.  I believe the options consist of French toast, Belgium waffle, English breakfast, eggs Benedict, and southern Benedict, which has become my go to breakfast choice!  I have had most everything at some point in time, and while I'm not a huge breakfast person, everything has been really good. The food can sometimes take a longer than expected time to get out to you if there are several people dining.   Service has always been fair, and they check on you multiple times which is nice especially when sitting outside. If you are spending some time in St. Augustine, consider staying with Old City Inn.  With a great location, tasty breakfast, nice clean accommodations, and reasonable prices, you really cannot beat it'This is perhaps the most under rated restaurant the food belongs at a 5 star restaurant in Manhattan, Paris , Madrid or any place you can think of. Fabulous chef prepared food that can't be praised enough. Don't miss this place !!!!!We went during the afternoon when they had their small plates menu available. At 6 bucks a pop it was incredibly affordable for the quality. Everything tasted great ...the staff was very nice...and I wouldn't hesitate to come back any time!Really really wish we could have stayed longer than one night.    This was such a quaint and enjoyable inn.   The room was nice and the bed was comfortable.    The courtyards at the inn were very nice and lush.   We went to the restaurant area during the 5-6 wine and cheese plate time and the cheese plate was very good.   Good pours on the red wine.   Later went back for appetizers and my husband had a shrimp one that was very good.  I ordered another cheese plate like I had earlier and they did explain that they would have to charge which I totally expected, however it def wasn't worth the $17 charge for it.   The free one had better cheeses on it.   My mistake on not asking before ordering.   Other than that everything about this place was amazing.   Staff and ambiance was great!!!   Location was perfect.","When I stayed at this B&amp;B in 2008, everything was 5-star.  Charming themed rooms, great rooftop patio, great location, historical story within, great price (too many steps, all rooms are upstairs so be a healthy stair-climber).  My breakfasts were memorable and 5-star at the restaurant.  I remember a fab fritatta.  Also had a great bananas foster.  Had great duck for a fine dinner.  Intimate, romantic restaurant.When I went back last week, simply for lunch, we found the menu limited and without ""pizazz"".  The desserts changed.  The blonde female appeared distracted. (Twice when we came through to check things out, no one was there, no bell, no one came.)  When you review the 5-star reviews they are years old.  This place currently seems understaffed and less interested in drawing a crowd.  (The town was bursting with crowds this week, this place was empty.)Please note this review is based on observation--we chose NOT to eat there based on the menu and lack of human connection.  Maybe next time.The location is fantastic.We really enjoyed our stay at the old city house inn. The staff was very nice and attentive. We stayed in the Ammidown room, very cozy and comfy bed.  The location is excellent, very close to everything in the historic district, only 1/2 a block off the beaten path so its a bit quieter.  They give options for breakfast which is a bonus and it tastes good too.I was here almost 10 years ago, but I always remember how awesome this place was.  Nice romantic atmosphere but not stuffy.  The food was SO delicious.  I can't wait to go back!No objection to the food, but it is truly WAY overpriced - for the brunch, at least.  Service and food were ok, simly worth nothing near what we paid for our meal.I love this place. We went here for the first time with another couple and ordered the sliders and lobster appetizers, followed by the filet, scallops, lamb and a grouper special.....wow! everything was prepared and presented perfectly. The scallops were so fresh and cooked just right, best I've ever had.We ended up eating there two more times in a week. It was great every time.The atmosphere and food are just right. It is never really crowded and the staff are very attentive.Great service. Quaint and quiet location. Nice drinks and the food was well prepared. I would recommend and will likely return with friends later in the season.We came here for breakfast and are so glad that we did. Nice service and really great food. We had the stuffed French toast and Southern Benedict and both were delicious. The setting is nice a little bit upscale but cozy.I share the same comment from a previous review-USE to be one of our favorites in st. Aug.We live in St. Augustine and feel that the improper way our situation by the general manager, Marty, was handled in a manor that is unheard of in the industry.Note-we have eaten at old city house well over 20 times and had good experiences but not on Saturday evening.  Ordered tuna appreciate as my meal and it was well done.  Moved it around on my plate to determine if any of it was medium rare.Sent it back and was asked if I would like another portion.  I stated no because you never know were the next piece had been.  Received my bill and was not removed.  Marty-the general manager, stated that i ate half the tuna and he offered to replace not remove from the bill.After carrying on with Marty on about his lack of wanting to make it right,  we left and will NEVER GO BACK!!!!!!  I have already expressed my displeasure with 30 friends and plan on making sure that no one has to deal with this type of attitude which is a shame because it was a nice place to eat.Very Wonderful!Service was nice (LOL, there were only 2 tables filled and 2 waiters, so we pretty much got good service!...altho had to wait to catch someones eye a couple of times to request something.The restaurant has a little bit of a Slavic or Eastern European/Polish hint to it (the balsamic vinagrette had poppyseeds) and I cannot recall the other 'hints' the Hubby mentioned. He is of this decent, and not only could we distinguish an accent in the food, but the waiters as well.Food was outstanding. We were staying Next door at Casa Monica, and had great food there also, but we so happy to have discovered this place via yelp before our visit, and had made a reservation ahead of time.I had a chicken breast which was kinf of like a cordon bleu, altho it was stuffed with only mozz and basil, and it had the most WONDERFUL bechamel sauce on it, and the ''fried' outer layer was so thin and delicate, the little tiny crunch it gave was a delight in my mouth!We loved the house salad dressings (the salad was utilitarian in nature), but with the dressings, which they suggest MIXING....the poppyseed balsamic vinagratte and a creamy garlic dressing. each was fabo in itself, but OMG when u DID mix them, they rounded right out and were so smooth and delicious! I was wiping my plate with my very HARD and CRUNCH Ciabatta bread at the end....ok, will finsih this later, mouth is watering.....need a snack! WIsh I was back at this restaurant!Recently travelled to St. Augustine for a little romantic getaway.  My wife and I have become quite the world travellers and we have been blessed to have had experience with many 5-star accomodations (e.g. Four Seasons, Thailand).  Because of this, we find that even when a restaurant is very good, it always seems to pale against our more luxiourious experiences.  Not so with this darling little find.The Old City House Restaurant really made an impression on us.  Tucked away within an inn near the city's center, this restaurant is pleasantly appointed with a very high attention to detail.  The staff was genuine, hospitable and down-to-earth.  We felt very welcome here.Now to the food.  Everything was superbly prepared.  That included the usually forgettable house salad.  The main courses were the real show (as they should be).  I had medium-rare ostrich which was done to perfection.  I've had ostrich several times, but this was a true winner.  My wife ordered the surf and turf.  The filet was cooked to an exact medium rare and crusty on the outside.  That type of accuracy in preparation typically only happens in the best steak restaurants.  The seafood cake was 95% crab and very little filler.  Excellent in every domain.The desert du jour was hot bread pudding with white raisins, chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream.  Just like the understated yet well created interior of the restaurant, the desert wowed us with the fact it was made with a lot of love.Bravo!  For such a small restaurant to have achieved this type of balance while not getting a big ego over it is something to be congratulated.  We would absolutely return, if nothing more than to enjoy your hospitality.I hate to say I disagree but I disagree. The only thing I enjoyed about this experience was the cheesecake. I ordered the sea food crepe and I know this might not make sense, but it was very seafoody. What I mean is when sea food tastes good it taste like shrimp, scallops, etc. This just tasted like sea water. It wasn't great. The waitress blamed me saying ""you ordered seafood"". Then when I ordered cheesecake she said that the real reason I didn't eat is because I wanted cheesecake. Um ya she lost major points on that one.  My boyfriend the feat bacon burger and it was really good. Maybe of k ha ordered the burger the star count would have been higher, but based on rudeness and grossness I will have to give it 2 stars. Ps we went because it emphasized south African influence. My boyfriend is south African and the pictures on wall were only south African influence we saw. The other waitresses seemed nice wish we enjoyed this more, but alas we won't be visiting this place again soon.Upon arriving in St. Augustine my wife and I were not impressed with much the city had to offer.  We had booked a week long trip at a local hotel which was beautiful, but noticed that the city was more of a B&amp;B kind of city. We stumbled through the city and found the Old City House Inn &amp; Restaurant...This was the highlight of our trip! the building is beautiful! it turns out it was Henry Flagers stable house for his horses  many years ago.  the rooms were perfect! we chose the Augusitn (i believe is the name) it was perfect ! 4 post bed awesome layout! .  Like i said we werent too impressed with the food in the city but we decieded to try their restaurant out. The food was fantastic... I had a pan roasted grouper encrusted with jumbo lump crab meat with a garlic herb sauce, my wife ( a huge curry fan ) had their thai curry she said was the most authentic she has every had, my food had to be the best Ive had in years.  we will return again",,,"['great', 'lunch', 'experience', 'back', 'try', 'dinner', 'located', 'right', 'downtown', 'quaint', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'food',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-st-augustine-beach-saint-augustine,Hampton Inn St. Augustine Beach,3.5,$$,26,"Am I a hotel snob....yes. Lol.  So with that being said.  This hotel was just ok.  It's a little creepy on the inside.  I've never seen a hotel with such a setup. It looks as if it could have possible previously been a outdoor hotel that they decided to enclose.  It was just very different.  The room itself was fine.  My bed was comfy, room was clean.  But I noticed a few stains on my towels when I held them up to the light. Considering the large crowd they had during my overnight stay, the breakfast area was fully stocked and I was able to grab what I needed very quickly.  Great location for the Diva Run event I attended.  If you are going to the amphitheater, again this hotel is in a great location.  The venue definitely needs an upgrade, but overall not a bad place.I pretty much only stay at Hilton chain hotels as I am a Hilton Honors member with diamond elite status.  This is by far the worst Hampton I have stayed at, and I've stayed at a lot of them.First, it badly needs updating.  The room decor was hideous.  Second, it's not exactly on the beach but pretty far off set from it. Third, the room did not seem clean, we found a spent coke bottle along the baseboard of the bed.  Housekeeping...look under the bed skirts.I booked an ocean front room with a deck.  I checked in and got stuck on second floor (room 207) where we could barely see the water over the dunes.  I used my points for the room and believe I got stuck on a lower level and sub par room because of it.  I was fed some bs about all the upper floors were already reserved when I was checking in early and could not pick any particular room on line in advance.This is a very nice Hampton Inn right on the beach beautiful facilities dining located right across the street I accidentally left my phone charger there and they are going to send it to me how's that for service. The breakfast on Sunday was good, the staff friendly and accommodating .smell of room unbelievably awful-cross between dirty socks and wet dog.  carpet and most of the room shabby and in need of updating.  breakfast also in need of an overhaul.  i've been to numerous hamptons and eaten in their breakfast rooms.  this one is on the small side in room space, and the food offered is messy in presentation and low quality.  few if any whole grain bread choices.the only reason for a second star is because of the ocean view and location.  this stay we got the fourth floor rather than the second floor last time.  but  the same beach is publicly accessible about a half mile down the road with free parking.  there are other hotels just across the street away from the ocean, thus no ocean view.fyi-there is a new Embassy suites resorts going in just down the road also tho no building started.  ocean front/view.would not return here unless knew it has been renovated.Well, this is not so good.I'm a Hampton Inn regular (a HHonors Diamond), and have stayed in dozens of them throughout the country.  This is a poor one.  Here's my rundown:GOOD:- Location is great.- Private beach is big and right out back.BAD:- It needs a full renovation.  It is old.  The hallways are dark.  The carpet is worn.- The breakfast area is TINY.  Read more below.- The parking lot is too small and gets completely full every night.Breakfast is a disaster.  It's tiny.  There are about six 4-top tables, maybe six 2-tops, and that's it.  It was totally slammed every morning.  The line for food was 15 people deep, and blocked the coffee.  Trashcans were overflowing.  Tables were filthy.  It's just woefully inadequate for the number of rooms and guests at this property.So I'm disappointed.  Hampton is usually very consistent, and I trust them.  They let me down at this site.  It is just not up to the standards of Hampton Inn.Good value, GREAT location, and a very personable front desk staff!  Clean rooms, accommodating and comfortable.  We would definitely stay here again!  Our room was on the first floor with a patio that was connected right to the pool/hot tub area!  One wish is that there was a gate on our patio fence so we could get to the pool without having to leave the room.  You couldn't possibly ask for easier access to the huge beach.  Also a great playground that my 4 year old LOVED!The view from our balcony was great, the friendless of the staff even better. However the bed sucked I would rather have slept in the chair.  The access to beach and breakfast was ideal and better than expected they must get better beds and larger TVs to make this an ideal place.We stayed here in October of2014. Room are clean, plenty of space. A very close walk to beach. Free wifi need a car to go to  st. Augustine old town. The breakfast was a 4 out of 5 eggs, beacon, bread, fruit, waffles great coffee in the room as well as at breakfast. Highly recommend.Hilton Garden Inn was sold out so we tried the Hampton. Beautiful hotel by the beach. Clean &amp; modern rooms with patios. Complimentary breakfast from 6-10, complimentary cookies at 7pm, and complimentary coffee/tea/hour cocoa all the time. Friendly staff. Decent gym with updated equipment. Pool and hot tub located inside.The hotel is pretty standard for a Hampton Inn, being in the ""budget"" tier of Hilton properties.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the A/C worked great.What sets this place apart though, is the whirpool tub rooms and the proximity to the beach.I opted to splurge a bit and get a room with a whirlpool tub.  Separate from the bathroom and shower, this tub sits out in the open right next to the bed [see photos]. Let's just say... it's a good room for couples.Each water-facing room has a little patio in the back with a couple of chairs, should you want to catch a sunrise or just hang out [see photo].Through the lobby to the back of the hotel is a door that lets you out to the pool and the boardwalk to the private beach entrance.  It's nice. I walked out there in the morning, stopped about halfway down the boardwalk to watch a few wild rabbits hopping around and nibbling in a grassy area, and continued out to the beach entrance.A couple of minor annoyances: The parking lot is too small to handle a full hotel.  We got back late one night and I had to park under the overhang by the front door.  When I woke up in the morning, I went out and there was at least four cars under that overhang.  The room that they have the free breakfast items in is also too small for a crowd.  It was a nightmare trying to get through all of the people that were waiting in line, or just milling about aimlessly.  No tables were available so we had to go out into the pool area to eat.  Also, they ran out of little cream cheese tubs for the bagels and when they put more out, they were frozen solid.Still not a bad place.  We'll come back as the opportunity arises.I love being a Hilton Honors member. Seriously one of the best decisions I ever made and I am not joking. American Express/Hilton Honors - watch your points GROW. Plus your incentive to frequent Hilton properties when you travel. Game on. So here we are...best girlfriends weekend, St Augustine Florida and we found a Hampton Inn on A1A on the beach for a very reasonable cost. $179 a night. Bit much for a Hampton but it's on the beach. You walk out and you are on the beach. The staff is AWESOME. Front desk, housekeeping. Just amazing. You get the same consistent service anytime of the hour or day.  When you pull up the property is very Florida. By that I mean screaming pink building. Plus, the property is older. It's not NEW so you have to manage your expectations a bit compared to other Hampton Inn properties.  We had our own balcony.  Our own micro, fridge. The shower pressure was awesome. The pool was perfect. There is a whirl pool as well.  The fitness center looked very small but again, who wants to go there when you roll outside of your bed and you're at the beach? And I LOVE to workout! :) Would totally go back in an instant. One of the best hotel experiences ever.First off, staff was great!!! Only reason it got a 3 star...Stayed in room 316, just for a nightAsked for a double queen bed suite.Call me crazy but those must of been FULL size... They felt tiny!!!! I have stayed at Hampton inns through out the US and their quality standard for this room was not the same. ( I travel very regular due to my job although this was a family trip which is what made it even more disappointing, after my daughter had found a room at a holiday inn of some sorts in the area I told her NOWAY!!! After seeing the Hampton inn, I said to her that ( Hampton inns had better rooms) BOY DID I FEEL STUPID!!!I regret to say I was disappointed in the room. AGAIN, the person on staff (Shannon) was super polite and helpful. I have no complaints on the customer serviceWe didn't eat in the breakfast area due to time restraints but it did seem tiny for the amount of rooms on the property. Probably won't be staying there again.Thanks,Just checked in. Nice front desk person. Got to room. Tv doesn't work. They are trying to fix it and won't let me change rooms yet. Lumbar pillows on the bed don't look like they've been washed for a month or more. We'll see how it goes from here...OK.  Spent the night.  Loud people in the hallway.  Not my kind of property.  Nuff said.I love this hotel &amp; the staff. They have the best general manager EVER, Kristin! This is our 2nd trip &amp; they welcomed us back like family. They are so very accommodating &amp; ready to offer suggestions &amp; pointers on what to do &amp; how to make the most of our visit. We have never had better customer service at any hotel ever!!!!!Friendly Staff. Amber at the front desk was so lovely and had a very cute southern accent! Stephanie from Breakfast was a nice lady too. A man asked her why she got a big smile on her face. She said ''because I woke up today""!Amber informed us that their homebaked cookies served at 7pm is a must have, so we got there to have the cookies!! They were super yummy like she said.Breakfast is included and it's very standard, eggs, sausage, waffle maker, fruits, coffee, tea, yogurt, muffins, pastries, bagels, cereal, oatmeal.It's right by the beach so if you get an ocean view room, you will see the beach (with swimming pool, and maybe a small parking lot in between), but it is nice to leave the balcony door open to listen to the sound of waves.Overall, a good experience and would go back again.Off to a bad start, 1 hour check in delay. No fans in the bathrooms.Location is great! The beachfront description is true. We stayed in room 201, which had a beach front view. While the location should be enough to give this property 2 thumbs up, being a Hilton Honors member and frequent guest of other Hampton Inns across the country, this room needed a lot of improvement. Please change the bed! It is hollow in the center. Almost felt like sleeping in a hammock.Well, I just really like this place.  Not super cheap for a Hampton but it's on the beach so it's to be expected.  Front office staff very friendly.  Let me upgrade to the jacuzzi room.  Mostly I wanted to be beach side rather than street side.  Having the jacuzzi in the main room, not in the bathroom just made me think that my room had seen some action if you know what I mean.  Liked having a pool and the ocean right there.  Ate across the street so didn't need to drive anywhere.  Breakfast was fine.  We got a table but it's not a huge area so some had to eat in the hall.  Will stay here again when I come back in the fall.So let me start by saying in the end this was a great hotel... However in the beginning when we first arrived after our 7 hour drive I had to take a pretty significant dunkus. I went into the lobby bathroom only to find to my horror blood vomit and fecal matter all over the place. OMFG! Well needless to say I took my dunkus elsewhere! Okay now that I got that off my chest I can talk about the room. Our room was large and clean it faced the street but still provided wonderful views. Our ac was cold and the sheets were clean. The location is great you can walk to just about any beach attraction that St. Augustine has to offer. The frat boys had the hot tub outside on lock down the entire time we were there I take this as a sign that it was a decent tub... The complimentary breakfast was good. Not great but good. The elevator didn't eat me which is another plus. I would recommend this hotel to my friends. By the looks of some of the exteriors of the competition  I think we made the right decision. Oh I just remembered the wifi is free however we had to connect with our code way too often. Free is good but this was a pain in the butt.Pretty good place!  If you haven't been here for a while you'll notice the beach is about 7-8x larger since Feb. 2012.  The city spent $49 million re-sanding the beach.  This happens every 8 years.  Fabulous beach!","Just had a short stay here but it was comfortable and convenient.  I checked into room 222 which had just had the carpet replaced and the odor from the glue was really strong.  No problem as the front desk moved me to room 118.  The only thing was the free wifi worked in 222 but not at all in 118. After checking in I walked right across the street to the Sunset Grill and had a great meal.  I would stay here again even though my comforter smelled like cheap cologne.Good location, hotel condition is nice enough and fairly clean.  Staff has potential but could use an etiquette brush-up, they were a little unfriendly and inflexible compared to every other Hampton Inn we have been to.  Overall the hotel just needs a few tweaks.  Good is fine, but great is better!  May return, not sure though.Stayed here when I was in FL for Christmas. My husband and I had a nice room with a king size bed. Some rooms overlooked the beach and we were in one that overlooked the street. I was impressed that there was no noise that we could here in the room from S A1A. My in -laws had a view from the 3rd floor of the beach. They have a nice spread in the morning for food- one rotating hot item (while we were there- omlette one morning with hash browns, one morning sausage and egg patty, scrambled eggs and bacon one morning and I can't remember the other one) In addition there is the waffle machine that was oh so popular, bread varieties, fruit, cereal and yogurt. The standard continental breakfast at a hotel. the only thing I didn't like is that matress and pillows were not the most comfertable- so 1/2 a star off for that but overall great.I went again last weekend - it was fantastic again!cannot access wifi from inside rooms (not strong enough)beach access is nice, but only when it is not closed off during beach/sand reconstitutionrooms smelled like mildew which is fairly standard, but drains were all clogged with sand (slow to drain)the pool is ok for its size, but there are too many people in the pool in the eveningthere is a playground in the back, but the debris in the sand makes it dangerous to play on without sandalsbreakfast buffet was good, but only one person runs it so it is kind of small and slow (always a long line for making waffles)the view is great when the skies are clear, good places to eat at (across the street), overall it is good, but misses the last two stars because of all the negative pointsDelightful.  On beach.  Reasonable price. Not deluxe, but we wanted to be on the beach at a reasonable cost and we got that.  Would definitely stay again.",,,,"['hotel', 'snob', 'yes', 'said', 'hotel', 'little', 'creepy', 'inside', 'never', 'seen', 'hotel', 'setup', 'looks', 'possible', 'previously', 'outdoor', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-st-augustine-vilano-beach-saint-augustine,Hampton Inn & Suites St. Augustine - Vilano Beach,3.0,$$,21,"Love staying at Hamptons for the reasonable prices and free breakfast. The room w/ 1 king was huge!Breakfast was great, beach in walking distance, nice/large pool, fitness center really nice,  and Publix across street incase you forgot anything or wanna grab some snacks.Great look inside of the rooms and I was very pleased with the bed and room size. Hotel staff has no respect for the Hilton brand or proper procedure. The idea that a paying guest is always right escapes the staff at this location. Having worked within the Hilton brand in the past it was extremely disappointing and turned me off of the brand. Maybe the 'Make it Right' campaign didn't reach this location. Interesting this Hilton brand experience because the Hilton downtown in St Augustine does a wonderful job.You get what you pay for regardless of association.The hotel was pretty busy when I stayed there earlier this week. The hotel is very nice and has a nice touch. The room was very nice though the A/C seemed to not work at all and was constantly on cold. Overall a very nice room and nice hotel with great service at breakfast. Though the gentleman that checked me around midnight was pretty unprofessional. It seemed that he was quick to judge my friends and I that we were pretty young and thought we'd be a rowdy bunch at the hotel. (We literally are just a bunch of guys that wanted a quick get away for a night before hanging out in St. Augustine in the morning). But literally when we walked in, the gentlemen (which I should've grabbed his name) took a look at my ID, said okay you already e-checked in, tossed the keys at me and said ""have at it"". I thought that was pretty unprofessional of him and should probably have some training in professionalism.This part has no affect to a negative review, but the morning of check out there was a fire that went in the hotel. The staff seemed very prepared and professional in evacuating the hotel. So bonus points for the morning staff from putting up with the ordeal.Super slow check in, waited 30min. In line as customers were helped and received rooms, only to be told my room  was not ready.  A friend that booked after me got his room and booked a day after me. One person working the front desk is a joke for such a popular spot.  Obviously not well managed  people off the street got rooms before we did, with no reservation.  finally got a room onsite from the elevator and vending, every time the elevator was used a loud electric surge noise could be heard.  Not to mention the ice noise and people making noise at the elevators.  there were no pillows for the pull out sofa bed and the bed was missing all the springs that held up the end of the bed. I used to love this place, it is in the best location but has gone down hill, will not stay here again.An OK place but be prepared to deal with the paper thin walls. You can hear the kids in their rooms from down the hall and the stallion next door going at it with his philly loud and clear at 7amPassable. The room was clean and the food was breakfast food was okay. The staff was very friendly. But the owner is clearly a cheapskate. Apparently he/she hadn't heard about the environmental damage done by styrofoam. Although that seemed to be the case in most St. Augie's establishments. There were no towels available in the pool area or on the way to the beach, for the duration of our 2 day visit. We mentioned this several times. Pool is too small for more than few people at a time. Despite being clean, everything smelled odd. But you got used to it. The television reception was inconsistent. Free wifi!Breakfast area probably too small for the number of guests. Will not return. The place has great potential if the owner actually spent a little money.The staff members are excellent - very responsive and caring. I was very impressed with the service. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The location is fantastic - right across the street from the beach. Some restaurants and bars (and a grocery store with an excellent beer selection) are within a few blocks of the hotel, which is very convenient.I had one small issue during my visit with some noise from a school group, and the front desk was very responsive to the issue. The next night I didn't have the same issues. When I mentioned this in the review Hilton sent me, I received a personal email from the manager who was very polite and seemed genuinely concerned.Overall, this hotel is nice, but what makes this place truly excellent is the staff.I'll start with this review is preferences with it's a hotel in Florida - meaning I'll give it a pass on the water - it's all bad in Florida - and the dampness - everything is damp in Florida.  The room was clean; staff friendly; and can't beat the location.  The only real complaint is the pillows - they were the worst Hampton pillows ever.I had a great stay at this Hampton. We had a third-floor room overlooking the ocean. The room was clean and fairly-well appointed. Service at the desk was good, and breakfast was passable. The location is really what makes it special, though. It is within sight of the Atlantic, and has a nice stretch of beach to play on. It's quiet at night, inside and outside. Also, it's a few minutes from the rest of St. Augustine, close enough to enjoy the attractions but far enough to forget you're near a city. I'd stay here again.Can't say enough good things about the location of this Hotel. Close, but not too close, to the Old City touristy area, while also being nearly beachfront, and essentially tucked away quietly in its own little corner.  The rooms probably could have been a little cleaner, but no serious issues. The breakfast was pretty solid for a free small-hotel breakfast. The pool, though small, was empty most of the week and beautifully lit in the evenings. We appreciated the fridge and microwave in the room. Most of the guests staying here were friendly and respectful, though a bit noisy at times. The beds could use a serious upgrade, but we are young enough to deal with them. Overall a great stay.Booked a Kingsize oceanfront balcony suite with hot tub.   The room was nice BUT all I could see is the pool and a grass field from the ""Not"" at all private balcony.  The ocean is way too far to even see from the top 3rd floor.This really is one of the nicest Hampton Inns in Florida. The location is right on the beach.  The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are huge.  The pool area is very nice and there is a small bar where you can get a couple of adult beverages while you take in some sun.  It is a short drive to Old Town St Augustine and not far from I-95.  My only tip is everything on the Island closes at 10:00 PM, so make sure you have everything you need before then.Great hotel. Really cool outdoor area with fire pits. Walking distance to the beach. I'd definitely recommend staying here.What has happened to this place?  I Love this place I love the location I Love the Hotel until..... my stay 7/5 thru 7/14   Everyday there was something else that was not the quality that it was the last few years. From a elevator that was broken for 3 days ? Days well.. you press the button and press and press and wait and wait  .     for 3 days ! Look I know that elevator Company's work 24/7  so what gives? So what is up with that?         Then we see a sign saying the elevator works but, you have to press harder or firmer ? Come on The Hulkster would break his fingers.... The dammm thing was broke.         Then the tub... nice paint pealing come on this is not a 62.95 a night place you would expect that from a place like that.Hampton are you reading this?Wonderfully relaxing experience. I adore all the outside paces, the location is literally steps from the beach, and just minutes from the historic district. The staff was super friendly and our room had a balcony. In terms of what was available at this price point, Hampton Inn was a great deal. Recommendable.Excellent service, rooms, atmosphere! This is my third time coming here and always had a great experience.Second time around... Awaken at 5:45 Am (Fire Alarm) someone burt the bacon in the kitchen....  Fire department arrives...  The best mangement could come up with ....  Folks go back to sleep.   Love the location, but the management and staff could careless!  Managed by college kids, who really, really really could care less!   Stay in St. Augustine!I was impressed with this little hotel in an area of town where there isn't much going on.  The ladies at the front desk were very helpful when looking for things to do in the Old Town area - which was very charming!  It was a well maintained and clean hotel with a very friendly staff.  The pool is very clean and, again, a well maintained area.  It is a short walk to the beach from the hotel.  The rooms and bathrooms were very clean with fresh towels and fresh bed linens.We ran into one issue but the responsive front desk addressed it immediately and had a solution for fixing it.  The air conditioner worked which is vital to a comfortable stay during the summer months in Florida.  However we noticed Friday night that it was leaking and the carpet in front of the unit.  We called the front desk and (because it was late at night) they sent someone up in the morning to fix the AC unit.  The maintenance guy also left an industrial fan in our room to help expedite the drying process of the carpet.The breakfast was good - the food was mediocre but the coffee was great.  Also the cookies were a nice touch in the afternoon!Nice accommodations. Updated from other Hamptons I've stayed in. The room descriptions are not accurate. Their idea of a city view are the front yards of the homes seen from my balcony. The AC had to be replaced, and the front desk attendant was ""stuffy."" Not your typical warm greeting and service I'm accustomed to at Hilton properties. Over-priced as I've stayed at much nicer locations and never paid what I did here.Convenient location to I95.  Clean, about what you would expect for a Hampton.  Staff was very friendly.  Breakfast was EXCELLENT!  I would definitely stay here again.",Very nice and well maintained Hampton Inn.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  This is easily one of the best Hampton Inns I've ever had the pleasure of staying in.  The location is excellent if you want to be close to the beach.,,,,"['love', 'staying', 'reasonable', 'prices', 'free', 'breakfast', 'room', 'king', 'huge', 'breakfast', 'great', 'beach', 'walking',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/st-george-inn-saint-augustine,St George Inn,4.5,$$$,23,"Beautiful and convenient. Most importantly, customer service was absolutely outstanding. We were traveling and were delayed, but the innkeeper stayed late to check us in.  We left an item in the room and they had called us to let us know they found it and even offered to mail it to us. Room was neat, clean and beautifully furnished.  Within walking distance of everything.  Great experience for couples and families.I stayed two nights at the St. George Inn in St. Augustine, FL on 4/20/2015 &amp; 4/21/2015.  It was my 1st time there.  The old saying location, location, location applies here.  St. George is a pedestrian street full of shops and eateries.  The Castillo de San Marcos National Monument is just across the street.  Trolley's which you can pick up near the Inn can take you to farther locations.  Besides all of this the staff is extremely helpful.  Sherry, showed me to my room when I arrived and all the staff helped me with any of my needs.  I had planned on staying only one night but added the 2nd because it is so nice here.  I stayed in one of their Santa Maria rooms.  the price was $219.00 per night.  With all the additional taxes, my two night stay came to $492.40. Plus, I took photos.Great Place to stay. We stayed upstairs across from the fort, so we had a great view off of the deck .It was nice to sit on the deck and enjoy a glass of wine at night and look at the fort and the water. The rooms are very comfortable with lovely decor, a homey feeling. Also the staff is very helpful and accommodating.I wold definitly stay here again.This inn is in the perfect location. It's right off St.George St. where you can find tons of tempting boutique shops and restaurants. The courtyard of the Inn features a beautiful fountain shaded by large trees where you can sit and have a late night drink or enjoy your satisfying complimentary breakfast. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and many offer eve lent views. My room had a view of the fort and the ocean. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation, especially for couples!Great place to stay in St. Augustine. Outstanding location, nice rooms, convenient parking, and a very friendly staff. We stayed during Labor Day weekend on the City's 450th Birthday celebration.Location, location, location. That's what you pay for at this inn. The rooms are nice enough, with tile floors, faux antique TV cabinets and faux antique chairs with no support (like the horrible doctors waiting room chairs). The linens and pillows were fairly nice quality. The room is nicer than a Days Inn or Motel 6, but not as nice as a Hilton or Marriott. But the wraparound decks are fantastic! You have a birds eye view of the variegated street scene of St. Augustine's tourist downtown while you relax on a rocking chair with a smoke and a cool beverage!The checkin was a little odd. We couldn't figure out where to park, so we called the lobby. The nice young man on the phone told us to stop on the yellow traffic markings right on the middle of the street. When we did, four young people trotted out the door, grabbed our bags, escorted me inside, and gave my husband a chit for the parking garage a block away!  The staffers were laid back, asking if we wanted things most places do automatically, like clean your room and make your bed while you're out. The guy who showed us our room didn't get us a bucket of ice, which I kind of expect at a $200-a-night hotel, but okay. They were super pleasant and polite, like almost everyone we met during our pleasant anniversary getaway. The cold continental breakfast included with the room was unexceptional: packaged bagels, Costco croissants, cream cheese, and cold cuts, coffee and OJ. But, again, you eat it under oak trees by a fountain in an old Spanish courtyard, before the mad tourist throng has even begun to arrive. Location, location, location!This was truly one of the best hotel experiences we've had. The service and the room were 5 star! We stayed in a Castillo Suite, #43, and were in amazement over the comforts the room offered. They even had umbrellas in there in case of rain, which came in handy. There was also an ice maker, plenty of pillows, a comfy bed and lots of towels. We had our 2 year old son with us and upon our arrival they already had a pack-n-play in our room along with a baby gate to block off the spiral staircase.You should know that there are bars and night-life going on around the Inn, and if this is not something you are ok with, then rethink staying here. For us, we really enjoyed sitting in the rocking chairs on the balcony and listening to the live music going on next door. When it was time for us to go to bed we could still hear it, however it did not keep us awake. It was well worth it to be in the heart of the historic district. The room was on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the building, so there were some stairs to climb (the 3rd floor part was due to our choosing a 2-story suite). However we did not mind the stairs because upon our arrival the staff whisked all of our luggage out of our car and right up to our room for us. They did the same upon our departure.The Inn offered a continental breakfast and the staff was very knowledgeable when we asked questions about the area. We didn't think housekeeping was going to come on our second day since we spent quite a bit of time in our room. We were ok with hanging up our towels and making our own bed. However, we did find that they had left us a basket outside of our door that contained fresh towels, coffee, toilet paper, tissues and a note that said they did not want to disturb us. While I was more than satisfied with this service, we came back from an adventure later in the day to find that they had actually come back and still serviced our room for us.All-in-all I can wholeheartedly recommend the St. George Inn and I would like to extend a warm ""thank you"" to them for making our trip so memorable.Just checked out from a wonderful stay at this place. All the rooms are well appointed and spotless.  Their toiletry selection is nice quality Rusk products, so this place does not skimp.  Perfect location to all the old town sites, but very quiet and our stay was perfect. Out room also included reliable wireless internet and a well appointed breakfast selection. It was beautiful to enjoy coffee and a croissant in their beautiful courtyard. The staff is friendly and available without being overly intrusive. We hate to be interviewed and questioned when we travel (even when we kno the staff is just trying to be friendly) so we loved the professionalism this place and staff offered. We had a wonderful time at this place. We felt it was worth every dollar and would not hesitate to come back to St George Inn.Awesome all around could not ask for anything else. Super comfortable beds, great layout, great location, great prices, great everything. This our second stay here and will be our next stay when we visit St Augustine again. Also St. Augustine is our favorite place to visit and we live next door to Mickey and Harry Potter so that says a lot.The St. George Inn is located right by St. Augustine's main point of interest which is the Castillo de San Marcos! It's right across the street! It's also on St. George St. which has lots of cool shops and other points of interest like the Pena-Peck House, the Gonzalez-Alvarez house, etc. The Inn's staff are all really nice and helpful. When we got to our room one of the hotel personnel came up with us and gave us many tips on what to do and where to eat, etc. Other reviewers claim that the Inn is noisy and that it is hard to get a good night's sleep. This is simply untrue. I never heard the noise from the nearby Oldest Wooden Schoolhouse and noisy passersby were not a problem either, nor were passing cars, etc. My MAIN complaint is that I heard the neighbor's bed banging against the wall and also heard it creaking frenetically haha! Ewwww! This doesn't mean the walls are paper thin, it just means that on this night we had clueless and/or rude neighbors. It didn't last long though hahaha! They have complimentary wifi but the signal isn't the greatest. My other complaint is that our room did not have a safe for my laptop. I guess it's time to get an ipad mini haha! We were given a room on the third floor that faces an old cemetery (which is by the Visitor's Center)! Spooky! The room was very nice and had nice furnishings. The bed is comfortable as are the pillows. In the morning they serve a simple complimentary breakfast (bagels, pastries, yogurt, juice, coffee, granola bars, etc.) in the lobby. They have an elevator. When you get to the Inn you can make use of the painted yellow triangle in the middle of the street right in front of the Inn to unload your luggage. Their parking is in a nearby structure right in front of the Visitor Center. The structure is just across the street. They will issue you a card that allows you entry into the structure. Don't forget to swipe out with the card every time or you may need assistance from a parking attendant.  The structure doesn't have one of those arm things that go up and down that keep you from driving out so people forget to swipe out. What happens is that the system thinks your still in the structure and doesn't allow you entry if you forget to swipe out. Parking is cheap and the structure is pretty big. The structure has elevators.  I highly recommend the St. George Inn. It's quaint, has really cool staff and is at an insuperable location!!!!We stayed two nights, and the staff were consistently very friendly and helpful. It was also great that they provide parking in the public lot for a $10 fee, because normally it costs $10 *every time* you enter the lot, so if you take your car out to use it during your visit, the money can add up. With the hotel pass, you can go in and out as many times as you want during your stay, and you only have to pay that one-time $10 fee. We found that very convenient, since we weren't just leaving our car there during our entire visit.Every time we had a question or a request, the staff were wonderful and bent over backwards to help us. We used one of their inflatable air beds, and I was pleased to find that they provide the high-quality kind, so that it was just as comfortable as sleeping on a normal mattress. I've slept on some that weren't nearly as good.I liked their continental breakfast more than I expected. The bagels were wonderfully chewy and fresh (even though the desk clerk told me they buy them from Dunkin' Donuts!), and there was good quality cheddar cheese and thinly sliced ham, in addition to the usual croissants, breads, cereals, juices, coffee, tea, etc. So it isn't fancy -- it is a *continental* breakfast, after all -- but it was better than many. Also, there is always bottled water available in the office during the hours it's open, which I appreciated.The location is wonderful, right on the quaint pedestrian St. George Street shopping area (and therefore footsteps from several restaurants), and it surrounds a beautiful little cobbled square with a tiled fountain. There are lots of attractive metal tables and chairs scattered throughout the courtyard, so you can sit out there and relax anytime you like, and it's a lovely place to enjoy your hotel-provided breakfast in the morning. The courtyard contains many stores (e.g., a chocolate store, a knick-knack store, a coffee place, a clothing store, a jerky store, etc.), as well as a drink machine that is accessible at all hours.One problem: our room was almost directly above a cigar store, and a man frequently sat outside the store smoking, especially in the evenings. The smoke completely permeated our entire stairway, so we often found ourselves walking through a very thick, stinky cloud in order to get from our room to the courtyard or vice-versa. There's nothing the hotel management can do about this, obviously, but it was very unpleasant.Another problem: the hotel has no ice machine. I use a lot of ice, and so all by myself I completely depleted their supply once or twice, and when other guests came to request ice afterward, there was none to give to them. Also, this means that you can't get any ice during the time when the office is closed, between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. We were able to work around this, but it was slightly inconvenient, and it meant I was constantly in the office bugging the staff for more ice. They were nice about it, but it would have been better if I could have taken care of it for myself, rather than having to always ask.On the other hand, I forgot a brand new pair of earrings in our room, and phoned almost a week later to ask if they'd been found, and it turned out that the person cleaning the room had found them and turned them in, and the management is sending them to me (on the other side of the country) right away. I thought it was great that the person cleaning the room was so conscientious and that the woman at the desk was so obliging in offering to send them.Oh, also, they provide free wifi. Always a plus.Excellent location right across from the Castillo De San Marcos fort. Parking is available at an additional $10 a night, 1 block away west on Orange street, near the old drugstore. Lock your car up tight and take our any valuables. It's very safe in St. Augustine, just don't like having my car parked in an unattended lot so far away. The St. George Inn is divided up into three sections. All the rooms are above businesses. The central fountain area can stay fairly noisy until 9 to 10p. Just an FYI in case you want quiet. But you can't get a much better location when it comes to being able to walk the town. We stayed in the 'St. George' room style. Very nice. There are many B&amp;B to chose from in the St. Augustine area. But we would recommend the St. George Inn. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stgeorge-inn.com%2Fstgeorge.html&amp;s=f81b2a46681ba55e3e7dde9c427ad760189c72cec56a6aa3e553921a547836fb"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">stgeorge-inn.com/stgeorg...</a>This inn was perfect! The room was great. Nice and clean. Great service from the staff! You can't beat the location :-)What a great place to stay in the Historic District!  The staff is great- very friendly and helpful with loading and unloading the car. Our room was the Santa Maria- overlooking the fort, city gates, and cemetery. We had a long, private balcony with rocking chairs. We came here for a couple of days to celebrate my husband's birthday, and were so glad we did. The room were very nice with a small refrigerator. The parking was close by, and only $5 per day. Breakfast was European style- meats, cheese, toast, croisants, bagels, peanut butter, coffee, juice, sweet breads, yoghurt. We sat outside to eat and watched the squirrels play- what a nice way to start the day. The Inn offers beach towels and ponchos for inclement weather which is nice. We were in walking distance of everything in the Historic District. Do drive down to Crescent Beach for lunch at the South Beach Grill, and then to see Ft. Matanzas.This place is in old St Augustine right on St George st.. Park your car in the public garage and forget about it. The inn keepers are very friendly and helpful. The place is very clean. Beds are comfortable. all the amenities you could ask for. The location CAN NOT be beat. there was some noise from the street and the bands playing at some local restaurants but that just added to the whole experience for us.DO it!!  Parking is kind of a pain but they have fine tuned the process so that we double park, they take our bags to our room and give us directions and a pass for free parking in the public lot. The great thing is we were able to leave our car in the public lot after we checked out till the end of the day, but it is two blocks away. The room was located overlooking a quaint courtyard, with a back balcony view of a private garden. Really cute but the best thing is the LOCATION. We were close to everything, and the owners have great suggestions for tours, shopping and dining. We actually saved money by following the owners suggestions.The St George Inn is one of best hotels in the St Augustine Historic area. It is located at the original entrance to the original city. Our room balcony look right out over it. (see picture). I believe there are only sixteen rooms in the Inn. The rooms are very nice and the hotel staff were great. The continental breakfast was very good. You can get it and sit in the courtyard (see pictures). I would highly recommend this Inn if you plan on making a visit to the St Augustine historic district. The only draw back was most of the better restaurants and bars were located three blocks away but it is a very pleasant walk through the old town.Outstanding!  Return visit - just as great as first time!  Innkeeper and staff very helpful.  Rooms huge, stone tile floor, clean and two balconies!  Location perfect!  Recommend highly!This is THE place to stay if you are visiting St. Augustine. Nice rooms, very friendly staff and even their Continental breakfast is better then others!Where should I begin...We had a great visit to St Augustine, it was our first time in the Old City. Not sure of what to expect, I did a little research and happened to find a place called the St George Inn, so I booked our stay.Making a reservation was super easy and the inn keeper answered all my questions when I was making the reservation. I asked to make sure they were a family friendly location as I was traveling with my 4 yr old. ;)When we arrived we were greeted by the staff- all very friendly and accommodating. (You unload your bags in the middle of the yellow median- center of the road, and are issued a parking pass for the parking garage- about a block away.) Our hotel stay included the historic package- so it had tickets already printed for the city trolley as well as tickets for some other points of interest. That was an added value!Our room was really great. We over-looked the Old School House and were right across from the Fort and next to the Old City Gate. There was hardly any noise, which was a pleasant surprise. Below our hotel room were many unique shops. The hotel provides a really nice selection for the continental breakfast, and the complimentary bath products were a nice touch. We were having such a great time walking through out the city, that every day was an adventure to find yet another great restaurant to get lunch and dinner. We were having such a great time, that we extended our stay an additional night. Our room was previously booked- but we were able to switch rooms with such ease! Anyone wanting a really nice, relaxing and friendly experience and place to stay should look into the St George Inn... The rooms are all non-smoking, super clean and spacious!**note: make sure to pack comfy walking shoes- you'll want to explore the city and walk the side streets!","If this place had better soundproofing, I'd give it 4 stars. We checked in at 4pm and the front desk guy was REALLY nice and helpful. After an hour of being in the room, I was no longer relaxed. I could hear every footstep in the room above ours and the noise from the street was non-stop. The worst part is that we paid over $300 a night for the Castillo Suite that has a beautiful porch, but the old schoolhouse was across from our bedroom window, and the mannequin's recording was played loudly on a continuous loop from 8am to about 9pm every day. That just ruined it. I understand that it is in the middle of everything, but I've stayed in Times Square and heard less noise, it's called ""soundproofing"".  For the price, I'll never stay here again. The room was beautiful and spacious, but the noise level was too high to sleep or enjoy the porch/balcony.  Save your money and get a nice place a block or two from the action.The St. George Inn is a lovely place to stay in the heart of the downtown tourist district. The third floor room we enjoyed had a view of part of the walking street, yet it was completely quiet at night. The room was cozy and comfortable while also being updated and extremely clean. Even the complimentary toiletries were high quality, and plentiful.Convenience is one of the best amenities. The street festivities begin at the bottom of the stairs, just a few yards from the room.The mornings got off to a great start with an impressive continental breakfast including fresh breads, pastries, cakes and fruit. There was also cheese and deli meats for sandwiches, as well as yogurt, juice and coffee. With the outdoor courtyard seating, breakfast was delightful.The staff was tremendous -- friendly, personable, and very helpful. We had a rainy day, but they offered us umbrellas and help running to and from the car. All of this service was delivered with a smile and plenty of enthusiasm.My mom and I stayed here.  I picked this inn because of a room that overlooked the old cemetery.  We were there in mid October so we had signed up for the ghostly getaway.   Was very pleased when we arrived not only did the balcony overlook the cemetery but the city gates from 1700's.  Irving, santi and Carrie were friendly and went out of their way to make our stay comfortable.    This in is within walking distance to most all shopping and attractions.   The inn also provided us free trolley tickets that lasted throughout our stay which got you around the city with the drivers as tour guides filling one in on the very beginnings of this beautiful city.     The rooms were large and comfortable. Wish they had microwave.   There was a dorm size refrigerator and coffee machine with various coffees.  They made sure there were extra pillows and blankets.     I highly recommend this inn for the price , location, size and the friendly wonderful people who run it.",,,,"['beautiful', 'convenient', 'importantly', 'customer', 'service', 'absolutely',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/casa-monica-resort-and-spa-autograph-collection-st-augustine,"Casa Monica Resort & Spa, Autograph Collection",3.5,$$$,119,"Romantic, exotic, ideal location, walk to shopping, eating, Flagler college and Lightner museum.  We had a view of the park from our window.  We had a drink in the lobby after check in and service was a bit slow but nice people.  We stayed in the one bedroom suite.  It has a four poster bed with sheer curtains around the bed.  Pretty sexy.  Linens great, robes, great shower.  Valet, front desk and bell service really exceptional.  Another nice touch was the Bose system beside the bed playing some nice background music when we arrived.  We think it was a good value for the $.Screw this place. They fired an employee for wearing an American Flag. That should tell you what kind of people own this flea bag hotel. Want some bed bugs with your anti american bed? 26-year-old tells reporters that he was released from his front desk supervisor position after he refused to take off the pin, which he had worn to work every day for two years.""I've actually gotten probably more compliments about it than any of the service I've actually done at the hotel, which is an interesting concept,"" May told a local station.The Casa Monica is stating behind their decision, claiming that they were only enforcing a company policy--not taking a stand against the flag itself.""The property reflects its pride in America and great patriotism by flying the Stars and Stripes high over the hotel,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""However, our employee handbook clearly states, 'No other buttons, badges, pins or insignia of any kinds are permitted to be worn.' No matter an individual's national preference, political views or religious affiliation, it is a standard regulation which ensures equality for all.""May suspects that the decision was a result over the company coming under new leadership, under the parent company Kessler Enterprise.Really overpriced, and this hotel has seen better days. The ambiance is lovely in the lobby, and furnishings are pretty in the room, but expect musty smells, poor wifi, stopped up sink, and tattered shower heads. It felt like staying in a fancy retirement home. We also opted for breakfast at the hotel; both times it took an extremely long time for our food (despite a half empty dining room). First day, poached eggs were totally cooked through in eggs benedict, so we asked that they please make sure it was runny (as a poached egg should be). It took over an hour to receive our food, as our waitress pointed out that they had to keep redoing the eggs. Um a hotel kitchen that doesn't know how to make poached eggs?? Scary. Then the benedict itself was prepared poorly (vegetables not cooked, English muffin not toasted).We went back for drinks to spend some time and also ordered appetizers, which again took forever. We ordered soup, salad, and cheese board -- not items that would take a long time to prepare. The server informed us they had lost our ticket. The location is good if you're interested in doing toursity things. It's walking distance to most interesting sights in St. Augustine and right across from Flagler College.But like St. Augustine, it is kitschy, overpriced, and desperately trying to stay relevant in the new millennium. Because of this stay here, I'm hesitant to stay in any other Kessler establishment. With such a high price point, I expected high quality amenities and service.Beautiful place. Good location. However, ants in the bedroom. No water pressure for the shower whatsoever. So much noise anywhere in the hallway, even just someone talking comes right through the door. Someone sang the theme to ""Green Acres"" down the hall and it was like a personal concert in my room, OY!!  Whenever someone upstairs flushed the toilet... the sound of Niagara Falls in our room. Pillows completely flattened as soon as we laid down so asked for 2 more and they brought old crumpled pillows which felt like the material inside was balled up.Edited review: mentioned above problems to manager who without a blink apologized and gave us a substantial discount on the room. Great management customer service.Absolutely beautiful hotel with old world charm that you can't get enough of!  Check was effortless ... Location superior ... Looking forward to the Spa!While it's a Marriott Autograph collection, it is part of the Kessler group which sets the bar for outstanding hospitality and decor.The Casa Monica has the perfect location in St. Augustine and the fact that it is a historic site really made my visit special.  I checked in and found my way to my room (trust me- harder than it sounds with the labyrinth of hallways)The room was just okay, small but adequately furnished and overlooking the pool.  The main areas of this place fare so much better like the impressive lobby, the bar and just the overall Spanish style architecture.Customer service was quite good.  They quickly checked me in and made sure that since they didn't have a concierge level that I would get Marriott points instead.  And at the pool, there was no bar, and the pool area was packed so I called room service and they sent a server out right away to take care of me and all the other people who were melting in the courtyard pool area.  Really surprised that there wasn't a working bar out there!Staying on the pool for a minute- know that if you have kids- the pool offers no shade and the deck is super hot on the toes as it bakes in the sun all day.  There are towels by the door and iron chaises (again- watch anything metal as you are likely to fry a limb off!)The restaurant off the main lobby was terrific!  The servers and food were great and the decor- well I will just have to write a separate review about the wonderful lighting arrangement over one of the tables.My final proof point of exceptional service came from the valet and engineering staff.  When they pulled my car around in the morning- I somehow had a flat tire.  I mean like flatter than a pan cake.  So the valet worked together with the engineering staff to put air in my tire and give me directions to a local tire store to get me on my way.  So appreciated!So really high points for this Marriott hotel and it's staff.  And the location can't be beat either!Casa Monica is the nicest hotel in St. Augustine.  This was my first stay here.  It is located along the main street in town a short walk to everything.  Valet parking is very convenient.  Three rooms are well kept with essentials. I stayed in a small room near three gym with a good business rate.  I expect there are larger rooms.  The gym is very small, but since I was the only one there both times it was fine. There is a bar and restaurant of the lobby area.  There is also a Starbucks at the hotel. This its a Marriott hotel.I have revisited the Casa Monica since the new management.  The new face lift in the bar area looks great and the service is 100% better.  We gave them another chance after a bad experience in 2014 and they more than redeemed themselves.  All of the staff from the front desk; the valet the waitstaff and the barstaff were exceptional.  We were sad when things went sour in 2014, Casa Monica St Augustine was home away from home.  They have truly apologized, they sent us a really nice gift, gave us a weekend stay all inclusive and have been so very accommodating since.  Our daughter got married and most of the bridal party stayed at Casa Monica 1-23-16 and we all had a great time.I loved the hotel and the service. It was a perfect location for my wedding night and getting ready with my bridesmaid. The spa was my only disappointment. I trusted the hotel to find someone to do my formal hair and makeup for my wedding. The makeup was wonderful, but my hair was terrible and I had to return to my room to redo it myself. I paid over $200 for this service and it included a 20% tip that I had no control over. It was my only regret of the whole day. I emailed the hotel and they didn't even respond with an acknowledgement.The supervisor for the front desk is not smiling at all ( name Rhan ) Not a good image for this hotel. .. Nothing special in this hotel I paid $399 a night and services and room quality is no different the holiday inn hotels.btw I found human hair under the sheets.. DISGUSTING..Will never return.One of my all time favorite hotels. If I'm in St. Augustine, I always try to stay here. Customer service is 5 star, ideal spot and beautiful property! It's the quintessential St. Augustine experience.Beautiful OLD hotel.  Likely the most expensive place to stay to be in the center of the city.  You can get a better experience at the B&amp;B's in the area.  The architecture is nice to look at and wonder around the hotel but you do not have to pay for a night to look around.Amazing hotel and really the only 5 star in St. Augustine Pros: - nicely decorated, very regal and gothic with big chairs from a castle - suites are amazing, Anastasia Suite is worth it- service is very good and friendly - they cater to whatever you need - location is perfect right in the center of St. Augustine worth paying for if you want to walk around the city at allCons:- Pricey $$$$- some of the rooms need to be updated and cleaned (drains backed up and cleanliness) - Parking is very pricey at $35 a night. If you stay and pay a lot, parking should be free Such a great hotel with a few caveats that if corrected would give this hotel a 5 star review in my book but for now it only gets 4. Still a great hotel.As always, you get what you pay for. I have stayed at this Autograph location 2-3 times now, and they never disappoint. Valet is $24 a night for guests, which is expensive, but there is little to no parking anywhere in St. Aug, without paying for it, so it is definitely convenient. There are always bellhops available to unload your car and bring your stuff upstairs. I always happen to be here for a wedding so we have a ton of stuff. The rooms are all different, no 2 are the same. The building used to be an old government building, before they converted it. The front desk people are nice and helpful and they are usually always able to accommodate you. The rooms are always spotless and the bathrooms are clean and organized. On the days that we got ready for the wedding, the guest services was running back and forth to our room maybe 100 times and they were so nice and helpful about it. I felt bad having them come up so often, but they hold so many weddings there that they are used to it. The restaurant downstairs is delicious. I have only have tried the crab cakes but they are so good. The wine list is mediocre and the prices are jacked up pretty high but it is nice just to sit down there at the bar and relax. The ballrooms are absolutely gorgeous when they are done up for a wedding reception. The staff are all so nice and will get you anything you need. They are a lot of fun too! The food was delicious at the reception. We had the choice of filet or salmon. I did filet and I was in heaven. It was one of the best filets I have ever had! Overall, the hotel is amazing. Yes, it is expensive, but you are paying for such a wonderful experience here. If I can afford it, I will stay here again and again.Beautiful but a bit pricey. Nice for special occasion. Was not really happy that parking was $24/day and that was really the only choice.If I could give it less stars I would!!!  Came here for my 14 year anniversary and Paid $465.00 for a nasty, old, moldy, makes motel 6 look like the ritz room. Found two roaches in drawer.Got food poisoning from room service which cost $200 ended up checking out early to go to a Marriott down the road. Which we were able to get a 1 bedroom sweet for more than 1/2 the price. DO NOT GO!!!Had a great time. Everyone from the valet to the lounge bar tenders were extremely nice. Extra bonus was the Starbucks in the lobby.My husband and I decided to stay at Casa Monica because we would be getting married across the street in the Lightner Museum Courtyard. The location of the hotel in general is really excellent. It's centrally located and so easy to walk to everything in downtown St. Augustine. It was an amazing location especially for us during the week/weekend as we could just pop across the street for our rehearsal, meeting with the wedding planner, doing photographs, and anything else that we needed to do to prep for the wedding. The customer service at Casa Monica, I have to say, was top-notch. Attentive, courteous, friendly. We had a weak shower head and alerted the front desk. We were headed out, but they had someone up to fix it immediately and even left us a courtesy card apologizing for the inconvenience and to grab a small coffee (on them) in the cafe downstairs. The common spaces are gorgeous. The rooms themselves are a bit outdated and could use some TLC. They are also not that big. It kind of rubbed us the wrong way that we had paid top dollar to stay there (the weekday nights were more affordable but the weekend/prime nights broke the bank), while they charged for bottles of water and internet in your room. We decided to splurge for parking because we did not want to worry about street parking/meters, and that was another hefty charge (about $25/night). All in all, I am so happy we stayed there as it was a once-in-a lifetime, but for the cost we will probably not splurge to stay there again (unless we go on week nights).I just got into town visiting my mom, who is in poor health. Never been here before and since this was an emergency visit I had no clue about the restaurants and what not. So, after closing down the visiting hours and schmoozing like only I can I needed some food. First going by the condo to drop things off I headed down town. Confused I was, clueless and with no planning. Never being able to find a place to park I saw this place from a distance. I say. Looks higher end, as the town had many beer halls and college places but I wanted something better and more mature. So I entered into an adventure, after a long day and I was taken back by the place.Sitting at the bar, good live jazz was playing. Ordering a wonderful martini, from the terrific bartender I got both their bar menu and higher end faire. So, I had these little fried fish buttons as an app. Quite good, very fresh and pure of good fish taste. On the seafood kick, I had the salmon sandwich, which was really good and fresh. Looking around at this small plates place, I can see they knew what they were doing and with some great trumpeting in the background and after a long and truly miserable day they place lit a little candle for me as we will need it.Beautiful hotel, prime location.  We were so happy with our stay here.  We had canceled out reservation due to a possible change in our plans, but when we got to St. Augustine, we knew that we had to stay here!  The front desk was able to give us our room at our original price, plus upgrade to a larger suite.  We have stayed at a few hotels from the Autograph Collection and this one was by far our favorite.Our room was very quite, comfortable and had a view.  The Bose was playing when we arrived, nice touch.  We didn't feel bad about the cost of valet, so worth it while staying in the area.  Lots of great restaurants within walking distance.  Plus, we were even treated to a free breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Great stay!","We stopped here for two nights on the drive down to Miami from Virginia and absolutely loved this hotel. The hotel is beautifully decorated with lots of old Spanish touches and the room was spacious and comfortable.Customer service was top-notch and the restaurant downstairs had lots of delicious choices. At night, there was live music at the hotel restaurant.The location is great- walking distance to all the major St. Augustine tourist attractions, shopping and dining.  The hotel offers valet parking for $24, which is great, because parking is not easy in the area. The only disappointment was the pool, which isn't in great shape and which didn't have enough shady areas to sit under.  We spent about an hour there with the little ones, but the steps were small and the pavement was burning hot, so there wasn't really space for them to hang out and play.Great location and one of the nicest places to stay in town. I would go back. It only gets three stars though because the ""preferred view"" room we stayed in had no view at all unless you get down on your hands and knees.  The window started at the floor and was only about 30 inches high and a balustrade further obscured the view.  If you reserve a preferred view room ask for one with a normal window.Great location but way over priced. Try the Hilton instead - but they have less than 100 rooms and often sell out on the weekends. We paid $500 for one night (Friday, the most expensive night). The room was nice but not any nicer than other hotels we've stayed at for far less. Our ""preferred view"" was anything but ... not worth the premium. If you have to stay at the most expensive place in town, and paying an exorbitant amount for it makes you feel important, than Casa Monica is your place. Otherwise there are many other options to choose from. Also - hope your neighbors are quiet. Ours weren't. The walls are thin. It's hard to get in the mood with Marge yapping non-stop next door.I was a little concerned about the hotel given the mixed reviews. It's definitely got an older feel to it...the rooms are small and just ok. However, the service I received more than made up for it. I just slept in the room...didn't hang out much at the hotel. Breakfast took forever to be served but it was clear they were short-staffed and those working were doing their best to be gracious and attentive ...I had the continental as a Marriott member...juice, berries, Greek yoghurt, muffins, toast and coffee.  All good. I changed my reservations several times and each time the hotel staff was pleasant and accommodating. Concierge handled my meal reservations...including getting me into a booked restaurant...which I fully appreciated. I would definitely return to Casa Monica...it is so convenient...and the staff was so lovely. I was tempted to help wait on tables myself when I stopped in for a drink early evening before bed...the staff was clearly struggling to keep up with all of the demands. But they smiled through it all. Shout out to Matthew at the front desk...thank you!  You are a great hospitality professional!was in the bar....whew pricey for St. Augustine.The best thing about this hotel is it's prime location.  The 16 foot ceilings are nice.  But I was expecting something really special for a Marriott category 8 property.  The hotel is average, though wearing a fancy veneer.  The A/C in the room is LOUD like being next to an idling truck and since the windows do not open there is no other way to get fresh air.  The ceiling fan squeaks.  The bed has a soft foam mattress that is comfortable enough when I'm sitting up reading, but killed my back when I tried to sleep.  Balky WiFi doesn't work most of the time.  Free continental breakfast (see picture) wasn't worth the price.  Even though I paid a rock-bottom price and was upgraded to a suite, I find myself wishing that I had stayed in one of the many quaint B&amp;Bs I passed during my evening stroll.All has been very good over these past two days here with one exception...the restaurant.  The dining room has felt like it was ill prepared to handle the Christmas crowd they've had.  The wait staff is excellent but apparently under-manned.  That, however, isn't the group who's underperforming.  That distinction goes to the chef &amp; his staff.  The last two mornings breakfasts have been both slow &amp; poorly prepared.  Over-cooked eggs both days &amp; this morning's was so bad they comped a whole meal for six guests. I'd estimate that cost the hotel right at $150.  An establishment of this caliber shouldn't be let down by the kitchen when all other departments are exemplary.  Valets are spot on; front desk is efficient &amp; extremely accommodating;  housekeeping does a great job &amp; I was told engineering took care of a problem within minutes of notification.  C'mon, Chef!  Get up to speed with the rest of the hotel's staff.I am a fan of Casa Monica.  First of all, I acknowledge that my experience at the Casa Monica is probably slightly different than most people who stay at this hotel.  Maybe that made my rating and experience a bit biased.  We were there this past weekend for our friends' wedding.  The first night there, we joined the bride and a few bridesmaids at the Kessler Suite, which is their large 3-bedroom suite.  Then for the next two nights, we stayed in a regular room near the Kessler Suite (since I am helping out with the wedding).So several reviewers pointed out the negatives, and I have to say, they are true.  The wifi does cost extra, which in this day and age, is a bit ridiculous.  The parking does cost extra, but given you are staying in a prime spot in St. Augustine, I fully expected it.  The hotel rate is expensive, yep, I agree.  The hotel is old and not everything is shiny new, yep, check.  When it rains (one of the days we were there, it poured), some areas smelled a little funky... that's an unfortunately yes as well.Ok, aside from all that, and I know it's a long list.... We had a great time and experience at Casa Monica.  First of all, the hotel is GORGEOUS.  Every details, every corner, from the lobby, the hallways, the guest rooms, the ball rooms... beautiful.  So it isn't one of the very contemporary shiny type, definitely don't want to stay here if that is your thing.  Appreciate the theme, the look and feel of staying in a historical building, and you'll enjoy your stay.  Our first night was at the Kessler Suite and then we checked in to Room 517 for 2 nights.  The Kessler Suite was beautiful.  Three top stories in that high tower when you look at the building itself.  It's hard to believe how spacious it is because when looking from ground level, it seems to be a tall and narrow tower.  The suite has 4 levels, the foyer, the living area, the master bedroom, and lastly the two bedrooms on the fourth level.  It was beautiful and spacious.  The only complain I have is that you have to climb stairs... lots of stairs, especially on the top level/floor.  We enjoyed it and it was perfect for the bride.  She had plenty of space and invited her bridesmaids to join her at the suite the night before the weddingFor the next two nights, we checked in to room 517.  If you are planning or helping out a wedding with the bride staying at Kessler Suite, I strongly recommend you to take the only non-suite room on the fifth floor (517), which is what we did (assuming you don't want a suite yourself).  I didn't want to spend too much and stay in another suite on the fifth floor, and 517 was the only non-suite choice.  The front desk warned me that it is one of their smallest room in the hotel, but in this case, convenience wins.  I am glad we picked that room because it was very easy to go back and forth between 517 and Kessler to help out on the day of the wedding.  And really the room wasn't so small that it would be an inconvenience.Overall, the beds were very comfortable, the hotel was beautiful, the service was impeccable... so we really enjoyed our stay.  Will we stay there again?  Well, unlikely.  I don't usually stay in an expensive hotel and especially since it's so close to home, that the chance to spending a night in a hotel in St. Augustine is already unlikely as is.  But we were glad we had the opportunity to try Casa Monica at least once.Oh and the wedding coordinator, Courtney, was awesome!wonderful!! Great room   Great lounge.. Nice front desk people.  Parking stinks 25$ a Nite!!  Great area convenient to all!!  JUST an UPDATE  AS I WAS CHECKING OUT THEY  wanted to charge me $20 because I asked for a refrigerator in my room!  I called and told them YOUR KIDDING RIGHT!! I $400 a Nite hotel doesn't have a mini fridge !! Then I want to charge me.. don't think so!!Very beautiful hotel. Extremely disappointed in the fact we had reservations for a premium room with a view. We checked in and the window was the smallest window I have ever seen. It was floor to half the ceiling. The view was overlooking the roof of the old courthouse. Room needs 2 chairs.Team Vega made a stop here to not only admire the beautiful antiques within the lobby, but to check out the awesome art located within the hotel property. It was incredibly impressive and the staff was more than friendly, definitely check it out.Honestly, I'm not sure I understand the hype about this hotel. As a platinum Marriott member, I've come to expect pretty great service/accommodations especially from what they deem a Category 8 hotel. I think that's the problem I had with the Casa Monica: It's NOT a category 8 hotel. NOT. AT. ALL. We booked with Marriott points, so perhaps they gave us the worst room in the building (great way to treat platinum members). The shower would not stop dripping. The room was large, but had only one tiny window. It was SO DARK. It was laughable!! The bedroom area, which was almost like a secondary room, had no windows at all - it was a dark box. Just like our very own dungeon.  We ordered room service for breakfast each morning. $6 service charge, 27%+ tax, etc. It was insanely expensive. Especially considering it was cold bacon, sausage and pancakes. It was evident they either pull things off a buffet line where they've been sitting, or there's a vat of pre-cooked food in the back. Awful awful food.They charge $27 a day for parking which honestly seems steep for the area.The Starbucks inside is a great addition. Make sure you tell them you're staying at the hotel (they'll give you a 10% discount) I didn't find this out until the day we left. The pool was much smaller then we anticipated, and was pretty crowded.Wifi is $14.95/day - unless your a gold/platinum member. Then it's free. But it's pretty spotty and didn't work well. Had to keep logging in and out. On the plus side, the bed was very comfortable. And the bedding was nice.  The staff were very polite and friendly. That's about all I liked about the place. Marriott needs to re-categorize this hotel. 120,000 points for a three night stay. You can stay at the Ritz for that - which is a FAR CRY from this place.This was my first stay at the Casa Monica.  So disappointed that Marriott has changed the dining into an updated look.  The photos on the website are not of the new updates.  As a traveler, we wanted to stay here for the experience.  While we had a great room with an amazing view.  I pray they don't update the charm of the rooms.GREAT HOTEL, GREAT BAR &amp; RESTAURANT, AND EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! My husband left his brand new sports coat in the closet and Casa Monica found it AND shipped  the jacket back to us in Houston, Texas!  Casa Monica is located right in the middle of downtown and is within walking distance to all the cool spots! We LOVE this hotel and will definitely be staying here during our next trip to St. Augustine!Conveniently located in the heart of St. Augustine.  I recently stayed at the Casa Monica while attending a wedding.  For a 4-star hotel, I was expecting a little more.  Let me begin with some of the negatives.  Wifi is not free.  For a hotel that's already pricey to begin with, complimentary wifi would have been great.  Housekeeping looked liked they needed an extra push.  It didn't seem like they were in any kind of hurry to clean the rooms.  The gym needs a lot of work. They have all the basic equipment but it's entirely way too small.  Lastly, the showers are dreadful.  There is nothing more unsatisfying than taking a shower with low water pressure.  Now for the positives.  The rooms are very spacious and come equipped with an HD television.  The beds are very comfortable and will definitely give you a good nights sleep.  The hotel staff is very friendly and willing to help you out with any questions.  As for my favorite part of the hotel, it has to be the pool area.  It's a great spot to be able to kick back and relax.  The jacuzzi didn't hurt either!We have stayed in 2 other properties from the Kessler collection before (also considered a Marriott Autograph Collection hotel) and they were a step up compared to the Casa Monica.  We own property in the area but decided we wanted to stay in town this trip just to experience the city in a different way.  St Augustine is a terrific place to visit, the streets were full of life downtown so the location for the Casa Monica is perfect.  But that is about all that is.  The rooms are small, overpriced, a little musty, bathrooms are small and the rooms are poorly equipped.  My wife expects to see  a full length mirror somewhere in the room, not here, plugs are sparse which is not helpful in todays digital world.  We tried the bar/restaurant our first night and  ended up walking out, they were slow, understaffed and not the least bit interested in serving dessert and cocktails at 9:00 pm.  The hotel is old and loud, you can hear most everything said in the hallway, kids next door are like they are in the room with you.  The staff was somewhat courteous, but you can tell they have a script for every question so they were not helpful. We were there for three nights and not much changedLet me start by saying the staff were super helpful and attentive, and the location a destination every traveler should experience.  The Room we chose was their premium king with separate seating area, and upgraded room.  The room was clean but of average to small size from my experience.  We requested a early check in and a high room; we got a 2 floor room on the street SUPER LOUD ROAD NOISE! We looked forward to the Sunday brunch with carving station and seafood, we smartly choose to look before committing $35.00 per person,  this is one of the lows of the property.  The stainless buffet stand had food sloped down the fronts and all over the table clothes serving tongs with crusty old food on them attention to this would give the whole new perspective.  Now the best part is the architecture and the location, you can not any better location too bad they did not pay more attention to the small things and the cost is just way out of line with reality.Incredible place that's a once in a lifetime stay.  Have the five course  dinner with wine in the hotel restaurant downstairs and it was quite literally the best dinner I've  ever had.  Where normally I eat and run, I sat at table for two hours savoring an incredible meal, superbly matched wines and attended by an excellent waitstaff.  Definitely made our stay at Casa Monica trip to remember.It's a gorgeous hotel in the heart of historic St Augustine, lavish, beautifully decorated, and it's the only place I'll stay when I visit St Auggie.I went to a wedding there and was blown away, It was beautiful! The staff at all times were very polite and professional! The food was amazing! I would recommend this to anyone for any reason. The parking is not that great (no-where in St. Augustine is though) Valet was a bit pricey. The hotel is central and very convenient . They do have a bar and restaurant in hotel too. Love, love, love.","We have Marriott Platinum Elite status and have always been treated very cordially at this hotel (last stay was April 2015 prior to this stay in November 2015).  April was a wonderful stay but this trip was totally opposite.  Check in desk was ho-hum and didn't care about anything.  Given a small room that smelled extremely musty and had no tub.  Called front desk and we were given a room like ones we have gotten in the past.  Next morning stopped at front desk and asked if they could tell we had been there before - a man (all people working the desk during our stay were under 30 years old and not personable) answered 'no'.  I told him about the first room smelling really musty - at that time a short haired blonde female appeared and said rather curtly that ""none of their rooms smell musty"" - oh yes they do!  Asked about the tub situation and she said that if it wasn't on the profile or requested at time of reservation, they won't give it to you.  I said that we had always gotten it in the past and she said that they reserve those rooms only for ""Platinum"" members; I said we are Platinum and then she started saying something about that only Platinum Elite can get those rooms - hmmm, we ARE Platinum Elite as the profile shows.  She got very huffy and from her words/actions she insinuated that we were ""lucky"" to even get a room there.  The hotel was not full at all and only the bar area was busy, mostly because of walk-in traffic from outside. There were other things that had changed since April 25.  We will NOT be staying at this hotel again (had always done so any time we were travelling to south Florida).  On this trip in Nov. we met with several people whom we had highly recommended this hotel to in the past ; told them about our experience and said it's not worth the money to stay at Casa Monica where the customer is always wrong and management is always right.  Marriott/Kessler Group has done a real disservice by changing management.The Casa Monica Hotel in St. Augustine is centrally located in the heart of the tourist section of St. Augustine.  It is directly across the street from Flagler College and just a block away from St George Street.  It is an Autograph Collection hotel from Marriott and everything was very nice.  The hotel's restaurant was good and had a nice bar. Very nice pool and hot tub.  Great views of Flagler College from certain rooms.  Highly recommend this hotel.  Must valet but you won't need to get in a car because everything is within walking distance.hotel is very pretty and very centrally located.  unfortunately, it's an old hotel and the amenities haven't caught up with modern expectations.  they trade too much on the name and not enough on guest convenience:1.  internet is crazy bad.  no signal, and ridiculously slow and cuts out when you do get one.  insane if you need to access internet.  2.  shower was backed-up3.  got bounced around from housekeeping to bar, back to housekeeping when trying to order drinks at the pool. 4.  rooms are ok, but nothing great - flimsy shower stalls, single sink in a premier room when we complained, they tried very hard to fix things, but some of the issues experienced require investment.  lovely old property, but expensive and dated.  can't recommend, sorry. jwA true surprise. Excellent service.  Yet relaxed. Visuals oh so pleasant.Wireless, one device, per day?That's wrong.You are a fancy hotel and I paid a lot of fancy dollars. We have more than one person with more than one wireless device. Hell my 4 year old has an iPad.Otherwise, great location, beautiful building and rooms.We just finished a four night stay here and it was absolutely perfect.  Luis was very nice to upgrade our room and was also very considerate in providing suggestions for activities and dining options.Everyone at the hotel from the valets to the servers at Cordova 95 and Cafe Cordova were wonderful.  We were able to use the pool which was very nice and my wife loves the cushioned chaise lounges.Our stay was so nice we are already planning another trip to this hotel.I just wanted to pass along my compliments and point out Luis and the other staff members who went above and beyond to make our trip wonderful.A Florida classic play to stay.   I didn't run into any ghosts.   Had a few nice drinks at the bar.   Also it was great to have the coffee shop right in the lobby.    The valets were super nice, and quickly got my car when I needed it.   The location is perfect.   Stay in style!Ok, so I know it's a Marriott Autograph and some things are going to be overpriced, but $13 for one weak, single vodka and soda? I mean, c'mon...that's too much. As someone who enjoys utilizing the bars at hotels, I couldn't allow myself to order another drink when I can walk half a block and get one for less than half. This is St. Augustine, not Miami Beach. It's a beautiful hotel with a comfortable bar, so enjoy a drink and then go explore.What can I say? Booking was easy and the staff made sure I was welcomed and made it a special day for me on my. Big 5-0 !!! They even gave me a pretty birthday card and complimentary dessert! ;) It was very clean, beautiful, (especially the historic artwork throughout the hotel) nice pool and jacuzzi. Thank God they had a Starbucks lol and the valet was thoughtful as I was waiting for my family to all depart at the same time.    (Thank you Luis and all in your staff)It's those little extra touches that make you want to return! Thank you for also having a great online deal for what I know as the upper end of hotels in town.An outstanding and HISTORIC hotel in the heart of St. Augustine.  Great updated rooms in this classy old hotel. Some rooms are a bit small. Pool or water view are ideal.  Nice lobby bar and restaurant and PERECT location near restaurants, bars, marina, art galleries and sites. Hotel lobby can get a bit busy and traffic here on weekends Starbucks in lobby is great, albeit busy. Staff is helpful and it's a great overall experience.  Rooms can get pricey at peak times. BE sure to walk around Old St. Augustine town.Only stayed one night, and no complaints. Very beautiful, romantic, a lot of opportunities to for photos. Starbucks on site. Very comfortable beds. Exceptional Customer service. Clean, well appointed rooms. Public Parking lot around the corner that is free after 5pm M-F if you want to avoid the $24 valet. Didn't get to go to the restaurant or the pool, so this review excludes them.Beautiful hotel right by the water. Polite and professional staff with immaculate room and very comfortable furnishings. The art galleries and shops downstairs are lovely. We watched world cup at A1A restraunt when us was playing. Plenty of nice ahops and venues to visit and enjoy.  The tini martini room nearby is pretty happening for drinks on the patio. Stay away from the restaurant on the pier. Unless you just want some hushpuppies. There are a number of bums see wiki for definition of yhat word or urban dictionary and denizens of the street that will petition you for money and freely offer unsolicited negative attention. Check the weather before you go. Its fun in thevrain but beautiful when its clear.Amazing place. Katie was so awesome. We got a very cool room. The decor is beautiful. We are very happy staying here.This review is for the bar only. The bar in the lobby of the Casa Monica is very nice. However. It was filthy.  Crumbs and broken pieces of glass were on the bar and on the barstools.  Glasses hanging  above the bar were covered in dust and spotted. The very nice bartender put her fingers inside the glass to reach it and pull down from the rack.I booked a night at Casa Monica to take in the Xmas vibe in St. Augustine. Unfortunately I had a pet emergency that forced me not to make the trip. Now sure,  my fault for having a pet of course and being inside their generous 72 hour cancellation policy. I tried to move my reservation and not cancel it outright as to state that I understand I am in the wrong but let's work together so you can have my money and a happy customer. I was met with a resounding NO. So full charge for the room I will not be staying in. I suppose Casa Monica is in the money making business and not the hospitality business. There are a few definitions of hospitality and Casa Monica has not met one. Deplorable customer satisfaction. Enjoy the free money and I will not book Casa Monica or any Marriott ever again.We stayed here last week and it was a pretty nice time.  I randomly selected this hotel stay as a getaway weekend trip.  We had never even heard of St. Augustine, FL before so we were amazingly surprised at how beautiful the hotel is, the town, and the awesome history.  My boyfriend was pretty impressed since he lets me pick all of our vacation spots and this pick was random but turned out perfect!  I literally Googled Florida hotels and packages and Casa Monica came up.Keeping in mind that this is a historical hotel, it is beautifully kept.  Valet parking is available and you might as well use the valet because I think parking is the same price... about $20 a night.  Just remember to tip. Check-in was smooth and easy and the staff are friendly.  I LOVE the old cars they have parked around the hotel.  They are available for rent I believe.  We did not swim in the pool because its just too cool for me in February but I think its heated, if you're interested.   The grounds at Casa Monica are just lovely. The room was clean and they even made sure to fulfill my request for extra pillows and towels. Our king bed was really sweet. There's not much light in the room we had but we did have a view of the water fountain next door.  We booked the Romance Package ;)There was a bouquet of red roses and a bottle of red wine in the room upon our arrival.  Later that night the waitstaff delivered chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne to our room!  It was so sweet and romantic. We also reserved the carriage ride and we were promptly picked up at Noon in front of the hotel.  This carriage ride was EVERYTHING for me on our trip!  It was sooo amazing and sweet, and awesome! It was about 1 hr long around town and we were told the in depth and highly interesting history of the town.  It was just awesome. We had a really great time for a weekend, mini vacation. It was super relaxing, too. We will definitely go back.   By the way... they DO have Starbucks coffee in the cafe of the hotel! ;) The dining experience at the hotel's restaurant, 95 Cordova, is a completely different story so you'll find it in a separate reviewFantastic historic hotel in the center of the Old Town area.  Staff was very nice, helpful and welcoming.  Had a room upgrade to a large one bedroom suite - wish we were staying longer!  Room was large, well maintained and very clean.  I was able to get a very good rate online which made it even better.  Next time in Saint A, we'd definitely want to stay here!It's just a really cool place to stay. The hotel has a lot of history and  it is very different from any hotel we've stayed at before. Centrally located makes for an easy walk to everything.  Food was great. Service was great. It's a tad pricey but for a special occasion it's worth it.It really is grand and gorgeous. Upon laying your eyes on this gem, it is confirmed that this is a majestic 1888 landmark hotel. I adore St. Augustine and try to visit at least one a year. It's historic, gorgeous, relaxing and just a lovely place to spend the day or weekend.  I stayed at this lovely castle turned hotel earlier this year and it was delightful. The beauty of this place it just breathtaking. Part of the Kessler collection, this hotel delivers just like the rest of them; a true classy, swanky and upscale brand. Rich colors, lovely scents and just so much character with the decor. Lynsay at front desk was super nice! We asked for some suggestions on must eats and dos and she popped out a map and showed us all over. Very welcoming. The room was lovely and comfortable. This was a very brief stay due to some scheduling conflicts and I am very disappointed we did not get to check out more of the hotel and the pool. It is very pricey so I would suggest booking for a certain occasion and make sure you have time to sit back, relax and enjoy. One small downside was the valet. We rolled up in a Jeep and they did not inform us that the cars would be staying outside overnight and they did not allow us to secure the Jeep correctly so that was a bit frustrating. We would have appreciated a heads up. Good thing it did not rain that night!Stumbled upon this wonderful hotel through Luxury Link- and what a great find!! Located right in the middle of town it was easy to navigate to little pubs/bars. Everywhere we chose to go was walking distance. Wonderful!!And for the hotel...we upgraded to the Kessler suite which was amazing!! More space then we knew what to do with. Only downfall was no big tub in the master bedroom- which you would expect in their largest suite. Staff was curious and accommodating. It was very clean! Hotel restaurant was very good, and the lounge bar was great! Best pizza I've ever had... Good love music... Great drinks! Would definitely go here again!","Why hello there Casa Monica Hotel. You sure are looking nice today and everyday for that matter. Casa Monica Hotel is a very classy hotel in which I wouldn't mind spending the night. I am sure the hotel is expensive based on its appearance and ""fancy"" style. However, I know that if you search for a good deal one can be found. In fact, some friends of mine were able to get a good discount and spend about $90 for the night back in December...deals are available! I arrived at the hotel after a wedding at the Lightner Museum for some drinks with other guests. The lobby area was very inviting and the concierge was friendly. He directed us to the bar area in which we were able to find a table (a few tables) for all of us. We looked over the drink menu and were able to order everything from beer, wine, cosmos, and martinis. It was a simple menu with simple options. I wasn't in the mood to be making a decision so when I saw they had martinis I was ready for one. The service was great and the bartender was doing a great job keeping the drinks coming! I will say that drinks cost $10+ depending on what you get so be prepared to  spend your money when you arrive. The drinks were worth it though. I felt classy drinking in the Casa Monica.Top quality brunch with a raw bar, omelette station and the works.Tempted to give it 3 stars, but just couldn't. A 3.5* or better hotel should not have tube TVs. But the Casa Monica does - good ol' 1990s-era tube TVs in every room. Considering what the Casa Monica charges, there is really no excuse for clunky old TVs. The reason must be no competition in the historic district of St. Augustine.I did appreciate the cafe downstairs with the cool street view and good coffee drinks. But the pool area is basically an internal courtyard with no natural view, and after only 15 mins of working on my MacBook poolside, tiny mite-like bugs started to crawl out from under the pool furniture onto my computer case. Ewwww. I packed up and went back to my room.Casa Monica may be the best of St. Augustine, but that isn't saying much at all. Even a lower-tier 3* property in Las Vegas like the Excalibur or virtually any Hampton Inn / Hyatt Place / Courtyard by Marriott blows the doors off of Casa Monica, room feature to room feature.Be aware that there is no true grocery store, convenience store or chain-pharmacy within walking distance of this hotel. Nor is there any store that you would find in a mall (e.g. Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, The Gap) within walking distance, so don't forget any snacks or socks before you decide to coop up at the Casa Monica. Room Service shuts down at 11PM, too. What does one do in historic St. Augustine? A religious fasting retreat would be a good fit.This and only this is the finest hotel in St Augustine. I've attended many a meeting here and I have no material complaints what-so-ever.  * The meeting room is classy and private.  * The service is perfecto. * The restaurant (yes, a restaurant in a hotel! *faint*) is really outstanding. * The valet parking is affordable and convenient.The rooms are historic. If you are expecting stainless steel, granite countertops, ipod docking stations, and flat panel TV's, this isn't the right spot for you.This is one of my favorite hotels to stay in, as often as I can.  I only wish my travels took me to St. Augustine more often so that I could stay more frequently.I read some of the other reviews of the Casa Monica on Yelp; thankfully, I've never experienced those issues during my several stays there.  The front desk staff is always very pleasant, welcoming and professional; I often need assistance with several bags and the bell staff are also really nice, professional, and can help with local dining recommendations, too.The hotel rooms themselves are well-appointed, with a vintage flair; red velvet headboards, for instance.  The rooms are very quiet, even when there is a lot of street noise from traffic (most of the time, my stays involved a street-facing room).  Another prime reason to stay at the Casa Monica is its location; it is right in the heart of the city.  So many of the destinations that you come to St. Augustine for are within easy walking distance from the hotel.I also have to really commend the housekeeping staff at the hotel; they go to great pains to keep the rooms exceptionally clean, and each one will greet you pleasantly when you see them in the halls, unlike many places you may visit.  On my last visit, the housekeeper even left a nice thank you note, for spending time at her hotel, something I thought was a nice touch.I stayed here for a work conference. We pulled up to the valet. The valet greeted us warmly. Parking is $17/day plus tax. The valet area was clean and there was even an old-timey car in the area that really set the tone.We walked into the lobby and we were immediately transpoted to old Spain. There was beautifully carved dark furniture everywhere. Dark reds, mosaics, bronze and the lobby smelled amazing. We proceeded to check-in. The process was fairly quick. The front desk person seemed rushed and wasn't overly friendly, but I got my room keys and set off to find my room.The elevators were small, but fast. I got to the fourth floor and found my room. The hallways and lobby areas were all clean.I found my room. It was fairly small, but this is a historic hotel. That said, it really stands out compared to other old hotels. He room was  modernized with updated drywall, light fixtures, and a coffee machine. The only negative in the room was the TV. It was a big box TV and the quality wasn't very good - but who goes to St. Augustine to watch TV anyway?The bed had a huge red tufted velvet headboard. The room had tons of dark wood furniture. The king sized bed was comfortable and cozy. The sheets were soft and clean.The bathroom was very clean and spacious. The  bathroom counter had plenty of space for all of your toiletries and then some! We so used the Flagler Ballroom for our work meetings. I would love to come back and host a party there. The location is gorgeous. There are beautiful paintings, dark woods, beautiful Moorish light fixtures. Overall, a very beautiful space. If you're coming to St. Augustine, you have to stay here. This hotel is  the true essence of  the old city.I'll start with the great things about this hotel.  It's a gorgeous and authentic building with attractive furnishing and extremely courteous staff.  The location is also perfect for its proximity to local attractions.  They also host weddings and other events, making the hotel a natural choice if you're attending such an event.All that being said, I didn't find the hotel a great value.  In particular I felt nickel-and-dimed by all the extra charges.  My nightly $339/nt + tax rate seemed high enough as it is, but they also charged $24/nt for parking and $9.95 per device per day for Internet access.  Don't make the mistake of using the hotel room phone, as a 10 minute domestic long distance call costs $43.  Even local calls are $1 each.I was also disappointed by their 11AM checkout policy.  I requested a 1pm checkout, but the best they would offer was Noon.  I'm pretty accustomed to checking out much later from rooms which cost much less.Our room was fine, but not what I would expect for the high price.  We only had a tiny window and it overlooked a rooftop.  A plaque by the window explained that the tiny window was a special historical feature of the hotel.  The gym was small but at least adequate and they didn't try to charge extra for using it.The Casa Monica is gorgeous. It's fancy and expensive.  But you know that already.We stayed at the Casa Monica for one main reason: We were getting married in the courtyard of the Lightner Museum right next door, and I wanted a good place with a big room where my wife could get ready with her bridesmaids and makeup person and hair person and various mothers and friends and not feel too terribly cramped.And so we ended up in Room 504, a large beautifully decorated room with a big bathroom and a four-poster bed with the white sheets hanging down curtain-style around the outside edges. Three large windows let the perfect amount of natural light in, and a Bose clock radio was softly playing jazz as we walked in.My friend's room, where the groomsmen got ready, was actually a two-story room with a small living area downstairs (a couple of nice couches, a chair, a TV, and a bar area) and a bedroom upstairs separated by an iron staircase.  It had a bathroom on each floor. Amazing.The service (in any respect) was generally amazing.  When they found out about the fact that we were there for the wedding, they sent someone to each of the two rooms with wine glasses so we didn't have to keep drinking out of plastic cups.  The ladies got a visit from a gentlemen with a number of chairs for the room so everyone would have a place to sit.The valet parking system.... maybe could have used a little work, at least on the first day we were there.  I had to go back for my checkbook which I had left in the car. Rather than allow me to just go to the car and get it, I had to wait for a valet to bring the car around.  Since another wedding was about to take place, there was a rush of cars and it took me over half an hour to get my car.  And then 10 seconds later I handed them the keys back and they had to go re-park it.Overall, if I had money burning a hole in my pocket I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.This hotel is A-Ok. There are many things about it that make it 5 stars and just as many making it a single star destination. The hotel is elegant, imposing, and bold. Beautifully situated in the heart of the downtown area. Location is among the best. Another pro is that there is a hotel bar and fun, live jazz music in the lobby at night. Hotel bars seem to be rare in St. Augustine. Great for meeting up before dinner.The hotel nickels and dimes a lot (e.g. $10 for wifi and $25 PER DAY valet parking). Finding an overnight parking spot downtown can be tricky so it's worth it, plus the valet staff is super attentive and quick. However, at the price you're paying for the hotel, it's simply insulting to charge guests for valet. The difference between great hotels and ordinary ones are often in the details. On the surface this hotel is 5-stars; take a look closer and you'll find it's lacking... here are some examples:- housekeeping forgot to put shampoo and conditioner in the room. I had to wash my hair with soap because it was too late. Already stepped in the shower and had to get ready.- the toilet continued to run and the seat kept shifting to the side. gross.- the pool was closed from 2pm-10pm for an event. we drove an hour to get to the hotel with the kids and they were so disappointed. the hotel did offer an alternative but it was 15 min away... a heads up would have been appreciated via mass email. - the pool is miniature! most hotels in the area do not have pools so it's better to have one than not. Just keep in mind that it's more like a 3ft deep plunge pool to cool off... not a ""swimming"" pool.- our family stayed in one of the suites. it smelled like mildew. glad it wasn't our room. i would have imagined that the suites would be nicer.The price is for location, very friendly staff, and an overall nice hotel. Next time I'll book sooner and stay at a B&amp;B or the Hilton (which are around the same price).Very pretty hotel, lovely rooms, bottle of house wine &amp; coffee maker in room, super clean, fluffy bathrobes, in-room safe, but wish the other guests could have used their ""inside"" voices at 2 am...continuing until after 3 am despite calls to the desk to intervene...doors into hallway need more insulation! Gold and platinum Marriott reward members get free Internet.Awesome! Stayed this past weekend and enjoyed white glove treatment for a Cinco De Mayo getaway with my fiance.  Very clean and comfortable room, friendly staff and high attention to detail.If you're looking for a great value for your dollar, I would recommend checking out the Casa.  Also, we had dinner at the 95 Cordova Chop House in the hotel and it was as good or better then the big name steakhouses .This is a great old-guard hotel in downtown St. Augustine.  The moorish decorations may not work for everybody, but I thought they worked.  Rooms were well laid-out, and the staff was helpful.  Parking was a pain, and valet parking was pretty expensive, but that was the primary drawback.  It's a landmark for a reason.Eeeck.... My fiance and I chose this location  banking on Kessler's reputation. We normally choose the Waldorf when we are looking to escape monotony.  We booked a premium room, when booking there was a picture of a soaking tub which I was really looking forward too. Upon arrival our room had a standup shower. This may have been my own mistake but still disappointing. We dined at the Cordova for dinner the first night, we were looking forward to a high end steak house. I ordered the filet mignon well done, being pregnant that was my only option. I normally choose a medium well. It took a very long time to actually get our meal, when I got it it was rare! Lol aka still moo-ing! I politely asked our server, who was as kind as can be to send it back for well done. My fiance had the lobster tail risotto dish which was wonderful. After getting my meal for a second time I cut into my steak and again in was rare. Being annoyed if asked to speak with the manager I explained that this was the second time sending my food back to the kitchen. He said "" would you like to give us a third try"" shocked that he was not remotely embarrassed, I said no and we went back to our room. Being our first night we were excited to jump into bed and enjoy a movie, the beds were not comfortable. The beds are of the same quality as the beat western or perhaps slightly inferior. I was again disappointed. The location was prime, my fiance enjoyed st. Augustine and all the shopping it had to offer. We decided to head back to our room for some lunch. We ordered in, when reviving our lunch we discovered that the kitchen had prepared a bacon avocado burger, forgetting to include the bacon or the avocado. Yet again another disappointment.We also realized upon arriving the spa advertised was not open for business yet.Synopsis:Unfortunately this hotel was very disappointing.  This beautifully decorated, opulent structure has no real place in the 4-5 star hotel chain selection. The location is prime, however it lacks  great service and luxuries amenities. I think they may need some reorganization in their management system. I would not expect this type of experience for $400 a night. I will not be visiting the hotel or the Kessler brand for our vacations.If you enjoy luxurious relaxing vacations I urge you not to have high hopes for Casa Monica.Gorgeous property, great staff. Ask about the ghosts...they say there aren't any, but I disagree! Fun stuff!The setting was nice, music was engaging acoustic classical guitarDuo, service was adequate, however the food quality was disappointing.Shrimp rubbery, oysters deteriorating, prime rib over cooked, the food layout confusing. The level of food quality and presentation is not in keeping with their Golden spoon award-status.We have been to St. Augustine many times over the years and had always wondered what it would be like to stay here. This time we did.  It is a very opulent hotel - some would say over the top -that has a lot of history behind it.  I won't bore you with the history at the moment.  Thing is though they have restored it to what it was originally meant to be, so yes, it is over the top and lush.Its not a cheap hotel, it is considered the best in St. Augustine.  There is no other parking or parking option other than valet - for $20, so keep that in mind.The room was large, very nice and although I have been in nicer rooms at lesser hotels here you are paying for the whole package.  You feel like royalty when you stay here.The front desk staff was beyond stellar, however we were promised a bell hop and never got one.  Since we have no problem carrying our own bags it wasn't a big deal.All in all you stay here for an experience, for the history, and the location cannot be beat. Its old but updated, beautiful and historic.This historical and unique hotel stands alone as a true gem in the heart of the historic district in St. Augustine. Just a few steps away from St. George street, its location is privileged. During our stay here we did not have to move the car at all, everything is reasonably close and the walks are really enjoyable. The Lobby is quite unique and we found the service to be fantastic. The rooms are quite comfortable, clean and modern despite the fact that hotel is quite a few years old. There is a myth out there about this hotel being haunted.... all I can say is- it may be haunted ....or maybe not....stay and find out for yourself, either way, you will not be disappointed.Overall the hotel is nice, lots of charm but theres lots of room for improvement especially for the ""Ritz"" price at nearly $300.00 per night.  The pool and bar drinks are also double the price of the surrounding bars. The Room Service same song different verse. The staff was really nice and professional. I would be very happy staying here if I was paying the price of a 3 Star hotel. Great location, walking distance to everything.My dear if only there was coffee available at five am there could be five stars!! Charming location and period furniture; visitors will be charmed. Valet n front desk exceptional n professional. We had a cocktail mixed just to taste by our able bartender. 4th floor room nice view n quiet. Walk straight down cordoba past Flagler uni to enjoy a stroll through pretty lanes jam packed w tasteful and absurd commerce! Kitschy and fun. Location seems perfect for this n you won't be disappointed. The coffee maker in the room sufficed but woke up partner trying to make a five o'clock cup. Bring room snack mine was a fiber one bar left in car... No vending machines or snacks at front desk to buy. Nada!  Starbucks yu were sooo close but not awake like I was......This is a beautiful hotel as far as the lobby and bar are concerned; however, for $400/night, it was definitely not worth the money.  I will stay at a B&amp;B next visit.","Not a great experience After being awakened at 4:26 am by naked people running around the pool areaMaking a lot of noise . I and my wife could not go back to sleep . Worst night ever . I found out later that it happens there all the time ( the college students break in often)I called the general manager and left a message . Four days later stillNo call back . Very bad manners . All we got offered was a cup of coffee and water . Didn't  Even get the wine that supposedly comes with the room .The general manager should be fired . I hate to be negative  but we paid full price for this room and it absolutely was not worth it. Sorry but the manager not retuning a call is not good practice or good etiquette .This is a beautiful hotel in the middle of historic St. Augustine!  We the only thing it doesn't have is a view!  We only stayed one night on our way to Southern Florida so for us it was perfect!  We were able to walk around the town and the front desk recommended a great breakfast place with a great view! (Mary's/Harbor View Cafe) Our room was really spacious, comfortable &amp; clean!  Would definitely stay there again!Casa Monica is the best hotel in St. Augustine. While $250 may be pricey in Florida coming from San Francisco that seemed reasonable for the best hotel in town. I loved the design of hotel and Spanish/Moorish architecture. I love the lobby and pool are and spent many nights by the hotel bar with friends. It is located conveniently near major attractions. I would definitely recommend it.The Casa Monica was perfect for our anniversary vacation.  We booked through the site (taking advantage of the FL resident deal) for cheaper than any ""deal"" sites.  The hotel is beautiful and truly felt like we were in another time completely.   The room was larger than expected and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Because it was our anniversary, champagne was delivered to our room upon arrival.  The hotel was also within walking distance of everything we visited in St. Augustine.  Overall, we had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back!Stayed here for 2 nights in honor of my mother's 50th birthday.  Hotel staff is excellent. They treat you with upmost respect. Valet services were great, they unload and load your luggage and bring it up to your room. Valet parking is $24 per night but the alternative is parking on street with the coin meters. Valet services were worth the fee and you can call for your car from the room before coming down. Hotel lobby is luxurious and has an art gallery to walk through. Small cafe is also available with Starbucks beverages. We stayed 4 in a regular room with 2 queens beds and it was very comfortable with a big bathroom. Will definitely book here again.For such an expensive and ""upscale"" hotel I expected better.  It was over-priced and I was very underwhelmed.  The water pressure in the shower was almost non-existent and when I called the front desk about it I was basically told to just deal with it.  The only parking available is valet and they charge $22 per vehicle per day.  If you need a fridge you have to pay extra for that too.  The pool is okay for wading as it is only 3 1/2 feet deep.  I really had high hopes for this place and was let down.  After a long day of exploring the city and swimming we came back to our room to a tv that is from the 1990s and a remote that did not work.  I was not impressed at all by this hotel and it goes to show that you do not always get what you pay for.Please do not think that I am cheap, we spent $1k staying here for 4 days and 3 nights.  I have spent much more than that at other hotels and have had the ""wow"" factor.  On my next trip to St. Augustine I may just elect to stay at a B &amp; B or better yet I will just stay at the Hilton in Jacksonville and drive down.First let me say Casa Monica is quite a beautiful property. Every attention to detail was met when they renovated it and turned it into a Kessler Property. I was very pleased with the aesthetics and cleanliness when we stayed there. St. Augustine is a nice little gem of a city and over the years, I only stayed at Bed &amp; Breakfasts. The mainstay that I always went to looked like it changed hands and wasn't as nice so for the first time, I tried for a larger hotel. I was impressed with the property overall however you paid for it. I did feel that the property was quite pricey. It was however St. Patrick's weekend as well as Bikeweek in Daytona with a lot of bikers spilling over there so that may have inflated the prices for the weekend. While it was too cold to use the pool, I fell in love with the area they created. Beautifully decorated, nice cabanas, bar service and very quiet out there. We ate at the restaurant one evening. It was a great meal, wonderful service from a server we had a lot in common with and a nice vibe, but it was really expensive. We spent around $200 or more and to me, it wasn't at that caliber. I don't mind paying for an incredible experience but it wasn't worth that in my opinion. The lobby bar however provided an incredible experience. We had artful cocktails and saw an incredibly talented husband and wife jazz duo playing flamenco jazz. They were such a treat for us. That definitely helped our experience. Would I stay there again? Yes.. but I would look for hotel promotions. Would I eat at the restaurant again? Probably not.I stay in hotels often and am always disappointed in something -- how housekeeping overlooks the little details, how the AC doesn't quite work, how loud the hallways are, how poorly the room is maintained, how worn the furnishings are, how the staff just doesn't quite seem to care.I now know that I DO NOT HAVE UNREASONABLE EXPECTATIONS, as Casa Monica   doesn't miss a single detail.  From the perfectly beautiful Spanish-style furnishings that were carefully dusted and polished, to the fact that they were appropriately sized for the room, to the lovely hand-written note left by housekeeping in appreciation of being left a tip -- Casa Monica will be the property by which I judge all others in the future.The staff at the front desk was always efficient, cheerful and helpful.  The staff in the restaurant and bar were equally impressive.  The restaurant does a wonderful job with breakfast and dinner, though I do have to say that the seating is rather uncomfortable.  The only other thing I have to zing them on is the lack of appropriate staffing in the StarBuck's on the premises, but I don't know if that falls under Casa Monica or Starbuck's themselves.  Being able to handle only one order at a time, the girl never even acknowledged the rest of the people patiently standing in line.  I just wanted to purchase a bottle of water, but she wouldn't ring me up while she already had her gloves off (from preparing food) ahead of anyone else who was ordering coffee or food she had to prepare.Our stay was provided by friends, but I asked at the desk how much the rooms are and was astounded to find out they were under $200/night. I hope to visit all Kessler properties in the future.  (We stayed the first week of April, 2013 and experienced nothing like the reviewer who stayed the prior month.)I stayed at the hotel - I did not eat in the restaurants or drink at the bar (shocker - I know). I love the look of this place and like other Kessler properties - they pick a theme and run with it. This place is supposed to be Moorish Glamorous as it would have been in its hay day at the turn of the century. It is a little bit like a shiny version of Disney's Tower of Terror hotel and the overall look works - consistent and stunning with attention to detail - especially in the lobby. Even the mirrors are ornate and in theme. The place just feels expensive and at the prices they charge per night (we paid $199 for a standard double) - you want it to be a little fancy. It is an older renovation - place went from hotel (late 1800s) to court offices, to vacant - to Kessler boutique hotel (renovated in the late 90s). I don't think there have been many upgrades since the original renovation - there are big old tube TVs in the room (I could care less), old phones, some dated fixtures, etc. Our room was not huge, but was very cozy and nice with a dark feel and plenty of storage. Typical of more expensive hotels - they nickle and dime every amenity because they assume it is going on some expense report. They had $5 bottles of Evian waiting for us and wanted to charge $11/day for Internet access (by the way - it is free in the coffee shop downstairs). I hate that - at the Marriott Fairfield Inn (Kessler is also a Marriott property) - it is a cheaper place to stay, just as clean, with free Internet and free breakfast, as a comparison. They also give you a cookie. I do not like the trend in more expensive hotels charging for more things - I called the Marriott customer service line (I am a rewards member) and managed to get my free Internet - turns out they have a password and user name at the ready for anyone who complains. Irritating. Also, be warned - it is $22/day to park, but I am OK with this as parking in St. Augustine is a commodity. The pool space is beautiful, rooms are elegant, needs some updating. Hate the nickle and dime stuff.Yesterday, I was in the bar area with a wedding party. My friend and I were trying to order food. Nobody came up to our table so I decided to walk up to the bar. I got the young male bartenders attention and politely asked if I could place an order or have someone sent to our table whenever he gets a chance (because I could see they were busy and overwhelmed). He then rolled his eyes at me and said he'd get to me when he could. A stranger next to me who saw the man roll his eyes at me, said out loud ""well that was extremely rude of him"". But I still continued to wait by the bar to order food because I was starving. He began taking everyone else's order around me except for mine, even though I was there before half the people at the bar. A man sitting at the bar next to me had seen how long I had been waiting and he flagged down the bartender to tell him to take my order. His response was again an even bigger eye roll and he rudely said he'd ""get to me when he could"". Needless to say, he was one of the rudest people I have ever met. I wish I got his name. I ended up going somewhere else.Lovely hotel, great service, central location.  Not cheap but the beds are super comfortable. Attentive staff. Downside - expensive valet parking and you have to pay for wifi in the rooms and it's not particularly high speed.  The hotel restaurant is beautiful and the food is quite good.The best hotel in St Augustine! Yes the parking is $22 per night and it isn't cheap but the service is 5 star and if your platinum with Marriott they will find every opportunity to upgrade you. We have stayed twice and both times we got a suite for the price of a standard room. The pool isn't good I will say that but the furniture and style make up for it. The only place I will stay when in St Augustine.The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the window!  Lindsay (I'm so sorry I think I am spelling your first name incorrectly, please forgive me!)  Made us feel very welcome and was the BEST first impression!  Fantastic.A beautiful (expensive) hotel, all first class, THANKS!Our stay at Casa Monica was luxurious and relaxing.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else in St. Augustine!  The beds are very comfortable, the showers are great and the service is top of the line.Lucky to stay her for our annual company meeting. I have been to St. Aug many times but never stayed here. Would highly recommend for the accomodations, location and ambiance. Staff was fantastic and all the meals we had in the hotel were great. Probably the one of the best venues we have had for our annual meeting.  Price is in line with what we expect in a big city but this is a better hotel and in my opinion a better deal for the money.We just had our wedding reception here and can't say enough about how great our experience was! Working with Linda and Courtney was easy and smooth. They were able to take what I envisioned and turn it into reality! Living in Chicago and planning a wedding in Florida was challenging, but they made it a smooth and as easy as possible experience! We also stayed there on our wedding night and the room and service was amazing!""The hotel to walk, stay and play around St. Auggie""Mar 23, 2012 traceme2kcIdeal place to stay when visiting St. Augustine. Walking distance orshort drive to many family fun attractions and adult suited fun too. If you're up for a good laugh and aren't easily offended, stop in at Trade Winds for down home music one evening. (No kiddos.) Or take in all the little locally owned boutiques close by. The pool is a quaint place. What's tops is they have a reciprocal deal with the private club on the beach, Seranata. There you can have your full of the beach with great service and food. They alao have an adult only pool area and loungers on the beach.. Just be sure to get your pass from the front desk before you go. It is a good 15 drive to go but worth it and there's a lot tosee on the drive in the way ofscenery. The only down on this hotel, and really, the only, is that the rooms are dim. Lights not bright enough. You will get the true essence of the coastal area with ease in access to area restaurants when this hotel is base. Goreguos views. Art in the hotel pretty enough to get you to stop and look every where you go. Gets hot and very humid during the day. Brig on the sun screen and a jacket for the evening dining. Don't miss the water side dinning! Experience the locals. Really liked the hotel for an all around good experience.My husband and I stayed here from 3/25 to 3/28. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Typical of Marriott Hotels such as these, parking is $22 per day (Valet is your only option) and wi-fi is not free. The first night we were here the firmness of the bed really hurt my hip joints, since I am a side sleeper. But after this night, I was fine. I guess I got used to it. I saw in other reviews that people didn't like the room sizes being on the smaller side and the walls to be thin. But I think it's important to remember that this is a historic building from 1888, and rooms of that time period were not as large or well insulated as people are used to today. Also, there is way to much to see and do in St. Augustine to be spending much time in the rooms anyways! I found our regular king bed room to be comfortable and spacious enough for the small amount of time we actually spent there, especially since much of that was sleeping! One of my annoyances with this location is that brunch was $30 per person, and we only learned of this price when we got the bill. Later we saw that the price was listed on a single piece of paper in our hotel room, but we wish the hotel would have been more up front with this, such as a sign or something near the restaurant. Yes, they had crab legs and other wonderful looking and good-tasting food, but by the time we filled up on our first plate we were too full to go back for more and so $30 was way too much for what we got. My other annoyance was the pool area. It is a nice spot once we found it, but there are no signs advertising where it was located. There were no towels available (luckily we brought our own), and my husband said it was ice cold. For the amount of money you pay to stay, why isn't it heated? For a change of temperature we went in the hot tub and that was so hot I felt ill after 5 minutes. I wanted to order a drink but there was no attendant available. When I was leaving I saw a sign on the wall that said to phone an attendant if you needed a drink or anything else. Who wants to get up and call for someone each time, especially while sunbathing? I think it would benefit the hotel to have someone out there at all times, and maybe even a little bar area. Overall I recommend a stay here, but skip the restaurants in the hotel and go exploring for other unique places such as the Cafe Alcazar across the street at the Lightner Museum.I mean, this place is nice, but it is freaking expensive, so it had better be.I frankly feel like they take advantage of the customer.  Be really careful here-- your room fee is not nearly what you'll actually be paying.Valet parking is $20, and I didn't see a reasonable alternative.  They don't let you just park yourself (that would be below them!).  When you check out, you find out there is another $20 ""resort fee.""  What is this for?  To give you access to a pool/beach resort in Ponte Vedra, like 20 minutes north of the hotel (oh and for ""wireless internet).  Why in the hell would they MAKE you pay for this, even if you don't use it (and why would you use it when there is a closer beach in St. Augustine?)  And why do they not just include it in the room fee, so as not to be deceptive?When I ordered breakfast in bed in the morning, I got the cheapest thing on the menu-- just one $9 waffle.  I was a bit annoyed when I got a call at 9:00 AM asking if I really only wanted one waffle, if I was sure I didn't want a drink or another waffle.  Wasn't hoping for the wake-up call.  Then my $9 waffle came, and the bill was like $16 before gratuities.  There was a service fee and a delivery fee.  They just charge you with fees every possible chance-- I found it insulting.The walls were thin, so we could hear everything the people next door were saying.My honest impression is that they are just in it to get as much money out of you as possible, and I find that offensive.  Though the place is nice, it could be nicer.  Like much of St. Augustine, it just reeks of inauthenticity.  They take advantage of the city's amazing history to act like you should open your wallet and puke money at them, but I just don't understand what Casa Monica offered in return.  If you're looking to unload some money haphazardly, have fun here.  If you're more rational and don't like being taken advantage of, stay at the Holiday Inn.  It was only slightly less enjoyable, and like 1/3 the price.This hotel is really nice.  We had a good time there with the rosicrucian group.  It is a beautiful clean hotel with good service.","['romantic', 'exotic', 'ideal', 'location', 'walk', 'shopping', 'eating', 'college', 'museum', 'view', 'park', 'window', 'drink', 'lobby', 'check',
