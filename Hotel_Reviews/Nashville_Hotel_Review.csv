http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-suites-brentwood-brentwood,Hilton Suites-Brentwood,4.0,$$,28,"Stayed here with a group of family members. Our room was spacious and well-equipped. Comfortable and clean in our room as well as common areas.Enjoyed sitting out by the pool with a few drinks that we were allowed to take out there. Sadly didn't get a chance to try the pool out but it looked clean and tidy.Breakfast was good, free parking and wifi. Would return if was in the area again, though it's a bit of a drive to downtown Nashville.This 4 story hotel that is of the interior atrium design is a nice hotel. I stayed here for 3 nights last week and enjoyed my stay. Check in was easy and courteous. The atrium is very nice with an inside restaurant and bar. My 2 room suite was very good and up to the standards I expect when staying at a Hilton Suites. Parking availability was adequate. I only ate breakfast one morning and the buffet was good and plentiful with several choices. They also have an indoor pool. There are also several restaurant options nearby.When I return to Nashville I will stay here again.This weekend may have been the best sleep I have ever received in a hotel! When you get 8 hours of sleep on a Friday night and 10 on a Saturday night, that's when you know you are relaxing. I didn't think I was tired or sleep deprived when I got to Nashville, so I'm blaming (more like complementing) my stay at this hotel. A standard room includes a living room area, bedroom, and big restroom. You've got an iron, hair dryer, microwave, fridge, and coffee maker. You never need to touch that coffee maker, however, because the first floor offers fresher coffee for you to enjoy. The hotel has a pool, fitness center, and pool table, and I took advantage of all of those. If you need to host an event or party, this is a great place to do it. They have several rooms available and your guests shouldn't have a hard time booking a room, since they've got so many. For those who love to have breakfast, lunch or dinner at the hotel, they have that option. Breakfast is not complimentary, so maybe you'll want to explore one of the many cute establishments in Brentwood, about a few blocks away. I truly enjoyed my stay here and wish my bed was just as comfortable.I have to say the only pain was making reservations since they talked my husband into signing up for their ""rewards"" program (which is a joke) but our stay and experience here was excellent. My husband and I have five kids between us and we thought this would be a fun way to be together and exchange presents for Christmas. We had two adjoining suites which was more than enough room for all of us between the beds and pull out sofas. We ate junk, watched Elf, and enjoyed the pool and hot tub downstairs. My stepson used the fitness room which he said was really good. We had the breakfast buffet and that was wonderful!! Definitely not the nasty continental breakfast you see at cheaper places. We had to go to the front desk because we were missing two breakfast vouchers bit that was quickly resolved. The servers were very sweet and attentive. I can see us wanting to make this a holiday tradition. We enjoyed our stay so much my husband and I came here for our honeymoon. We both said we have to make this place a getaway for us along with a holiday tradition with the kids. :) When we were on our honeymoon (we stayed three nights) we had to call the front desk for housekeeping because our room wasn't tended to even though we were gone all day. But they were quick to send someone up with fresh towels and such.The hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly. Rooms seem to have been recently updated and the decor is tasteful. The bathrooms are larger than most hotels I've stayed in. I had 2 nice flat screen televisions - one in the bedroom and one in the living room. Nice desk/workspace, but the wifi was spotty. I kept getting kicked off the network so I gave up trying. The shuttle service is unreliable, but it seems to be a problem with their scheduling software. They overlooked us two days in a row after we had pre-booked and confirmed our ride to meetings across town. Luckily, we were able to track down the drivers who then saw that we were, in fact, on the schedule. We ended up being late both times, but we made it there safely. Our driver on the way back to the hotel on the first day was excellent and even arranged for a cab to pick us up and take us to downtown Nashville. Aside from the schedule confusion, the experience was great. One suggestion, please have some sort of complimentary continental breakfast for your guests. $14 (plus tip) for a mediocre buffet is a little high.This is my second time staying at this hotel. The staff is extremely friendly and the room service food was really good. I love the gym and inside pool area, plus free wifi &amp; parking makes it all worth the stay. It's close to the interstate and downtown Nashville so that makes getting around really easy.They're currently doing renovations so it's been a little noisy but otherwise a great value whether you're on a business trip or a vacation with the family. I'll definitely be back.My husband and I worked with this hotel to get a block of rooms for guests staying in our town for our wedding last month. They were so nice to us each time we visited. The rooms are very spacious, perfect for several people to sleep in if they wanted to. I was able to get ready for my wedding in the same room that some of the guests stayed in, and everything went smoothly for me and my friends, who also got ready for the wedding in the room as well.I definitely recommend this hotel for anyone looking for accommodations for an event!We had no water for most of our stay. We were told that it was a water pressure problem in Brentwood and that it could not be helped. We later found out that this was not true and that it has happened several times during the past several months. It seems to be a unique problem to this hotel. We also had a fire alarm during the night that was a ""prank"" and we again heard that this also occurs quite frequently. There was never anyone at the front desk and the hotel seemed to be somewhat vacant. The rooms were not clean, nor did they clean our room during the day while we were out. I guess others had read the reviews on trip adviser before us. Do not stay here.Nice clean hotel. Room was great - spacious, clean and good layout. Bathroom was large. I didn't see any of the quality issues experienced by other reviewers. The hotel is currently being renovated. Only disappointment was we couldn't stay an additional night (last minute plans), but understandable seeing it was a last second request all of the rooms were booked. Didn't partake in the food, but it smelled good enough and $13 for a breakfast buffet is reasonable. Saw a pool table and bar. Looked nice, didn't get to use those either. Will definitely stay here again. Especially since I'm about to work near there. Will be a good transition residence. It is a little hard to find. Use GPS.very nice place. We had a good stay.  We arrived at the same time as a baseball team and we had to wait for a while to get an elevator.  we were also offered the opportunity to have snacks ready when we arrived. This was a nice touch.The first room I checked into had a bathroom that was disgusting. It had peeled paint in the shower, white goo all over the soap tray and the towels had brown marks on them. I went to the front desk and asked for a new room and the room was much better. Staff and hotel is very nice just a bad experience with the bathroom.  Being that the hotel was not at full occupancy, they could have checked people in to rooms that had upgraded bathrooms.Nothing bad to stay about this hotel. Spent 3 nights here for business mtg. Suites were spacious and clean. The hotel staff was friendly and professional. Wifi was free which is a true luxury these days and the BLT with avocado I ordered from room service was spot on. Would come back to this hotel over and over again.In my travels I always stay at Hilton properties, but I try my best to avoid full-service Hiltons and Doubletrees when possible. In most cases they are old, outdated and, while decent, just not for me. I like sparkly and new. This property may be older, but you'd never know it. Everything is updated and very nice, and the room service dinners are better than pretty much every other I've had (we're talking room service, so never great, but this one is a step up). I had a problem with my lock freezing on my door and had to switch rooms on my 2nd day, which was a pain in the ass but they handled it quickly and efficiently as someone could handle such a thing.The staff is very friendly and the price was low - $99/night for a king suite, which is well below my corporate maximum. I was skeptical based on the price (and also knowing I'd get less points than if I spent more), but it was more than worth it.Let me just say, I really do like the facilities.  The customer service...not so much...This place is clean, spacious, and well-decorated.  It was a lovely hotel, and one of the best rooms I have stayed in in a while.  We love to stay at Hilton/Hamptons.  They are really good, usually.  This trip was just...off :(The problem was, I was searching for a room for Friday/Saturday night.  We booked a double room (handicapped) because that's all that was left and we needed two beds.  THIS is where it gets bad.  We get there, and it's a gorgeous, clean suite (YAY!) but...there's one bed.  Where was my daughter supposed to sleep?So I call down to the front desk, and after a little bit of searching, she comes back on the phone and said that I must have made a mistake and booked a ""double BED room"" not a room with two beds.  I am 99% sure I didn't, but even if I did, they should make that WAY more clear on their website.  I never would have booked a handicapped room in the first place if I didn't think it came with two beds.She said that they could *try* and see if there was an extra roll-away bed somewhere.  Whatever, don't do me any favors.So the first night, THREE people slept in a full-sized bed.  Not comfy.  The second night, I volunteered to sleep on the couch.  Again, NOT comfy.  It sucked.  For paying well over $300 for two nights, and getting crappy customer service on top of not fulfilling our needs?  Yeah, no thanks...I am not sure I would ever stay here again.  I hear there is a fabulous Hilton right down the street I can check out.  Or maybe go with a different hotel chain altogether next time.  Hilton, you have let me down :(I stayed here the night before my wedding thanks to my awesome bestman, and this was also the hotel our guests for the wedding stayed at. Overall it is a very nice hotel and the rooms are extremely spacious. So much so they would be a con goer's dream. Sadly their event space is not big enough to support large conventions. That being said it was an amazing bargain and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for guest accommodations for an event.Newly remodeled. Stop by the bar and if Mark is working tell him Ron and Angie from Cicero Il sent you. Mark makes you feel very welcome. Mark recommended an Irish restaurant in Franklin and it was great!Love the new LG televisions, and the staff is excellent. Wifi is very reliable. Temperature was perfect.This gorgeous hotel is located on a hill in the suburbs of Nashville.  The view is spectacular.  The hotel suites are large, clean, modern and well appointed .  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Ample parking is available.  Several shops and restaurants within short driving distance.  Fantastic option for a romantic getaway.Higher end business hotel. Room and spacious and central located. Just minutes away from Nashville, depending on traffic. Clean environment and well kept. The staff is friendly and attentive to your needs.  They have a fridge and micro wave in the rooms and a huge bathroom.We stopped here for a night on our way to Florida. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the hotel considering the low price ($120 for a king suite).  The room was recently renovated, well appointed, clean and spacious. Ample room for us and our three children (one in a pack n play). Super comfortable beds and great water pressure.The worst possible Hilton you can stay at. The rooms are worn out. There is paint coming off. The staff here is the worst I have ever encountered. It's just huge nothing else. I would give it a negative rating if it was allowed.","The rigamarole of check-in is incredibly unaccommodating for guests in multiple parties. Even though we were part of a group of rooms purchased under one family member, despite having proof of ID and the family member having purchased the rooms already having shown proof of payment, we were unable to sufficiently prove our identity, despite providing a confirmation code, and this were made to wait in the lobby for the ticket purchaser to make their way across the city to allow us entrance to the room. I understand methodical verification, honestly. But to sit and watch a couple sit awkwardly in the lobby for half an hour, bags in tote, waiting on someone to arrive with a credit card that has already been charged is poor form and counter intuitive.Part of customer service is, in my opinion, requires one to ignore the rigidity of protocol every once in awhile when it presents an unnecessary and illogical frustration for the guests and patrons.It was very clean, lovely,  had lots of space and comfortable. The customer service was good too. I had a broken iron and it was replaced in less than 2 minutes after I called to complain. I had a bourbon cocktail at the bar that costs only $5.50!!! There was free parking and free wi-fi too. I definitely recommend and will return to stay.Can not understand the poor reviews this is a very nice hotel clean great staff this is my second stay this month I travel quite a bit for business and this is a notch above what I expectNice place for the money and location. Lots of kid noise at times. Pool is small. Wireless is unreliable.This is a gem of a hotel. A home away from home. Clean and comfortable, great service and a good price. Make sure to stop and se Mark the bartender, he is a great guy and a pleasure to deal with!It's really a nice hotel, great amenities at a great price.  The breakfast buffet is expansive and quite good, but half a point lost for having tube TVs (blasphemy in this HD age!) and another half a point off for not telling me about the graveyards surrounding the property!It's in a great location, but it's not all that it's hyped to be.  The A/C in the room was horrible, it never really cooled down.  Let kids run up and down the halls.  Didn't use the pool because it was literally full of kids.  The staff was great, but not very knowledgeable.  Lighting was also an issue.  It was very dark in the bedroom and bathroom.  The shower was small and mine leaked water from the shower head.Great place to stay if you're in the Brentwood area. It is conveniently located close to everything you could need. They offer fast dry cleaning services. The place was nice and clean. It is a bit far from the entertainment of downtown Nashville, but that is not what I was there for on this trip.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/knights-inn-nashville-downtown-nashville,Knights Inn Nashville Downtown,2.0,$,37,"Stayed here for 5 nightsMixed review here:Pros: Cheap, Quiet, Free Breakfast (7-9) and Wi-Fi, a mile from Broadway.Cons: Bedboard was broken (couldn't sleep on left side without falling off), phantom noises from the plumbing at all hours of the day/night, a piece from the drain of the shower has been sitting on the tub for the duration of my stay (didn't effect showering though), random times for housekeeping, the walk to Broadway is sketchy (especially at night), and it's kinda in the middle of nowhere without much to do within a mile.Bottom line, this is a budget hotel. If you don't want to spend a fortune, this place isn't half bad. Feels completely safe within walls and on Broadway, but the between is pretty sketchy day or night. I would recommend getting an Uber/Lyft/Taxi, about $5 ride to Broadway or back.We booked this room because it was convenient to downtown, under $100, and offered a safe place to sleep and shower for the night. I had few expectations, which is probably a good thing.Pros:-Not too expensive-Conveniently located-friendly staff-The WIFI was free and good enough to let me stream Netflix (which is great because TV reception was piss poor)-police stationed in the parking lot (probably a good thing, given the area)Cons:-The lobby smelled awful. I couldn't wait to get out. -The room smelled strange- like a clean diaper-There was a strange brown stain on the top blanket. We just removed it- there were no problems with the other blankets or sheets.-The area is really sketchy.-The walls are very thin- I was awakened multiple times throughout the night by the sound of arguing and yelling, and once by the unmistakable sound of sexual intimacy.For one night it was fine, but if I were staying in Nashville for 2+ nights, I'd probably look elsewhere.Good value for money! Our room was clean, quiet and no disturbances. The swimming pool was also clean, and a great relief to have in this heat!Staff was kind to us, helpful and friendly. Greet them with a smile!Breakfast was not very good, when we arrived five minutes before nine there was nothing left. However, you are able to make your own waffles!Where do I even begin...Check in for our 4 night stay was smooth... Until we got to our room. We noticed a very peculiar smell in the air. Checked out the air conditioning unit and found copious mold spores which can be found in the picture attached to this review. Went to front desk and showed the attendant the mold. Didn't say a word, just gave a blank stare and begrudgingly gave us a different room... Except...We got to the second room, which looked nice at first... only to lift the lid of the toilet to find some sort of stain from a bodily fluid of sorts. Source: unknown. Went back to the front desk and informed the attendant once again of an issue, and we reasonably asked that someone clean it. He responded by telling me that he's never heard someone complain so much in their life. He also proceeded to tell me that he had just placed another couple in our original moldy room and that they had no complaints. Great customer service response right there. The only positive note was a very nice security guard named Jesse. He not only went to find supplies and cleaned the toilet, which was not his job, but gave recommendations of restaurants and bars to go to. Once we got all that sorted out, it was alright. Cheap cab ride into the city, which was our priority, and the only reason this review receives 2 stars instead of 1. However, looking back, we would definitely pay the extra $$ to stay in the city somewhere with a hotel that does not cut corners on cleanliness and hygiene. We will NOT be staying here again.The area is grim, but it's walking distance to Broadway. The hotel itself is fine but really needs a coat of paint and a bit of a sprucing up because from the outside and afar it really looks very grim and depressing. It's not an incredible hotel but the rooms are not bad. There's a sad breakfast you can get as well. The prices are high for what it is, I was surprised how much it cost, but being downtown Nashville there aren't many options. It's okay and if there's nothing else in the area, it's fine but it's not the best of the line, obviously.This place looked abandoned from the road and the neighborhood was sketchy; we were glad we could drive anywhere we needed to go. WiFi was fine, room was clean enough, bed frame on one bed was unstable but workable for one night. We missed the 6-9am free breakfast because the desk clerk hadn't told us the breakfast hours during check-in. We chose this motel partially due to its proximity to Broadway, and it was close, but it was a drive through an industrial area. We would not stay again if we were passing through Nashville. And it did also smell a little weird.DO NOT STAY HERE!!  You know when you're looking for a cheap hotel and you just hope you don't sacrifice everything for price? That's that happens when you book here.  Say goodbye to any sense of self worth you had when you pulled into the parking lot. This place is the slums. To me it looks like former section 8 housing ""converted"" to a ""hotel"". Walk in room and do our inspect..  dirt all over the place, clearly not thoroughly cleaned. Bathroom has been flooded more than a few times as the tiles were coming apart and smelled awful. The A/C did NOT work and the fan smelled like mold. The floor is sticky, there is fluids all over the walls, the tv reception is bad, there are people pissing outside your door, and here is the best part.. tried calling the office at least 5 different times and NO ANSWER!   NoNE! This has never happened to me..  based on other reviews, I'm sure this is the managers way of avoiding issues. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money and go elsewhere! Or plan to be taken advantage of.. $85 is simply too much to pay for this kind of experience.You get what you pay for at the Knight's Inn. Yes the room smelled weird, yes the carpet and furniture weren't in the best condition, yes the service at the hotel/motel was bad. But what can you expect when you're paying $70-$100 a night at this location. I didn't spend too much time in the room besides power napping from 3 AM till 8 AM and mixing up whiskey and cokes. If you're coming to Nashville you probably shouldn't be spending too much time in your anyway whether it's the Sheraton downtown or here you should be enjoying the atmosphere downtown, chowing on some BBQ and southern goodness, and drinking a few brews.This location could use a renovation but for the price and location not to mention $6 lift downtown it's hard to beat.Do NOT stay here. The Indian manager kicked us out at 5am l. no warning, no second  chances he just called the police straight away and we had to go.  They take your money then kick you to da curbPROS: $7 cab ride to downtown NashvilleCONS: Heavily soiled carpet, extremely strong odor of mold/mildew, dirty sheets and pillow cases, towels half the size of any normal shower towel, toilet leak with standing water in the bathroom, old worn garage sale looking furniture, fridge and microbe sitting on floor, no iron or ironing board in room, two light bulbs were burned out, and of all the wall plugs, only one was tight enough to hold my cell phone charger.Quick review:This hotel should be shut down. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. Dead serious! The hotel lobby smells like a dog grooming building. Just a funky/dirty smell. The attendant behind the counter was very brash. But, whatever...I just wanted my key so I could shower and head out on the town.I open the door to my room and BOOM, the smell of mold/mildew smacked me right in the face. It. Was. Strong! But again, I just wanted a place to shower and lay my head down for a few hours after a night downtown. I walk in, and immediately notice the dark soiled carpet. It felt and looked like you'd expect a carpet in an auto repair shop. Just filthy. I pulled the comforter off (like I do in every hotel) and checked out the sheets. Both pillow cases had hair on them, and one still had some odd colored stain on it. Clearly these sheets hadn't been washed after the last guest. I immediately called the front desk and asked if he could have someone bring some clean sheets up. His reply was ""no, you can come get them yourself."" What?! Seriously? So I walk to the front desk and he reaches down below the desk area and hands me some sheets. I took a quick look at them and noticed a bunch of dust on them like they'd been sitting on a dirty shelf for a while. I then asked for a couple extra pillow cases, and he walked away into the back office (if that's what you would call it) and grabbed two more from behind the door. I went back to the room, walked into the bathroom that had standing water all over the floor. I dried it up using a towel and finally saw that it was coming from the toilet. Their best attempt at fixing it was a ton of caulk. Anyway...I could go on and on about this place being my worst hotel experience, by far, of my entire life. My nine month deployment sleeping in a tent was more pleasant than this.Hotels are tough to review... That being said, this place fulfilled our two requirements: cheap and a short cab ride to downtown. You get what you pay for and $40 will get you a bed to sleep in, as opposed to the $100+ places you'll find downtown. There was a bit of confusion due to the incredibly rude/quiet-talker that was working at the front desk. We called on our way to ask about a AAA discount and even after asking him to speak up, he was barely audible. We decided that this would still be the cheapest/most convenient place to stay, so we went anyway. When we arrived, the incredibly rude/quiet-talker said that they could not offer us the price I thought I heard on the phone or the price online. He was incredibly unhelpful and we were becoming increasing frustrated. About to take our business elsewhere, the manager came out and took great care of us. He explained that the room were cheaper if you booked in advance online, but because of the confusion, he gave us the room for the discounted rate. He was extremely friendly, apologized for the confusion and we could tell that he genuinely cared about having our business.The room was clean and just what we needed after spending the evening checking out the town. The cab was about 5 or 6 dollars and arrived in no time. If you want to see Nashville and you're on a budget, the savings are worth it to stay a little bit out of town.DO NOT STAY HERE! This place is a total dump and that is not the worst part of my disturbing stay here. Booked this place for myself and 2 friends for 3 nights. Upon checking in, they asked for total payment of all nights. Should have known then what a scam we were getting into. Didn't pay the total upfront since no other decent hotel in history has ever had a similar policy.  We were woken up at 2:30am by the lunatic night manager screaming that we needed to pay him. Told him we would pay in the am since it was the middle of the night and was pouring rain outside and you have to walk outside to get to the front desk. Plus he already had my credit card to run on file so I asked him to simply run it. He would not. Then comes banging on our door, jars it with his foot and literally scared the shit out of us 3 girls who were in bed. Threatens to call the cops because we were ""disrespectful and refused to pay"". As a female in a city I have never been to this was a very disturbing experience. He proceeded to call the cops and evict us from the room. At 3am. In the pouring rain. During an NRA conversion weekend and almost all hotels booked up in the city. The cops were sympathetic towards us but said ""there was nothing they could do"" and would drive us to whatever hotel we could find. At 3am. In the pouring rain. Cops said this was not the first time this lunatic, non-professional, aggressive and clearly deranged night manager had pulled this same stunt with other customers. Will be blowing up social media, BBB and the owner of the hotel incessantly with my experience and to fight the 1st nights fee the night manager already charged to my cc. This place sucks. You should literally stay anywhere else then here. I had to give 1 star in order to post this warning- but they deserve zero stars.Shit hole. Charged us for 2 queens and got 2 doubles. There is s power strip on the floor! The mini fridge wasn't even plugged in. Fuck this indian shit hole. I'll be checking into the Hilton just cause of this bullshit room! DO NOT COME HERE! Plus I saw some pimps outside our room.I don't even want to waste my time reviewing this overpriced smelly motel but here is my quick feedback. The guy at the front desk was nice enough and personable. The room itself was smelly, the bathroom flooded because the shower curtain didn't function, the carpets were disgusting and the beds have bed-bugs because I'm now covered in bites all over my arms. The access to Bridgestone and Titans Stadium is decent enough, but maybe bring your own sleeping bags...Absolutely HORRIFIC customer service. Do not stay here. There is a Clarion next door. The gentlemen behind the desk was rude and off putting from the moment I checked in. Aside from a non draining tub and stains on the sheets and towels, when we called the front desk no one answered. Went down to address the issue, and the man said he ignored our call because he was speaking with a customer, and that we were passed our ""30 minute"" check in where I suppose you're allowed to make complaints(?). He tried calling the woman who cleaned our room, and when she didn't answer he walked us around the property (we presumed he was going to address the problem)... But he took us to find her. When he did, he reprimanded her in front of us, asked why she didn't answer her phone (she was working???), listed the complaints about our room to her... In front of my party and other mortified guests. We asked him to please stop because we were so uncomfortable with the situation. He asked why because it was her fault. When we apologized to the house keeper he turned and walked away, ignoring us when we asked why he was walking away from his customers. He turned and said he didn't want to deal with us. He also refused us any refunds or apologies. I have traveled across the country and around the world and I have never encountered such horrible customer service. If he had simply addressed the problems and not had such an accusatory demeanor, we wouldn't have minded.Thankfully when we called cooperate, they were receptive and profusely apologized for him. They intended to investigate the property, and while they cannot guarantee a refund (yes I was charged for the full nights stay leaving 40 min after we got there), to hopefully prevent this from happening to anyone in the future.Do. Not. Stay. Here.If you're looking for cheap, near downtown and clean, this is your place. The cost was around $40. There is a mini fridge and microwave, and flat screen TV. There is no coffee pot, but there is a gas station around the corner. Can fare to downtown is about $5.Great bargin if youre lookijg to be near the parties and stay cheap. Hotel is an 8 dollar cab ride from downtown and a little less than a mile walk. We used hotwire to book and we were pleasantly surprised. Rooms were clean and came with a microwave and fridge. Out tv didnt work but for this trip we didnt care. We didnt make it to breakfast because it goes from 6 to 9. Air conditioned worked great and the pool was nice. Would recommend bringing your own shampoo and conditioner though theirs is the super cheap stuff. Would totally stay again!Cheap and really close to downtown by car--that's it. If that's all you need to be happy, then you're all set! Don't expect anything more or you will be sorely disappointed. A convenient place to lay down your head with money left over to blow around town.I have definitely experienced better, but we were able to walk downtown and get a cab back cheaply. The breakfast was better than expected, the parking was plenty. It is a motel. The comforters had cigarette stains and there weren't enough towels. I also tried to tell the woman cleaning that she didn't have to change the sheets and she didn't speak English (my failed attempt at being green).Please do not stay here. We got to our room and immediately left and got another room at a different hotel - I've never had to do this before. The only good reviews on here are suspicious, as if written by the employees themselves. When we got to our room there were people who clearly had been living out of their rooms for some time. The fron desk tried to get us to double pay for the room - be aware of this, they have down this to others as well. The room it self was awful, stains on the sheets and one bed was broken. If you stay here please be safe. To be honest I would feel better sleeping in my car in a better part of town.","3:00 am - Stroll in to meet the rudest human being at a front desk I've ever had the pleasure to encounter.3:01 am - Get keys to a room with no idea how to get there. Asking directions was treated with a strange eye roll and ""eh"". I guess it's time to wing it.3:06 am - Drunkenly staggering around the property trying to figure out how to get in. Find a Gate that is climbable. I perform a move that should have been filmed for try outs on American Gladiators and land impressively on the other side.3:07 am - My friend stabs his chest on the Gate and will complain about this for at least the next two months.3:09 am - Pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the room and overall layout for $45. Even in my extremely inebriated state I can appreciate a good value on my dollar. 3:30 am - Fall asleep on the floor because I don't want to sleep in the one bed with my friend and the couch is too small. Used scratchy comforter for warmth, not impressed.10:04 am - WHAT IS ALL THAT NOISE OUTSIDE THE ROOM?!10:05 am - Friend goes to investigate10:10 am - Friend comes back and tells me to look out the Window.10:11 am - Find out the motel is completely flooded and everyone in the first floor has taken shelter on the second floor where we are located.10:30 am - We decide we are leaving hotel by foot. Use the plastic bags they put the coffee cups in to wrap our electronics and stop them from getting wet in the rain and or death water.10:32 am - Entrance/Exit to the motel rooms is flooded. Gate that was hopped last night could be unlocked to let people out of the motel but the staff will not unlock it. Maintenance guy is walking around lost on the other side of the flood waters.10:33 am - Not fearing, polluted, diseased water, I walk through it to the lobby to complain. Friend decides he's going to risk impaling himself again and chooses the Gate route.10:36 am - I enter lobby to find that the office manager walked away from someone while they were in mid-sentence and has locked himself in the office unsure of what to do about the flood waters.10:38 am - I talk to a few guests in the lobby about their ruined cars in the parking lot that are now under water and decide I don't care and can't wait to leave.10:40 am - Friend doesn't accidentally mutilate himself on Hell's Gate; comes to the lobby and we start walking back downtown to Nashville.9 Months Later - Was never charged for the room. The only decent part of service in the whole thing.Staff is very rude! I was in town the same day there was a few conventions so pretty much everything was booked. I rented a smoke free room that smelled like stale cigarettes. Being severely allergic to cigarettes I'm very sensitive to it. No big deal I went and purchased fabreeze. I come back in the evening and I stared coughing uncontrollably couldn't breathe and my eyes were killing me. I went down the hall to get a pop and the machine wasn't working which annoyed me even more. I call office and the front desk was extremely rude and said nothing was open but 20 miles away. Unfortunately in the rush I forgot to pack my allergy medication. I asked the front desk if this room if smoking free he said yes but people can smoke outside the balcony. So what's the point of smoke free if it comes through the vent. Maybe the should advertise smoke free with an occasional second hand smoke that come through the vents. I had to sleep with the a/c off so I didn't smell the chain smoke (who happen to be right next door) cigarettes smoke. Maybe they should have, no smoking 30 feet away from the building or a smoke free area They do have security guards outside so that made it safer.So I never even made it out of my car to checkin.  I decided to book this because of the awesome price and location based strictly off of the reviews.  However once I drove up and got eyes on the place I realized I had made a terrible mistake.  Unless u and whoever you're staying with has concealed carry licenses and are in fact strapped I wouldn't get out of my car.  Trust me I've stayed in some shady places to try and be cheap and get the ""steal/discount"".  This place is so ghetto and unsafe I wouldn't stay there if they told me it was free.  Luckily they do have nice staff because after calling the <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> sales associate, who then called the hotel, they agreed to refund me fully.  Just spend the extra 75$ and stay somewhere close to broadway and fun/safe.  Holiday Inn Express has been awesome and within walking distance down Broadway.Horrible!!!!! Dirty and ghetto!!!!! Found pubic hair in the sheets and WARNING : there is bed bugs!!!!!!!! A lot of shady activity happening around this place!There was hair on our pillows. Yuck!!!The only good thing about this place was the price.  When I checked in, the guy at the front desk acted as if it was an inconvenience that I was going to be a guest there.  I stood there as he told me to wait a minute as I watched him organize some papers, clean the counter off, organize some more papers, then finally hand me a paper and said, ""fill this out.""  Wow, wish I could have been filling that out instead of just watching him take care of his daily routine.  He did not seem knowledgeable about anything.    The room was clean but smelled like smoke even though it was a nonsmoking room.  The area was not somewhere you want to hang out after dark.  After spending a night out I took  taxi back and was dropped off out front.  The problem is that all the rooms are around the block and not connected to the front office.  By the time I get halfway to my room this guy appears out of nowhere and starts following me, walking quickly.  He was clearly not a guest.  I made it to my room and he broke off pursuit.    The area is definitely not safe at night but the price is right for being a mile from downtown Nashville.  Makes for a cheap taxi, next time I'll have him drop me at the door.Clean but dated is a good description of the rooms.  It  had a very odd assortment of people staying here.  My view was the city skyline but within the same view, a truck storage area with random abandoned furniture. We stayed here at the last minute because everything was booked or double the price.  I would not stay here again and rather pay more.  My bed was comfortable but it had a wooden protrusion where I kept knocking my shin.  Annoying.I walked in the breakfast room and came immediately back out because it was gloomy and lacked anything I wanted to eat.I stayed here on 11/23 &amp; 11/24. Reading other peoples reviews made me expect the worst but I was on a tight budget and this was the cheapest I could find close to the Bridgestone. The area is not the greatest but it was too cold to walk anywhere anyway so I didn't feel like I was in danger of being mugged or anything. The room was much cleaner than I expected. It was a non-smoking room and it actually did not smell like smoke like a lot of cheaper hotels do. I checked for bugs (bed and otherwise) and no traces of them. The bathroom was immaculately clean which really surprised me. I'm a sticker on that. The only weird thing was that when I pulled my tucked sheets out, an Advil pill was in my bedding. The sheets were clean so maybe it fell out of the pocket of the maid? Anyway, no biggie. The ""continental breakfast"" was a joke so plan on eating out. Waffles and bread for toast but no butter and pre-peeled boiled eggs. Ummmm, I don't want anybody touching my eggs. The coffee was o.k. Yes the hotel needs a lot of updates and softer pillows but you get what you pay for.The outside of the building is above average but the room itself is pretty decent for $45. You wont find the best family friendly crowds out here but the location is only a mile away from downtown. What I was surprised to find was the EXTREMELY fast wifi. 23-25 Mbps of Wifi for the 2nd and 3rd floor. Haven't seen too many cheap hotels with that kind of wifi signal in most rooms. Have to give them a thumbs up for the wifi achievementHonestly I booked this hotel because it was one of the cheapest on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> but it was a great place to stay. Budget friendly but not a sketchy place to stay at all. The room was clean and modern, the bed was comfortable. Easy check in, even late at night. Felt safe and it's close to downtown.DO NOT STAY HERE! Splurge a little and stay closer to downtown in a much cleaner and safer hotel. I had planned on staying here two nights with my girlfriend but once I saw the area, the parking lot and the room we found another hotel. Its in a bad part of town, NOT within walking distance of downtown. I booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> so when I went to check-out they said I had to go through them. So I called <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> and they called the Knights Inn and for confirmation that I checked out and the staff at Knights Inn said I was still checked in.  We were already out of Nashville by the time I knew this and it wasnt worth our time to drive back to argue with the staff at Knights Inn to try and get my money back. All in all I paid for two nights and didn't stay there more than 5 minutes.  The staff isn't too bad, friendly to a point but the rooms aren't kept up and ours  reeked of cleaning chemicals. Also, word of the wise...dont book through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>.Cheap hotel. What do you expect at this price? The Hyatt? Not terrible, decently clean, short cab ride to downtown. If looking for cheap and reasonable close to downtown by cab I'd recommend.Cheap place. Close to downtown. It's a no frills place but good enough for a couple of nights.OK, so I guess my expectation of a hotel for less than $50/night that is within walking distance to LP field and short cab ride to downtown isn't too high compared to others.  Yes, the restaurant is closed, yes the people around were kind of sketchy, yes the front desk staff wasn't all that friendly, but for $50 we got a decent, clean room, with a good shower, and the TV worked.  The furniture even seemed to be pretty new.  I don't know about the other rooms, but room 101 was fine.BED BUGS ALERT. I stayed at this hotel last week and developed a terrible case of bed bugs. The staff appeared unsurprised about the infestation, and I have little hope that it was dealt with-- DO NOT STAY HERE!I would give this motel 2 stars for quality/amenities, but am adding the third star because of its location/overall value.  Staff were decent but not overly-friendly.  The floor wasn't very clean, but otherwise we got decent housekeeping daily.  Lots of hot water in shower and sink, and it wasn't over-softened as in some places).  Beds were ok but had some spots where the mattress springs were worn out.  It is an older building, and you have to go outdoors to get to the front desk, etc. but I would consider that more a mark of when it was built than its quality.  There was a microwave and fridge, and a decent TV.  Wi-fi was really slow to connect, with no apparent reason. There was a continental breakfast but we skipped it one morning and the other morning didn't get there in time (it ends at 9).  I didn't feel unsafe or bothered by other guests (no noises from the next room, etc.).  The main problem in our room was with the shower - curtain didn't prevent water from getting out of the shower, so water pooled significantly on the floor, and there was some ""give"" under the tub at that end of the room, so water damage is a possibility (but I didn't fall through so it didn't bother me!).  It is in an industrial neighborhood right on a highway, but only a mile from downtown.  Very walkable during daylight hours, and I never felt unsafe, but I wouldn't recommend it at night (though it's a cheap cab ride back).  That said, if I had stayed out by the airport I definitely wouldn't have been able to walk down there, and I wasn't willing to pay 3 times more just to stay a little closer, across the bridge.  I grew up in a city so it just seemed ""urban"" to me; it is definitely not the ""ghetto"" that I have seen in some reviews but if you are not familiar with urban areas you may be uncomfortable.  If you want to be near downtown and plan to spend most of your time enjoying what the city has to offer, this place will be fine, but if you want to hang out in the hotel playing on the internet,

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-by-hilton-nashville-vanderbilt-nashville-3,Homewood Suites by Hilton Nashville Vanderbilt,4.5,$$,38,"The staff is so sweet and just always smiling!! That says a lot! Location is Great but I recommend preparing to just use their valet service at $28 a night! Extra touches in the room were so nice.... Love that there was a ceiling fan! I will be booking with this chain again!Location: conveniently located to many places to eat that are walking distance. A 24hour rite aid, the Vanderbilt university and the centinnel park. About 5-10mins away from downtown. Def pick this place if you want to avoid the noise of downtown.There's a free shuttle (don't forget to tip!) and free breakfast. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was so spacious and the bed is very comfortable. Parking is a bit pricey. The only con was that you can easily hear everything happening in the hallways from your room. I was awaken at 6am to a family talking very loudly. Unfortunately, my room was near the laundry room and I could hear the workers taking very loudly to each other. It made for an unpleasant morning. Other than that, I think this is a wonderful place to stay but try to avoid the room near the elevator/laundry room.WOW this hotel is awesome. I love the fact that all the rooms are suites and quite honestly they might be bigger than the apartment I live in. The public areas are expansive and modern. The rooms themselves are well furnished with a desk, couch, ottoman, extra chairs, full sized fridge, stove, the list goes on. The bathroom is spacious and the neutrogena bath products are a nice touch. Pretty much any time a hotel gives body wash instead of bar soup I'm a happy guy. You get both here (woo!!).The location for this place is great as there are tons of food joints around and you are very close to Vanderbilt.I would definitely stay here again if the opportunity presents itself!Great suites.  We stayed in a room with two rooms and 2 baths (1 King, 2 queens, a pull out bed in the living room).  Pull out couch mattress was surprisingly comfy.  The room had a little kitchen with a full size fridge and microwave, etc.It's basically on the Vanderbilt campus and about 10 min drive to downtown. There's also I think a Rite Aid and liquor store nearby.They offer free shuttle service to downtown but not the airport.  They have luggage storage as well. Continental breakfast has good waffles.  They try to offer a variety like it would be a different bread/pastry, egg, meat (either sausage or bacon), potato on different days.I just don't know where the loud party/ dance music was coming from on our first night there. Good thing I had ear plugs.One of the best places to stay in Nashville. Hotel is new and modern and staff is so friendly! Suites are great with full kitchen, fridge. Bed is so comfy! Mon-Thursday they serve dinner complete with beer and wine. Breakfast is always hot and delicious too. This hotel is located across the street from Vandy campus. And a short drive to Belmont. Main disadvantage is the $25 fee for parking (self; valet for $28) per day. But your car is in a protected underground parking garage. Best things: location, staff, free food and drinks, extremely clean and comfortable rooms.Right across the street from Vanderbilt itself!When you stay near a college, you are bound to be in a lively area.Close to numerous bars and restaurants (walking distance) and not even 10 minutes from the heart of Nashville.The hotel staff was amazing. Especially the valet boys. Remembered our names and always had a smile on their faces.The check in was a breeze.We stayed in a suite. Super spacious. Separate living and sleeping area.Kitchen area had a stove, full fridge, and dishwasher with plenty of dishware.(All stainless steel appliances too)The room was spotless.The shower didn't even gross me out. Nice white/clean tub.1 TV in each room as well which gave me a break from ESPN that is constantly on everywhere we go.The breakfast wasn't your typical ""continental breakfast"".They had cereal, oatmeal, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, toast, bagels, yogurt, fruit and even a waffle maker!I loved everything about this hotel. And when I'm back in Nashville, i'll definitely  stay here again! Close and convenient to everything!Hands down 5 stars mostly thanks to the shuttle drivers/supervisors. Logan, Keith, Michael, Rich, Olman, and Matthew were great and handled our 6 girl party awesomely. Made some good recommendations to pick up supplies and places to try. The front desk staff Armani, Denzil, and Chelsea, were also great they even ordered our pizza for us! Great service overall, clean rooms, and the breakfast buffet plus the happy hour during week were perfect for us girls. Had a smashing time in Nashville and the staff played a big part. Hotel was worth every penny for the service alone.This was hands-down the nicest hotel we stayed in during our two-week road trip. It is a newer hotel in a fantastic location. It is across the street from Vanderbilt University and just a couple blocks (a short walk) from Centennial Park and the Parthenon. We checked in late so we didn't get to take advantage of many of the hotel facilities but we did have their breakfast in the morning, which was really good. The only problem was that it was very crowded. We had a bit of a line to go through the breakfast area, but it was OK. Once we had our food we had trouble finding a table. There was plenty of seating, but many of the larger tables were occupied by just one or two people. The only place we could find to sit all together was on the couches, which isn't really the best for eating. I hate it when hotels charge for parking but we avoided the fee and found street parking on the street right behind the hotel. The woman at the desk advised me that Nashville can be strict about ticketing and towing but that spot was fine, and really convenient. We left the car there overnight with no issues.A little pricey, but another great example of Hilton quality. We were in Nashville for the Rifftrax - Sharknado 2 live show. I wanted something near the Belcourt  theater. We had a very clean, well-appointed spacious 2 room, 2 bed suite. We didn't use The kitchen,  but it was clean and well-stocked. The beds were incredibly comfortable; if it weren't for Rifftrax, we would have stayed in bed the whole time!The entire staff was friendly and attentive...the Hilton treatment is the best...and worth it. If you're ever in Nashville, give this  Homewood Suites a shot!Awesome place to stay. Great staff. Great amenities, very clean. Delicious free breakfast. The staff was going the extra mile to make our stay awesome. Loved it!!This is a newer hotel that is ideal for VU campus events. It is right across from the Towers and within easy walking distance to all points on campus. It is also minutes (when traffic isn't backed up) to downtown and is surrounded by restaurants and shops within walking distance.The hotel has contemporary decor. The lobby is spacious with ample seating in a variety of set ups--tables (hi tops and regular), living/lounge areas with sofas and TVs and comfy chairs. The suites are equally as nice and spacious. Large living room with sectional sofa (sleeper) and chaise lounge; dining room table, plus counter bar off the kitchen, which had a mini cooktop, full size refrigerator and dishwasher. Bedrooms were equally as spacious. The lighting could have been better, but that was my only gripe. Ample number of plugs including bedside plugs.The staff, from front desk to housekeeping to kitchen staff to shuttle driver, all provided top notch service. They were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. They greeted us with smiles and seemed to seek ways to make our stay enjoyable.The breakfast buffet was also great with a wide food assortment including make your own waffles, egg scrambles, sausage, fruit, muffins, pastry and the absolutely best apple turnovers! The food was hot and fresh.This will definitely be my spot when in Nashville.I had a room block at this hotel for my wedding (including dropping off welcome bags that the hotel handed out as our guests checked in), the rehearsal dinner was there, and I stayed there for 3 nights over the wedding weekend, and everything was wonderful!  There were a few small snafus (as there are bound to be with that much going on), but each time something came up it was handled promptly and professionally.The free happy hour is amazing, parking is convenient, the beds are insanely comfortable, and the staff was great to work with! The location is great, and the free shuttle is a very nice touch, though some of my wedding guests that tried to use it said it was often a long wait. Free wifi, breakfast, happy hour, shuttle - a great deal for that close to downtown!Stayed here for a night and the suite was very nice. The TV is mounted to the wall so that you can rotate it to whichever room you're watching TV in. Security seemed good. You need a room key to take the elevator to any of the guest levels. The hotel is pet friendly, but there is only a small patch of grass/landscaping in front of the hotel within an immediate distance for the dog to use. Parking was also $25 for self park, $28 for valet. Overall, very nice. Several restaurants within walking distance. I'd stay here again.Every single detail of this hotel has been thought through. From the full kitchen in the rooms, night lights in the bathrooms and grocery delivery. It's all been meticulously thought out and well planned. The bed.....oh my gawd the bed. One of the best beds I've ever slept in. I wanted to pack it in my suitcase. From the mattress to the linens, all PERFECT. Security was well thought out with room cards needed to activate the elevator and to access the hotel late at night, with a night guard standing watch. Breakfast AND dinner with beer and wine is included Monday - Thursday, I believe. There's also a free shuttle that will take you within a 2-mile distance - well within reach of all the action. Staff is friendly and warm. Everything is kept very, very clean. I wish all hotels were like this.I would highly recommend this hotel on west end ave. They took good care of us even after we had a little check in problem.Besides the wonderful breakfast that most hotels server, the have a evening receptionFrom 5-7 that is just like going to dinner.The staff was very nice and helpful when needed.What a fantastic hotel! I've been to Homewood Suites before but this one is above and beyond. The staff is excellent, everyone from the Managers to the housekeeping staff are all lovely people, very friendly AND proactively handed out little trinkets to me children AND the dogs! Small rubber ducks from the manager during breakfast 1 morning,  waterproof footballs from housekeeping to play with while in the pool, and treats for the dogs one day when we took them out for a walk. It's these little touches on top of the fantastic facility that make this hotel great.It is located across from Vanderbilt University, so close to everything.  The rooms are very spacious and well decorated, there is a updated fitness room and beautiful salt water pool.  The food during the free breakfast is delicious, much more than continental breakfast.Scrambled eggs, cherry turnovers, hash browns, sausages, waffles plus the usual cereal,  juice, coffee, pastries, etc. The staff during breakfast was really efficient and on top of everything, so nothing was ever out of stock even when busy. The hotel also offers a free shuttle to anywhere within 2 miles.Great option! So glad we choose this place for our long weekend in Nashville.I take it back, I must have had the meal on an off day -- the dinner has been terrific the last two evenings. Wonderful work everyone!Great service, great attention to detail.    I enjoyed the service staff, they were friendly and conversational.  Can't complain about anything, valet awesome, front desk staff awesome.  I'll be back at my next visit.Great hotel!  I was surprised with how much it was per night (stayed 5 nights) - and thought it was pricey but I was pleasantly surprised with all of the amenities!  Free wifi.  Free shuttle service to anywhere within 2 mile radius - NOTE - it is first come first serve and, they only have one that can seat only about 10 people comfortably.  They serve a nice buffet style hot breakfast everyday and a hot buffet dinner Monday-Thursday evenings with free beer and wine.  (Nothing high end but if you are on a budget - it helps).  Parking and Valet is not free and not cheap!  We opted to walk and Uber when we had to!They have a nice gym with tv's.  Also an indoor pool, and washer and dryer room on-site (however I used them - and I think they could use some service - washer doesn't spin properly and I needed to run the clothes in the dryer a few times to get them dry (when on high).The customer service is great - everyone is so hospitable and they aim to please.  (They will even grocery shop for you). The rooms are very comfortable and spacious and clean!  Great security too!  It has everything a small studio apartment would have.  Wish there were more room in the toilet/shower area - hard to close the door.  Great location - near great food spots and a short Uber ride to certain attractions.  I would be open to stay at a Homewood Suites again after my experience.This brand new hotel across the street from Vanderbilt promises to be a busy hotel.My wife and I were guests in this hotel for 9 nights, and were very pleased to be here.Rooms are spacious.  Breakfast buffet is filling; hours are: M-F: 6-9, and Sa/Su 6-10am.  Complete evening meals, wine and beer are also available, and also complimentary.Free wifi throughout the hotel. Complimentary shuttle service within 2 miles is a great amenity. Parking, both valet or self-park, is an additional charge.Fitness center is properly outfitted. Large indoor heated pool. Very good laundry facilities on site.Good security: Need key to access each floor &amp; after 11pm need key to enter front door/lobby.Staff and management are very interested in accommodating guests.Only downside, which likely is a temporary one, is that being a new hotel, like any establishment, the hotel is still in the checklist status.  As a result, systems and procedures are still being worked on and being implemented.  Staff is still grappling with how best to effect customer satisfaction. However, any personal issue brought to top management was immediately addressed.Bottom line: I will look forward to returning here!!","Homewoods tend to be hit or miss, usually based on how new they are, and this one is a hit. It's also pretty newly built, so that's to be expected. I had a king one bedroom suite with a huge patio on the 4th floor while staying here for business, and the patio was the absolute best part (see pic). It had a lounge area with comfortable seating and a table and chairs for four.  Awesome.The room was nice and clean, and when I declined service for the day the hotel staff left me a basket containing extra towels, toiletries and coffee.  Great service!I would definitely stay here again if in Nashville on business or fun.When you don't want your most expensive souvenir from a trip to be bed bugs, stay here. Super duper clean. Pricey, but worth every penny. A block from the Parthenon. Pretty modern to make you feel snooty, but staff is not snooty at all. They let our wild beast dog stay in there! Amazing location, very secure and parking is in attached garage. I've stayed places where accessing your car is more of a hassle, so this was very convenient. In the near 100 degree Tennessee heat of early August our room was ice cold. Giant ass bed for wife and pooch to sprawl out. And booked on the fly as we drove down same day! Loved it.Superb customer service!!! We stayed two nights close to Christmas and it was wonderful! The two rooms (we had a king and 2 queens) were very big and so clean. The sheets were the softest I've ever felt!Breakfasts were good and the dinner option was great for a glass of wine. We saw the general manager working one morning and was picking up Cheerios off the floor. Everyone working was so nice! This is a great place!Nice place...good location...I have stayed here before and will again.They need a another staff person for valet...the breakfast staff is very good..they should have a better place for dirty dish work than the hallway?For its category &amp; price , 4-5 stars. The suite w 2 bedrooms included full kitchenette including full size fridge/freezer, tv's in all the rooms, decent beds w white linens, very clean. Hotel has a shuttle van that can be called for drop off to restaurants or venues. Proximity to downtown &amp; Ryman decent by car, about 10-15 minutes. This hotel is across from Vandy and within walking distance to J. Alexanders, Starbucks, Barnes &amp; Noble and a few other amenities.The hotel was great and the staff was exceptionally friendly.  The manager, named Michael was so friendly and patient.  The woman that was over the housekeeping was over the top with guests and especially children, making us feel so relaxed and welcome even with an ""active"" toddler.  The breakfast was great, very quality and clean.  I have stayed in many hotels in this area including some more expensive and from now on I will not stay anywhere else thanks to such a good experience at this hotel.Great value and service for this location across from Vanderbilt and just two miles from downtown . Pleasant free shuttle to downtown. FREE wifi FREE breakfast . The room was spacious and inviting. Staff was very friendly . We loved this hotel and I will be back.Two experiences out of the 3 we have experienced have been poor.  The room was not ready (after check -in hour) and upon inquiring, we were told a few minutes more.  An hour later....the room was finally ready.  We missed our BlueBird Cafe opportunity that evening. The next stay we booked MONTHS in advance, were asked for a deposit and the day before we got a call from the manager stating that there was a problem with our room.  At that point, they had our deposit for over a month and our reservation for over 3 months.  We are Hilton Honors Gold members and resolved the issue with the HH customer service rep and manager.  The rooms are comfy and for the most part, clean.  There was a dirty towel on the back of a door in one bathroom on  one of our stays.  Beds are really comfy though and we slept well.I stayed here for a couple for nights. I the whole time that I was there, the staff made me feel important and were extremely helpful. They even drove us the the Bridgestone Arena for a Predator's game.  I didn't need my car the two days I was there. Rooms were very clean and there was nothing left lacking. I would not hesitate recommending there to anyone and everyone. This would be my first choice next time I need accommodations in Nashville.Fabulous hotel. Beautiful lobby. Great breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff. My top pick in Nashville.good position at the beginning of the magnificent mile. Charm of the structure. Beautiful lifts ""historic"" with a bench to sit on. Hall classic with amazing floral arrangements. I had a free upgrade to junior suite overlooking the lake: huge and atmospheric. Decent breakfast and expensive. Executive lounge insufficient. Service to the rooms ""distracted"". I recommend it as well as the Nashville, TN Board: BEAUTIFULWas great for our bachelorette party! We had a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suite (1 king and 2 queens). It fit the 8 of us VERY comfortably with tons of room to all be together in the living room. Staff was extremely nice and accommodating. They let us add everyone onto the room in case anyone lost their key.THis place is beautiful.  From the front lobby with water feature,relaxing gathering areas, breakfast area and especially the staff! Katie at the front desk and everyone else!  We were amazed at the new hotel. The pool was welcoming and relaxing.  We loved the free shuttle to downtown and Wade our driver was a personal tour guide.  He was both friendly and informative.  the room was modern/warm extremely clean and comfortable.  we heard no noise with a fully booked hotel.  WAIT!  WAIT! WHY?  be aware that there are very few (5?) rooms with tubs....no where does the hotel say this on their description and it is important to know that...after a long day of walking around Nashville it would have made the trip.  The staff said that was the ""new"" way for hotels...maybe but they should inform you!I had surgery Wednesday at the VA Hospital and was blessed that I was provided a room here to stay. I was blown away by the hospitality. The rooms were so quite and comfortable.Great stay with the family.  Breakfast was better than Hampton and most others!  Spacious lobby and seating.Had a wonderful stay here. Great location: very convenient to Vanderbilt, and lots of restaurants and shops nearby. My suite was large, roomy, and very nice. Pretty modern (maybe it was newly renovated) and felt more upscale than most Homewood Suites. I have to say the thing that really stood out was the service, so friendly and welcoming. Especially Gavin at the front desk, but all the staff made me feel at home, I just can't remember the rest of their names. At first I was a little skeptical because the rate was a little hefty, but it was worth it and I would stay here again if visiting the area.Excellent hotel. Came down for spring break. Checked in and the hotel gave us a room with an amazing balcony for being hilton members. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Didn't do the week night dinner they serve. Great indoor pool for kids to play in.Loved this hotel. Very new and clean. Rooms are beautiful. Had a kitchen with refrigerator, dishwasher, 2 burner stove. Staff is very nice and helpful. Workout room is enough for a quick workout. Breakfast buffet is good. Parking garage is right under the building.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-nashville-6,Hampton Inn & Suites,4.0,$$,30,"I don't really do Yelp reviews on hotels but this place deserves it. The price is right, the location is nice, free parking, free WiFi very nice modern rooms with comfortable beds and great pressure in the showers. The staff is super friendly too. I'm typing this as I enjoy my complementary breakfast in the lobby which is far better than I expected. Pretty much everything you'd want for breakfast (fresh made waffles, eggs, BACON, cereal, fruit, pastries, oatmeal, coffee, juice, I'm sure I forgot a few things)I will definitely be looking at Hampton Inn more when I travel.Our visit here was great - nice location just outside of the downtown area, the room was nice and clean, and we got a great rate. The bed was very comfortable as well, which I really liked. And we were close to restaurants and just a short drive from the freeway. Plus it was just a few minutes down the road from downtown. If you are looking for a less expensive option (with free parking!) in town, check this place out!I had a great stay at the Hampton Inn. The rooms are very nice and clean and the staff was great to deal with. Our rooms had a fridge and outlets almost everywhere (I find this accommodation rare to find in some hotels). Perks of this hotel are the free parking, free wifi, complimentary breakfast, gym, and big outdoor pool. They also have a coffee and tea stand available for all guests in the lobby. I made use of the gym and pool during my stay and they were always well-kept and stocked with towels. The gym consists of 2 treadmills, 1 elliptical, 1 yoga ball, medicine balls and dumbbell rack, 1 bench and 1 mat. The pool has about 20 lounge chairs and 3 tables with umbrellas.Overall, I had a great stay and would consider coming here again.My husband and I travel constantly and stay in Marriott hotels all over the country. This particular stay at the Hampton Inn on Elliston place in Nashville was a very nice stay. We where in the process of moving out of Nashville with a crazy schedule, tired from moving around boxes all day, this Hampton was a nice place to call 'home' for a few nights. It is very conveniently located, there is great parking right on the lot, not in a parking garage a block away like some of the other hotels in mid-town. Their pool is outdoors and well kept. And the hotel is over all clean and very welcoming. Most of all, I had to wake up early in the morning and get some food in me before my long day..(it's not typical to have a good breakfast at a hotel without a restaurant) granted, I only got oatmeal, toast and some banana bread to snack on later, the oatmeal was actually cooked great, (not thick slop) the area was clean AND Richard who possibly manages the breakfast hours was an absolute pleasure. It's early, I'm tired, don't particularly want to talk to anyone early and he greeted me, asked me how everything was with our stay, talked about old Nashville before all of the new bullshit being built. He got me a tray when he noticed my attempt to haul my husband's breakfast back to the room. He hummed and sang while straightening up which was endearing. It was a sweet way to start the day. Also, the music that was playing throughout the hotel was incredible old old blues including Elmore James. Great stay!I really liked this Hampton Inn.  All of the staff members we encountered were polite, accommodating, and willing to help.  The bed was super comfy, and there was a microwave and fridge available too.  The bath towels could have been thicker, but at least they give you plenty of 'em.  The toiletries are Neutrogena, in case you were wondering.  The water pressure was terrific, and there was no shortage of hot water.  Ahhhh. There are two free wireless networks available, so when one wasn't working that well, I just switched to the other one.I was rather impressed by the free breakfast buffet that runs from 6-10, I believe.  I was expecting pastries and boxed cereal, but HI went all out, with oatmeal, make-your-own waffles, biscuits, muffins, omelets, hardboiled eggs, yogurt, bacon, sausage, fruit, juice, and other things.  Popcorn, tea, and coffee are always available in the lobby.Free parking too!  There are restaurant options within walking distance, and downtown is a short drive away.  A solid choice for your hotel needs in Nashville.We went here recently to visit and I will tell you the experience was top notch. From the moment we entered the door and were promptly greeted by the first staff member to the last when we left they were always asking how they could help you and how they could help make your stay more enjoyable with a smile on their face. Rooms were very clean, large and beds very comfortable. One might think they were a bit pricey, but for downtown Nashville and you throw in all you get from the amazing service from the staff, excellent FREE breakfast and FREE wifi and you can't beat it. We were actually within walking distance to several excellent restaurants and bars if you wanted to get out. I would definitely stay again when revisiting Nashville.Stayed again at the Hamtpon near Vanderbuilt. Although we did have a room that had a weird-sounding air conditioner, it was 2 in the morning when we rolled in and at that point you just go with it. This place is just CLEAN and nice. It's updated... The staff literally whistles while they work... And the breakfast. It's so good. Also, the location is so great! There are some really cute spots right around the hotel for meals. Check this place out of you need a reliable stay!!Hampton Inn had so much to offer while staying in Nashville. Walking distance to multiple restaurants, bars, and beautiful sites. The room was comfortable and included a refrigerator and microwave, perfect to having those leftovers from many of the nearby restaurants. A delicious full breakfast was included which offered eggs, crispy bacon, sausage and biscuits with gravy, plus really great fresh fruit and overall more options than we could try in the two days we were there. The employees were super friendly and accommodating. We asked for a high room with a view of the nearby Parthenon and they were able to meet this request. My only reason for not going the full 5 stars is returning to our room for a rest at almost 5 p.m. to have it not yet cleaned for the day, and feather pillows that were not that simple to get replaced with non-allergen pillows. The free wi-fi is a plus and the lobby area is a nice enough place to hang out when not in the room.  I would definitely recommend staying and and book my room here next time I am in town.This is an excellent place to stay.  The people that work there are all into customer service.  The housekeeping is the best I have experiencedThe lobby is super even by Hampton Inn standards.  The rooms were large and well laid outBest in the Vandy areaWow, ok I just came from the worst hotel experience of my life which I would never wish upon anyone. Thank god I found the Hampton inn Elliston. It was huge, desperate living room and kitchen, more like a 1 bedroom appt! Breakfast was a fun nice treat and the staff was fantastic. Sheets and everything was clean. On issue was housekeeping missed a few things, but very minor. In a city where hotels are limited and overpriced I was more then satisfied.Great staff and VERY friendly and accommodating! We usually stay at the Homewood Inn and Suites across the road but this Hampton Inn far exceeds expectations! Good job!I really enjoyed my stay at this Hampton Inn.  I was in town for the RockNRoll Nashville Half Marathon and they could not have been more accommodating.  All of the staff members I encountered were polite, accommodating, and willing to help.  They were helpful with recommendations and made a point wish all of us runners good luck!  I was really impressed by the free breakfast buffet.  I was expecting packaged pastries and boxed cereal, but there was oatmeal, waffle iron, banana bread (yum!), muffins, omelets, eggs, hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit and other things.  The morning of the race they opened breakfast early for runners and I think all of my running friends could agree that that all of the above food items are perfect pre-race fuel.  The hotel also put out bottles of water and energy bars on race morning.  Popcorn, tea, and coffee are always available in the lobby which is great.They hotel also offered a free-shuttle service to the start line which helped keep the entire race day stress-free (and cost effective, considering the race organizers were charging about $20 for a shuttle.)  The bed was comfortable and the rooms are clean.  The only issue with the rooms is the paper-thin walls.  We literally heard every conversation, shower and television in a 3-room radius.  Free parking, restaurant options within walking distance, neighboring, beautiful park to spend the afternoon, and downtown a short drive away.  Hampton Inn is a great choice for Nashville.Great complimentary breakfast.  Very well kept and clean.  Rooms were a little tightly packed, and the coffee maker was in the bathroom which kinda grossed me out a little.  Staff was friendly.  Would stay again.Very impressed! We got a great price for this hotel after looking at a lot of options in Nashville. Good location. $7-10 cab fare to bars/restaurants on Broadway. Clean, modern, and updated. Though I did not try it, my friends told me the breakfast was good. They called us a cab as requested. We asked for additional towels and received them within approximately one minute.  Less than 15 minute drive to Green Hills mall. Free parking!This review is way overdue. But since I'm semi new on yelp I felt it deserved to get a review even if it was almost a year ago! Last year me and my friend had booked a hotel on Nashville for the weekend through priceline. When we got there not only was it not a hotel but the staff was amazingly rude and we had to switch rooms 3 times before saying we could NOT stay there. It was late in the night and made a few calls to nearby hotels but everyone was ""booked up""  finally I just went into the next one I saw. Which was Hampton Inn and Suites. After explaining our situation the front desk lady quickly found us a room and told us SHE was sorry for out bad experience in Nashville! Lol since it was so early in the morning gave us a little discount for our first night and was super sweet and helpful. Along with the rest of the staff ! Checked up on us the second day and really treated us kindly. I'll definitely stay here again if I'm in Nashville. Thank you for my great experience!!I read in a previous entry that this hotel is a little on the worn side. I guess that explains the not as fresh air that I felt and the small stain on my couch. The whole room gave me a not so new feeling. Otherwise, the service was wonderful. There was a great outdoor pool but the trick was getting to it. The gym was small and had 4 machines. Only the necessities. They did have a water cooler though!The complimentary breakfast was satisfying and there is always tea and coffee available for you.We had a group of 5 and this was a great place to stay because we had a Queen Suite that fit 2 queen beds and a couch in the common area (2 TVs), a small stove top, dishwasher, a fridge, and free wifi. This place also serves continental breakfast from 6a-10a. The room was nice, ""wood"" floor and area rug in the common areas and carpets in the bedroom. We stayed here for the Nashville Country Music Marathon and it was great because the start line was within walking distance at Centennial Park. They served breakfast early (5am) on race day so that the runners could get some carbs in before the big race. Free parking available as well. Pool is located outside, but we didn't go in because it was cold and rainy all weekend.The only downside is the THIN walls. We had an adjoining room with an adjoining door, and next door to us was a rowdy group of guys celebrating a bachelor party. I was sleeping on the couch in the common room and could hear everything from next door because they were LOUD, DRUNK BOYS. I actually had to call security on them because they knocked on our adjoining door 3times at 3:50am. Not the greatest night sleep, but the boys finally passed out at 4:30am! The security came by very quickly to remedy the situation, so was pleased with that.Queen suite for marathon weekend ran me $489/night, but not bad if you split it between 5 people! :)I liked this hotel!  We stayed here because it was close to the Parthenon, and we were in a block of rooms reserved for guests of the wedding we attended.I thought the rooms were spacious, clean, and comfortable.  The staff at the front desk was really nice to us.Apparently they have fresh baked cookies during the week.  (I could smell them on Friday, but I never found them.  I think they were gone before I located them).The hotel has a reasonable sized outdoor pool.  It looks out onto the parking lot, but I guess that is better than facing a busy street.  At least at the back of the parking lot, there aren't a lot of people around.The complimentary breakfast was better than I expected.  There were a couple of hot dishes, hard boiled eggs, fruit salad, whole fruit, assorted pastries, make your own waffles, cereal, oatmeal, and yogurt.  I thought that was really impressive!CONSTRUCTION ALERT!!!  as of mid June 2012 there is a huge construction project taking place across the street from this hotel! Prepare to be woken  up anywhere from  545 to 630am Monday thru SATURDAY ( yes Saturday too). I was worried when I saw the earplugs they were giving out at the front desk , but with festivals and such there was no other place available. Much construction in the general vandy area...  You takes your chances with this place Its a decent hotel , with a gym , pool and overall room quality , and close to some cool restaurants , but I'll pass next time im in the area till the condos are builtCould not have been any nicer say. Great staff and management with attention to every detail.  Great breakfast with large area, tv, and complimentary newspapers.  I just feel it is a bit expensive for what you get.  The nearby construction was not a bother at all to us during our 4 night stay.","Of all the hotels we've stayed at in Nashville, this is the best.  Clean, spacious rooms (and lobby).  Wonderful pool.  Great sleep.  Great location.  Worth a stay if you get a chance.Still undergoing some renovation, but seems like most of the place has been made over, judging from what I've read in reviews around the web.  Our room was in good condition, clean.  Bed was extremely comfortable.  As another reviewer mentioned on TripAdvisor, there is a mini-refrigerator and microwave oven in the room!  Very nice convenience.  Free high-speed internet was fast enough to watch movies.  Free breakfasts were extremely convenient.  Convenient location next to Vanderbilt, 2 miles from downtown, centrally located to most attractions, but much cheaper than staying downton.  Next door to a number of restaurants.  We walked a block over to Calypso and had some pretty good and very inexpensive food.Would recommend.Very nice hotel!  Stayed here recently during a busy football weekend.  The rooms were clean, spacious and newly renovated.  The hotel staff were extremely friendly too.  The only reason why I am not giving five stars is because of the bed.  It was lumpy and low on one side, but bearable. Our friends said their room mattress was great, so it could've just been our room.  Will definitely stay here again.Four of us in our 30s from Chicago stayed at this Hampton Inn this past weekend.  I must say, this hotel has the most friendly and pleasent staff I have ever had staying at a hotel.  Everyone said hello, good morning, asked how we were, Robert even came by this morning to ask how our breakfast was and thanked us for staying with them as he was cleaning up.  Every housekeeper, desk clerk, and everyone we saw was so sincerely nice.  Unfortunately that isn't always the case today.  It was so wonderful.  Our room was big, excellently located by the fun part of Division Street and a quick, cheap taxi ride to downtown..oh and I loved the complementary popcorn and the breakfast that is included in the room fee was very good.  Thank you for making our trip to Nashville very pleasant!Convenient but pricey. Clean, quiet, and with staff that is courteous.  The iron in the room was weak and nearly broken, and the ironing board was broken. I probably could have had it replaced had I had time to tell the staff, but there you go. You pay for the convenience to be somewhat near Vanderbilt campus.Clean, spacious rooms in a convenient location made for a pleasant stay. The suite arrangement with two queen beds and a sofa was perfect for us with two adults and one teenager. The beds are very comfortable. While I thought it was a bit weird to have little post-it notes on the headboards saying that the duvet covers had been washed, I was glad to know that information, given it is not a top-end hotel.And the room was surprisingly quiet. Next to our room was a family party of three rooms and 5 or 6 young boys playing in the hall. We could hear them a bit in the outer room of the suite, but not at all in the bedroom.Being a weekend, there was no noisy construction, but that could be a problem during the week. It's just a booming area of town.Overall, better than I'd have expected from a Hampton Inn.Absolutely the worst hotel I have stayed in...and I have stayed from the best of the best to the bottom of the barrel. The staff is rude. The rooms are smokey and old (they are in the middle of a much needed renovation). We asked for a King room, non smoking. Got a 2 double bed, smoking  room with NO sofa or anything in the room besides an old desk and chair. The carpet smelled terrible. There must have been a church and a youth group retreat taking place that weekend as well. (7/21/-22). I am glad we only stayed one night. WE asked for a late check out and when the other manager did not relay that to the manager on duty, we were yelled at for ""Staying"" later. Took 45 mins to get continental breakfast with all the kids in the lobby. There were many ""working"" guys walking around the hotel all day and night and the front desk staff was horrible to my Mother in Law (to be) when she came to meet us at the hotel. NEVER AGAIN! This place is disgusting and the people are equally as disgusting! Stay at the other Hampton Inn on West End...BEST in town!This is probably my least favorite hotel I've stayed at in Nashville.  It is not really that this place is altogether that terrible, if it were some random hotel along the interstate somewhere, it'd suit perfectly well.  However when you compare the price, location and quality, there are plenty of better options in the area.Its location on Elliston means it is within a block or two of quite a few restaurants and bars, which makes walking pretty feasible.  You're also just a couple blocks down from Centennial Park which is a great place to explore on a nice day.  Its proximity to Vanderbilt University makes it popular for visiting family which also means that for Vanderbilt events, you're going to need to book a room far in advance.The rooms are clean but plain, not really a great hotel to spend a lot of time in.  The lobby is large and colorful and also pretty loud so hope you don't get a room on the first floor.They have their own parking lot but traffic in the area can get pretty bad during peak hours.My fiance and I stayed here and got food poisoning from the scrambled eggs served at breakfast.  We let the staff know but they didn't seem concerned.This place is pretty old. The rooms are incredibly bland and tasteless. It looks like 1992 up in here. The staff never went out of there way to appear helpful. The wireless internet did not work in my room. I had to go to the lobby to even connect for an extended period of time, and even then I had to endure incredibly slow speeds. Do not come here if internet is a must. The only reason to come here is for an inexpensive room near the university. I would not stay here again.",,,,"['really', 'yelp', 'reviews', 'hotels', 'place', 'deserves', 'price', 'right', 'location', 'nice', 'free', 'parking', 'free', 'nice', 'modern', 'rooms',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-nashville-airport-nashville-2,Hyatt Place Nashville Airport,3.5,$$,30,"I don't stay at Hyatt properties because I try to stick with one chain to maximize my elite benefits. But Hyatt has sent a few reminders lately that I need to have some activity in order to keep the few points that I have in my Hyatt account. So when a Hyatt showed up in the right area and the right price range, I gave it a try.Hyatt Place is probably on par with the Marriott Courtyard or the Hilton Hampton brands though it does have a free breakfast in the morning, free wifi and a small bistro in the lobby area.I had a very comfortable room with a large king-sized bed, large flat panel television, a good walk-in shower with a small closet, sitting area and coffee service. Interesting, the coffee service had actual ceramic coffee mugs not plastic wrapped paper ones.It was a good stay. If Hyatt's were in the places I wanted to be, they'd probably be in my regular repertiote. But they're not.I am slightly disappointed with my stay in the Hyatt Place. I was hoping it would be the best stay due to the fact that I spent a nice amount of money on a room to enjoy.The main issue that I had was cleanliness!! I found stray hairs all of the sheets, dirty wash clothes, and to prove that they did not do what they were supposed to do, I left a note in the bed sheets for housekeeping to change them. When it was time for bed, I pulled back the sheets and the note that I placed in the bed remained there. After learning the fact that they did not even bother to completely pull back the bed sheets, it made me feel uncomfortable wondering what else they did not clean. I am not pleased whatsoever about this.The living area was decent and spacious and the mini refrigerator was convenient.A solid Hyatt.  I got a little bit of a bad vibe when I called them to pick us up from the airport on Wednesday at 11pm, but I think the personality of the desk lady was just less warm and more matter of fact.  When we got to the hotel to check in she was nice enough.  The location isn't crazy awesome except that it's right next to the airport and walking distance to some fast food, so if you're coming in late or trying to catch an early flight it's perfect.  It's maybe 20 minutes from downtown Nashville, so may want to consider another option if your trip has reason for you to be down there often.Their breakfast layout was great.  A lot of options and a lot of good tasting food.  We slept in, so missed out on a lot of it, but still grabbed a few items that hit the spot.It's less than 5 minutes from the airport to the hotel once the shuttle gets you, and the overall ease of getting to the hotel is wonderful.Room was huge and very nice.  Looking more closely I found some areas that didn't quite get clean or needed maintenance attention, but nothing that bothered me during my stay (more like if I sat somewhere for a long period of times I started to notice very minor things).Hyatt place always keeps its looks very consistent.  Even the smell of the lobby is the same regardless of where you go.  I haven't stayed at a Hyatt Place for over 5 years now.  Coming in to another one brings me memories of my previous stays.  Whenever you are looking for a clean, spacious room, and pleasant stay, always come to Hyatt Place.  I always enjoy it whenever I stay at one of these places.  You will love the room.A nice last minute weekend option at an affordable price!Itching to visit some POIs in Nashville months ago at the last minute, we chose this Hyatt Place hotel for the price and since I'm a Hyatt Gold Passport member.Without a doubt, Hyatt is consistent when it comes to decor and service. This location was no different. *Reasonable [last minute] rates*Convenient location*Clean and spacious room*Comfortable beds*Separate living-room area*Work desk*Kitchenette*Small closet (check before settling in)*Delicious hot breakfast options*Friendly staff*Small gym*Modern (clean lines) decor*Adequate &amp; free parkingInitially, I was concerned about noise when I made the reservation since it has the airport in its name. Thankfully, the hotel and our room was quiet.My usual hotel special requests include: highest floor, non-smoking room, quiet &amp; away from elevators. Not much to ask, right?! This Hyatt disappointingly gave us a room on the furthest end of the hall near the stairways. Too tired from our drive to complain and in a rush to play as tourists, we settled for it. Thankfully it wasn't noisy. But gosh(!!), we had the smallest closet ever!! Had we been there more than 1 night, a small closet would be unacceptable as I always overpack. Always.Aside from that, our overall experience was pleasant. We'd recommend this Hyatt Place location. Just be sure to check the size of your closet and all the other things that matter in your stay. ;DWe stayed over the Christmas holiday. I stay at Hyatt Place hotels around the country as I am a Platinum Passport member. We prepurchased four nights via the Hyatt site. First the interaction with every employee was top notch.  Hyatt does something right with training.  But the room. The carpet was dirry, the sofa stained and overused, our room was cleaned but new coffee cups and glasses were not changed out. All pretty gross. Also the shower had a regulator on the handle which would not allow to turn to the point which would allow us to take a hot shower! Several times I washed out of the sink with a washcloth so I could have hot water. The sink did not have a regulator. Manager apologized for condition of room and said reno at ions were happening. Stay out of room 404. It was gross.Room wasn't filthy but wasn't the cleanest either. There was a clear plastic wrapper, the type that go around the top of a pill bottle clearly visable on the back of the couch as soon as we entered the room.  The linens seemed clean enough, like they'd been washed and replaced, but I don't trust the cups.  The couch seems in good enough condition but since they didn't notice the wrapper, I question whether or not they inspected it for cleanliness before our arrival.Shower doesn't get hot, and the nob frequently hangs loose and floppy like it's broke.  Where the shower head meets the wall, no caulking and the piece just hangs loose, letting you look into the darkness of the wall.There is no place to set things down in the restroom, just a toliet and a shower- the sink is out in the bedroom area.  The clean towels, are on a wire shelf inside of the shower stall.  Literally the only place to store clean and dry items is inside the shower stall.  WTF?There is no trash can in the restroom.  God forbid you should be female and ""that time of the month"" in this place.  What is the hotel owners suggestion here?  Set your feminine hygiene products on the floor?  Both the unused you may need later, and the used until you can get out to the unlined metal mesh garbage can over by the desk?  Do they literally never have female guests? For that matter, what do you want men to do with condoms should they get lucky in your hotel?  Flush 'em and clog the toilet?  Toss it in that unlined mesh basket in the middle of the room by the desk?  Seriously- the fact that this hotel fails on something as basic as a garbage can drives me nuts.Food waste should probably go in a trash can with a liner.  So should any restroom trash.  God hopes they spray that metal mesh basket with Lysol.  My inner germ-a-phobe goes crazy about this particular detail as soon as I floss my teeth and go looking for a place to dump my now used piece of floss, and realize I have no choice but to put it in the metal mesh can.  Then I start thinking of all the other things that belong in a more appropriate trash can, in a more appropriate place, and what people did when they didn't have the option...I don't want to set any of my things on a hotel bathroom floor to get folks athlete foot germs all over my belongings.  Add some hooks to hang things that aren't inside the shower, add a small shelf, and a bathroom trash can with a liner and my inner germ-a-phobe might shut up.  Small fixes to make for a much less skin crawling stay.Speaking of skin crawling, every time we turned on the TV the default screen was an advertisment for on demand porn- it also if you scroll up through options, has the on demand movie information and things of that nature, but every single time we turned on the TV, half the screen was dedicated to various almost naked folks.  And not with some surreptitious title, the ones with really rauchy titles.  For some odd reason, the remote didn't work very well from this station to go to the standard TV options, so you had to get up and manually change it on the TV set off the ""on demand"" screen, and then the remote worked fine.  Thank God we don't have kids to be staying at this hotel with us, or they may have got to learn about Blackzilla or Barely Legal 3 ways before we could get the TV changed to a more appropriate station.  The fact that you can use parental controls (we discovered on the last day there) doesn't make up for the fact that it defaults to that spot every time the TV turns on.  This issue with the TV, along with the less than perfectly clean elements made the hotel seem really seedy and scummy, when it has all the potential of coming off as a reasonable business class hotel. The lobby was great, and our first impulse, aside from the wrapper on the couch- was to say we actually liked this room as well as we liked our room in the Gaylord Opryland hotel we'd stayed at earlier in the week.  15 minutes later however, after we start seeing all the little ways it was awful, really altered that perception. On our 2nd day, housekeeping never showed up to our room.   We didn't have anything in the door to say not to come in, it would seem they just didn't bother.  We didn't need much, but the one trash can could have used to be emptied.If they want that hotel room to be nice, they only have to do a few things.  Clean and do it well.  Add a few minor details to give the place better function.  Default screen anywhere other than porn.  But without those few things done, I don't know that I'd stay here again.It's OK. Definitely an older hotel that was renovated. Some of it was well done, some of it not so much. The room was spacious at the sacrifice of having even a decent sized closet. I walked into the room and the only cup I found was a coffee cup stored with the coffee maker on the counter but it had red lip stick all over it. Not just a little... A lot.... Gross. Hence the reason everyone says not to use cups in a hotel anyway I guess.I've stayed in better hotels though this is my first time in Nashville. If given the choice, I'd try a different hotel on my next visit.EDIT: This morning I needed some toothpaste so I called down to see if they could bring some up, as I would at any hotel. I was told that they do have it but I'd have to come and get it. Not a big deal by itself but just adds to the 2 star experience here.I came to Nashville on business and the Hyatt was wonderful. My second day in the city I broke my ankle downtown and had to go to the hospital. Once I arrived back at the hotel the staff did their best to help me. They brought up my meals (they have a 24/7 gallery menu for purchase but you need to pick-up your food in the cafe area) and even brought ice to help ice my ankle down. The room was great for me as a business traveler but big enough to bring my family (the sofa has a pull out). Overall room was clean, food was good and the customer service was excellent.The hotel room was a standard Hyatt Place room. Nothing special to report. I would mention though that the hotel pool is towards the right rear of the hotel so if you will be spending any of the day trying to work in your room you might want to request a room in another place. It was noisy on Saturday, but I didn't notice it Sunday - Tuesday. As an aside, access to the outdoor pool requires going outside the hotel. For the room, 4-5 stars. The gym was a huge let down. There was 1 recumbent bike, 2 treadmills and 1 elliptical. There was a good set of dumbbells, but NO bench or mat?!?! There were towels and water provided. 1-2 stars. The free breakfasts were just ok. I had a hard time consistently finding clean plates. Nothing horribly dirty, just 'baked' on food from the heat of the dishwasher. There were hot items each day which were fine though one morning the plain scrambled eggs tasted way too salty. I liked the pepper/onion scramble better and the egg sandwiches on subsequent days. And from all of my Hyatt Place stays combined - I still think the fruit mix has an odd taste. I ate the whole fruit instead. They had it 2-3 stars.Very friendly staff however. I arrived very early in the morning. No rooms were ready - not a surprise or disappointment. The man at the desk, Russ, despite a full house at breakfast showed me into a back office and gave me a spot to put my bag. I think this was him thinking quick on his feet because this space was clearly not bag storage usually - it was I think the manager's office. When I returned to the hotel about 8 hours later the same man was there - but now he knew my name! However he knew (maybe he looked at my luggage tag that morning), it was still impressive. When he checked me out 4 days later he still remembered who I was. 5 stars for service.I Really liked the rooms.  The layout is really nice and spacious for the price with a nice sofa sitting area, and desk.  With the larger mini fridge and wet bar, you could stay a little longer more comfortable if you needed to.  The bed was comfortable but the water pressure in the shower was very low, almost a trickle. The breakfast is not bad but not great. Overall we would stay there again.Tip - Ask for extra pillows and get to breakfast early.  This place was 4+ stars all day. The staff especially Jessica were great to us. We enjoyed so much of our vacation because of the lack of risk and trouble with our stay. The hotel is clean. I will stay there again. They have all the amenities and don't break the bank.We have had other great Hyatt place experiences - but not here.  It does appear updated but the rooms are not thoroughly cleaned and the updates aren't enough (outdated light fixtures in the rooms contrast the other room updates). We had a late breakfast at the food counter in the lobby.  It took 25 minutes for our food to arrive (a cheese plate and egg sandwich).  The cheese plate included 4 slices of cheese...we asked for and received more.  The egg sandwich included a little piece of deli paper (it was included with the cheese as the cook forgot to take it off).  We were done at that point.  The staff was friendly (although kitchen staff not very competent) and the manager did comp our 1-night stay to make up for everything.  But next time, we'll choose the Courtyard by Marriott down the road.This was my second stay at a Hyatt brand hotel and I was impressed again. I booked this room last minute and it was a lot less expensive than a room in the downtown area. The taxi fare from and from the hotel to downtown costs around $20 each way and the lady at the front desk called the taxi company and set everything up, which made that process just as easy as the check in process. They offer complimentary toiletries that you usually have to purchase at other hotels, such as razors and shaving cream. The room was immaculate and very spacious and included a kitchenette and couch. The complimentary breakfast was above your average hotel breakfast. I just recommended this hotel to a friend today and remembered that I hadn't posted a Yelp review...I don't think I should keep this place a secret any longer.Really like this hotel. Crisp white sheets, newer furniture and a freshly cleaned shower. Cleanliness is the most important feature next to safety to me when I'm choosing a hotel. Very comfortable. Two big pluses for my fiance and myself were the generous continental breakfast full of (good) fresh fruit, teas, juices, oatmeal and such and their later checkout (12 p.m) which afforded us the ability to stay out late on Easter Sunday listening to music downtown. So good! It makes a big difference. It's close to the airport but I didn't hear a sound. Two notes is that Nashville has two strange taxes, the 'Privilege Tax' and the 'Lodgig Tax' which brought our Tax total along with state tax to seventeen dollars and some change I believe. I would absolutely stay here again if ever I'm in Nashville.Very modern, swanky hotel. Staff very friendly. It's a little pricey and there is no room service.I love this hotel. It was a home away from home. Once you enter the building, there's a good feeling you get when you see the lobby that looks like a really big living room, the big kitchen to the left, and the smiling concierge who's awaiting to help anyone who walks in. The room itself looked and felt comfortable. The first half of the room had an ""L"" shaped couch, mini fridge, a kitchen sink, and an office table. The second half of the room had two mini queen sized beds, the bathroom, a long counter with the sink, a closet, a heater, and a nice huge plasma TV. Overall, had an amazing stay here. It was clean, all of the staff members were really nice, and they have reasonably priced food that's available 24/7 which is beneficial for the really late nights. When I go back to Nashville, this is where I'll be staying. It's comfortable, safe, and located a short walk away from The Waffle House.The Hyatt was clean, with spacious nice rooms, free wifi and a big screen tv. I also used the fitness center, which is a decent size and has very nice equipment. But what made my stay truly exceptional was the staff. The weather was bad and I had an early morning flight. The cab I ordered the night before called in the morning to say they would be very very late and the Hyatt had the shuttle service start early for me. You don't find this kind of service often -- I am definitely a Hyatt convert.We stayed here on a recent trip to Nashville and selected the location because of the proximity to the airport (less than 1 mile away) and price compared to hotels in downtown.First glance, it's a very new property. The entry/lobby area is going for the whole trendy look with a crecent shaped desk in the middle of the room, open on one end, not your standard hotel check in counter. There's apparently a 24 hour bar and ""restaurant"" connected to the desk, which means it's 2 feet away. We didn't test the bar and I think the restaurant is just mainly some pre-packaged foods that you can order, but I guess it's nice to have there if you're ever in need.Lobby area is small, and there is a lot of furniture. It seemed like at all times there were masses of people camped out with their shoes off, laying on the couches, etc.The room was clean, and spacious, but it seemed overly designed. It had a big sectional couch and an ottoman that jutted awkwardly into the middle of the room - we kept it up against the couch the whole time. There is a sink and refrigerator off by themselves in one corner, then a small desk across from it. The sitting area and bed are seperated by a half wall thing which just looked out of place. The sink was outside of the bathroom. Shower was big. However, the shower and toliet area was up against the wall where the window was, and left very little room between the bathroom wall and end of the bed. Maybe about 18 inches at the most. The whole thing just seemed very poorly designed - a lot of wasted space but at the same time cramped in areas that didn't need to be cramped.No outlets next to the bed. Had to charge my cell phone across the room. Bathroom didn't have a fan. Stay here alone and leave the door open when you shower. No wall mounted or automatic temperature control on the thermostat, so I had to get up and adjust the heater three or four times during the night - one of those big loud fan units under the window.Closet is a joke. It's jammed behind the tv and next to the sink in one of the fake walls in the middle of the room. I was able to fit about 2 jackets and a couple of shirts in there, anything else would be out of reach.The bed and pillows were comfortable, I will admit to that. And the room had a 42"" plasma TV, so that was a nice touch. Other than that, it was very mediocre. I think Hyatt is taking a stab at the ""middle of the road"" type hotel...this wasn't a Hyatt, just a Holiday Inn Express or a Hampton Inn with some newer furniture. Staff was pleasant, it's in a good area, lots of parking. There are about 20 other chain hotels within walking distance. I would stay here again if the price was the same, but if it was any higher, then I'd probably try somewhere else.Lobby is super sheek. Desk staff was really quick, friendly and personable. Neat to have a 24/7 cafe. The rooms are clean. Huge LCD TV. The bed was so comfortable. Free wifi, breakfast and parking...We would stay here again.","I like the Hyatt Place. Their service is consistent. The rooms are clean, and the beds are comfortable. I really like the continental breakfast: your choice of fruit, yogurt, cereal, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, biscuits, muffins, english muffins, bagles, and toast, and several types of juice. They have a new ""green"" approach, that if you don't put your towels on the ground, they won't pick them up until the 3rd day. But if you want fresh towels, simply put them on the ground. Also, the hotel is fairly quiet. The staff is friendly and the locations are great. They are also happy to help with driving directions.Hyatt Place is my hotel of choice. Having stayed at quite a few of them all across the country, one of the things I appreciate is their consistency in service and quality. Hyatt Place had kept a clean record with me, until my stay at the Hyatt Place Nashville Airport.My stay wasn't bad, but it just wasn't the great that I'm used to. To start, when I arrived at the gallery, the gallery hosts were goofing off and joking around with each other. It took a little while until a young man came over and greeted my wife and I. I cannot remember his name, but he was a very nice gentleman. Once we received our room keys and headed upstairs to get some sleep. When we walked into the room, there was just a ""wet"" smell. Sort of like a wet dog. It was very unpleasant. After running the air a little bit, the smell went away (or we just got used to it). I went to open the room door to air the room out a little bit and that is when I noticed the door was ""warped"" at the bottom. The door apparently did not fit in the frame and if someone was wanting to, they could look at the seam anywhere below the handle and see into our room. Finally, I love the breakfast at the Hyatt Place. And breakfast was great at the Hyatt Place Nashville Airport with one exception: dirty coffee mug. A minor thing, but it just seemed to add to the letdown of what is normally a great experience at a Hyatt Place property.Since there seem to be quite a few choices for Hyatt Places and other Hyatt properties in the Nashville area, I will definitely be choosing to stay elsewhere in the future.I have just had great experiences with this hotel chain, try not to stay elsewhere. Complimentary shuttle service from airport is on call only. Hot breakfast as always. Their executive suite looks exactly like a normal suite so don't waste your money unless you need the computer hookups in the room. They booked my room after I prepaid weeks earlier, so after complaining about the situation, they set me up appropriately. Bottom line, all members and prepaid customers should get their exact room, no exceptions.Best hotel I have ever rested in //I am under the impression that most Hyatt Place Hotels are perfect home away from homes due to many reviews I have heard and read. However, this particular Hotel can stand alone in my judgement. I was blown away the moment I walked into the doors. Their redone interior and very respectable staff makes this the hotel I would recommend. The rooms feel refreshing and smell amazing ( I have to include this because I have had some horrible experiences, haha). Every detail is top-notch from the contemporary couch to the cozy bed. Even though I live in Nashville, I would drive 2 exits down just to get a room... it is that great.Decent hotel. Not the greatest I've been to. If your staying for a long time this place is for you. It's considered an extended stay. Lobby, hallways, elevators suck! I'd give it 2 stars.Clean, comfy, and cheap. My three favorite things in a hotel. Bonus: the rooms are gigantic.I felt totally at home here and was able to get a lot of work done in my room thanks to the free and easy wi-fi and the comfortable desk with ample lighting. This hotel is less than 10 miles from downtown and they offer a free mini breakfast with yogurt, fruit, and pastries. If you have to be somewhere early, you can make a cup o' Joe to go and be on your merry way at no extra cost. The pillows are almost as awesome as my pillow at home, and that's saying a lot. Don't come here if you want a fancy hotel with a restaurant, but come here if you want the basics done expertly with professional service. They do offer lunch and dinner plates, but I didn't try any of them so I cannot comment on the quality.Nice, modern, clean. Great staff. I had a late flight out so I camped out in the lobby and worked from there. Nice place to work from. Lots of light and electrical outlets were easy to locate and access.Not too expensive to include a fridge and breakfast. We were disppointed that they did not provide plastic tongs everyday to get bagels out of the toaster without getting burned or risking the metal tongs. This was the only time I have ever experienced entering a hotel room and finding a toilet full of urine. It made the whole room smell. My son had a nosebleed on the sheets  and we left the room available for maid service and they came in and provided clean towels but made the beds up with the dirty sheets. Next time we'll call the front desk and just ask for sheets specifically. The room temperature controls were very nice. It was overall not too noisy, mcdonalds across the street, walgreens very close. No laundry. You have to drive 10 minutes to 24 hour laundry and I recommend you go for a large front loader because their normal looking washers are actually more like compact in their water levels. I might go there again but I would not look forward to spending time in the room more than just sleeping and getting ready for the day. Things look relatively clean but after getting maid service it smelled worse and that is just suspicious. You have to really flush the toilet right away or it will also smell up the  room so that is awkward in the middle of the night when you don't want to wake up everyone. Oh the pool is unheated and in very shaded location so even thought it got hot while we were there the water was too cold to use. We will probably make sure we look for indoor pools next time unless it's July or August.We stayed here one night and downtown Nashville the next night. The Hyatt was half the price and twice as nice as the downtown hotel. It's definitely worth it to stay out there and cab it. The hotel is recently redone and very nice: pool, fitness center, bar area, 24-hour food. The rooms are cozy and have mini fridges, and the beds are nice. Sleek modern decor.Nice, courteous an professional team. Accommodations are nice and clean. My only gripe is the channel selection is not good and no microwaves in the rooms.",,,,"['properties', 'try', 'stick', 'chain', 'maximize', 'elite', 'benefits', 'sent', 'reminders', 'lately', 'need',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-inn-and-suites-airport-nashville,Drury Inn & Suites Airport,4.0,$$,38,"Friendly staff-clean rooms-good food and beverage. We always stay here. It's near the airport. There's restaurants and shopping near by.                                                     They will call a shuttle that will take you to downtown Nashville for 10.00 dollars round trip. It is well worth it no chance of a DWI.                                                   There pool is half inside and outside the kids love swimming under and being outside in the cold then coming back. Free breakfast and dinner always a big hit. We always sit at a table for four so we can ask a couple sit with us. You can meet the nicest people that way.I had to change hotels for my last night in Nashville, so I ended up staying closer to the airport.  While the hotel was a little older, it was beautiful and clean. The staff were extremely friendly.  The location is very close to the airport and they offer a complimentary shuttle.They offer a ""happy hour"" with cocktails and a light meal.  They offered hot dogs, pasta, salad, baked potatoes, and nachos.  They also offered breakfast with sausage and biscuits, fruit, eggs, etc.  There is also a Wendy's and KFC within close proximity as well as a gas station, Ruby Tuesday's, Panera and Waffle House.The mattress was a little too soft for me, but I slept well.  I had a room on the first floor and it was extremely quiet.I would highly recommend if you want to stay at a nice hotel near the airport!This place not only gives you a free breakfast buffet every morning but also a free dinner buffet every evening from 5pm-7pm (plus 3 free alcoholic drinks, soda &amp; popcorn machine access every night). Pretty good deal in my opinion. Nice hotel with nice enough rooms.We LOVE Drury! We even vacay around them. We didn't book ahead though. Lesson learned! The NRA is having a conference in Nashville leaving us with only a Suite to stay in! Alas, that's what we got. It's Awesome! Dear Son said he felt like a Redneck Millionaire!! Enjoy!The staff made the stay so so pleasant. Omg. The only reason for the 4 starts were the hall noises and the business of the airport.I was in town for a hair and beauty trade show and sought out this particular hotel. It's a short commune into downtown but half the price of the downtown hotels. I wish I could stay longer.The Drury Hotel / Airport in Nashville has been, consistently, the hotel  where I have received the best value and the warmest welcome. They are doing everything right, the staff is perfect, the service is superb, the performance/price value is, without a doubt, the very best  I have seen  in this class of hotels in North America, Europa and Asia. I do mean it. Love the snacks &amp; drinks early evening. Superb staff &amp; crew at the Drury Airport in Nashville.This is a really nice hotel! I stayed here with my two dogs, and we had such a great time! They only allow two dogs per room, but the dogs are allowed anywhere in the hotel. The staff was extremely friendly, and the room was clean. Besides a few kids running down the hallway screaming in the middle of the night, it was generally a great experience. I would recommend staying here, especially if you're passing through with pets!We booked our trip last minute to Nashville and were very lucky to book this hotel. This was out first time staying in a Drury Inn.Pros:-Very friendly and accommodating staff-Clean rooms-Decent price-Very close to the airport(If you care about that)-About a 10 minute drive from downtown -Good breakfast-Kickback hour which includes 3 drinks per person/per night and  heavy snacks -Indoor pool and outdoor pool and indoor hot tub-Comfortable beds-Easy access to highway-Pet-friendly (if you want to bring your pet)-Many restaurants to choose from surrounding the hotel-Hotel guest only parking lot-Plenty of outlets in the room-Safe areaCons:-Some rooms smell like smoke even though it's a non-smoking hotel-10 minute drive from downtown(if you plan on spending most of your time downtown)-Pet-friendly ( if you don't like the idea of animals being in the hotel)-Very close to airport( you hear airplanes fly over quite frequently)-Only two elevators and there are 6 floorsWe definitely would not mind staying here again.$10 pet fee in an incredible hotel.  Staff extremely polite and professional.  Love the Drury inn chain only issue is there are not more of them.I have never heard of this brand of hotels but was able to stay here for a conference while in Nashville. This was one of the best customer service experiences I have had all year... super friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating staff. The room was clean, bed was comfy, and experience was great. I joined their membership program on the spot as I checked out and will definitely be looking to stay at these hotels again!We booked hotel by phone on Thanksgiving Day. We were given a nice discount, as the military discount was blocked-out for the holiday weekend. When we arrived (too late for drinks and dinner:( we were very impressed with the security gates and the updated room keys. No swiping of room keys- you just need to wave it. The hotel was fully booked, there were a lot of pets, and the pool was packed (inside/outside pool seemed very cool). We stayed with our dog ($10.00 fee) on the pet floor, and only heard a bark twice during our stay. The room was clean and did not smell of pet or harsh deodorizer. There was even a few grassy areas with dog bags in the parking lot. In all, we had a great experience and will stop there again next time.After a great stay at Drury hotel in Orlando I thought I would search them out on my most resent trip. It was ok but not great friendly and had all the benefits that Drury offers just small and cold. I would stay there again. And recommend it to you. They are good and worth the money.I'm not one to usually write reviews, although I always research reviews before visiting anywhere and appreciate those who take the time to give honest feedback.  So, I'm making it a point now to try and write reviews myself to help assist others as well.  With that being said, we have stayed at this particular Drury Inn on a few different occasions now while in Nashville.  We've always had a very pleasant experience.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  We feel safe staying at this hotel and the gated parking lot is a nice touch.  Great breakfast and light dinner/snacks served in the evening, as well as popcorn and free drinks. I love that it's a pet friendly hotel as we usually bring our dogs with us.  The $15 pet fee is fair. Room rates seem fair compared to other hotels in the area.  Book the Drury Inn Nashville... You won't be disappointed!This hotel is amazing! Great pet fee. Amazing rooms that are clean and beautiful. VERY good hot breakfast. Loved the staff. Even the manager was out there helping his guests. The kids loved the indoor/outdoor pool &amp; hot tub. We will be back! Thank you for a great stay here in Nashville.I'm really pleased to be writing a positive review about a hotel for a change. Seems I have the worst of luck when traveling irregardless of the price. This is truly an exceptionally clean, well maintained and managed hotel close to the Nashville Airport.Thank you for providing enough electrical outlets. Seems about 2/3 of the places one stays when traveling you have to unplug a floor lamp or some other appliance in order to charge a phone or laptop.Love the magnetic key system and the ability to park behind a security gate.Was in town for a two-night stay. Didn't need an elaborate bar or restaurant in-house as I was in a rental car with all of my business downtown. $300+ for two nights, everything was to my satisfaction. Would most definitely recommend this venue and will likely stay here again in the future.1st timer for Drury...Wow what a good deal, and nice for the price ..The staff was very helpful, and even gave my wife a goodie bag because it was her birthday ( thanks Sherry). Great service !Rooms nice &amp; clean,  free breakfast, snack/dinner. Free drinks alsoJust be aware abouth the hordes of kids on bus tours and other bus tours that apparently mob the placeI didn't see or hear any pets, but it is nice to know a pet friendly placeMy husband and I stayed here after flight cancellations kept us in the area for an additional night. We chose this hotel partly because of it's location in regard to the airport but MOSTLY because we were traveling with our dog. It was nice to have a safe, pleasant place we could go with our companion.The accommodations are wonderful, the drinks and popcorn in the lobby make it that much easier to relax after the frustrations of travel complications. The dinner in the evening is a thoughtful addition as well. My husband and I are vegetarian so we didn't partake in the hot dogs but the salad and pasta worked well for us. Not to mention there's plenty of food in walking distance.The only thing we wished we knew was the timing of the morning breakfast (we probably should have verified this with the front desk) in the lobby. We read the start time in the paperwork inside the room and realized that due to our flight we were going to leave nearly an hour before it began that Sunday. To our amazement when we got downstairs the next morning, there was food available. Unfortunately for us we had to leave immediately to catch the flight so we only had time to quickly snag a few items as the shuttle driver took care of our bags. We were bummed to see we could have made time to start our day with what appeared to be a great spread.  - Therefore I recommend asking about times for the food just to be sure!So, we 100% recommend staying here if you are in the area. As frequent European travelers we often comment how the hotels over seas seem to make more of an effort to provide small things like a decent breakfast, which really mean a lot to a traveler, well this hotel was above and beyond! Loved it!We travel with our dog and we try to stay exclusively at Drury Inn's. We always enjoy our stays. I wish I could give 4 and 1/2 stars as my only issues were that they were more expensive than the other 5 we stayed at this trip and they were in a less desireable neighborhood than most Drury Inn's.We came with two bulldogs and two kids, traveling with another family with 5 kids.  We fed everyone well at he free dinner and breakfast the following morning.  The kids thought the indoor/outdoor pool was the coolest!  The manager was awesome, very accommodating and eager to help two moms traveling with a zillion kids.Great for families!  Rooms were updated and the bedding was nice.Kudos for being very family and pet friendly!  We stopped at the Drury Inn &amp; Suites in Nashville to break up a long drive from Florida to Chicago, with two large (75 and 90 lbs.) dogs.  Dogs are welcome and there is no extra fee! On top of that, the hotel is clean, the staff is friendly, and they have a great dinner and breakfast buffet!  Upon arrival, we were each given a ticket for three free drinks at the bar!  A glass of wine (or two, or three) and a free buffet meant that we didnt have to venture out for dinner (even though several places to eat are w/in walking distance) after a long drive.This will be our regular stop as we make this trip twice year.","I am so disappointed in this hotel. I booked a room for one night after reading all the great reviews. When we arrived too late for the finger food and drinks, they just said I am sorry. The bed and pillows in the room were the worst I have ever slept on. The transportation provided by hotel was a reasonable price at 10.00 pp roundtrip downtown but they also pick up other people at other locations so you get there and come back later than you think. We had a full load going back and the person sitting up front turned the radion up all the way and was a miserable ride back. The breakfast is not good at all down to the coffee. You are better off going to a fast food restaurant. There is no bar or alcohol available. I will never go back. I rate this place a 0 and don't believe everything you read.Love this motel. Good breakfast and free dinner and drinks. Will and all front desk employees are the best. Very helpful.Free beerEnough saidThe Pros: This hotel is very conveniently located to the airport - about a 5 minute drive away.  The folks at the front desk were very friendly and helpful.  They recommended a restaurant nearby that turned out to be a great experience.  The rooms were clean and the decor was nice enough.  We were on the sixth floor and it was pretty quiet. The downsides were that the AC in our room could never get the room cool enough and I woke up in a sweat twice, despite eventually setting the thermostat at 62! The hotel had only one elevator to serve six floors of rooms. While most hotels have queen size beds in their two-bed rooms, these guys use only double beds which totally sucked since my husband and I are used to sleeping on a queen.  The breakfast offered a lot of different items but the gravy tasted like it was made from a powdered gravy mix - pretty gross.  Also, the sliding door leading into the lobby was rather narrow, especially if you are dragging a suitcase or two behind you. Very awkward.This is a great spot to stay for a visit to Nashville.  It's well located, the rooms are clean and roomy plus they have so many free amenities, I'm sure I can't even name them all!  I especially enjoyed the breakfast and the Kick-back hour.  They had much better food selections than I'd imagined plus, for KBH you get three free alcoholic drinks!!  For breakfast, I loved the sausage biscuits, eggs with ham and waffles.  For KBH I had chicken strips, some soup, nachos and salad.  There are plenty of things to do in Nashville, but it's nice to have a little down time.  After this experience, I'll be sure to stay at a Drury for my next visit.This is my first time staying at a Drury Inn and I was very impressed.  The lobby was very cleanly decorated and welcoming.  The staff was friendly throughout our stay.  The rooms were clean and there was a free gym and indoor pool.Most impressive were the free hot breakfast, the free food in the evenings, and free snacks throughout the evening and nights.  The breakfast was actually good - eggs, biscuits, sausage, and gravy, in addition to the normal continental breakfast items, plus waffle irons where you can make your own waffles.  I can't speak for the free ""kickback"" and snacks in the evening because I got in late, but I've heard great things and I saw them clearing up the popcorn just as I checked in, so I'm sure it was a good time.The staff was extremely courteous and helpful.  We stayed for $100 per night, which is a good deal when you look at the surrounding area and especially considering what they have to offer.I've heard good things about Drury Inn in general, and would recommend anyone to check them out as a hotel option throughout the US.This hotel is awesome! They have a friendly and very accommodating staff. Our suite was huge and VERY clean (I'm talking grout lines and bathroom tile corners clean) it was like the place was brand new. My kids LOVED the pool. The free breakfast and dinners were freshly made and very good, not at all what we expected for it being free. Oh, and the bonus three free drinks per guest per day was pretty sweet too! Oh oh! And they have free soft drinks/water/coffee AND popcorn almost all day!! This place was great. We'll only be staying at drury hotels from now on...we actually kept saying that during our stay. :)Good rate for a pretty nice suite.  I trusted the Yelp reviews and they didn't fail me here.  I had to find a last minute place to stay and found a winner.The suite ($125 or less with military discount) was clean and modern.  A tv in the room and living area.  The only knock in this was that the tvs were using coax/analog for some reason so the picture quality wasn't that great for those techno heads out there.  There was plenty of space overall.  The bathroom area had all the stuff you'd expect from a nice place including marble counters and flooring.Wired LAN and wifi net service free and fast.Another plus was that it was super close to the airport.This place is awesome! Free drinks, dinner, and breakfast! Plus, pets are free! It's very clean, too! I would absolutely recommend this hotel!Very clean lobby and rooms. Breakfast and evening food bars exceptional. Staff goes over and above to be friendly, helpful and accommodating. Best Drury I've stayed in yet. I highly recommend this location.Dogs barking at night. Not very restful. At $146.00 for the two of us. We won't stay at another Drury Inn.Beware pets are on same floor as non-pet customers.  Hearing dogs barking is not what we signed up for.We LOVED our stay at the Drury Inn!!I came to Nashville for a girls weekend, and we picked Drury since it was inexpensive, right off the interstate, and had tons of perks. In addition to a free hot breakfast, it also has a ""kick back"" hour with things like free chili, loaded potatoes, pigs in a blanket, and chips. When we checked in, we also got a card for free alcohol each night! How can you go wrong with two free hot meals AND drinks? Other than that, everything was great - rooms were clean and had enormous TVs, and all of the staff we encountered were super responsive and helpful. Also, for an airport hotel, we never noticed any noise. For the price, this hotel really can't be beat!Pet friendly. Free cocktails and hot appetizers. Free hot breakfast. Clean and spacious rooms. Wil definitely come back on our roadtrips from chicago to Georgia.Do not be fooled by any effusive praise you may have seen for this property.  I wanted to give the Drury name a chance, as I usually stay at Hamptons whenever traveling for business.  I could not have been more disappointed.  First, I had to kill a large tentacled insect within the first 10 minutes in my room.  Also, upon my arrival, I was disgusted to find that my room toilet had not been flushed after having been presumably used by the housekeeper.   Things only went downhill from here.  The fire alarm sounded twice later that evening. I politely inquired with the front desk attendant ""Mike"" as to the nature of the problem.  He was outrageously rude, stating repeatedly that ""if there had been a fire sir, it would have stayed on.""  Translation? ""Are you stupid, pal?""  He also volunteered that kids play with the fire alarm a lot, and he even bickered with me that it wasn't at all embarrassing to the hotel.   The next day, I spoke with the General Manager ""Tim"" who did nothing but defend his employee and offer no apology for my bad experience.  All he offered was ""I understand you thought Mike spoke rudely, but we've never heard anyone say that before.""  Translation?  ""We're not all that interested in customer feedback.""  Message received loud and clear.  I will never stay there again.  By the way,   breakfast consisted of flavorless scrambled eggs and sub-par coffee.  The windows in the room resemble something one might see in a jail cell.  The nightly nibbles consisted of hot dogs, industrial strength chicken nuggets, and other unhealthful fare.  The decor is old and the lobby is terribly cramped.It is just 15 minutes away from the airport to this hotel/suite. I have heard a lot of positive feedback about this nice and affordable hotel. This southern-based hotel chain has the exquisite and breathtaking ambience of a hotel should feature. It is quite possibly the best looking and nicest hotel in Nashville. Sorry, If I had to compare to the hotel in SF, it will be Hotel Nikko,which is also my favorite.They have a special on a suite for $109.00 a night. The room has one large bed for my linebacker's frame body, a whirlpool and a satellite dish. We requested two rooms,because I'm a huge snorer. (Strong-advisory, never sleep with me,because I snore like a bear). The suite was cheap enough, why not two rooms.The hotel employees were nice and helpful,also they request to carry our bags,but we are young we can do it. They also valet my rentral-Corolla. I would definitely stay here again, if I come back to Nashville.You kidding! It's a Drury. Rooms have been redone, great location to visit all the Nashville hotspots.This was my first time staying at a Drury Inn and based on my experience I plan to stay at this chain whenever possible.  I'd compare Drury Inns to the Hampton Inn of the Hilton brand...except Drury's are a little better in terms of extras (and more of them let pets stay free!).  They have free internet, free parking (which is accessed by a room key card), an expansive breakfast, some snacks and free drinks in the evenings.  They had a combination indoor/outdoor pool and a small gym.  There are some nice sidewalks along the main road there for walking the pooch.  There are several other hotels and restaurants along the pike, so you should be able to find anything you need within a block or two.  There's a Waffle House across the street and a McDonalds and Wendy's next door.  It was very easy to get on and off the freeway.  With all these free amenities, a decent price, clean rooms and no pet fee, I'd definitely stay here again when I visit Nashville.",,,,"['friendly', 'staff', 'clean', 'rooms', 'good', 'food',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/radisson-hotel-nashville-airport-nashville-2,Radisson Hotel Nashville Airport,3.5,$$,35,"The staff was extremely nice and accommodating. Room was large and clean. Came with free water. I also stayed at the Marriott near here, and this was much nicer and cleaner.Absolutely pleased with Nashville's hospitality and hotel quality. For what I paid, I received service that I would only expect if I paid at least twice as much. Front desk staff were all polite and quick, the hotel location was perfect, and in a nice enough area (I didn't get to explore all that much - just a quick business trip.) my room was super clean, the bed was amazingly comfortable, and the massive desk/tv in the room was too cool: it's the little things that matter. Bottles of water in the room, a bath robe, body wash loofah thing, oh and SLIPPERS! haha. I also liked how there was a bottle opener on the bathroom door frame. A great feature after a long day. I did not get to experience the breakfast unfortunately, I slept in and enjoyed my room as long as possible. I'll be back, hopefully pretty soon.The rooms were fine. The customer service however was atrocious. Every employee there made me feel like I was a huge inconvenience to talk to. There was a lot of trouble at check-in. They couldn't find my reservation and it took over 30 minutes to get checked in. After a 9 hour drive a you want to do is get to a bed and relax. But yet again it felt like that was my fault for them not having my information. And to top it off, I left my expensive pillows in the room (yes. I know.  That was dumb). But they're nowhere to be found, nor did they really want to spend the time looking for them. Or bother to take my description of them both when I called and when I showed up at the front desk. There was one guy who was pretty nice and tried to be accommodating, but everyone else there was pretty lacking in the customer service department. Awful. The only reason I gave two stars is because the rooms were nice and clean and everything worked in them... Except the wifi... Super slow.This hotel sucks. With much better places on the same campus (The 2 Holiday Inns here are great), do not stay here. My colleague booked this dump and compared to other nearby places, its amenities are terrible. The rooms are outdated, have very few electrical outlets and the wallpaper is peeling. There is no self-service coffee in the lobby after 6:30 am and if you get down there after 6:30, expect to wait at the restaurant for a long time AND pay Starbucks prices for a very common cup of coffee.We told the receptionist that we had to leave for the airport at 1pm and he promised us that there would be a shuttle for us at that time. It's currently 1:28pm and there is no shuttle. Not to mention there was one guest ahead of us and they ""lost their information"" and it's New Year's Eve and there is no room for the guest. There's one desk guy and a huge line behind us. Very poor experience.Turned out to be a great choice for a recent visit to Nashville. It was a less expensive option than staying in the main part of the city and by using Uber to get around, we saved quite a bit of money for the lower rates and not renting a car.The complimentary shuttle service picked us up within 10 minutes after arriving in Nashville and was also prompt when it was time to take us back. The printers were beneficial to print off boarding passes and other itinerary materials. Also, free WiFi, which is awesome and every hotel should have that. We didn't use the gym, but did fill up our complimentary bottles of water with the cooler in there! Note: The weather was hot and humid, those free bottles of water were a blessing and more hotels should think about providing this small benefit for their guests!Check-in and check-our were both a breeze and my friend and I were more than pleased with the service we had in the restaurant. The first day we had a sit down breakfast there with prices being very reasonable and a server who was super sweet. The next day we were more in a hurry and decided to grab a bagel to go. Not only did our sweet server give us a bagel (two each!), he also put in a small fruit salad and coffee in a convenient to-go carton at no extra charge. The only drawbacks were that the bathroom wallpaper was peeling and our tub drained so slowly, as in standing in shallow water by the end of the shower. The beds were comfy though and the room a good size. For the price and convenience, would definitely recommend.Decent hotel. Nothing impressive. Small beds and no refrigerator in the room. There's a shuttle bus that brings you dt every hour which was nice. Since it is close to the airport you can hear the planes but it's not that loud where it bothersome. Most likely will not stay here again.Friendly staff and free wifi couldn't overcome the sad room that was desperately in need of renovation and overpriced for $160 / night.Hotel is dated and not maintained to the typical Radisson standards.  Restrutant poorly run - staff was disinterested in service to the customer.  Too many other choices in Nashville to book this one.Two girlfriends and I just got back from a spur of the moment trip to Nashville. We booked our trip through AAA and got an awesome deal! Our room was very nice, clean and exactly what we were expecting. The staff was incredibly nice! Huge thanks to Matt for letting us check in super early! We took a red eye on a Wednesday night which meant we arrived at 5:15am in Nashville. But that's 3am in California time for us. And who really gets any sleep on planes!? Also, Janice at the front desk was incredibly sweet and attentive to us during our stay. Any time I called the front desk requesting towels, spoons, coffee pods...it was brought to our room instantly! This hotel does offer a free shuttle to and from the airport and within a 3 mile radius. And is about a 10-15 minute drive to downtown. We just used lyft while we were there and it worked out great.A fairly typical Radisson that is far away from everything (other than the airport) and not very memorable. That being said, the staff was lovely and the room was comfortable and in the end, if you picked a Radisson, that's what you were looking for anyway, right?Very nice people. Very scary physical plant as evidenced by the post apocalyptic deterioration outside my window.So this is the last morning of our 3 night stay and overall I'm disappointed.Location is great, and the Staff is friendly. First the continental breakfast is a joke, super  8 has a better spread for 1/3rd the cost. It goes from 4AM to 6AM. That's it. It is a tiny table with coffee, hot water and tea bags, only a handful of coffee creamers, 6 trail mix breakfast bars, bruised bananas and a few apples. Now the reason for this crumby breakfast is because they want you to eat breakfast at the restaurant which is awfully overcharged. We paid over $5 to get 2 coffees, $2 for 3 small pieces of bacon, almost $8 for 2 servings of oatmeal, and almost $4 for a bagel. To make this worse my coffee was refilled only once and I had to chase the waitress down to get it. It was slow and she clearly didn't want to work hard for a tip. Here's a tip, work harder!Next, the sleep number beds was a selling point for me to come here, until I got here and found my bed to be slightly busted. The control would light up but the bed didn't seem to change from soft to firm. When you call down to the desk, they suggest you push hard on the remote. Very dissatisfying since that was a factor in having me come here. Seeing as how I'm not the only sleep number complaint on here maybe you should look into that.What hotel doesn't come with a microwave in the room, and they charge a ridiculous $10 to rent one.Parking is great in proximity to doors, rooms, and elevators. Bedding, bathroom and surfaces are clean but the carpet is gross, there were someone's toe nail clippings on the floor in front of the nightstand, I stepped on one and it stuck to my sock, when I realized what I picked up I was disgusted!Not that this matters to me much but they don't vacuum the elevators either, at least not in the 3 days I've been here.Pool open from 7am-10pm according to the sign on the door, not true they locked it early and I was unable to use it by the time the front desk dealt  with it.Valeria and Jeremy greeted us as we arrived and they were amazing! We were tired from driving and asked if we could check in early. Valerie and Jeremy were so nice and accommodating, they found us a room that was ready and let us check in! We were thrilled! We had such a exhausting week, it was nice to get in early! The next day we ask for a late check out and again Valerie and Jeremy came to the rescue. They gave us a late checkout and we did not have to rush. I just want to say thank you Radisson Nashville, we have stayed here before and we always enjoy our stay with you! I always leave your hotel ""HAPPY"" you have a nice hotel with clean rooms, a good breakfast, great front dest associates, a nice bar, it's close to the airport, I also enjoy the indoor pool!I had a great stay. This is what Radisson is supposed to be! Unlike the on by Disneyland. I would stay here anytime.After my initial review, the manager surprisingly called me and offered to change me to a new room.  He mentioned that the 5th floor is close to a building fan and it can be loud.  So avoid the 5th floor.  He set me up on the 7th floor and included a hand written note and complimentary breakfast ticket (classy). BUT, later that evening the room next to me was having a raucous party.  10 years ago I would have been the one having the noisy party, but I am old and cranky now.  I need my damn sleep! It is the airport radison, for ppl with early flights.  So as much as I felt like a tattle tale, I called the front desk asking them to ask the room next to me to quiet down.  After an hour, it was still loud AF.  I called again and the girl at the front desk said they tried to contact the room but had no answer.  Kinda a lame response.  How about send someone up there.  They were partying with their door open.  She then offered to change me back to the 5th floor.  I was so tired and annoyed, I agreed to it.  despite the manager's effort to clear things up for me initially, I still would not return here.  I hate writing crappy reviews, but I cant front.  Again on the plus side, the beds are AMAZING.  So if you do stay, stear clear of the 5th floor and hope you are not next to party.While I did not actually stay the night as a guest here, I spent my entire day in your restaurant and lobby instead of my own hotel's lack of accommodations. We were all  iced in! The staff was very short today (due to the terrible road conditions) but they handled it very well. The restaurant service was VERY slow but the 3 waitresses that were there were working their tails off! Good food, good environment. I recommend staying here/eating here or anything! The pool was also very nice.We stayed here a few weeks ago for the CMA Fest... at first we were a little annoyed about not being able to stay downtown, but honestly, I'd stay out near the airport again anytime. The drive to get downtown was no more than 10-15 minutes, even when the traffic was ""heavy"". I use quotes b/c what you Nashvillians consider ""heavy traffic"" is nothing compared to where I'm from! The trip to &amp; from the fest was a breeze, no matter the time of day.I knock off 1 star for a few reasons... Sleep Number beds. This, dear Radisson, is NOT a selling point. These beds suck. Mine was broken, first of all, so I couldn't even see the number on the little dial-gadget-thingie, but honestly I think these beds are just really freaking expensive air mattresses. I tried a bunch of different settings and never did find one that was comfortable. Granted, I couldn't see the setting I was on, but I could feel the air going up &amp; down and it was never, ever soft.Lack of toilet paper. Seems like a weird thing to complain about. But, 2 girls staying in 1 hotel room for 3 days, yeah, we need some TP. I had to go steal some off of the maid carts every morning, because for some reason, whenever the maids would make up our room, they wouldn't leave us any TP. Weird.Overall I'd definitely stay here again, but I'd rather they not have those Sleep Number beds. All the staff that we dealt with was friendly, rooms were clean, it was really quiet, etc. ... Free wi-fi is a bonus as apparently my cell phone and Nashville do not get along at all. Not much else you can ask from a hotel except for the basics and they did that part well!The Radisson Nashville Airport is exactly what you hope an airport hotel to be.  Which is generally a good thing, if you know what to expect.  A quick breakdown of the hotel experience:The Good:+ Very prompt shuttle service to the airport (which is 5 minutes away).+ Friendly staff.+ Sleep number beds don't really do much for me.  But if you're into that kind of thing, they have 'em.+ Can't hear the planes flying by.+ Reasonable walking distance (if you don't have a rental car) to fast food (KFC, McDonald's) or a K-Mart (which does not have fresh food, but is a place you can buy some water to save a few bucks).+ Approximately 15 minute drive to Opryland, and downtown Nashville.+ Free WiFi was relatively fast, and didn't make you re-login every 5 minutes.+ Nice flatscreen TV with a decent selection of channels.The Bad:- Why can't hotels do the soundproof door thing right?  This hotel clearly figured out how to keep the outside noise out (see ""The Good"").  Why then can I hear every single noise from the hallway?  Like every single noise.  I could hear conversations going on 50 feet away from my door.  That's not okay.  Since you're in an airport hotel, this means you will inevitably hear someone opening/shutting their door for their 5AM flight, when you're trying to squeeze in a little more sleep.- Charging $7.75 for a breakfast buffet when you can get a free version (granted, which sucks more) at a sister property just down the street (Country Inn &amp; Suites).- Piss poor recognition of Club Carlson elite members.  I don't expect you to roll out the red carpet, but giving me a bottle of water, and some weird candy that wasn't sealed is not enough.- Computers that are so slow that I wondered if: a) someone watched a lot of porno on them and now they are full of viruses, or b) they bought the computers in 1986 and never updated.Clean, nice amenities, big pool, large fitness area. My room had a sectioned-off work space. The bed is large and comfortable. The TV was NOT HD. Bummer. Friendly staff. Bar and grill/room service prices were a bit high, but not unusually so.","Stayed here for New Years Eve events and had a very enjoyable stay.  Couldn't beat it for the price.  Very clean, nice rooms and every time we needed something from the front desk, the employees were beyond helpful and friendly.  They went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed.  If you're staying here to visit the downtown area frequently, I do not recommend it.  It was at least a $25 cab ride every time we went downtown and back.  Same with going to Opry Land.  It's only a 15 minute drive but the cab fares add up.  However, there was a free shuttle to and from the airport.  Not a fan of the sleep number beds.  Ours was difficult to work and we couldn't get them so that it was comfortable.  However, free WIFI, microwave and fridge in the room and good service!This place earns 5 stars for service, 5 stars for cleanliness in rooms and common areas, and 5 stars for affordability. I think that's about 15 stars. Too bad Yelp only has a 5 star limit.Their free shuttle service to/from the airport also drives anywhere within about 3 miles of the hotel and gives rides to the airport every half hour. Unfortunately for us, the shuttle left early and we weren't super pleased - however moments later the manager came out and personally gave us a ride to the airport in his car. This is above and beyond service!!!!!! We'll be back just because of this hospitality.A few hints:The breakfast buffet is surprisingly good and about $7.The place is right across the street from Waffle House and Shoney's if hotel food isn't your thing.Save money staying here and cab it downtown, just make sure they use the meter instead of the flat rate. It's about $25 each way including tip.They have an indoor pool and outdoor deck. Not bad.They have a hotel bar. It's not huge, but it's there. Having a bar is always a plus.Great rates for USAA (military) members.Rooms &amp; Lobby areas were clean and nice. It looks like they've recently renovated.$1 snacks &amp; meds at the front desk. Midnight snack, anyone?FREE WiFi. I could stream Hulu on it even.I'd definitely recommend this spot. Try it out!I have only stayed here a couple of times, but have been pleased each time. It's a great place to stay when flying out of Nashville. I have used their parking/shuttle service numerous times. It is cheap and efficient. This service is the reason for the 5 star review! On my last trip I lost my watch somewhere along the way. It was not expensive, but had belonged to my grandmother, so very, very special to me. I called the hotel and the shuttle driver had found it. They not only had kept it, but then mailed it to me at no charge. How great was that?!!  In my book.... these guys rock!!!This is a nice hotel very close to the airport.....and fortunately only 5 minute drive to Opryland.  They also have the sleep number beds - mine's a 30.  They have all the traditional Radisson amenities, there was a hockey tournament on the weekend we were there, so unfortunately there were 16 - 18 year old kids running around like crazy, management did a pretty good job of shutting them up though.Basic room. A little worn. My room opened to a roof with klieg lights shining bright. Still filtered through the curtains. Small but functional workout room. Cardio and weight bench with rack of dumbbells and cable machine. Breakfast until 11:00am on Sunday. Basic. Eggs, bacon, potatoes, grits, biscuits and gravy, cereal, toast and muffins. Best employee in the hotel is a waiter I have seen several times. Asian man who goes overboard to help. Don't have his name but he has been there every time I have. Hotel 5 min from airport.----see update below----Dirty, Outdated, and Sleep Number beds that do not work.  I'm sleeping on a hard air mattress.  I am here on business, the room is direct billed.  For some reason direct bill seems to be a hit or miss but it seems that this hotel missed COMPLETELY.  Also, tried to be on the ball and send my cc auth form in the day prior to be prepared and of course it wasn't processed and neither was the direct bill.  Took me more than 45 minutes to get checked in. The girls at the front desk were super friendly though and that makes up for everything.  Customer Service goes a long way. Tea in the room, but its all decaffeinated and in the morning for someone who does not drink coffee, caffeine would be appreciated.  The AC was set at 68 so I turned it up to 75 as I was freezing!! The heat came on....?!?!  So I turned it back down and of course it was too cold.  Decided to just put a sweater on.  Thank goodness I brought one! There is a 37in Flat Screen TV which is nice.  The Sleep number bed is set on VERY FIRM- the remote wont even turn on to change it to something SOFTER.  I HATE SLEEP NUMBER BEDS! If I wanted to sleep on an air mattress I wouldn't be in a hotel. :) But then again I'm not paying for this room....but I have to be here for a week so this could be a long week! WiFi is very spotty, but its FREE!!! Daydreaming of sleeping on a WONDERFUL bed in the Hyatt Place that I get to stare at from out my window!!! There is a nice swimming pool though. *******Radisson also has a Yelp Deal at Check In for an extra 500 Gold Points Plus Points, but its been forever since I've stayed in a Radisson and I certainly do not subscribe to their rewards program.  But its great they offer that to Yelp Members!-----------------UPDATE-----------------OK, so I'm editing my earlier review of the Radisson here in Nashville Airport.  I am blown away by the response I have received from the hotel since I posted this review.  They pay attention and its very evident that Customer Service and Guest Satisfaction is important. This morning I went to have a complimentary continental breakfast- it was good. The service was great! I left and went on with my work day- I had no idea that I would have such a fantastic response from the hotel to rectify my experience when I posted my review last night, but its much appreciated!  I got back to my hotel this evening to a very nice note from the Manager, Connie. She wanted to be sure that anything wrong was addressed and that I was satisfied!  She also extended a phone call to me and asked me if there was anything specific she could make right for me.  The sleep number bed isn't something that can change, but I let her know about my tea preference and also let her know that while I was gone today, tea was not replaced by housekeeping.  I left my room briefly and came back and a platter of assorted teas along with a fruit and cheese platter was delivered within just a few minutes of me arriving back to my room.  To me this is ABOVE and BEYOND and I could not be more appreciative of the manager here for making my satisfaction a priority. She also addressed the direct bill issue, and that issue is a two way street, but she assured me that she will be working with my company to be sure that everything is done correctly in the future!  We have a very good rate with the Radisson and I know that we use them when others come in to town.  I'm completely impressed by the Customer Service I have received and I have changed my rating to reflect my satisfaction. From the beginning the Customer Service and the friendliness of the staff have been great- I would be happy to stay here again for this fact alone. Thank you Radisson for being so very concerned about your Customers' needs and expectations.Very comfy room, clean, free wifi cable tvFriendly staff. Not a lot of 'style'here but a great hotel nonetheless. Easy access to highway. Love the sleep # beds nice surprise there. The hallway was a little dingy but the room was lovely . Great location too.At first, it seemed like a no-frills room. Very clean. No fridge or microwave. BUT... They do have sleep number beds. I've never seen those in a hotel before.I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. We arrived at 4:30 AM and, remarkably, they were able to give us an available room! That alone made me really happy, but the room was also clean and comfortable with free wifi (always a plus). I wasn't a big fan of the sleep number bed, but I don't know if it was because there was actually something wrong with the bed, or if my husband just set it to ""deflated balloon"" on purpose. Overall, a satisfying experience.As hotels go, and this is an airport hotel, this one is vgood. CLEAN, quiet and friendly staff. Even the TV worked.What more do you need. I am not a fan of sleep number beds and I think this would be the only negative. Did not try the food and went out early in the morning. They had good hot coffee and grab and go for us V early people. A place well run.Nice room, not a place I would usually stay. Probably stay closer to downtown, but the sleep# bed will make up for it later. See if it's better than our temperpedic ergo cloud. The remote for the bed was hard to use, didn't wanna work. Got to push the buttons way down. Okay, finishing this review, our bed was better. Free wi-fi and breakfast for 2 was nice. Hotel is right by I-40 and the airport  and only 7-8 mi. From downtown. Considering it's location, outside noise was minimal. Didn't use the pool or weight room, but peeked in and both seemed nice. All the staff we encountered were nice. Booked on priceline for the sleep# bed, but had us for a double on arrival, desk clerk changed with no problems. Overall I'd say this is a great place to stay, no matter where you are going in the Nashville area.This hotel was really nice.  The rooms were really clean and the bed super comfortable.  The complimentary breakfast was delicious and the waitress was really nice.  The shuttle to the airport was really convenient.  My only complaint is that they didn't have any movies available for purchase on the tvs - I really wanted to watch a comedy or action movie but was stuck watching whatever was running on a really limited number of channels.Nice room, pleasant staff...not a thing wrong w/ this place.  Make sure to check out the continental breakfast in their restaurant (free w/ room...ask for coupon at front desk...unless you booked via Priceline, etc...in that case, just tell your server that you weren't given a coupon, no problem).Hmm...now why a hotel near the hospital would decide to under staff during the evening check in shift was a bit mind boggling.  The best part about my stay: They had sleep number beds!  The worst part about my stay: I realized I didn't really like the sleep number bed.Between the bed, the nice chairs, and the free wifi, this was almost the perfect hotel for the all functions no

We did exactly everything that Porter recommended based on what we told him our crew liked and he tailored everything to us. Cheryl was so sweet in checking us in and making sure we had everything we needed. The hotel manager (?) Cecilia sat back and let them do their work without micro managing and was sweet about Porter taking extra time talking to us. We are very happy campers here!This was a one-night stop for us on a road trip. We spent very little time at the hotel, in full transparency. After checking in, we dropped our bags off at the room and then went to the front desk to ask about a local bar and its proximity to the hotel. I think we got a little snowed -- we asked about walking; the hotel clerk said we should take a taxi and then connected us with one who happened to be in the lobby. Regardless, the room was nice enough and the included breakfast was satisfactory.Location can be sketchy at night. Parking is tough even if you valet. The rooms are oversized which is nice. Hotel is nice. Staff is very friendly. Carpet in our room was torn as if an animal had chewed it?Seemed a little rough. Food and drinks in the evening is nice.My wife and I checked in for a long weekend and we were very happy with the hotel,location and the staff who were all great. I didn't encounter one negative employee from the hotel the entire weekend in fact everyone went out of their way to be friendly. The people at the front desk, the valet drivers as well as the cleaners were great.My family stayed here the weekend of the Nashville marathon and were in a standard room with one king size bed.  I selected Homewood Suites based off my stay at their airport location which is brand new and very nice and spacious.  Unlike this location which is older and much much smaller. Our room might have been 400 sq feet.  Also no bathtub only a shower and after a 1:2 marathon I wanted to soak in a tub! Pros: The room and hotel are very clean with good linens, mattress and pillows. Homelike set up with kitchen- great to cook up a meal or heat up leftovers. Free breakfast that is top notch - waffles, biscuits, potatoes, gravy, sausage along with cereal- fresh fruit and many pastries.  They even had a special breakfast set up for us running the race - very thoughtful! Location: right downtown and can easily walk to everythingFriendly staff - easy check inCons: $336 a night- usually at this price point the hotel will have more amenities such as a spa and restaurants and larger rooms. Fridge made loud noise all night long No free parking / $29 a day to parkNo restaurant inside hotelWe've never had a bad experience at Homewood Suites, but the staff at this one went above &amp; beyond when it came to flexibility, being courteous &amp; those 'little touches' that made us feel very welcome &amp; comfortable. The one bdrm had plenty of space, and the free breakfast had lots to choose from, including hot items. Fast, convenient valet parking &amp; Morton's next door. This will always be our hotel choice in Nashville.We were very pleased with this hotel. We got a great price on a suite with a king bed and fold out couch. The complementary breakfast was very good with real eggs, bacon and other health choices. Most impressive was the staff. A woman from Toronto, who was in Nashville for her birthday had had numerous problems with her visa and flights. The staff brought her mimosa and sang happy birthday. Everyone, staff and guests posed for selfies with the birthday girl. Location is good, rooms are comfortable and the staff are friendly... what more can one ask for.The rooms are pretty standard for what you would expect from any decent hotel room except they have upgraded features like a pull out couch and full kitchen. I started having issues with this long ordeal from the minute I made my reservation. I set up an HH Honors account because I didn't have one at the time of reservation. I called a few days later to a hotel in Boston that I needed to reserve which was also a Hilton. They couldn't find me in the system and had to re-create my account. When I checked in, they still didn't have my account on file and I said just forget it.Then about a month before arriving, I happened to be looking at my email and realized that they booked me for a King Suite instead of Double Queens as requested. After numerous calls to the hotel, central booking, and different managers (total runaround) I was finally told that all they have is 5 rooms with 2 beds in them (that's insane) and that they were all booked. After countless time arguing, they agreed that I would be upgraded if one became available at no additional charge. Otherwise we would be stuck with a King bed and a pullout couch for the 4 guests. Not the end of the world but, not the ideal sleeping arrangements I had in mind for the money.They day of arrival, I call ahead to see what was going on. They had no idea what I was talking about and had to scramble and call me back after speaking with a manager. They said there was no double room available but one would be the next morning and that they would move us. I then arrived at the hotel a few hours later to check in. My other guests had arrived before me due to a flight delay and I asked that they be let into the room. Once they checked in, I instantly had a hold on my debit card for the entire amount of the stay plus my guests parking for the entire stay... What! First of all, they should have waited for me to arrive to authorize anything on MY card because I would have gladly given them a credit card for incidentals instead of putting an $850 hold on my debit card. I've also never heard of a hotel charging the entire fee upfront for a hotel stay instead of just incidentals and I've stayed at hundreds of hotels.Gabrielle at the desk apologized for all the mistakes and assured me that the manager would be notified and that we would be well taken care of after all this. he implied we would definitely be moved to a larger room in the morning and even said he would be my ""personal concierge for the weekend if anything else went wrong or for anything I needed"". I thought that was a nice touch and felt assured that things would get better from here.The next morning I called down to see about us moving rooms. Again, nobody had any idea what was going on. I asked for Gabe, my new personal concierge as of the day before, and was told he was working the night shift and would be in from 11pm-7am... not so helpful. I ended up back on the phone with Miguel, the manager who I spoke to initially upon realizing the room issue a month before checking in. He let me know that Gabe was mistaken and that he should not have said we would be moving rooms because nothing else was available.At this point I was furious and we went back and forth about terrible communication amongst staff and how he needed to make this right. Eventually he called me back with a solution. The moment he said ""upcharge"" I told him absolutely not but, he recommended I hear him out. He said the fee would only be $20 extra per night, and he would put us in two adjoining King Suites for basically an additional $40 (two more nights of our stay). My party and I all agreed this would be a much better situation compared to cramming into one room and having two people sleep on a pull-out. From here on out, our stay was great. We had plenty of room to spread out and no other issues. The location is perfect for getting around downtown. Breakfast was unimpressive but it's free so.... no biggie. One day we came back to the room at 3:30pm and had been gone all day only to find that they were still servicing our rooms. Had to wait in the hall for ten minutes while they finished up. Lastly, everyone is right about there being no whirlpool even though it says there is.Miguel did finally take care of us and made our stay enjoyable. Unfortunately, it took so much teeth pulling and  too many aggravating conversations. The whole situation should have been handled better from the start. We all knew in advance that there was an issue but instead of being proactive and trying to resolve the problem before I arrived, they put it on hold to figure it out when I got there. Reactive customer service is never the best option. Imagine my excitement to check in to my room only to find out that they gave us the same situation without all the arguing. I would probably be writing a 5 star review saying how thoughtful they were. They had the ability to do this but instead, opted to turn the whole thing into a negative experience.Had a great stay here. After cancelling a reservation at the Sheraton Downtown Nashville (see previous review), for not being able to guarantee a refrigerator for me (I am a nursing mom), Homewood Suites provided an exceptional customer experience, complete with a fridge!!Staff was awesome - night manager was super sweet, helping my friends and I order a pizza when we came in..uh..late. Hotel lobby is so beautiful and the rooms themselves were clean and spacious; cleaning staff were exceptionally friendly! Finally, the complimentary breakfast was delicious. If ever back in Nashville, there is no question where I will be staying.I liked the little Yoda towel they made on the counter for us to find. Plenty of room to fit four people. Breakfast here was okay.Clean hotel with nice lobby, dining area, and hot food available for breakfast and dinner. It is only a few blocks from the Broadway area, although there isn't much in the immediate blocks for dining and entertainment. There is a free WiFi option, expensive valet parking, and an exercise room. The staff was very polite and helpful!The suite was in three sections (bedroom, bathroom, lounge/study) as opposed to an open plan. This is good for not disturbing others, but makes the rooms small. The heating / cooling ran constantly. And I didn't like having my window facing the lobby 'cause even on the second floor there was no privacy, no natural light, and I had to keep the shades closed.I would stay here again (on business only) but want a window to the outside world.Good locating downtown. The staff on the front desk were first rate. Breakfast is included. There is also free wifi. My only beef is the noise from the front street so get an inside room.My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel 3 weeks ago. The suites were comfortable and clean. The front desk staff provided fantastic service and made great recommendations for dinner and things to do during our stay. Your stay during the week includes decent meals and a cocktail hour. While it isn't fine dining it is great for catching a quick bite. The first room we checked in to needed a/c repairs so we had no choice but to move (after unpacking of course). This was disappointing but they discounted our stay each night by $50 which was more than generous.The location of this hotel is fantastic for a tourist. It is in walking distance of the ""Honky Tonk"" bars and a short cab ride to the trendy ""Gulch"" area. I would recommend this hotel and I would stay again. I had exceptional service from 2 employees in particular, but unfortunately I did not write down their names!PROS--Room was huge, had a living room and pullout couch.--All the amenities in the room: coffee pot, full sized fridge, stove, dishes, tupperware, even a toaster oven!--Free Breakfast! --Great location: short walk to Broadway and all the Honky Tonk bars, Ryman Auditorium, etc.CONS--Breakfast ends kind of early and the food offerings are nothing to write home about (bagels, toast, yogurt, eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc.).--Customer service was not great, once had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to come out, it's literally your job to stand there. YOU HAD ONE JOB.--OH HEY WHERE'S THE WHIRPOOL? Maybe you SAW THE WHIRLPOOL ADVERTISED ON THE WEBSITE, brought a bathing suit, and after a long day of walking around, you put it on and wrap a towel around your waist, and FOLLOW THE SIGNS TO THE WHIRLPOOL, and you can't find it. So you wait 10 minutes for the hotel concierge to remember it's his job to come out and help you, and when you ask where the whirlpool is, he just says, oh yea we don't have one. And when we tell you it's kind of not a great idea to have a sign for a whirlpool and information about it on your website, you just shrug and are no help at all. That's cool. Maybe you should just ride the elevator back up to your room in your bathing suit and towel.For how expensive this place is, I'd expect better customer service. We only stayed here because we had points.For the price, having the refrigerator and stove was totally NOT worth it. I would suggesting AIR BnB if you really needed it. This hotel is locate pretty centrally inside of downtown Nashville, but it still requires you to drive all around the city if you are interested in doing lots of sight seeing. At $24/day for valet parking, I would highly suggesting just staying outside of downtown and paying for parking for a day inside downtown. You will save yourself HUNDREDS, if you paid my rate at over 200/day :-(. stay at the hilton garden inn for about 50/less and eat the difference!Issues at this hotel 1.The Parking situation was HORRIBLE, to say the least. Valet was not always available to take your car and I had to call the front desk 3 different times during my stay to see where the valet was, which leads me to my next two issues.2. Valet person is NOT AVAILABLE from past 12 midnight - 6am. You will need to call the front desk to make arrangements. If you are out late and come back, gosh I don't know what you would do.3. Front desk is slow/unresponsive. 2 of the times I had called, the front desk it was faster for my friend to walk to the front desk to ask than it was for them to pick up the phone. This also happened as we called down to request for our car to be pulled up.4. I found 3 ants in my room..... man if it weren't for the fact that we were leaving early the next morning and had too much to move around, I would have requested for a room change. Ants... really??5. You can hear lots of trains and sirens at night-4th floor6. The alarm went off in the building at 1 in the morning - false alarm that went on for 3-5 mins... It was deafening.then sirens for our building b/c the FD came....If you do choose to stay here regardless, I would say it is pretty shady looking outside at night. There is a mortons one block down an downtown is pretty walkable from where you are at. Pucketts is a good option, and Frothy monkey is just around the corner. You can also walk to the Tenesee State Museum which is free admission and you are also in walking distance of many other landmarks. Again, I recommend you pay the $12 for public parking for one day in downtown and save your money!Silverlining in that the MOD was very kind and really aplogetic, but I still paid over $700 for the hotel due to parking and taxes!!!! I recommend the Hyatt Place near Opryland, or the Hilton Garden Inn down the street if you are an HHonors member. The breakfast is better and the locations are newer.My girlfriends and I met up in Nashville for 5 days of fun and country music. Not knowing that we were going to be amongst snow and ice for days, nearly EVERYTHING in Nashville was closed. Despite this, we were SO lucky we stayed at the Homewood Suites. The staff and manager were BEYOND accommodating and went above and beyond to make our experience something to remember. I have never met such courteous staff in my life!The rooms were great and the breakfast was awesome!I have and would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in downtown Nashville!For the price, this may be my new favorite downtown hotel.  I was here on business the weekend before the 4th of July.  Right smack dab in the middle of a heat wave.  That Friday was actually the hottest day on record in Nashville - ever.  There were times when even walking a few blocks to a restaurant seemed like too much in the heat.  This would have been a major bummer if I was in Nashville for the first time wanting to see the sights, but I come often.  The heat made me truly appreciate the fact that my room had a kitchenette and a couch.  After picking up some groceries (there's a neighborhood grocery store a few blocks down) I could hole up in my room and be just dandy.  I have no complaints about the room at all.  It was smaller than other Homewood Suites rooms I've stayed in, but that's to be expected with a downtown hotel.  The layout was very nice, the bed was good, tv was great with lots of channels, and everything was clean.  As mentioned in a previous review, I think your experience will be better if you get a room with a view, which I had.  The hotel is set up as a square, so the rooms on the inside of the square must not have any windows.  That could drive me batty.  But, I was able to see outside and get some nice light in the room.  And, everyone I encountered was helpful - even the poor valets who were outside in the heat.Breakfast is free every day and they had some pretty good options.  They also do free dinner (set menu) and drinks Sun-Thu I believe.  I was there Thu-Sat nights and didn't partake of dinner on Thu, so can't comment on quality.  The fitness room is small, but nice.I was on government business, so switched to another hotel for Sun &amp; Mon nights because of a better rate.  But, when it comes to regular rates, I believe this hotel is cheaper than most others downtown.  And, for what you get, it's totally worth walking a couple more blocks to get to the hubbub of downtown.  In fact, for sleeping it's even better as it's harder to hear the people down on the street carrying on at all hours. Well done, Homewood.  Hopefully I'll see you again.The hotel staff at the front desk were extremely helpful, accommodating &amp; went above &amp; beyond to ensure our stay was a good one. Brent &amp; Kiera were extremely helpful when there was a snafu with our room reservation ~ very appreciative for their assistance!!! Brent was also very helpful with information on downtown area ~ Thanks so much Brent!!! Room was a king suite with a sleeper sofa ~ nice size CLEAN room with everything we needed at our finger tips! Would definitely recommend this location for a stay in Nashville ~This place was great!  Minus the $28 a night for parking.  They should be ashamed!  That's just rude, inconsiderate and ripping off your customers.  Putting that aside, they do do things to ""kind of "" offset that!  They have free beer &amp; wine every night and full breakfast AND a FULL dinner is offered every day!!!!  ALL the staff was VERY nice!!!  The room did the trick!  It was very clean, had a king bed, pull out couch and FULL kitchen.  Dishwasher &amp; everything!  Made it nice to bring leftovers back to the room &amp; stick in the fridge.  This hotel does not have a bar!  Fyi.  It's walking distance to Broadway street, Bridgestone arena, the Ryman Auditorium etc.  About 4-5 blocks.  The state Capitol bldg is about 2 blocks.  Grand Ole Opry is 12 miles away.  Titans stadium is about a 15-20 minute easy walk! 4 stars and not 5 because of the parking charge.  Just absurd &amp; gouging!My family stayed for two days in the middle of the week. My husband and I live within a few hours of Nashville but we had our daughter and friend who wanted to experience Broadway. This was convenient for walking to touristy downtown. We were in a king suite which slept four people. The room, while small, was comfortable enough. We were happy with the hot breakfast and the dinner and refreshments that were served in the evening. All in all we were happy with the room. My reason for less stars was two issues that we had at check in and check out. First, when we checked in (I had made these reservations at least a month ago), my husband asked if by chance they gave a military discount. We don't expect it and it never hurts to ask. The clerk asked the manager that was standing next to her, who answered curtly ""Not this week"" Not this week??  Okay, we didn't even ask what that meant and left it alone, as I said, we don't expect it...we just thought that was a strange answer. Then, at checkout, I asked if they would adjust my rate according to the rate I saw on their website the night before for the same exact room with the same amount of guests. It was a difference of twenty dollars a night. The first clerk (who was so pleasant) turned us over to the next clerk, as she was going on her break, with the apology to the 2nd clerk, ""I'm sorry to do this to you""   I was told 1) It wasn't the same amount of guests (yes, it was I explained)   2) It was a different time of the year  (that I didn't understand, as it was the night before) 3) That perhaps it's because the hotel wasn't at capacity.  The 2nd clerk then turned it to the manager who told us that he could not adjust the price. It was set. I know that is not true. We were not satisfied with the answers but stay was over and we left it at that. The 1st clerk who was outside on her break, was VERY surprised the our request wasn't approved and apologized. Any way, we enjoyed our few days taking in downtown. We will looking at the many other options to stay downtown on our next visit.","A group of 15 stayed here this past weekend and they were excellent. We booked 3 suites and it was ample enough space for everyone split up. I worked with a woman named Jessica in arranging the rooms and check in and she was great. She called us cabs, had wake up calls, etc. She made the experience wonderful. The night person was great as well. He checked us out Sunday morning and helped store our bags so we could walk around a bit before we had to head to the airport.Definitely a good hotel for a big group of people. They were great!8 girls stayed in Nashville on a Friday and Saturday for a bachelorette weekend 2 weeks ago.Negatives:When you arrive at the hotel there is no round about or anywhere to pull your car up while you unload your belongings. They did have valet parking but it was really confusing because there was no where to actually pull your car up and there was no one out there to take your car. We ended up having to park across the street and carry all of our belongings inside. We also asked for a cart to carry all of our things and they simply said they are in the front and if there aren't any then they are all in use and there was nothing they could do. We arrived shortly after 4pm our room was still not ready and check in was at 3pm so we had to wait in the lobby with all of our stuff everywhere since we had no cart. I don't really understand why the room wasn't ready when check in was at 3. The line to check in was really long too. There were multiple people trying to check in or ask a question at the desk. There were two people working at the desk but only one of them was helping customers. I am not sure what the other person was actually doing. After awhile we did get a guy to help us take our stuff to the room. Another negative is there is no view outside in the room. We had two big windows in our room but when you opened them all your could see what the lobby where you check in. It is kind of weird because they are right by the beds too so you would for sure want to keep them closed most of the time.Positives:The complmentary breakfast was very nice. I know one of the girls that stayed with us was sad there was no waffle mix one morning. I enjoyed that the breakfast was free though. As far as how many people you can fit in a room we had 8 girls in the queen queen with pull out sofa. We brought a queen sized air matress too so everyone had a place to sleep. I don't think you would be able to fit very many more people though. You might be able to fit a twin sized air matress if you needed to. The other downside of having that many girls in one room is there are hardly any mirrors to get ready. There is a small sliding mirror where the closet is but its not full size like most are. There was also a mirror over the sink and thats it. We got lucky and the guy that helped with our luggage brought us an extra tall mirror and one of our friends brought a mirror too. Overall our main issues were when we were checking in. Other than that everything went okay and was fine. It was nice to have a full sized fridge to hold all of our beverages and leftover food. There is a microwave too so that was nice! The location was pretty close to broadway. The first night we walked there and it was okay. The second night we ended up taking a taxi just because but we didn't need to. I would stay there again if I was going with a group of friends. The rooms hold alot of people and its nice because then you can split the bill. The cost of this room was very similar to other hotels but you can't fit as many people in one room at the other hotels. If you are going with a big group I would stay at homewood suites.I am an HH member and love Homewood; this was my third stay at a HW hotel. My room was immaculate and had a great view (older building with lots of charm and  close to Nashville attractions). The guy at the desk (Gabriel) was polite and friendly and suggested I go to Puckett's for dinner. By the time I unpacked (I did not get to check in until 7:30), I realized how tired I was. I went back to the desk and asked him if he knew of another place; he gave me some info on restaurants that deliver. He then asked if I wanted a glass of wine (which I did!). Another guest service member chatted with me in the meantime and was friendly. When the desk clerk went to get the wine,  he discovered the dinner buffet was still open and invited me in. Happy as a clam! Really great customer service makes a difference to me. He could clearly see I was beat and went the extra mile to make me feel ""at home"". Thanks, Gabriel!The hotel was A-ok... the parking was terrible.  As most of those who visit Nashville the parking situation is horrible for not that big of a city.  The valet was 24 bucks and their was no attendant as we did a few loops to figure out if their was any self parking.  The entrance to the hotel which is weired smelled terrible the entire first day there, but was cleaned up the following morning.It is pretty expensive for what you receive but having a suite with a kitchen was nice and the location is pretty... walking distance... if your in decent shape from a lot of the hot spots.Also the treadmill and spa were both out of service which was a bummer for us.I wouldn't stay again as Hilton has much better locations normally, but better than a lot of hotels I've stayed at over the years.First off let me say I love Homewood Suites, they are my first choice. I was disappointed with a lot of little things...easy things to fix.  Nothing that a little ""Customer Service"" training couldn't fix. Here is the list of issues...1. Parking, they offer Valet but after waiting 20 minutes we parked our self2. Multiple calls to front desk with no answer3. Taking a reservation on the phone while waiting to check in4. Not telling us we would be in a ""Handicap"" room.5. Not telling us the AC had broken earlier and that the rooms may be a little warm6. Staff members blocking customers pathsNow for the good stuff...1. Room and building are very clean and charming (built in 1928)2. Breakfast was good (stay away from 5 day old gravy)3. Location (very close to many restaurants)4. Beautiful LobbyWe do live in Nashville but wanted to take a mini vacation downtown, catch a Preds game and dinning downtown without having to drive home. This hotel served the purpose but as stated above it could have easily been a four star rating if the staff had been trained properly. I wrote the manager a email about our stay (requested a reply), it's been well over 2 weeks and no email. I have down graded this hotel to a one star due to the lack of management.Our experience with this hotel started out very rough. We were given a room that we did not book and it was a smoking room. We had specifically requested a non smoking room due to 2 girls in our group having asthma. They let us know that they had over booked. We tried to make due and spray the room and open the windows, but when we pulled down the mattress it was dirty. We were very frustrated but I am giving it 3 stars because of their customer services and willingness to rectify the situation. MITCHELL who was on duty that evening was extremely helpful with helping us find another hotel that was available to take us. He was very kind, understanding, and apologetic. He is a great example of what customer service should be.The next morning we spoke with Kevin the GM and he help fix the situation for the rest of the weekend. Even though it started out rough I was very pleased with the hotels ability to uphold the 5 star service of a Hilton brand and correct the mistakes that they made.Not a bad place at all! Downtown Nashville. I only stayed here one night. Rooms are clean and up-to-date. Free parking. Free internet. Free breakfast. What more can I say? I highly recommend this place if you want a safe, comfortable, clean, and good quality hotel to stay.Enjoyed the stay and hospitality.  Total presentation of room and cleanliness were great.  Packaged included breakfast and light diner with choice of complimentary beer and wine.  Access to downtown was walking distance.  Overall would recommend.Located in a great location in downtown Nashville, walking distance to many attractions and local bars.  Only compliants: when we arrived in our room, housekeeping was still cleaning and we had to bring all our things back to the lobby for a 20 minute wait.  We were a later check in, and the front desk had no idea housekeeping wasn't done yet.  Other than the delay, everything else was great.  Breakfast is ok, standard for a hotel, nothing fancy.Gives Downtown a bad name!Worst Nashville Hotel experience ever when it comes to manners, ease of communication or respect in general.   I'm not even speaking of an individual traveling for leasure but for a corporate account that has given this specific location steady business for years!Last fall some visitor who stayed at this location were accosted on their way home.  At gun point.The staff has a ""don't bother me"" attitude and ZERO communication.  Talk about bad business.  I'll make sure everyone I speak to about hotels never gives them the time of day; although they're doing a great job of reflecting that themselves.Two thumbs down!Can't really fault it, stayed only one weekend nite, it was quiet, rooms were spacious and clean, was reasonably close to the downtown attractions.  Very low key, good breakfast in the morning, friendly valet staff.  Only thing was we were driving a rental car in from the airport, and had never been to Nashville before.  Traffic inbound on the Nashville Interstates for a Saturday, sucked unbelievably, and if we had not had a SAT-NAV, it would have taken us a long time for us to eventually find it.I've stayed in far worse downtown metropolitan hotels.  If we ever came back to Nashville, we'd likely stay again.....I was a little iffy on the location of this place. We walked outside after checking in and there were quite a few homeless people and the distinct smell of urine outside. But, hey, it's a city, what do you expect? The location is very close to the main drag of bars and honky tonks on Broadway, which was very convenient. The valet guy was super friendly, and the front desk staff were nice too. While we didn't utilize it, the kitchen area would be nice to have for longer stays. Will definitely check out this Homewood Suites in the future.Horrible hotel!  This hotel is not consistent with the whole experience I'm accustomed to at a Homewood Suites. I was gravely disappointed from moment I arrived.  Parking is inconvenient as it's around the corner from the front door.  The first room I was assigned was already occupied (yes, I almost walked in on someone).  The second room was a handicap room (not my preference but ok), and the heat didn't work in this unusual 16 degree Nashville weather.  The third room (yes in the same night) was descent until the next morning.  My shower was delayed by the fact that the shower handle came totally off when I attempted to turn it on!  Of course I decided to speak to front desk, and the staff person was nice enough and took down my concerns.  After being gone for a work meeting/dinner from 8am-8:30pm, I came back to the room only to find that it had NOT been cleaned all day!  I expected far more from a Hilton property.  I come to Nashville monthly on business, and I will never stay here again.We travel extensively throughout the country and this is the first hotel we've ever stayed at that I can find a single positive thing to say.From the sleeping valet parking attendants  ($20 a day) to the incompetent in-house staff, this place is a real dog. We arrived to check in (two rooms, total of 14 nights) and were informed at check in that the air conditioning wasn't working in the rooms. We were given a voucher to a hotel across the freeway and told we could make one free call! The next day we returned to Homewood and were told our rooms weren't yet ready. I asked why, if the air conditioning was fixed, was our room not ready? Stuttering ensued a we got our rooms a half hour later. Apparently air wasn't the issue; overbooking was. They lied to us. The rooms were small and unremarkable as was the entire facility. There were more homeless hanging around outside the hotel than there were guest inside. A rotten experience at a rotten hotel. General Manger doesn't care and we didn't see him out on the floor ever. Probably hiding from a the unhappy guests. Don't even consider this place---never again for us!A group of four girls and one guy stayed at the Homewood Suites in downtown Nashville while in town for the Country Music Marathon in April 2011. The hotel wasn't fabulous, but it was fine, especially for the location. We were able to walk everywhere. Plus, they don't charge for wi-fi and there's a continental breakfast! I heard they have free dinner and drinks during the week, but we were only there Friday and Saturday nights. I can't comment on the price too much though, just because we were lucky enough to get a pretty decent military discount. I'm not sure how much the hotel normally goes for.The room itself was satisfactory. All the rooms are suites, so ours came with a bedroom (two queen-sized beds), a vanity area, a teeny tiny bathroom and a small living area with a TV, pull-out sleeper couch, desk &amp; chair, and kitchenette. Kind of tight with five people, but hey, it was cheap! There were bathrooms on the floor too (plus!), so we never really had a problem with that.The only issue I want to bring up is that we took out the extra pillows and blankets for the pull-out couch, and they reeked of smoke! I knew we had a smoking room (there were no non-smoking rooms left when we booked) but thought the hotel would have washed the sheets between guests! Gross! Made me wonder what else hadn't been washed... although everything else seemed clean. A hotel employee came upstairs right away with new linens though. The room itself did not smell of smoke, thankfully.Overall, a decent stay. I would stay again if they had non-smoking rooms available.This hotel was good for the price, especially being so close to downtown, having free wi-fi, free breakfast, and some nights free dinner with beer/wine!I didn't have to deal with the parking situation since I took a cab so I can't really comment on that.Some of the rooms are slightly bizarro mishapen (I was in one) but they're still fairly large and very comfortable.For all the free things they throw in, this hotel will definitely get my return business.Room is OK, no real complaints there I really would give it 2 1/2 stars but we can't give 1/2 stars. I love a tub and only have a shower. Not keen on their breakfast offerings, didn't eat it. It is tough eating at a lot of those types of things being lactose intolerant. Typically safer just not to eat it - plus I don't care for all the processed stuff anyway. But really I travel a ton and a gym is important to me and this one is horrible. Treadmill wasn't working, neither was the hot tub, and they don't have any free weights ---- really!?!?!? I have been a loyal Hilton Diamond member for years, but starting to stay at more and more Hyatt hotels because they tend to be better at all levels and brands. Actually, I had to swap hotels mid-stay this trip and I am staying at the Sheraton. They have one of the largest gym facilities I have ever seen at a hotel - saving my workout for tomorrow afternoon/evening and sleeping in now - will hit the gym after work and changing hotels.The rooms were nice, very spacious, clean, and had two nice TV's. But... I don't think I'd stay here again.  The guy at the check-in desk was not very friendly.  I was expecting some southern hospitality.  Parking was off site, about three blocks away.  Normally this wouldn't bother me, but it was COLD, temps in the 30's and I didn't want to walk.  We could have used the valet service for $20 a day, but it doesn't run between midnight and 6 am, we had a flight at 7 am and needed to drop off a rental car.  If I were to return to Nashville, I would have stayed one of the hotels closer to Broadway or come back in the summer.  The parking in Nashville is ample, so staying a little outside of downtown would work too.   The night before we left, we parked in a lot next to the hotel for $5 and we were able to get the car.  Another issue with the offsite parking garage is that it also closes between midnight and 6 am.  So, if you don' t having your car locked up for the night then you'll probably enjoy this hotel.  Otherwise explore other options.Excellent hotel worth every pennyStayed at this hotel when I went to Nashville to see the Ravens vs. Titans playoff game. This hotel was right downtown and was a very easy walk to restaurants and bars. I was just dropped off at the hotel and did not have to worry about parking, but parking seemed a bit tricky and I'm not sure what the situation was or where you were to park. I think there was a parking garage that our room actually was looking out on. I thought this room was fantastic. We had our own kitchen, a sofa, a desk, a flat screen, and a huge COMFY king bed. The best part about it was that the sink and vanity were OUTSIDE the bathroom. One thing I dislike about some hotels is having to get ready on a vanity that is INSIDE a hot steamy bathroom, Everyone we encountered that worked there was friendly and there was a continental breakfast in the morning. This was one of the nicest hotels I have been stayed in, very modern. If you want a place in downtown Nashville with a short walk to restaurants and bars, this could be a place to look into. Very comfy, clean, and convenient.","The hotel is three years old and located in a great part of town, accessible to many venues. Ask for an EXTERIOR room as interior rooms do not have a view of the city.  We had a room which faced Church Street, it was fabulous. Plus with the exterior rooms, you have windows which allow the light in.  Rooms were clean and well appointed.  Staff was friendly and helpful, even when asking to be moved from interior to exterior room. I would stay here again.  We used Hilton Honors points so only paid for self parking which was $9 per day.",,,"['staff', 'especially', 'porter', 'wonderful', 'helpful', 'gracious', 'making', 'exactly', 'exactly', 'everything',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-nashville-vanderbilt-nashville,Holiday Inn Nashville-Vanderbilt,3.5,$$,41,"Stayed here on a few different occasions while friends/family were visiting. I love Holiday Inn's. Great wifi, clean rooms, comfy beds, friendly staff = win win win! There's also a great bar downstairs that often has live music, which is a bonus. It's right next to Vandy so it can get a bit crowded during game days but they have a massive parking lot in the back so parking really is never an issue!This hotel had all of the potential to be a really great hotel, but a few poorly trained employees are really holding them back.  As someone who travels for work a lot, I usually see more of my hotel room or my work site than the sites of a city. So I got a pretty good look at this hotel over three days.First, I don't know the name of the girl who checked me in, but she was awesome. I had a flight that arrived at 6:35 AM, and when I originally called ahead to see if I could check in early, the front desk told me to call in the morning for a more accurate answer. Cool.  I would rather honesty than a made up story. I called as soon as I landed, and the girl on the phone and who checked me in told me  my room was ready. Score.  I got a quick nap before my 11 AM meeting, and I would have been miserable otherwise.The actual room was fine, and it was located on a nice and quiet corner room. I had a king-size bed with king pillows. The pillows were supposedly soft and firm, but I would refer to them as thin and lumpy and no filling at all.  While the pillows definitely needed some work, the actual bed was really comfortable. There was a balcony overlooking the pool, but it would have been really nice if there had been a chair outside to enjoy the balcony more. Last, the bathroom was an OK size with a big mirror and very updated looking.  Unfortunately, my shower seemed to be installed improperly, as the water kept puddling and wouldn't go to the drain.  But I love the Bath and Body Works shampoo and conditioner that Holiday Inns utilize!Wifi was painfully slow and not good for a business traveler.The hotel does have a restaurant that serves breakfast, but it is normally not included with a room. Mine was paid for, but I think it is normally $11.99. It was so not worth that amount, and you should go somewhere else for breakfast if it is not free.Let's move onto the issues with the front desk that began to arise throughout my trip.  While at the beginning they were very attentive, I quickly found that if I wasn't standing at the front desk, I couldn't get anything.  First, the phone is my room did not work.  So I tried using my cell phone at one point.  After sitting on hold for 15 minutes, I walked downstairs. Not 1, not 2, but 3 people at the front desk were standing and doing nothing.  Everyone was very nice and helpful in person so I passed this off as a one time thing. But this was an ongoing problem for the remainder of my 3 day stay.The biggest issue was the hotel shuttle.  I had two exceptional shuttle drivers, one good one, and one that was so bad that he should be fired immediately.  The exceptional and good drivers gave me a hand in and out of the van, immediately passed over their cards, and opened the door for me. I was so impressed!  However, the driver that worked the closing shift on October 30 was appalling.  I was dropped off for work around 6:45. This driver did not introduce himself, didn't get out of the van to acknowledge me, and was rude. Period. When I asked for his name and card, he refused to give it to me. I told him that I would need to be picked up at 10:30 PM but would call.  No acknowledgement. So I called at 10:20, and he told me he would be there in 10-15 minutes. At 10:50 PM I called him again. He told me it would be another 15 minutes. So clearly this guy was out partying or eating and not working.  So I say fine. At 11:05 PM a RANDOM guy offered to walk with me back to the hotel. I ran into a colleague on this walk who walked me the rest of the way. At 11:13 PM, I received a call from the bus driver asking where I was. HA.  What an idiot. I finally made it back to my hotel at 11:24 PM.I tried to call the front desk multiple times throughout this ordeal. Guess who never answered the phone?  So when I got back, I filled them in. The offer to resolve this was a free breakfast (Which I already had but couldn't even use) or a free snack.  While the gesture was nice, the issue was the shuttle driver needs to be resolved.  Your shuttle driver cannot take an hour long hiatus and lie to customers, and the front desk cannot ignore the phone for an hour. Sorry.Would I stay here again?  Depends on the price.  The parking was severely over-priced, and the shuttle was pretty dysfunctional as well.  If you are here 100% recreationally without any firm plans, this hotel will be fine.EDIT:  So I tried to follow up with this incompetent employee Nancy and her supposed Guest Service Manager, Britney Zanders.  Guess what?  No response.  This review has been lowered from 3 to 2 stars.  Thank you, SO MUCH, for wasting even more of my time.The hotel itself is okay, my review really for the restaurant downstairs. We waited about 20 minutes for a server to help us, not one did. 5 different waiters walked right by us, including the manager. I got tired of waiting and asked the bartender to please send us a waiter as we've been waiting a long time. She said yes, but never sent a waiter over. After wasting a half hour literally just waiting for someone to ask me what I'd like to drink, we left. Won't be going back there at all, ATROCIOUS service.Booked via an Expedia secret deals for a last minute 2 night trip. Excellent service, clean rooms, great location. Loved the free shuttle for easy Broadway access, and Uber/cab was super inexpensive to get downtown as well. Would definitely return here for any future trips!This is the third stay I've had at the Holiday Inn Vandy. The renovations are finally done and they are great. The rooms are remodeled and very modern. The lobby and Commodore Grill are also remodeled with a modern feel to it. They offer a shuttle service within a few miles radius. It gets you into downtown ;) The pool area is decent but not spectacular. The size is fair but seating is limited. I am not a fan of the food in the restaurant in the lobby (Commodore Grill). The menu could be spruced up a bit. However, the entertainment that comes through is excellent! Liver performers and song writers on an intimate stage while you dine. Very casual atmosphere.Looks renovated. All very new and clean. Value all depends on the price you paid. We booked using hotwire and got a pretty average price. Parking is a complete rip off for $20 a day when you can park on the street 2 seconds away for free. Buffet is average but not expensive. Staff friendly. Shuttle is slow and infrequent. The hotel is nice and new and squeeky clean and there is outdoor seating and a decent outdoor pool. Not worth more than $150 a night but if you can do $100 its a steal!It was average for a holiday inn.  The rooms were nice and clean.  However, the restaurant is only open 6:00 am- 10:00 am and 5pm-11 pm.  Their ""market"" for snacks and necessities was out of stock on almost everything - so you pretty much have to leave if you need any snacks, drinks, or Advil.It's been a long time since I've stayed at a Holiday Inn. If this is location is a representation of what other Holiday Inns are like, I'm in on the INN! It is clean, the staff are friendly, the rooms are large and the closets have lots of hangers! Plus HBO and a restaurant/bar that actually serves really good food! Quite impressed!!!Another good experience. The only complaint I have is that I was in a room that was handicap accessible meaning I didn't have a couch/coffee table so not great for a business traveler and the door was an automatic open so I had to wait for it to close. I was near an elevator again but it wasn't nearly as loud as my previous stay. Would stay again.Stayed here during an interview at nearby Vandy, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Although there's no airport shuttle, the Holiday Inn provides a free shuttle within a 3 mile radius, so you can go to Vanderbilt, check out the music and food scenes, or visit a nearby museum.  My room was obviously newly-refurbished, with comfortable luxury linens and a big bathtub (one of my hotel requirements).  Service-wise, this place is spectacular.  Although the shuttle technically wasn't supposed to go to my pre-interview dinner site, the workers at the front desk made special arrangements for me with profuse apologies for not having a mechanism already in place.  You can definitely feel the ""Southern hospitality.""  If you're an IHG member, don't forget to give them your number!  You might be able to score a room upgrade or a free drink certificate for either the bar or the in-hotel coffee stand.Hotel does not honor reservations! I reserved a room here through TripAdvisor, and I reserved a room with a king size bed. When we arrived, we found that they gave us a room with 2 full size beds instead. When we confronted them about it, they said they had ran out. Why say you have a room available when you don't? Although, it was a nice hotel with a nice pool in a nice part of town, there were some downsides - room included - we had some issues with parking. There had been an event at the Vanderbilt during one of our last nights there, and apparently the stadium guests had parked in the hotel's parking lot so there was no parking and it was beyond pouring rain. One of the hotel employees saved our night by coming out in the rain and moving her car. I give it a solid 4.We stayed here for my bachelorette party weekend. The hotels rooms have been updated and everyone at the establishment was beyond friendly and helpful. This was my second time at this Holiday Inn and I will definitely be staying here again.Stayed here for a business trip. Free parking, near other food options (PF Changs, McDonalds, fancier fare, etc.), room was clean, bathroom was fine, and Wifi signal was pretty strong. They have a little breakfast/coffee bar downstairs, a little snack bar, and a full restaurant. I didn't do the last one, but the other two were fine.Biggest downside I would say is the air conditioning system. It was cold when I was there, and since some of the room have those tiny patios where it is a big sliding window door, it got cold some nights. They have the older style heating systems, where it was kind of loud if I had left the hot air on at night.Overall, would certainly consider staying here again. It is a little bit of a walk if you walk downtown (like to Bridgestone Arena). They also have a free shuttle service, but I didn't use it on my trip. The location overall was centrally located.Love this hotel! I've travelled a lot (well, for a college student at least) and stayed in a lot of hotels, and this is the one I use as a benchmark to judge all other hotels by. I've stayed here many, many times.Free breakfast buffet and drinks (which now include an option of coffee too, yay for us non-drinkers) if you're a Priority Club member. Bonus! And the buffet is really nice, it's not just a continental breakfast. It's got the fruit, cereal, yoghurt, etc., but there's also eggs, home fries, bacon, sausage, even make-your-own Belgian waffles!There's free parking, too, and also a free shuttle that takes you within a few miles - it takes you downtown, that's the important thing. Plus it runs until 11 pm so you have plenty of time to do whatever you want and still catch the shuttle back, rather than rely on a cab. The WiFi is free as well and works pretty well. Nice and fast, it's only been sluggish when I'm there when a convention or some huge business thing is there.The rooms are awesome! I like staying on the executive floor, though the rooms aren't any different on that floor so if you don't want to shell out the extra cash, you can just book a standard room. It's nice and clean (I've never had any problems with dirty carpets or dirty anything else). You get a balcony no matter what, with either a view of the Parthenon on the even numbered rooms, or the stadium on the odd numbered rooms. The bathrooms are great, too. All I'd change is some extra shelving in the shower area as there just isn't enough room in there to put much of anything. But I love the shower itself! Nice water pressure and temperature, and the shower head is awesome. And I love having a shower and not a shower/bath.The pool is nice, too. It's outdoors so it's only open in the summer, but it's clean and big enough to accommodate everyone. If you wait to go in the evening, by then everyone will be leaving to go to dinner and you'll basically have the pool to yourself, if you don't want to deal with kids.The only downside is the parking. They stay so busy all the time that it can be really hard to find a parking space here. Be prepared to walk! Tip: the handicapped spots fill up (even the ones in the back) so if you have problems walking distances, make sure you get to the hotel in the early afternoon to get a better spot, and just rely on the shuttle or cabs. There's always cabs hanging around too so you'll never have to wait for one. Another plus is if you have a hybrid or electric vehicle, they have two charging stations in the back of the hotel! I only just noticed it this time and don't drive one so I'm not sure what the pricing is, but if you need to charge your battery while staying there, you don't have to drive around finding a charging station.It's just an all-around great hotel with a nice mixture of affordability and amenities.What a great hotel and hotel staff. Admittedly I rarely need much special attention, but little things make me pretty happy. Being called darlin, extra soap and towels in the hotel room, ac kept on before I check in. Ophelia took care of me when I first checked in and was very sweet.My friend and I were traveling for business, and stumbled into this hotel after being treated very rudely by a concierge at a different hotel. The two experiences were like night and day. Larry at the front desk took great care of us. All of the customer service at the hotel was phenomenal. I felt that the hotel staff really made an effort to go above and beyond. The room was very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and I personally really appreciated the large, well-lit shower.  The breakfast offerings in the morning were excellent. I have some dietary restrictions, but there were still plenty of food options that I could eat, which was a pleasant surprise. I will definitely stay at this hotel again next time I pass through Nashville.I have stayed at this hotel about 10 years in a row, about 40 nights. I have never had 1 bad night here. From the great location on Westend Avenue, Plenty of complimentary parking available. Small ""snack/sandwich"" area, like a small coffee and snack bar. But you are in Nashville, why eat at the hotel. there is a killer bbq joint open right across the street.the Bar/lounge is very good also, open mike nite usually every night. Nice place to chat or listen to some ""new"" county music.I like the location of this Place, walk in any direction and you will find entertainment or food.The duplicate of the  Parthenon is across the street. The park is, Centennial park Where a nice running path is. As well as coy ponds and open space. An art fair is held here 3 times a year as well as family movie nights and concerts.Close to the interstate also.Beautiful hotel, nice pool, awesome customer service, and a free shuttle available every 15 minutes with the nicest drivers. Great location being walking distance from restaurants and a liquor store! I couldn't have asked for a better experience for my first time in Nashville.The Holiday Inn - Vandy - has great views that overlook the Parthenon and the Commodore's stadium. This is a well-run hotel with a spacious lobby and nice amenities such as a sundries shop, a coffee bar, a lounge, business center, pool, etc.Rooms were clean and large.The bathroom though is tiny! Wow - you have to enter and get past the toilet to close the door. Breakfast was not impressive - service was outstanding - but the food just didn't seem very fresh; I understand this place does a large crowd for breakfast, but I just found it kind of overly steamed and not fresh. Still, great hotel - shuttle service is a major bonus.+ There's a ""Renovation Award November 2009"" plaque by the front desk which makes you feel like you're in a new-ish/updated hotel. Be warned that that illusion will end as soon as you leave the lobby.- The hallway on the 3rd floor had a big fan blowing, making one wonder if the floor was flooded or if they were trying to remedy a mildew problem. Either way, bad.+ Bathroom hand towels were folded into 2 swans whose necks made a heart shape. Yes you know the one. Little things like that get me =)+ Refrigerator and microwave in room.- Low-tech air conditioning system with low/high warm, low/high fan, and low/high cool settings. I'd assume that a 2009 renovation would include digital thermostats in this day and age...- The pillows on each bed were labeled with ""soft"" and ""firm"", which looked promising. Unfortunately, both were lumpy and crappy.+ Free wireless internet.+ The bathroom has a tiled stand-up shower (no tub) with floor to ceiling glass doors. A 15-setting Moen showerhead made it feel extra fancy (but I would guess 12 of those 15 settings aren't really practical).- The carpet was a color that looked like it was hiding nastiness. I decided against inspecting it any closer to confirm one way or the other.","While it's not the Loews Vanderbilt, it is a nice hotel with a friendly staff, a shuttle to the downtown are and lots to do within walking distance. Rooms are typically Holiday Inn, clean and comfortable. You can tell that this hotel caters to the fans of the games at nearby Vanderbilt Stadium, but they do have a large influx of business travelers inbetween. I would happily stay here again.PROS:Been here 3 days, paid $104 on Vandy nursing school rate, staff EXTREMELY friendly and helpful!! rate is locked is in until 8/2014 for nursing school students, no Vandy ID check, 750kBs download wifi or ethernet, free parking onsite, directly in front of Vandy football stadium, McDonalds directly across street with numerous other good food and drink within easy walk,. free shuttle within 3miles  6A-11P, free washing machines and dryers each floor, laundry soap 50cents,mattresses good but not rotated, all rooms have balcony, good water pressure, new 45"" HD-TV w/HDMI, RCA,  PC/SVGA(DB15),and SD card inputs, 6 cf refrig and microwave with turntable in  room, plenty of A/C( thru the wall unit with local controls), outside 97deg@ 54%RH, in room 67deg.: SWEET!!!!, Onsite food and drink(PRICEY!!)CONS:Phone cord won't reach by bed without unplugging and moving phone,Getting kicked out thurs. because of first  vandy football game of season on thurs. night(rate more than doubled)!!!,  no free continental breakfast(free coffee until onsite restaurant open at 6A), chintzy on towels, remote batteries dead (AA), alarm clock backup battery missing (9V), no chairs for balcony, east(stadium) side rooms won't assess vandy VPN, AND LAST AND EASILY THE MOST IRRITATING, 15 WATT  FLUORESCENT TWIST TUBES IN ALL LIGHTING FIXTURES!!!WRAP-UP:Easily the best deal in the neighborhood all things considered!!!

Lots of chain type restaurants nearby and literally right in the heart of the University of Vanderbilt. The staff got us right in after having a terrible experience at another hotel. Best part of this hotel was the staff there, they were super friendly and accommodating. Shuttle is easily accessible and will take you right downtown.I should be fair and honest up front. High marks go to the staff that helped me with the issues that continued to present themselves during our short stay. I believe they did their best with the resources they had. That said, I am forced to suggest that you avoid this hotel for one huge reason - amazingly filthy floors in the rooms. I can honestly say they were so dirty I felt that there might be a health risk. More below...I choose to book this hotel based on high reviews on Trip Advisor. Since we were travelling with our 11 month old so, when booking I requested three things that were needed: a fridge, a tub and a king bed. We booked an executive room and these items were confirmed in my reservation. Upon check-in I immediately noticed that we only had a shower stall, so I reported that and we were moved to a new room. Not on the executive floor (where the executive lounge/workspace was), but a suitable room. Only a mild inconvenience and short disturbance. Once in the new room, we discovered a toilet that sounded like a jumbo jet's engine when flushed. We were off to dinner so I reported that at the front desk and they said they would have someone look at it while we were out. Upon our return at about 10pm, I checked in with the desk about the toilet. They called and spoke to the repairman who said that it was broken but they did not have the part necessary to fix it. They asked if I wanted to moved again, but they could not find a suitable room while I was waiting. It was already past my son's bedtime and we needed to give him a bath and get him down, so I said I would call them shortly from the room and in the meantime, I asked that they try and figure something out. Once back in the room, my wife found the tub to be dirty (pubic hairs from a prior guest). Our frustration level was rising, but we had to get our son to sleep, so she washed the tub herself and I knew I would mention it when I called down. When my wife picked up our son for his bath, we found his hands and feet to be black. We considered the day, where we had been, where we might have put him down, etc. and were confused. Then we considered the room. I grabbed a white wash cloth from the bathroom and a simple, light swipe across the floor revealed it to be filthy. A black streak was on the cloth. I checked multiple places in the room and found the same condition. Finally, I called the front desk. At this point, I explained, we had been given the wrong room and a new room with a broken toilet, a dirty bathtub and a floor so dirty we could not bring ourselves to take our socks off, much less put our son on the floor. My room was comped at that point, without hesitation I must add, and I was offered another room. My concern now, however, was that no one knew anything about a carpet cleaning schedule - I wanted to avoid the same issue in a new room or just leave that night. It was suggested that a go into the other rooms with the person in charge of housekeeping and choose my room. She escorted me into three different rooms, all of which I found to have dirty carpets as well (I used the same cloth test in each room).It was after 11pm and I knew we would not complete our 3 night stay at this hotel, but did not wish to uproot my now-sleeping family. When morning came, we packed up and left this hotel. I must again say that the staff was very helpful and understanding. In fact, a few offered that they were as disgusted as I was. Of the number of people that helped me, thank you to Tiffany and Theresa (I might be confusing this as actually being one person - whomever seemed in charge behind the desk that night) and the rest of the desk staff, and Bertha, the housekeeper. However, no amount of customer service can clean a carpet or get my to put my son on the floor of that hotel ever again. I should add that we wondered how often this floor condition might be the case in other hotels and we just never noticed. Well, our trip included two more hotels, neither of which had this issue at all.First visit to this hotel for a meeting. Parking lot was torn up and the smoker's ashtrays are too close to the front door. I don't like having freshly showered and being forced to walk through someone else's smoke. Bathrooms had not been cleaned in at least 24 hours. Our meeting room was nice and the breakfast service was adequate. They could improve the experience by paying attention to some of the small, but important details.The staff was amazing from beginning to end. I had an interview and when I woke up I realized my nail polish looked atrocious and that I needed to take it off. I called downstairs and to my surprise they had a bottle of nail polish remover to my room in less than 5 minutes. For a small fee of course. I was visiting schools during the fall and out of the 3 comparable hotels I stayed at this one had the best bathroom. The room was adequately clean and so was the bathroom. I loved the free shuttle service to the college. My problem was the bed size. I had the same problem at another hotel where I ordered two queen beds and got two fulls.Here I requested two doubles and I got something much smaller. This was a problem for me because it was the three of us and there was no way two people could have slept on this bed. We ended up ordering a pull out bed which irritated me because of the extra charge but after I got my check out bill I noticed they didn't charge me for it. I would stay at this hotel again. If you are interviewing at Vanderbilt you should definitely stay here, the proximity to the school is amazing.It's a tired property. Rooms are horribly outdated. Carpets feel dirty and lighting in rooms is poor. Cheap mats in lobby and general chaos and amateur feel in lobby. However, the staff is pretty responsive and diligent but they are working with a very tired property. Rooms don't feel clean. I wouldn't recommend or stay here again no matter the rate.The location is wonderful for visiting Vanderbilt parents. Everything is clean as should be expected for a nice hotel chain. The outdoor pool was also well tended, though unheated and a bit heavy on the chlorine.    Our room was similarly clean, though a bit musty smelling, and the walls are slightly thin.   A decent choice, and less pricey than the nearby Marriott or Loews.This is a well located hotel - but - it is very compact in rooms and the least comfortable bed in the entire city.  Great service and a really fun ""Writers night"" downstairs in the Commodore Lounge.Home away from home. Everyone goes out of their way to make you welcome. Best mocha at the coffee bar!Bed - comfyShower - okCarpet - not soFridge - they forgot to clean it out!This place was clean and nice.  I normally try to stay in holiday inn's because of their consistency and I'm glad once again that we did.  The location was perfect and close to everything.  Not being from Nashville, we were pleasantly surprised to discover we were right across the street from Centennial Park where the Parthenon is located!Gorgeous room, friendly staff..  We were very impressed with room and stay our first night.  We stayed here because we were running the 1/2 marathon in Nashville and wanted a hotel in close proximity to start of race.  We were just coming back to our room after running the marathon, looking forward to a shower, and we see 3 housekeepers in our room with shopvacs trying to clean up the bathroom.  While we had been gone, a sink on one of the upper floors had been clogged and when maintenance had unclogged it, it somehow exploded all the sludge out of our sink and all over our bathroom, including all of our personal belongings that were in the bathroom.  The manager of housekeeping was super apologetic and replaced what they could  for us ( toothbrush, hairbrush, toothpaste, contact case), however my glasses were soiled as well as my breast pump parts which could only be ordered online due to the sizing (specialty of parts).  When we told them about this, they told us to talk to the manager upon checking out for a discount.  When we checked out, the manager was not available and we were told he would call us.  Received no call back and had to call him.  They are now currently working on getting us a free night.  We will see if this happens.  We don't think they would have even bothered calling us back, and would have just let this go.  I understand accidents happen, but you need to take care of your customers.  Having our toiletries/belongings  covered with nasty black bacteria ridden liquid deserves a bit more then a couple free drinks in their hotel bar.  ***** Please see attached photo to see the bathroom*****Small rooms, ok amenities, but if you're going to a football game at Vanderbilt Stadium, this is THE hotel to be in for proximity (stroll from parking lot directly into the game), tailgating, and overall convenience for fans of the visiting teams!  Normally would give this hotel an average 3-star rating, but it gets an extra star for location.The TV shows are $4.99 and they have commercials! What a cheesy way to make money and a sign of a less than classy hotel, particularly when you pay more than $150 a night.  And there is NO complimentary breakfast, just an overpriced buffet, something even the cheapest hotels in California provide.I was actually really impressed with this hotel.  Holiday Inn hotels don't have a great reputation for comfort, they're mostly a cost-conscious choice.  I only payed for one night in a king size room (two large beds and a desk), and the uni picked up the tab for the other 2 nights (total of 4 days).  I didn't have any children eating or rubbing the carpeting, so I don't need something that achieves that standard of sanitation.  I was traveling with an S.O who spent the majority of his time at the room, so the fact that he thought it was tidy and well appointed probably stands for more than my experiences.  The first night we got in late and were a little worried that we should have called to let the hotel know.  They were incredibly nice and friendly at the desk, even though I was totally exhausted after a 13 hour drive.  There was a big basketball game going on nearby, and the hotel parking was being shared for the event, but I was impressed that even with that all going on, we still found a spot quite easily.  Nashville has a lot of open sewage vents that can smell pretty funky if you're downwind, but that's not the hotel's fault -- or anyone's fault -- that's just the city.  Like Paris, I think its just a little stinky at times.  (Actually, a lot of my experience in this city reminded me of Paris:  lots of old run-down parts that were quirky at best, punctuated with modernized attempts at genuine luxury and comfort.)The room was big, with a nice balcony and a very new shower/bathroom area that was clean and modern.  Even as close to the elevators as we were, the room was almost silent, which was pretty impressive to me.  The shower head had a massager setting and was really big, and the tiling looked granite.  I am allergic to feathers, so I definitely appreciated that there was synthetic pillows and bedding available without a fuss.  The room was also super warm when we got in, which was wonderful, since we live in FL and were horrified by the burning cold and snow.  The only real annoyance in the room was the television, which had a un-bypassable menu system before allowing access to the unpaid, normal channels.  All it meant was that we left the tv on mute when we would have otherwise shut it off.  I always wish there are more power outlets.  The towel aviary was awesome.  I totally wish I could do that.The hotel restaurant hosts local musicians, and we went there for dinner on our first night.  The quesadilla I ordered was absolutely delicious and fresh tasting.  The only negative thing I could say was that in the full restaurant of music audience, few people were eating/drinking and I would have liked for those people who were trying to get dinner (like myself) to get a bit more attention than the patrons who weren't ordering anything or were only drinking Bud.  The music was nice, and honestly, if I hadn't been so hungry, I probably would have appreciated the intimacy that our server's absence left us.All in all, the location was great (SO close to my interviews!).  The room was clean and nice, with an obvious effort toward a modern look.  The desk staff were incredibly helpful about things to do and how to get from place to place.Good value, good location and good times in Nashville.  The staff here was very helpful, with advice, storing bags, checking in early...cabs right outside for a $7 trip down to Broadway or a decent amount of spots within walking distance.  (Across the street by Vanderbuilt is a fabulous outdoor bar, very homey, very Southern).  Pool is decent and rooms were nice.Nice hotel. Good location next to Vanderbilt and across from the Parthenon in the Park. Restaurant/buffet OK. Coffee bar in the lobby was good! Very pleasant and helpful front desk staff. I'd stay here again when in Nashville. Good value for the cost.Was disappointed to find out when I arrived at hotel that reservation had been cancelled. It took an hour to fix problem and get my room at the rate purchased. Other than initial incident the hotel empployees were nice and helpful.The room smelled like fast food.  I was there in spring, and there were a lot of loud people.  The staff was nice.The biggest thing I wish I knew before I booked was how the fitness center was dysfunctional.  The elliptical was 15 years old.","Our visit to Nashville involved the Vanderbilt Medical Center, and this hotel offered a special rate for patients.  It also has free parking, somewhat unusual for this part of the city, and a free shuttle to places within a short radius.  The front desk personnel were friendly and helpful, the room was clean and quiet with a nice bed and had free wireless.  I would stay here again and recommend it.",,,"['different', 'occasions', 'friends', 'family', 'visiting', 'love', 'holiday', 'inn', 'great', 'clean', 'rooms', 'comfy', 'beds', 'friendly', 'staff',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-nashville,Hilton Garden Inn,3.5,$$,48,"Luxurious hotel with an amazing staff!!! Jasper at the front desk was so helpful and Edward took care of us at the restaurant. The super nice shuttle drivers will take you downtown or to Vandy (for free!)The pros: very friendly staff, great free shuttle service. Good breakfast (not free), location to downtown. Coffee maker, microwave in room. Decent prices.The cons:With a name like Hilton I expected more. First room they gave us was handicapped accessible and the shower head was terrible and the whole bathroom floor wet after showering. We requested a room change and were moved. Second room sink faucet sprayed like a sprinkler soaking the user...Parking is expensive, hotel rooms look dated. Overall a medium experience and probably wouldn't book again.Brown waterFluid stained wallsFire alarmBroken bedNo housekeeping (go down for your own shampoo and coffee ground refills)This property is in a great location and you can walk to many restaurants and Vanderbilt.The rooms are pretty basic, similar to Hampton Inn, actually I'm not sure what the difference between this property and the Hampton Inn is. The Hampton Inn does include breakfast at no additional cost.The desk clerks were very pleasant and had a great attitude. The elevators were pretty quick.The property was clean.The beds were decent but nothing spectacular.We may or may not stay at this location again. There was nothing bad about the experience.The room and lobby were clean. The valet guy was so animated about hating his job that is was severely off putting. The only thing complimentary with your stay is the slow wifi (I'm currently using data instead). The front desk was alright, room service hospitality was great!Friendly staff and great location, that's about it... Tried to eat dinner in the restaurant the first night and was told by the server we would be waiting a very long time because they were backed up in the kitchen, so we walked somewhere else. Woke up the next morning with an aching back because of the horrible mattress that had a large divot in the middle of the bed. Breakfast was mediocre at best but very expensive ($12.95pp). One reason we picked this hotel was because of the indoor pool, which was closed the entire time we were there... They need to put some money into this place!There are so many wonderful things to say about this hotel:1. Free Wi-Fi2. Free Shuttle Downtown3. Free Snacks4. Cute Greeting (Post Card, Guitar Picks and Goo Goo Cluster)5. Uber Helpful Staff (We had to leave a night early due to weather and they worked with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> to make sure we weren't charged)Really, how many hotels offer 1 of the items listed above for free, much less 3/3?The room was also very clean and stocked with a Keurig, fridge and microwave. It wasn't anything fancy, but did the trick just fine. The room was what I expected to encounter for a 3 star hotel. Clean, fairly updated and nice enough.The downsides were proximity to a major street and the noise that comes with it and the fact that I couldn't get the TV to work (though I didn't try too hard and we didn't ask for help).I'd go back for the reasons listed above as well as for the proximity to many attractions (Hint-Walk to Hattie B's a couple of blocks away for a tasty and inexpensive meal).This hotel was fine for a night in Nashville.  It was within walking distance to many restaurants and bars. It's so close to Hattie B's which is reason enough to stay. We arrived a little early and they let us check in early.  We took a lyft from the hotel a couple of times and it was only about $5 to mercy lounge and the gulch.  Great location!Great location. Walking distance from Vanderbilt and good dining.  Prompt shuttle service to downtown and venues. Pleasant staff who listen and go above and beyond. Clean rooms, good food  options in hotel. Lobby is inviting and fun to hang out. Shout out to Betsy, Aimee and Jasper!Amazing customer service! It went to Nashville for my 30th birthday, we onlyMentioned it in passing when we checked i. After a afternoon out we came back to our room and found a wonderful card and 2 awesome cupcakes for my birthday! So kind! Shout out to Kat, thank you so much!Last weekend, I attended my friend's wedding and the reception was held at the Hilton Garden Inn. It was fantastic. While I din't stay there, several of my friends did and we hung out in the rooms the day before the wedding. Everything seemed clean and there was room for 8-9 people to sit and talk and catch up, as long as you don't mind multiple people sitting on the bed.The reception space was very nice. It was on the 9th floor so you get a lovely view of the skyline and the hotel staff were friendly and very competent. Hors d'oeuvre were passed smoothly. There were dedicated bathrooms for the space (necessary with such nice bartenders) and a small balcony facing downtown for smokers and just people who wanted to see the sights. The absolute only downside was when the waiter at dinner didn't know if the gravy on my friend's steak had butter (she has a pretty severe dairy allergy) He checked with the kitchen and they said no but after a few bites she felt her mouth starting to tingle and had to stop eating. I wish that she had been provided a dry steak but she's didn't want to ask.If you are planning a reception, definitely consider this space.Very sweet lady at the front desk named Terrica!!! She is a life saver and an angel sent from heaven!!We arrived extremely late and had to book last minute because our air b&amp;b was a no show. The front desk were extremely helpful and friendly. Breakfast is pretty good worth $12. Location at first might not seem as ideal as downtown but right down the road are 4 star restaurants and awesome dive bars where you get the newer Nashville feel. I recommend doing the pub trolley down the road and get a tour of the recording studios only a block away. Perfect location $5 uber or free shuttle ride to downtown tootsies. Definitely staying here next time in town.We were only staying for the night.  The concierge upgraded our room when he realized we were first time visitors.  They went out of their way to make our visit memorable.  Would stay there again if I am ever in Nashville.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME and pay the extra money to stay somewhere with better employees closer to the main part of Broadway!!!! My friends and I were kicked out of our SUITE when we were in the middle of playing an innocent game of ""the bride guesses the underwear her friends got her."" We were all sitting around the table/couches in the suite watching our friend guess and we get a knock on our door from a guy named Eric Patten, who I assume is a manager. He kicks everyone out of the suite and says we cannot have a ""party"" in the room when we are all clearly just sitting around not being rowdy in the slightest bit. Our plan was to open gifts and then head off to Broadway so this ""party"" was only going to be for an hour, if that. Not only did we get kicked out of the suite, but Eric followed every girl (including the Moms that were there) to their separate room to ensure we were not coming back to the suite. That completely set me off!!! We are not children and Eric acted extremely inappropriately. We then had to proceed to the public lobby area with our X-rated gifts to not completely ruin the bride's night and let her still somewhat enjoy her gifts. On top of this whole night's fiasco, we had to wait at least 30 minutes each time we wanted to get a shuttle. They say it runs every 15 minutes but they also forget to mention that EVERYONE staying in the hotel is also waiting for a shuttle.Anand, the general manager, runs a great hotel. He even picked us up in the shuttle at the airport. They have great live music in the lobby/bar area most nights. Convenient shuttle to many places, helpful staff, quality food and good value.I very rarely leave negative reviews, but my stay at this location was no where near the expectation that I have for this brand. I stay at a Hilton property 3-4 nights a week on average because of the high quality and great service. This hotel did not meet those standards at all. My top problems:1) the hotel rooms are in need of an update2) management did not notify guests ahead of time that there would be maintenance issues like fire alarm testings. The hotel lobby is lovely and looks like it is fairly recently renovated. This made the outdated rooms surprising. They are dingy (obvious patches on wall, gross carpet, etc) and the housekeeping was not well done. Several things were unfinished - pillow cases left on the bed with less than the normal number of pillows, items from a precious guest left in the mini fridge, and items left in the trash can. This may have been an isolated incident, but the lack of organization and communication about maintenance was a much bigger problem.The first maintenance issue was with the cable, so not a huge thing, but still annoying that the staff knew it would be out for an hour for testing and didn't notify anyone. The second was much bigger. The fire alarms and sprinklers were scheduled for testing and guests were not notified ahead of time. This meant the fire alarm strobe lights went off for approximately an hour around 9:30 am. Right while I was getting ready and checking email. Had I know before, I would have made arrangements to go elsewhere to do some work, but because it was unexpected I had to get ready with bright flashing lights. Hello migraine! I called the front desk to inquire and was told that it was routine testing and would be finished soon. I explained that prior notice would have been nice because this was causing a headache. The lady apologized, but neglected to mention that this was not happening downstairs. After about 10 mins I called back to ask how much longer and as I was calling a note was slipped under my door, dates the day before, alerting guests to the testing. So they did know ahead of time and were supposed to notify guests but did not. The lady at the front desk was very nice Nd apologized and offered me a breakfast coupon for the day. Unfortunately she didn't mention that breakfast was closing so I had a very limited selection (which ironically is usually free to HHonors members at other HGIs so I'm not sure why it isn't at this property). Overall this hotel needs a refresh, both of the rooms and the management policies in order to be up to speed with the standard of the Hilton brand.Super clean hotel and VERY friendly desk personnel! The only negative I have about the hotel is the fact it is on a very busy street and it was noisy all night long from traffic below. Otherwise, everything else was fantastic and I would stay there again. I would just probably request a room on the back side not the street side. The valet charge is on the website, BUT it's a little hard to notice. So, the semi-surprise of $28 for valet parking is a little on the higher end of normal.Clean Rooms and bathrooms are the number 1 priority of any place I stay. No exception here!! Super friendly staff, shuttles available for transportation.  All the taxes and extra charges are alittle too high but that isn't hotel fault besides $25 a night to park your car! Ouch!Um, these people clearly have been sniffing some happy gas because the staff is ALWAYS happy and cheerful! It wasn't annoying, it was just surprising and the most pleasant experience I have had with hotel staff. This being a Hilton Garden Inn, and with some of the reviews here on Yelp, I was a bit concerned prior to the arrival, but I was pleasantly surprised. We walked in on a very, very bone chilling cold evening, valet took the car, and the hotel staff were welcoming...genuinely so! There were no frills or extras that I can mention, other than the fact that they truly seemed happy that we were there. The foyer was decorated with fun music murals that captured the highlights of Nashville. There is a full service dining room, with a kick-ass breakfast (not included with the room). The staff made recommendations for places to dine, and visit, and also included a shuttle for the 3 mile radius. There is a lot within walking distance to the hotel so this was rarely needed. Since I was in Nashville on business, I used the business services for printing, and the free wifi in the room. I had no probs with any of it, again a shocker. Also wonderful, and should not be overlooked, was the comfy room. Everything was clean, completely furnished, and quiet. Next time I am in Nashville, it won't be a question of where I am staying. This place is it!","Pros: the whole place is non-smoking. The service is fantastic including a free shuttle to downtown. The room is great with a comfortable bed and working hvac. The location is within walking distance of many attractions or take the free shuttle! There is free wifi. Shower was clean with plenty of towels and hot water, even neutrogena products. They cleaned our room later in the early evening because we were napping when they and by the first time. Two free bottles of water to greet you and a keurig for single cups of coffee. Cons: parking isn't free. There is no safe in the room.My friend and I were in town for the weekend and decided to stay here because it was one of the cheaper hotels in the area.  It was a great hotel, had friendly staff, very clean, and housekeeping staff was attentive when we requested items (razor and toilet paper).  The hotel is in a good location, only about a mile or so from downtown if you want to walk or it's about an $8 dollar cab ride.  Overall, I would recommend and stay here again if ever back in the area.The reason this did not get 5 stars is for 2 reasons.  First, the parking per night to stay at the hotel is outrageous at $23/night.  However, I assume most other hotels charge for parking as well so I am sure there is no way of getting around that.  Second, though they did have free shuttle that will take you anywhere in a 2 mile radius of the hotel (GREAT, right??), it didn't work out that well for us.  There is only one shuttle, but tons of guest staying in the hotel so you end up waiting forever.  And if you do even wait for it, most other the other guests just cut in front of you and you are not able to get on the shuttle.  For instances, we had been waiting about 20 minutes for the shuttle at the hotel, only to have a group of 8 or 9 guys come down and cut in front of us and then there was no room on the shuttle.  It happened multiple times while we were there so we ended up always taking a cab downtown.  I suggest the hotel implement a different system for the shuttle as it was pretty useless to me while I was there.We booked 7 nights and were out after the first.  The lobby smelled and the room was old and outdated.  Walls were dirty, light didn't even have a cover, and the beds were uncomfortable.  Room looked nothing like the pictures.  I wouldn't recommend to anyone.My mom came to visit and booked a room at the Hilton Garden Inn. You have to pay $25 a day in addition to your room fee just to park at the hotel, and this is literally the only option since its located downtown. Annoying but something I could get over if the rest of our stay was great.. It wasn't. We checked in and on the way to our room we ran in to an older woman who clearly had Alzheimers and come to find out had wandered out of her room and was lost without a room key. It was pretty late (after 10pm) at this point and so my mom stayed with the woman and I went in to our room and called the front desk to ask if they could send someone up to help. I think I called the front desk more than 6 times in a 45 minute period and no one ever came to help. Luckily the woman had a moment of clarity and found her room and was able to get in, but it seemed like really bad guest service that A. they weren't quicker to help someone who was lost and B. left it up to us to help the older woman when we had absolutely no resources to do so. THEN we get in to the room and realize its a handicap room, which was just plain rundown. Not sure if it was because it was handicap or just happened to be that room but it wasnt good. So I called the front desk for the 10th time (after no one came to our floor to help still) and asked if we could switch rooms and they said they were booked. Luckily, we switched rooms the next night and the non-handicap room was much nicer. But the parking combined with their lack of incentive to help us or another guest left a bad taste in my mouth. Another downside, unless you are a Hilton rewards member you have to pay for wi-fi, seems like they nickel and dime you a bit.Let me start out by saying that for this hotel being still a shuttle ride from Downtown, it was expensive. That being said, there are several places to go get food and drinks around the hotel. The bar in the hotel was pretty lackluster and the breakfast buffet was OK. We did not have a vehicle so we did not worry about parking. The shuttle guys were STELLAR. Especially Chris and Jersey. I still have no clue what Jersey's real name is, but he is from Jersey hence the nickname. These two guys were wonderful and made our trip 100 times more enjoyable. Also, Olga the housekeeper is AMAZING. She was one of the sweetest people we had met in nashville. Make no mistake, if you have Olga for a housekeeper, making friends with her goes a long way. She always stopped to ask where we were going or what we were up to while we passing by.Nice rooms and fair food, but the staff is what really makes this place shine. We came down for my friend's birthday and when we mentioned that to the front desk cupcakes and a card appeared at check in in our room (thanks Andrew and Kat!). Everyone said hello, smiled, asked how our day was and then actually remembered us later. The shuttle drivers were fantastic and personable. Would definitely recommend them.If I had to describe my visit at this hotel I would do so in just one word, EDWARD. The bar tender make you feel right at home, as though you are a part of his family. He is witty, friendly, fun, and warm!! I would say that his service has made me come back to this hotel and if I ever visit Nashville again, I will keep coming back here. If you are a returning guest, he remembers your face and often times, your name. The rest of the staff is friendly too and that's what makes a successful business. Thank you Edward and the rest of the staff for making this my home away from home!!!I stayed here two nights while passing through Nashville. I had read reviews about the sewage smell in the lobby -that's real- but it's only in the lobby/downstairs area, so it was OK. Uh... you have to pay $23/night for parking. That's absurd. The hotel itself was nice and clean. The staff was friendly. Convenient location, not far from downtown or midtown.Everything about the hotel was great except the parking. $20-30 a day for parking is ridiculous, and that alone will keep me from staying there again. There was also an outdoor patio area, but there were ashtrays on all the tables and a bunch of people out there smoking. Wish the hotel had a stronger no-smoking policy. Other than that everything was wonderful. I wish the parking situation was different.For 179 dollars a night i stayed in Chicago downtown last week (at a Hilton).  I had two rooms 2 tv's a couch a lazy boy and it was immensely better room.The room i had in Tn was one step away from a flea bag motel.  Floor was covered in spots of who knows what fluids, all the furniture was banged up.  And the beds that were a selling point are not very comfortable and take an hour to adjust.  The bath tub DID NOT DRAIN (took about 5 min for it to drain but bloody disgusting).  I could have a conversation with my neighbors at barely above a normal voice, the first night i was woken up at LEAST 5 times by an adjoining room.  In addition I could hear people in the hall all night.  The wifi was not adequate (2MBps srsly), i had to tether my phone just to get decent speed.  The gym was not restocked in anything that resembled a timely manner, the treadmills were barely functioning, and in poor condition:  The second night the one closest to the wall TV did not work.  There was a swarm of flies constantly by the front entrance.  AND i was charged 23 dollars a day to PARK!Completely unacceptable.The only nice things about the hotel was that the breakfast was very well put together (pricey) and the staff was amazing.  Do not recommendStaff is wonderful, pool is absolutely outstanding (except it opens at 7 a.m., which puzzles me-why not 5 a.m. or 6 a.m.?).  Restaurant (for breakfast) was great.Coffee is wonderful and available anytime.  Parking is horrible and way over priced ($23?-Where do they think they are?)Room is ok, nothing great, mattress felt good.  Staff was extraordinarily helpful and courteous.Great staff! Everyone was helpful and friendly.The beds have an adjustable firmness control and were really, really comfortable. The room service is above average; good food, accurate and quick delivery.OTOH the rooms were noisy and in my room, the toilet ran and the tub drain was slow and backed up a little. The exercise room is smelly and needs a reno.It's clean and what you expect from a Hilton Garden Inn. They have a shuttle service that'll drop you off and pick you up from various locations in Nashville.  Unfortunately, I arrived on a Sunday night and if you don't know the South, places close early on Sunday. Why? B/c God said so.The shuttle drivers Larry and Anthony were wonderful. The rest of the staff was kind; however, our stay was unbelievably chaotic and stressful. We arrived and were told that they only had rooms with king beds left and we would have to wait up to another 3 hours for a room with 2 beds. We were hospitable, got ready in the lobby bathroom for our conference, and left our bags behind the front desk. When we returned back at 9pm, we went to our room and discovered that it was wrong and only had a king. We had to wait in the hallway for 45 minutes while the front desk clerk tried to find another room. We were then charged for a $50/night insurance without being informed. We were unaware of the fee until we were already charged. We then went down to put the fee on two different cards to make sure that the fee would not bounce and the clerk placed the wrong amount on each  card. The hotel was beautiful and clean; however, we spent much or our time at the front desk figuring out the mistakes.Free internet. Nice indoor whirlpool and pool. The only downfall is that people walking from the parking lot to the lobby and those waiting for the elevator can see you. Fitness center is reasonable.The plush queen mattresses felt great. Very relaxing and an A/C that works well. One downfall about the room is that the TV was too close to the bed. The HD looked pretty grainy and it made you wonder who designed this room and why.Lot of the restaurants nearby close early. My personal choice would be ""SatCo"" San Antonio Taco Company located about 6 blocks south (heading toward Vanderbilt).The rate here is generally about $20-30/night cheaper than the Embassy Suites next door. The parking facility is better than the nightmare of driving the Embassy Suites structure. The parking rates are negligible when comparing the two.Staff is very friendly and the rooms are clean. However, the amenities aren't as good as another hotel 1 block away for less. Embassy Suites is in the same chain but has better rooms with lower rates, free breakfast, and free happy hour. Hilton Garden Inn charges $11.99 for a breakfast that isn't all that great and charges for their happy hour as well. Also beware, Hilton Garden Inn's Internet speeds are horrible. Dial-up would smoke them. Do yourself a favor and walk the extra block for better rooms, cheaper rates, and free perks.The service was great!  Free (but slow) internet.  $20 parking.  Very clean.  Free shuttle for a 3-mile radius (I think that covers Vanderbilt).  Great plush beds!  Perfect location to the Patterson House!This place wasn't all that bad except I didn't get my platinum treatment I typically get from other Hilton family so was little disappointed.  And there is absolutely no restaurants close by.  So ended up getting a room service and it wasn't all that great.  I would avoid this place if I am ever insane enough to drive from NYC to Dallas again. :PThe staff was wonderful. I was allowed to check in early and they upgraded us to a junior suite for free. I highly recommend this place.Stayed for four nights, and it was great. The rooms were clean and staff was extremely friendly. Only complaint would be the beds which are ""adjustable"" but seem stuck on the ""slow quick sand"" setting, causing you to sink into the bed over and hour or two. When you go to roll over in the night, and you can't get out of your body shaped hole very easily.","My friends and I came here for two nights from Chicago. Everyone in Nashville is just super nice! It's kind of weird! Haha.  The rooms were pretty cheap compared to other hotels and they were very clean! I loved the fact that they had a free shuttle that would take you to downtown Nashville. Our driver Larry from Chicago! We love you Larry!!  Also, our bartender took great care of us. Older gentleman, African American. I wish I remembered his name because he was so nice. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star instead of 5 was because when we first came in the lady at the front desk had a majorrrrr attitude problem.  Considering everyone is so nice in Nashville maybe she should consider moving to Chicago where everyone else has an attitude problem.  Other than that, I highly recommend this hotel to everyone. It's only a mile away from downtown and a free shuttle? Perfect. We always tipped our shuttle driver though.Check in staff were very friendly and helpful. Really well kept hotel and breakfast staff and food were lovely (ate one and talked to other...you work it out). Room are very clean.There is a great free shuttle each night within a three mile radius from hotel and will pick you up with a phone call (the driver will give you a card). Patience is required though if you are  NOW person. I loved between 5th/Broadway and 2nd/Broadway where the music is for us tourists!Hotel was great, very friendly and helpful staff. Parking charges seemed a bit high ($22/night) though. Pool and jacuzzi were wonderful. Breakfast could have been better for being $11 per personI recently attended a seminar at the Hilton, I had to pay $10.00 to self-park, which I could live with, it is downtown, but the amenities were so poor.  The coffee was lukewarm and later in the day the drink selection was very limited and they were hot.I did not want to go off-site for lunch the first day, so I went to their buffet.  I would have been embarrassed to call it a buffet.  Your entree choices were thin sandy looking catfish or an ""oriental"" chicken made of bone-in thigh pieces with an odd, oil based lo mien. The salad was soaked in water so all the cucumbers were sort of transparent.  With that ""meal"" you could eat some small hard rolls or biscuits with chunks in it.  Poor fare for the money.The next date our buffet was slices of beef brisket with a little lean meat among the fat and a tasteless peach cobbler.  You have to work hard to make peach cobbler bad, but they did it.I would strongly suggest anyone considering booking a conference here, to be very careful and think twice.  I doubt anyone felt they got their moneys worth.I travel a lot so a nice, clean hotel in a good location is always a sweet fine. I like this place. The property is newer, so everything is still nice and shiny. The rooms usually range from 120-150, so price is always in line with other hotels in the area. Watch that parking charge though. The staff is usually friendly and helpful. They have a small bar/ restaurant (American Grill) that's synonymous with the HGI hotels. The food and drinks are always solid and the room service is pretty quick. Nice diggs in a good spot in Nashville.I have tried nearly every Hilton chain hotel in the Nashville downtown area and am running out of options.  I travel extensively, spending at least 200 nights per year in hotels, with most of those being the Hilton chain.  I've come to expect a certain level of service.  The Garden Inn at Vanderbilt consistently fails to live up to even minimum expectations as have other Hilton chain hotels in the downtown area (Homewood and Doubletree).  Inept and often condescending front desk staff, awful wireless, bland surroundings and generally bad service.  My team and I will be trying a new hotel brand!Nice and clean! Obviously, it just opened a few weeks ago!  Lots of bugs to work out as with any new or just opened business!  I just wish they would make the bathrooms larger!  But I do like the fact it no longer has a tub shower, a walk-in!  I wish all hotels would do this!  Seriously, how many people actually take baths in those little tubs anyways?  The restaurant is really expensive and I don't suggest it at all!  The breakfast is still good, but they could be a little more creative, after the third day of staying there it gets really old!  But I can certainly recommend this and many of the Hilton Garden Inns across the country, you can't go wrong staying at any Hilton property!  Except the crazy rates sometimes!!  Especially at Hampton Inns.Good location. Indoor pool.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-nashville-downtown-nashville,Courtyard Nashville Downtown,3.5,$$,42,"Nice place but small rooms. The mini fridge is hidden in some cabinets (ours were by the bathroom). I liked that one of the walls was painted. The bed was super soft and comfy but the shower was small and slippery. We had free internet but got the higher up version for free as well because my dad booked the room with his points. It was fun and I would come again.What a great location.  Right in the middle of it all.  Our team Save  A Horse, Run A Ragnar - stayed here after our 2015 TN Ragnar a few weeks ago.  The check in process was a bit of a hassle as the lady at the front desk (Allison - sp) was not at all accommodating or supportive and a bit rude - terrible customer service.  We arrived to the hotel early, and needed an early check in - the room's were not quite ready so we went to the fitness center to shower.  This was nice.  The rooms were great.  The parking was a hassle.  But the Starbucks inside was also amazing and much needed after not sleeping for days.  I would definitely return to Nashville but not stay here due to the poor customer service.In the heat of it all, I loved this hotel on Printer's Alley. Might have been a tad pricey but ohhhh so worth it. Walked to everything and its in the heart of it all. The staff was so nice, they have a starbucks and bar and a little area for getting a quick bite. The rooms were awesome, and the vibe was great. Can't wait to head back next year and stay here!The staff by the way was all too nice! Everyone from the valet to the lady at starbucks were so nice and helpful!Nice enough building with a nice location. Room wasn't completely ready for us though at 9pm check in. Noise was a issue but if you want to be DT Nashville I don't think this can be avoided. Services and parking are going to be expensive as nothing is included in room cost. WiFi didn't seem to work even.The hotel is very nice looking and the staff is great. I found a bed bug in my room in the morning and was really pleased with how the staff responded initially. They showed up immediately and took swift action to investigate and re-certify the room. I trapped the blood sucker and gave it to them. However, when I called to get an update tonight before I checked into my next hotel the manager was dismissive which is really disappointing. He suggested that it 1) came in on my suitcase (though it was on the other side of the room and I don't have bed bugs at home) or 2) wasn't a bed bug (which is odd that they would go through all that for something they didn't think was a bed bug). I posted pictures here so you be the judge. Either way, I'm not going back based on how poor the customer service was on the back end.This is a great hotel to stay at while you are in Nashville. Being downtown gives you the advantage of being closed everything fun and new! I had a great stay at this hotel and would definitely go back again. The hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff there are incredibly professional and helpful. The manager Trevor went out of his Way to help us through an unexpected turn in our travel arrangements. He was incredibly kind and made us feel well taken care of. Printers Alley is no big deal, there's not much there anymore. However, Broadway Street offers plenty to do with lots of shopping, entertainment, food and fun.I'm hovering between two and three stars, because really, I have experienced better in Nashville, but for all intents and purposes, I suppose this hotel was A-OK.First, great location. Friendly staff - front desk and valet guys especially.Now, the not so great.The clock in the room wasn't set to the correct time. This isn't a huge deal, but it's a pet peeve of mine. After a long day of travel it's nice to be able to walk into your room and know the correct time. All florescent lights in the room. I understand their more eco-friendly, but aren't there some softer more natural options nowadays?Air conditioner was exceptionally LOUD.No ATM.Starbucks on-site, but no complimentary coffee in the lobby or anything. There was an in-room coffee maker (a wannabe Keurig that just didn't make it), but everyone knows those generally suck. Selections in the on-site market for last minute toiletries, snacks, drinks, etc. was pretty minimal.Housekeeping didn't refill body lotion after day two.Shower head was very low (see: water shooting at me, not falling on me.)On-site restaurant food was a solid 2-star experience. It's average. It's clean. It's conveniently located. If that's what's you're looking for, you won't have any problems here.Stayed here for almost a week during a business trip. The location is great. It's very close to Nashville's nightlife and a ton of restaurants. I did not rent a car while I was there, and I didn't need one at all thanks to the location. Every staff member I encountered was very friendly and helpful. The room (a regular double) was nice, but I've come to expect more from the Marriott brand. My biggest complaint was the high level of noise, despite their claim that the room had soundproof windows. Our room was also missing its hairdryer when we checked in, but the staff took care of that quickly. I would stay here again.This is a nice hotel to stay in downtown.  You're walking distance from Broadway and lots of food.My one complaint is parking - there was nowhere to park so I did valet parking and it would take up to 15 minutes to get my car in the morning.Awesome location. It's just a few minutes walk to Broadway, Printer's Alley, the convention centers, etc. The hotel is nice and clean and the staff is super friendly. But.... They didn't give us what we'd booked. The beds were tiny (way smaller than queen sized). The WiFi was not dependable. The noise level is a bit nuts; you can hear everything going on outside. And the parking sucks; $22 a day or $26 for valet. Maybe it's just me but it'd be nice, if you're paying for a room to have parking provided. It served its purpose for a few days.Pretty neat for a courtyard. The rooms look more like Renaissance hotels, I was impressed by the cleanliness. Has a nice lobby with bar and starbucks with its full menu, not just coffee. Had got a suite for $179/night...not bad at all. It's walking distance to most of the touristy spots and music venues. Staff was super friendly. It is easiest to valet park, although there are several public parking lots around the hotel in addition to the hotel parking. 4 stars cuz the bathroom was nothing impressive.What a fantastic location.  We pretty much used the hotel for sleeping but it was a great base to explore the area from.  All of the fun bars are nearby as well as the Ryman Auditorium.  Printers Alley was seriously a block away and that was worth it right there.  If you are looking to be in the action and within walking distance of bars this is the hotel for you.  The rooms were large and clean, the check in service good and we experienced no issues.  The only downside I can see is that they do not have a parking lot or free parking.  I would stay here again if I am ever back in the area.For $350 the rooms are lacking quite a bit! The room was SMALL and do you think we could have something other than paper cups??? There's a Starbucks in the lobby but some crappy coffee in the room. I would say you are paying for the location which was great but come on Marriott!! Step up the amenities!!!This is a nice hotel, but the ""high speed"" internet is only true if you've time warped from 1999. ""Conveniently"" they offer upgraded internet speed for a price. Boo!Location is close to the old convention center, but a bit farther from the new one. Not too far if you're ok with humidity.My only real issue is the internet speed. Unforgivable, if you ask me.This hotel is home to some pretty stellar staff. Everyone from the desk staff to the cleaning crew were fabulous. The hotel itself is spotless and the people who work here are just nice. That being said, the major problem I have with this hotel is the noise and the shabby rooms. I was there marathon weekend and ended up waking up several time during the morning hearing doors slam and people talking. I have never been in a hotel that was so loud! Don't get me wrong, I think the people we key'd up for the marathon, however I don't think they were being overly loud. I think the walls and doors are just thin. Along with the noise, the rooms in general were pretty shabby. Some new furniture and a coat of paint would do this place wonders. It would have also made me feel like I was actually getting my money's worth......MONEY REMOVED FROM OUR ROOM.  My husband and I stayed at Marriott Courtyard Downtown Nashville.  We were pleased with the room and the hotel is beautiful inside and the location to downtown Nashville was great.  However, this Marriott does not have safes in their rooms but does have a safe located in the hotel.  There was only one time that we left our room that I did not lock up my purse.  We went to the gym at approximately 8:00 AM and returned around 9:00 AM. When we returned to our room we were met by a housekeeping staff, which was odd because it was so early.   I attempted to ask her to come back but she said, ""no english"" and quickly walked away.  Also, for the remainder of time we spend there the housekeeping staff never came to our room again until after 11:00 am.  I did not notice the money was missing until we arrived home and I immedialy called the hotel and reported it.  I knew nothing was going to be done but I would have at least like to known the Courtyard would open up an investigation.  I did not receive a call back from the hotel for approximately a week so I reached back out to them and finally was able to speak with the assistant manager.  She said they would check the door entries and send my concerns to the Marriott Claims Office (MCS).  I did not receive a call back but received a letter from Ms. W. from MCA asking me to call her back because she was unable to reach me by phone.  I called  Ms. Rosa Wong and  had to go through the complete story again for the third time.  Ms. W. said they would be sending me a letter within the next few days. I did not receive the letter and called her and she explained to me that occurances of this nature are addressed by the Innkeepers Stature for the State of Tennessee.  In short, a hotel owner is under no obligation for the loss theft, or unexplained disappearance of guest money, jewelry etc. which has not been placed in custody of the hotel for safekeeping.  I understand where they are coming from, I wish the Assistant Manager would have explained that to me... we could have saved each other a lot of time, agree.  Also,  there was no investigation open in my case.  I look at it this away, it's okay to remove someones belongings from their room, because nothing is done.  The saving grace is the person that took money from my purse located at the Marriott Downtown Nashville did not take it all.  And I learned a lesson..make sure you lock up your belongings.  I find it had to believe that this hotel does not have safes.  We will never stay at another Marriott that does not have a safe in the room.  And I have shared my experience with many many people and associates I work with.  Shared this on Facebook as well.  Also,  I guess the housekeeper needed my money worse than I did.Three stars for the terrific service staff and friendly valet.  I also like that this hotel is a re purposed historic building (opened as a bank in 1927).  But it appears the recent renovation stopped at the lobby and didn't make it to the guest rooms which was a bit of a surprise for me.My room was located on the 6th floor and while I expect odd room configurations in renovated buildings that usually have no view (my room although it had three windows- looked out at another neighboring building) I do expect my room to feel clean.  This was not the case here as the sheer draperies on the windows looked grimy.  They should just take them down and start over.The room also had very poor lighting.  I turned on every light in the room and it still was dark.  And I hate hotel configurations that have the sink out in the middle of the bedroom instead of in the bathroom.   The whole set up was a bit ""hodge podge"" and for $215 a night I expected more (especially given I had just stayed at the Sheraton down the block for half the price and a better room a few months ago)But you can't beat this place for it's location and proximity to Printers Alley and Broadway.  And the free Internet, free coffee, in room refrigerators and renovated lobby are also nice.I had a drink at the bar in the main lobby and with the soaring ceilings from the historic building as well as the friendly service behind the bar, it was a nice place to start my evening.  If your drive- valet will run you about $22 a night - just pull up on the 4th street side of the hotel and the VERY friendly valet will take your car.I also loved the service that I got from the front desk staff.  Not only were they quick and efficient- they took the time to remember my name so that when I came back down to purchase some water, I was called by name . . .a nice touch but one often found in more expensive hotels.If you like to swim- know that there is no pool at this hotel- however they do have a reciprocal agreement with it's sister hotel, The Renaissance, located a couple of blocks away so you can get your laps in there.I wanted to love this hotel, but I didn't.  And given the room I was in, three stars is generous.  But the friendly staff who went out of their way to make me happy deserve at least that.If you are looking for hospitality this isn't the place. The room sucked as well and I'm currently staring at a cement wall outside. We were told before we arrived that because we are elite status and they were making up for a prior mishap, they would upgrade us to a suite. Well that didn't happen when we arrived, but they did say that two of the three days we were here we would have two adjoining rooms.  Surprise surprise when we found out later the first day that they have that room to someone else. After staying here for two days we had enough with the place so we tried to cancel and go somewhere else, but again to our surprise they told us we couldn't cancel because it wasn't 24 hours in advance. You would think at this point they would at least be understanding and would allow us to leave. Awful all around. Do yourself a favor and find a better hotel in the area around the same $300 a night price.Definitely a good option when visiting downtown Nashville, the Courtyard Nashville Downtown is in a great location &amp; in walking distance to Broadway &amp; the other main event places in downtown Nashville. Granted, I'm from Chicago so ""walking distance"" is anything under 15 city blocks or so, but it was only 5-10 minutes from Broadway &amp; that surrounding area.Check-in was quick &amp; rather painless... the first room we were sent to was on the 2nd floor right across from the gym, but the room was not finished being cleaned, so I called to the front desk &amp; they quickly reassigned us to a different room on the 6th floor. Honestly, I was glad we got moved because I just didn't like the idea of staying right across from the gym with people going in &amp; out constantly. The room was large, 2 double beds, and the window we had faced right on Printers Alley. There was a mini fridge &amp; coffee maker in the room, as well as a human-sized hair dryer (I hate those little standard hotel hair dryers, I always fry them &amp; then have to wait 20 minutes to finish drying my hair!) so that was exciting for me. My only gripe about the room itself is that the sink area is really small &amp; poorly lit. Since our window was right above Printers Alley, it was definitely a bit noisy/bass-heavy around the 1:30 a.m. mark when I returned to the room, but luckily I had A) just the right amount of beers in me to knock myself out and B) always travel with earplugs &amp; an eye mask, so I passed right out into the super-soft mattress &amp; slept the night away. I didn't hear doors slamming or people yelling in the halls, so that's always a bonus, too. Sidebar, the water pressure in the shower will exfoliate you like nothing you've ever experienced. I love that.The hotel has valet for $20 (if I remember correctly), which is more than I'd normally pay but we needed to get in &amp; out a few times, so it was easier just to do that... the valet guys were super friendly &amp; quick. All the other staff I encountered were really nice as well... I'd definitely stay here again if there are rooms available on my next trip!Solid four, could have been a five if not for a couple of things...Starting with the good, though.  The staff were all VERY nice and helpful.  Big shout-out to the valet crew-- you guys were super.  Location was fantastic-- a short walk from Broadway and many other parts that made downtown Nashville a great visit.  Room was of ample size, well-maintained, and clean.Here's where I dinged this place from getting five stars:In our room was CONSTANT noise from a strip club in Printer's Alley.  It wasn't enough to keep us from falling asleep, but it was loud enough you could always hear it, which was annoying.  Light sleepers may have issues with this.  PLEASE NOTE-- if your room isn't on the Church Street side of the property, I don't see this being a problem.Second thing that slightly downgraded my rating-- the lighting in the bathroom/sink area was poor.  Needed to be much brighter.  Shaving, for example, was difficult, because I couldn't see well enough to make sure I wasn't missing a spot.These two negative points notwithstanding, there's now doubt that yes, I WOULD stay here again.","Nice location. Right downtown. You can walk to broadway for good music and good food. The staff is so nice. Every time you walk in and out, they say hello and welcome you back. The rooms are average the beds are nice. They also have conf rooms if you need to book a meeting.Great location, great staff, clean, starbucks coffee fresh daily,  excellent Courtyard more like a small J.W.  Room was plenty big for 5 of us.......one of us had a Cot.!! Room service really deserves a bonus as location is ideal for anyone visiting Nashville. Adjacent to all the 'hot spots'.Broadway, restaurants, bars, shops  only a few steps away. And yes, PUCKETTS every morning for breakfast 1/2 block down the road.As far as amenities go no pool or jacuzzi :(However as far as customer service goes TOP NOTCH... front desk housekeeping and even engineering were superbWould give you ten stars if we could!!  Such an excellent crew at the front desk no matter what time of the day or night it was.  Nathan and Aisha (spelling!!) took great care of us, they ""get"" what customer service means!! The Valet associates are a close second with nice help at check-in and check-out.  Mike in Engineering - great historical review of hotel and customer service too. Excellent location to music and museums. Keep up the great work!!No platinum members lounge.   No breakfast.   Clean rooms but walls were too thin.  Could hear conversations in adjoining roomsIt's a Courtyard... so you should already know what to expect.  But this one is just steps from the bar &amp; restaurant scene in Nashville... at a decent rate.  Extra star for location.This hotel was a true disappointment. Rooms were dirty, sheets not changed.Some front desk members were rude and indignant, totally screwed up our bill, the housekeeping manager was doing check out.The Bistro was extremely over priced. The only good thing was the location.Would not recommend.Great location, staff were very helpful...perfect spot for a group staying the weekend in Nashville.This is a nice hotel with a friendly desk staff. It sits in the center of downtown Nashville, so it's easy to get to the stadium to watch the Titans play or all the downtown country western themed bars that the city is known for. You can walk most places tourists like and cabs are plentiful as well. My only beef with this place are the valets are lackluster. You have to wait for a little while and often no one is manning the valet desk. The valet's doubled as bell hops as a need not added service.  Since the hotel has no adjacent lot, all cars have to be valeted. Also the hotel sits at the corner of an intersection, and the only way to check in and unload is to pull into the small valet lane on the left of the street. This can be tricky on a high volume traffic day. Passengers on the right of the car be warned.I just returned from a business trip to Nashville, staying at the Courtyard by Marriott Downtown for 6 nights.  Everyone on the staff that I encountered was extremely nice and helpful and the room was spacious and clean.  The sink area is a bit small, but the bathroom was large and had a tub/shower combo.My room was a double (two full/qeen?? beds) and faced Church street.  Overall it was pretty quiet considering the busy corner.  There was a bit of ""base"" noise from somewhere at times, but other than that, it was fairly quiet.  I didn't hear the normal everyday traffic, but did (of course) hear a couple of emergency vehicle sirens.  I will say that I kept the air conditioning fan on 24/7 so that probably acted as ""white noise"" where the traffic was concerned.  I only heard other guests one time in the hall, and other than that I heard nothing...not from the rooms above me or below me or on either side of me.The room amenities included a mini-fridge, a full sized ironing board and iron, a full sized hair dryer (though I preferred my own), lots of towels/wash cloths, internet (both wired and wireless), an alarm clock radio, flat screen TV, a chair and ottoman, a desk with desk chair, a couple of telephones.  The closet was a decent size, but wish there had been more hangers.  There was a small shelf in the closet which helped with some of my non-hanging items.  There were four small drawers in a dresser which acted as a TV stand, and there was a nightstand between the two beds with a very small drawer and a ""cubby"" space beneath that.My one MINOR wish was for more electrical outlets, especially by the second bed so I could sit in bed with my laptop plugged in.  There was an outlet by the other bed which was against one wall.The location was fantastic...1 block from my office and an easy, short distance from the rest of downtown.  There is a tiny grocery store just a few steps away which seemed to have a bit of everything.  I am allergic to gluten, and they even had some gluten-free items (a loaf of bread, gluten free burrito, etc.)  There is a nice sized cafe in the lobby area which is open for breakfast and dinner.  It's more of a ""fast-food"" type place where you order at the counter and they bring you your food.  They do have eggs and bacon/sausage type meals as well.I had an early flight out on my last day, so the front desk ordered a taxi for me the night before.  The staff was extremely helpful in giving directions and offering suggestions for places to eat/shop etc.Do not stay here!  We had a very bad experience with this hotel.  Let me start by saying that we reserved a room for our wedding night.  The next morning we had a very early flight to Montego Bay so we checked out of our room around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  We actually had no complaints until we tried to use our debit card on a large purchase in Jamaica on our honeymoon and it was denied.  OK, this special time that only happens once in your life.... was completely ruined because this hotel charged our account 3 TIMES for the room amount at a whopping $240 a pop. We only left a small amount in our checking account because we were travelling out of country (just in case something happened and someone got our card number or something).  After getting charged $19.99 per MB to check our bank account using data on my cell phone, we discovered this MESS that Courtyard put us in.  We had planned on a couple's massage by the beach in Jamaica but that couldn't happen!  Plans on our honeymoon were ruined and I am still very upset!!!After getting back into the states on a Saturday evening, I called the hotel to try and figure out what as going on.  I was told that a manager would have to speak with me and she would not be in until Tuesday.  I was forwarded to her voicemail and left a message.  The manager finally got back with me and she stated that she had no idea what was going on.  I explained to her my process through booking: I am a Marriott Rewards Member so I just logged into my account and booked a room.  After realizing that I would not be about to check into the room at check in since our wedding was at 4pm I called the hotel and added my husband to the account so that he could check into the room.  I also asked about how much the deposit for the room would be since Marriott usually charges a deposit in case of any charges.  The lady told me that it varies per hotel and I told her that I needed to know (since we were only transferring a certain amount into our checking).  She called the hotel and then finally got back on the line with me... she said that the deposit would not be more than $50.  When he went to check in he told them he wasn't sure what name the reservation was under it could have been either one of our last names. They found the reservation and got him checked in.  We checked out at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and that was all we knew.  The manager had then figured out what had happened: They created a new reservation for my husband and then charged me for a NO SHOW on my reservation.  The third charge was the pre-authorization that showed $220!  Let me re-cap:  They charged me 2 TIMES FOR THE ROOM and screwed up the check in.  THEN... they neglected to let us know that the pre-authorization and the room cost would be charged in the same amount on the same day of check in!  They also charged us for parking!  We had already parked our car in a parking garage and did not park with them!   The manager acted as if it was my husbands fault for creating a new reservation.   I assured her that he absolutely knew that we had a reservation and wouldn't have created a new reservation that it must have been her staff that messed up!  She credited my account for the no-show, told me that the pre-authorization takes 7 business days to fall off of the account, and then credited me for the parking.  She did credit back all fraudulent charges to our account!  However, she can never replace what we lost on our honeymoon all because of their screw ups and neglect in informing us about the pre-authorization and room charge on the same day!  (Basically it showed up twice in one day right after another... which makes no sense... usually a pre-authorization is charged to hold the money and then the balance is updated... like when you leave a tip at a restaurant... not two separate charges!).Ridiculous!!I stayed here for one night on a business trip and I was not disappointed. Big, clean room... comfy bed... 10.99 all you can eat breakfast buffet... and close to everything downtown. Really, no complaints and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.Stayed here 2 nights over Labor Day weekend using Marriott Rewards points.Good location, clean room seemed to be nicely updated for it being advertised as being in a ""historic setting."" Appreciated the free (plugged in) internet. I'd stay here again.The Courtyard is nicely renovated hotel from another era near a lot of  downtown Nashville action. The Courtyard Nashville Downtown seems to have it all except FREE breakfast. We were told on the phone while making reservations and at the check-in there would be a FREE breakfast buffet included in the cost of staying here. Unfortunately, when presented with our breakfast bill we informed the staff of our FREE breakfast and no one knew anything about it. We had to speak to the manager, Dennis, before we were finally given what was promised to us from the start. This is no way to run a upscale hotel. Shame on you Marriott Corporation.Three Stars for the hotel room, the lobby and beautiful dinning area and ONE STAR for the bait and switch attempt on our poor little street smart souls.Go there and see if they promise you the same FREE breakfast deal, but refuse to keep their promise until confronted by me. Bow Wow!The only good thing about this hotel is that the staff is really nice.The bad:- The beds are so uncomfortable. You'll sink into them. I hardly got any sleep! - The rooms are institutional.- The bathroom is gross. When you turn on the light, the light would flicker for about five seconds and then makes this annoying buzzing noise. - The lighting makes your skin look yellowish green. - The shuttles to the convention center are usually about 10 minutes late. I don't think the neighboring hotels are much better.The perfect place to stay if you're in town for a Titans game...which I wasn't.  But, as I found out on Sunday morning, the hotel is pretty close to the stadium...so close that most people are parked further away than the hotel.I arrived early in the morning after a redeye flight (with a 4-hr layover), so I was a bit grumpy when they told me no rooms would be available until the standard check-in time.  You can't really ding a hotel for that...since that's what they tell you to expect!  When I did get my room, I found it to be relatively big; the room with two doubles is a large rectangle while the room with a king bed is set-up almost like a suite (I saw my friend's).  The double rooms had enough room for an armchair, ottoman and desk and plenty of walking around room.  The bathrooms were the standard.  (I was a little saddened by the lack of a comforter or heavy blanket in the room...it still gets cold in Nashville!)I was a bit disappointed by the service, particularly the unpleasant front desk staff.  When we tried to check-in first thing in the morning, they were pretty dismissive of our request - no sympathy for us there.  Later in the day, we needed taxis to get to the wedding (I know it was close but it was cold...and we didn't feel like walking), and we asked them to call us three taxis.  When they arrived, we realized they were actually van taxis so they seated five rather than four, so we only needed two taxis.  There was a bit of confusion as we were running out to get the taxis, but I told the front desk that we didn't need the third taxi because the ones that had arrived were bigger than expected, and he gave me an exasperated look (perhaps eye-rolling?) and said, ""it doesn't matter now.""  Goodness, I was just trying to be nice...The Courtyard Marriott is located in the heart of Downtown Nashville - just a few blocks from Broadway which is filled with bars and restaurants and the Country Music Hall of Fame.  I'm guessing the location is one of the reasons why it is relatively expensive.  For my experience/what I got, I thought the hotel was pretty expensive at ~$170 per night.  I didn't have a ton of choice this time around, but I'll probably choose differently next time - or at least do a bit more research.Location on this hotel is key. You can walk anywhere for food, entertainment, and business. The view from my room was amazing and (strangely) had a jacuzzi near the window just a short hop from the end of my bed and no way connected to my bathroom. The room overall was a little subpar from what I have come to expect from the Coutyard brand. Poor lighting, worn carpets, and old paint made this feel outdated. Everything was clean and up kept, but I feel the price was a little hefty. The staff were awesome and the valets were lightning quick. All I ask is a quick remodel and this hotel will get my repeat business. I heard there was a nice Double Tree a block away that has a Starbucks in the lobby....I was really impressed with this courtyard...especially after reading the mediocre reviews on here.  The staff was wonderful...from the valets to the front desk to the bartenders.  The all gave great advice on where to go and what to do.  You simply cannot ask for a better location.  Less than a 5 minute walk to Broadway...even in heels ;)  The room was clean and comfortable.  Nothing overly exciting as far as decor but not your standard Courtyard.  If you are looking for a great place to stay with friendly staff and an unbeatable location, stay here.  I know I will be the next time I'm in NashvilleNot the best Courtyard I've stayed at. Courtyards are usually my preference when I'm out traveling. The bathtub was starting to peel. The beds were comfy and the rooms were clean. Biggest pro = this place is 5 mins to the airport and has free shuttle service.Great room, very clean will stay again next time I'm in Nashville location location !!","Clean and renovated bathrooms. Bed was just okay.  Stayed  with points; glad I didn't really pay for it or I would have been disappointed. Room was oddly large -- with that much space they could have added a seocond armchair or a sofa. Parking options don't exist : you will pay $22 for valet.I had a decent stay at this Courtyard.  The beds were clean and comfy, I had a great view of Midtown, and everything worked fine.  I really liked that they leave a note saying to call if you need room service if you sleep in.  We woke up at 2 PM one day, and usually hotels will just assume you don't want room service and give up on you.  I like how they leave you a note and tell you to call to request room service so that you're not guessing all day whether your room will be clean when you get back or not.  A negative aspect: the parking garage is poorly designed and cramped.  You have very little room to back up, and if you're leaving while a car is coming, you'll be stuck in an awkward moment where the two of you are trying to coordinate how to solve the problem. To end on a good note: It's in a great area of town: very close to downtown, music row, belmont, Vanderbilt, and some great restaurants.  I guess the ideal place would be to stay downtown so you could never use your car, but this is the 2nd best area you can stay at in my opinion.",,,"['nice', 'place', 'small', 'rooms', 'mini',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-vanderbilt-nashville,Hampton Inn Vanderbilt,4.0,$$,42,"Fantastic! The rooms were clean, beds extra comfy, four pillows to choose from, refrigerator in the room, decor attractive and modern, the bathroom is well equipped, and outlets adequate. Note: no microwave in the room but there is one down in the lobby.The hot breakfast includes oatmeal, bananas, berries, melon, bagels, croissants, toast, muffins, peanut butter, bacon, fried potatoes, and Belgium waffles.There is hot tea and coffee in the lobby.The free shuttle service is amazing and a key draw to this hotel. I saved a ton in cab fees! The driver makes their contact number available so you can call at any time to get picked up with only a maximum of a 15 minute wait (in my personal experience). And the driver is very friendly.The fitness room includes two treadmills, one NordicTrack type, seated bike, full set of Dumbbells, and an adjustable weight machine. Towels, water, and disposable headsets are provided. Some of the machines have a TV and there is another TV in the room. I highly recommend this hotel!I'm a long time Hilton Honors member and whenever possible stay at Hilton branded hotels. I've stayed at their hotels all over the world. Hampton Inns are a good, value priced chain that typically covers the basics and this hotel is no exception.The rooms here have been partially remodeled, the beds and desks are new, the televisions  seem to be reasonably new. The rest of the furniture like the love seat in the photo with my review are old and worn and the carpet is also old, stained and worn. I'm not a fan of either. The art on the walls was also very dated and the tub was old and was bowed in the bottom, it was also extremely slick with not mat or traction surface.The parking lot is good, they do have security that roams through at night. The breakfast is typical of the chain. They do have vending machines as there is no close convenience store.The staff here were extremely friendly and helpful, had it not been for them I'd have likely give this place two stars because of the grunginess of the carpet and furniture. I'd stay here again for sure but I'd hope they'd take care of some of the issues first.This place is A-OK. This place gets a solid 3.5 stars. The Good: It's affordable. In fact, it's one of the most affordable in the area. The rooms are simple and clean. The space is utilized very well. They did bring me a microwave when requested at no extra charge, which was really nice. The beds are comfortable. The gym has the makings for a very good workout. The only thing I'd suggest is some kettle bells and a bosu ball. Hampton has a decent breakfast in the AM, featuring yogurts, eggs, sausage or bacon, potatoes, oatmeal, boiled eggs, and/or a selection of breads and baked goods including waffles. Fresh fruit and a fruit medley area also available.The Bad: Not much in the bad department.The carpets were dirty, as evidenced by our dirty socks. Some of the staff was super friendly, while others....not so much. They had a fire alarm go off at around 0800. We all rushed outside (it was probably close to 30 degrees) but got to go in about 20 minutes later. I guess that there was a leak down in the basement. I think it was pretty awesome that the staff kept us updated, but it really sucked when the water got turned off post-alarm, and I couldn't take a shower after I went to the gym :(The verdict: This is a decent place. It's not fantastic, but it's good enough to lay down your head at night to rest.Rare hotel in Nashville that doesn't charge for parking! I did a detailed research and compared this one to many others on Orbitz. Make sure you tally in the parking costs when you compare this hotel to others because if you have 2 cars @ $20 per day for 5 days, that will cost you $200 just for parking! Yikes. You can take the free shuttle within a 2 mile radius and then take Uber/Lyft back to the hotel for $4-6. I suggest you drive to Parthenon though because parking is free and easy. Also, if you want to go touring after midnight (which I did), it's okay to drive because there is plenty of side street parking for free (especially on 3rd/Molloy). Excellent service! Breakfast = amazing! It gets kinda crowded in the breakfast area but it gets the job done. The servers are quick to refill as soon as something runs out and they are constantly on standby if you need anything else. A lady who was handicap basically had her own personal server (she sat down and made the server do everything for her, she even made the waffles which takes 5-6 minutes). I accidentally spilled an entire jug of ice right in front of the manager/supervisor and she didn't show any sign of annoyance. Instead she took the jug from my hand and said I'll get you more water. You won't see this in Chicago!!! Our pillows/bed were super duper comfy. Extra extra clean. Our thermostat though wasn't quite working. We set the thermostat to 60 degrees but the room temperature was consistently at 70 degrees. House keeping is super quick, but make sure you call early if you want something because I think housekeeping closes at 10ish. The free wifi works well enough to stream movies/music. You will be walking distance from many coffee shops, Pizza hut, taco bell and a bunch of other stuff. I thought this hotel was in a great location overall.I couldnt tell you how this hotel is because after I spent a hour on the phone with customer service making a reservation for the rooms I found online I was transferred to the hotel to ""complete my payment"" at which time I was told I had no reservation and they didnt have the rooms I needed available. When I called customer service again I spent another half hour on the phone trying to get the situation fixed but they couldnt get me the rooms there, or at any of the hotels nearby for the promised rate. . . waste of timeStayed here early May 2015 while coming into town for a concert.Overall a really good stay with no major complaints. Quality of room was comprable to DoubleTree, though not quite on level of Hilton (Yes, I'm a HHonors member). Our king bed was comfortable, the room spacious, as was the bathroom. Minifridge in room was a plus, except it hardly cooled anything. I was better off just getting ice from the down the hallway. Free WiFi for all guests, no charge for parking either. And parking spaces were ample, even on a weekend. Although I didn't use it, there was a pretty decent breakfast bar, a small fitness room, and pool (though the pool was going through some renovations). My main gripe would be the price. Though I liked the hotel well enough, it didn't justify the 200+ per night. I realize it may be because of the location in a busy city like Nashville, but I've stayed at higher end hotels in bigger cities for less. As for the staff, almost everyone was great. The daytime desk clerks were polite, professional, and helpful. Housekeeping did a good job. My only gripe was the night time desk person. He was rather nonchalant about checking me in, and forgot to give me a parking tag for my car-- I don't want to imagine what would have happened if I got towed without it being my fault.Great location, hotel is dated though. The doors slam, music is blaring at all hours of the night, bathtub didn't turn on (first call to maintenance), sink didn't drain (second call but was 10:30 at night, so I just lived with it). I'm a Hampton gal and while the location is great for Vandy and proximity to restaurants. It isn't great for comfort. Wouldn't stay here again.I was really impressed with this hotel in all aspects. When we arrived, we were met with smiles and friendly staff. The room was perfect! The blankets weren't paper stiff or spongey--definitely the best bedding I've ever experienced in a hotel. We also got GooGoo Clusters with our welcome package and plenty of the necessities, like shampoo, soap, towels, and city information. The shuttle runs in a 2 mile radius, which includes the Broadway strip, so you can easily get to and from the hotel, and the drivers are such sweethearts--full of suggestions and information for out-of-towners. The distance also isn't bad for walking if you're up to it, and you can get to Centennial Park pretty easily from the hotel on a casual stroll as well. The breakfast in the morning is impressive and it's not dried out eggs and pastries--fresh fruit, bagels, waffle maker, yogurts, etc.--all of the things that I'd like to have for breakfast instead of empty calorie meals that won't fuel my tourist walks. The free parking, pool, and fitness center are all wonderful perks and though I didn't have time to check out the gym or pool, they definitely looked clean and well kept. I'll definitely be staying here again.If you're looking for a reasonably priced hotel with a great location with added perks, this is the place for you. If you're looking for a quiet, upscale hotel, this isn't for you. The hotel is a straight shot to downtown and maybe 5 minutes tops. There are tons of restaurants around that you can walk to, including the famous Hattie Bs. They offer a free hot breakfast, free wifi, free parking (almost all surrounding hotels charge for parking), fitness center, and a shuttle that will take you downtown.  That being said, the hot breakfast was pretty impressive for this hotel. They cover all the basics - eggs, sausage, waffles, cereal, yogurt, fruit, pastries, biscuits, bagels, etc. Surprisingly, the biscuits were reallyyyy good. Warm, big, and fluffy. I would expect nothing less in Nashville. The fitness center was above average. There were TVs, treadmills, elliptical, bike, free weights, medicine balls, and a water cooler. I was pretty impressed. The shuttle was non-existent. It was there when we first checked in and then I never saw it again. I wish they would structure this like their Hilton brand partners and have a schedule of every 30 minutes so you knew when to expect it The room was very large and clean. The bathroom was very spacious for a hotel. Housekeeping never got in the way and was very thorough.  Here's the downside: we were located on the first floor, not far off from the lobby.  People were constantly walking by and not using their inside voices. The walls are thin so don't expect a quiet stay. It sounded like their was a family of 40 staying next to us.  Also, in the mornings there was this insanely loud electrocuting sound every 5 minutes and we couldn't figure out what it was. I now know what it feels like to be in a bug zapper. It didn't happen at night or interfere with my sleep so I was less annoyed by it. Overall, we did enjoy the stay. The hotel location and perks outweighed its zoo-like atmosphere and we would stay here again, but just request a quieter room next time.Great experience in Nashville made better by this hotel. The staff are so friendly and accommodating. The women serving breakfast in the morning are so sweet and kind. Room was beautiful and comfy, clean and very large. No complaints at all. Great location near Vanderbilt and mucus row.Price = 4Experience = 4Great location to Nashville fun... consistent Hampton.Excellent location and was a great place to stay the weekend in Nashville. They even have a shuttle down to Broadway. Good restaurants within walking distance for dinner and breakfast.this is a great place to stay. the staff is exceptional from the front desk, breakfast bar, custodians. the only negative point is the workout room. Too small and not enough equipment. but still adequate for a work out. I highly recommend this hotel.I'm not really sure where the 4 star average comes from.  It's decent, good location if you're visiting Vanderbilt. Reasonably close to downtown (not really walking distance).  Staff was fine. Hotel rooms were clean. Older property but reasonably well maintained.   Breakfast room is not good, it's in the basement.  Very small limited food options ( I stay in 1 or 2 hamptons per week,  this is one of the worst with regard to the breakfast room.  Price for room was a bit on the high side for what you get but to be fair, I was in town for a conference and hotels might be high occupancy.   Probably would look elsewhere next time.While on a recent week long vacation in Tennessee, the wife and I stayed exclusively at Hampton Inns, due to the Yelp reviews and locations of where we wanted to stay. I am a little bummed every time I stay, knowing a little bit of my money goes to Paris Hilton in some way, but man, this is a great hotel chain. This hotel was no exception.Check in was a breeze, and the front desk staff was super friendly. The room was amazing. Very roomy and comfortable, with lots of amenities and free extras. The room came with a mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, iron &amp; ironing board, flat screen TV, and plenty of outlets for charging your electronics. Bed was super comfortable with clean linens and lots of pillows. Bathroom was spacious with lots of towels and freebies (body wash, lotions, mouthwash, etc.) The free breakfast here is also no joke- fresh scrambled eggs, bacon, yogurt, fresh fruit, bagels &amp; toast, oatmeal with toppings, juice, coffee.... This place even made some bagel bite type meals with eggs, bacon, and cheese on a bagel. Really impressive, and it's definitely worth fighting a hangover at 8 am to go downstairs and get it.The location is nice- right off the highway, and close enough to walk to Broadway to experience downtown Nashville, however you should utilize this hotels free shuttle van. It goes back and forth from the hotel to a certain intersection in Nashville. It's free to guests, I just threw a nice tip at the driver every time we used it- definitely cheaper than taking a cab, and considering the amount of alcohol I consumed in Nashville, the smartest way to go. There's also a few great restaurants and fast food chains right across the street if you want to go out.All in all, I had a GREAT stay here, definitely recommended. Great, clean, comfortable rooms, friendly staff, and a great location. For the money I paid it was worth every penny, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat!I stayed here for 3 nights (Thu-Sat) and I have to say - I was impressed!  I thought it was a little expensive but everything was clean, and well functioning (except for the loose outlet in the bathroom but that just made it homey).  The bed was incredibly comfortable.  Great pillows, and I liked the nice little tray thing with beanbags and elastic so one could read or work on a laptop in bed -- I want one of those things!  The bedding was fantastic - it was very comfortable and distinctly lacking in cat hair (a feature that would have made it more homey).The hotel was well insulated from outside noise.  I could see the cars going by but couldn't hear them! Yay!The staff - Russell, TO, Craig (the shuttle driver) were all incredibly friendly, helpful and professional.The fitness room even has dumbbells!  And towels! And water!The cons - well, I would love it if other guests would be more considerate.  There was more door-slamming and shouting in the hallway than in a freshman dorm the first weekend a bunch of teenagers spend away from home.  And - I'm not talking about teenage guests.  People were LOUD in the hallway late at night and nobody held their door in hand to close it, just let it slam BAM! shut behind them.  Folks were shockingly rude in their noisiness as they walked past where other people were sleeping.I didn't bother to look at breakfast - I'm vegan.  I brought a shaker and protein powder because I don't expect anyone outside the Bay Area or Portland to actually know what vegans eat.  And - no hot tub/jaccuzzi!  There was a tiny excuse of a pool but not even a hot sauna or steam room?  Bummer.  I'd stay there again - but definitely rent a car because sidewalks are inconsistent in Nashville.Stayed here with a group of girls for 2 nights to visit our girl friend who lives in Nashville.  Great location, with plenty of parking.  Spacious room, comfortable, clean bed/room, friendly staff...everything that you would expect from a Hampton Inn.I can go on to talk about the amenities that they had, but we really didn't utilize them to their fullest.  Don't think we used the TV, lapdesk, desk...after all, when you are having a girls weekend, there's no time for that, right?  We did use the mini-fridge, which was actually pretty big and fit a lot of the snacks/drinks that we used for the weekend.If I'm looking for a centrally located hotel in Nashville, again, this will definitely be on the top of my list!My girl friend and I stayed here to explore Nashville for a few days. Nice room, always felt safe. Received lots of information and sight-seeing suggestions from the front desk; they even gave us advice regarding where and when it was safe to walk places (vs take a cab). ALSO I just have to mention the shuttle driver. We utilized this whenever we could, because (a) although it's doable to walk to the district, it was cold and (b) he doesn't quite go everywhere. Just most places. He suggested a few places for us to try; namely, B.B. King's Blues Bar. It ended up being one of my favorite places during the whole trip. Even the other people in the shuttle decided to come in with us! The driver also gave us cards so we didn't have to pay cover, which was great. I'd definitely stay here again. It is also right next to Vandy and very close the Centennial Park.We had 5 rooms there over the weekend.  Very clean, large, and comfortable.  Good coffee in the lobby available anytime.  Super impressed with the rooms and the staff.Stayed while on a business trip to Nashville. Had a problem with my company credit card while checking in, but the staff was very courteous and helpful in getting it resolved quickly. My room was very spacious, comfortable, and very decorated nicely. Bed was very comfortable and the internet connection was very good. I have to say it was one of the nicest rooms I have ever stayed in! The breakfast buffet was excellent with numerous food choices. Everything I had was very tasty. Excellent location close to pretty much everything in downtown Nashville. Just an all around great hotel!","Very happy with my stay here with my mom. The parking is free, there is complimentary breakfast which is surprisingly decent, free wifi, and a free shuttle to take you where you need to go. There is also free coffee and chocolate chip cookies during the day in the lobby. Free computer use as well in the business center. Every one of the staff that I came into contact with was very friendly and helpful. The sheets and duvet cover where nice and clean. There was a mini shampoo, conditioner, and two bars of soap - all Neutrogena brand, which was nice. The hotel room could probably use a few paint touch ups and maybe new carpet but overall it's clean and comfy. The cost of the hotel isn't cheap but I think it is definitely worth it.Great Hampton Inn!!! Very comfortable room, friendly staff and a great location. Breakfast was very good and the hotel is clean and very updated.Every single staff member was so friendly- from the people at the front desk, to the free shuttle driver, to the staff at the complimentary breakfast! The lobby is cozy and the location is close to lots of goodies. The free shuttle will take you anywhere within 2 miles which includes the downtown drag on Btoadway. The bed was incredibly comfortable, good hot coffee was accessible all day and the breakfast was really tasty with lots of options including croissants and really flavorful potatoes.We visited this hotel on our way to Alabama. It was a good room overall. We had doubles and the furniture was phenomenal. I love the espresso look and it was very gorgeous. The location was perfect for those who want to get away from the downtown area. The breakfast was really good as well with a nice arrangement of cereal to take on the way too! I would definitely recommend it. Staff was very nice too.Experienced Around: Jan 11, 2012I go to school at Vanderbilt and my mom came down for 2 nights to help me unpack my storage space.  The Hamilton Inn had the best price for hotels within a half mile radius of the campus.  Its in a good location, across from a lot of restaurants, and close to downtown.Pros- good location, fair price ($120-130/night), friendly staff, free popcorn and coffee/ tea/ hot cocoa in the lobby, complimentary breakfast, free parking, free wifi, very nice renovated rooms, a mini fridge, comfy beds, rooms are spacious, lots of lighting in the room, at night it can either be pitch black or if you want, there is a lot of night lights.  Quick and easy check in/ out.Cons- the Ac/heater made a humming noise which is not noticeable at day, but when I woke in the morning, I had a migraine.  Also, the wifi is somewhat slow/ bad connection.Bottom line: it wasn't the perfect experience, but I would stay here again.This place is excellent. Unless they added a bunch of extras and upped their price, they can't be five stars. But it the money, you really can't get any better. Everyone was friendly, the place is exceptionally clean, the lobby is well above average, and the room is more than enough for an extremely comfortable and peaceful nights sleep.I have got to remember that I love Hampton Inn! I love a place that feels like they care about good design. Lots of dark wood, and modern design, that has at its focus comfort. I LOVE the fact that through out the entire hotel is black and white photography! So, classy and good stuff! I really enjoyed the stay even if it was for one night! all the little things have been taken care of. (There was even a classic yellow posted note on the headboard of the bed telling me the linens were cleaned just for me! it is a tiny small thing most might not notice... but Hampton Inn gets it! It is the small things that make the difference. The comforter has little bumps in it and gives the  duvet cover a unique look! The bathroom had granite counter tops! The office desk had wheels and could be put anywhere in the room. I highly recommend this place to stay! Great eating right around the hotel also makes this a great location for any one visiting Vanderbilt or the Upper Room/General Board of Discipleship.Pros: GREAT comforting design, from the front lobby to the rooms.Service at the front desk was just fine.Price is great for the classy feel and level of comfort that I have while staying here.free Wi-FI, parking, and breakfast, and hotel van that will drive you around within reason. Cons: air temperature in the hall ways and near the elevators was really bad and very humid.My room temp said it was set for 70 degrees, but there is no way. I had it set to 60 degrees and it took quite a while to get to that temp.Once we got a shower curtain, THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!  We ate the BEST breakfast, jogged on the treadmill, did some laundry IN THE beautifully renovated basement.  We liked the Business area and lobby.  It wasn't crowded but managed to use the computers and drink the coffee - long enough to update this review.  And nice pool.  It had saline water instead of Chlorine - VERY NICE...............We WILL be back.  Our little home away from home can walk to many restaurants and drive to just about anywhere else from here.  Vanderbilt area and the hospitals are within walking distance but the best part is.........Chuy's (I will review that place separately.)  and the BP Station.  What a nice place - very friendly town and excellent location to come and go.  We'd call the Hampton Inn, home again - if Nashville will give us a reason to come back!  :)Stayed here, using points. Pros: quiet! (and the place was packed with little league teams), good water pressure, decent albeit small gym, clean, comfortable king bed, properly cooled (during a horrible heat wave), refrig, coin laundry was good, staff was handling the large volume of inquiries well, kids seemed to love the outdoor poolCons: breakfast did not accommodate GF/DF needs; fruit is not enough- no hard boiled eggs so no protein available,  elevator was slow (people opted for the stairs regularly) and I heard others sharing their stories of weirdnessOdd: Seems there must have been a corner soap holder that did not work out in the shower; big chunk of cement on the two walls became the focal point.EXCEPTIONALLY LOUD! Those two words pretty much sum up our entire experience at the Hampton Inn Vanderbilt. Each night while trying to fall asleep around 11pm/midnight a parade of drunk 20 something's and beyond would decide to continue their partying, drunk conversations, and make out sessions in the hallways, which apparently have paper thin walls and sound as if there are no doors on the rooms. I don't want to deny anyone their partying, especially in a fine town such as Nashville, I just don't want to hear it well past 3 am every night!I understand a hotel cannot always monitor every action of their patron, but they could hire a security guard to patrol the halls and tell people to shut their yaps. Secondly, after barely sleeping from the noise the night before, the hotel staff crew begin their cleaning and daily maintenance around 7 am. Complete with slamming doors, large creaky carts full of supplies and again, unnecessarily loud conversations, the hotel staff begin their day waking up the guests. Not what I call a pleasant wake up call. One person, who perhaps had bad indigestion or who maybe was just particularly rude, went through the halls each morning loudly belching like Barney from the Simpsons. To their credit: the hotel had a great location, free parking and breakfast, the rooms were very clean and in good working order and the desk staff polite. Albeit a bit overpriced, the hotel itself was pretty a-okay. But if you like peace and quite at night and a decent night sleep, look elsewhere. I have NEVER stayed anyplace SO LOUD! And I certainly won't stay here again.Adequate is the word that best sums up this hotel.If most of your stay revolves around the midtown area then you can't do much better than the location here.Bonuses:Free parking. I was shocked by this as it seems to be a rarity unless you are in the burbs.Free Wi-Fi. Another shocking item that is usually a huge upcharge at most hotels. The price point, freebies, and location make this a good option.After spending several days and all of my company's money at Opryland, which was huge and confusing to walk through and excessive, I was really surprised by how much I loved our room here. We switched for the last night to save some money. It was comfortable and the interior design of the lobby and rooms were creative and aesthetically pleasing. The breakfast was quality and nutritious: omelettes with cheese, decent bacon, american potatoes, fruit, hardboiled eggs, yogurt, prepared oatmeal, etc. This is really key for me, as I care a lot about nutritious food. The lobby had nice, comfortable chairs and a fireplace! Our room was beautiful. Gorgeous drapes, soft, comfortable sheets and blankets. The bathroom was updated and just so nice. There is really something to be said about the cleanliness of the room. It was really noticeable how well cared for. And all of the staff were very friendly. If I would have known how nice this place was, I would have stayed here all week and driven to Opryland for my conference. That should really tell you how good this place is.Nice hotel.  The staff was generally nice and pleasant, and I appreciated the ease in getting checked in and out, as well as the continental breakfast.  The room was also nice, with the general amenities one would expect from a hotel like this (shower stuff, coffee, iron/ironing board).One minor gripe: I'm not a big fan of housekeeping calls at 8:15 AM.  It wasn't too bad, as I had been up for the previous 45 minutes, but I was getting into the shower and probably would not have been as enthused.Also the elevators are slow.  Like crawling slow.However, it does seem to be an overall well-run establishment, and a decent place to stay the night if you're doing something nearby at Vandy or elsewhere.Everytime I come to Nashville I either stay here our at the Embassy Suites. Both are excellent hotels. I really like the Hampton Inn because it is centrally located, has amenities like a hair dryer in the bathroom, clean linens and a complementary breakfast. Win! If I am looking for an affordable hotel in this great city that is centrally located (which why wouldn't you want those things??) I will stay here!Pretty standard hotel in downtown Nashville. I stayed here one night on a business trip and found it perfectly ordinary. The hotel is currently undergoing renovations, so there is a lot of construction out front, but I didn't hear any noise from it while I was there.Pluses: Free wifi and free breakfast are always great. The wifi was okay--it wasn't fast enough to download the TomTom app to my iphone, which I tried to do all night, but it was fast enough to check email, browse the internet, and use FaceTime on my phone. The breakfast was also good for a free breakfast. There was a self-serve waffle machine, plus some ""cheese omelets"" with fake cheese (ew), ham, and potatoes, yogurt, cereal, and various drinks. There was also an outdoor pool that looked nice.Ordinary aspects: My room certainly hadn't been renovated. It smelled kind of musty and had really ugly rough walls. The bathroom was massive, though, and the shower had fantastic pressure. My room looked out onto the main window, but it only had one curtain, and didn't have the thin curtain that lets in light but not prying eyes. So there were two options--no natural light but privacy; or natural light but everyone in the parking lot can see you. Location: The hotel has a central location. It didn't really seem to be within walking distance of anything, though, so you'd either need to drive or take a taxi. Blackstone Brewery was across the street, so I went there for dinner, which was convenient (there's also an Italian restaurant next door to the brewery).Overall: I can see why this hotel is getting renovated: it's starting to show its age. There were no deal-breakers that would prevent me from staying here, it just wasn't very exceptional. I definitely would have been disappointed if this was a holiday for me, but for business it was fine. I think I paid $150 or $170, which is clearly mostly for location. However, it seemed like even if you were going other places in the heart of Nashville, you'd still need to drive, so even the location wasn't that much of a benefit. If I was going to Vanderbilt U or to Music Row, I definitely would have driven from the hotel. So yeah, not a bad experience by any means, but not good enough to return if I'm back to Nashville.This hotel rates five stars because of one if their staff members named Kela. We encountered an issue which she tackled and resolved in an amazing way. Not only did she initiate and follow, she actually sent a card and a box of candy to our room. We travel extensively, and you're lucky to get anyone's attention when you need help. Obviously the Hotel management is of high caliber as their hiring skills are evident. I'll be back!Stayed here for four nights in January 2011, while in town for company meetings. I'm a Hilton Diamond member, so I'm very familiar with the entire chain. Also, I never get to spend four consecutive nights in the same place, so I got to know this hotel pretty well.As far as Hamptons go, this one was probably in the top 25% of Hamptons I've stayed at. The room was on the more recently-renovated end, bathroom was spacious enough (for one person, at least), wireless ran at a decent speed, and breakfast was...free. Can't really complain, I usually just grabbed a bagel and OJ anyway.I got a $139 rate, which wasn't the best I've ever seen (I could have gotten $119 if I'd been willing to non-refundable pre-pay, but company won't allow that), but it was cheaper than the guy who checked in ahead of me, who had a $159 rate. I don't think I'd pay $159 for this hotel, but $139 seemed reasonable. Also, there was a refrigerator in my room (I don't think they're in every room), but no microwaves in any of the rooms. I'm okay with that, but some people like to have microwaves.Overall, I'd stay here again. The brewery and Italian joints across the street are both pretty good, there are other good restaurants on Elliston (within walking distance, even in the bitter cold), and the Hampton mattresses are awesome. Recommended.The first stop on our road trip.  Very accommodating front desk staff who offered suggestions of where to eat and where to go line dancing. Comfortable beds and accommodations.  Offered a shuttle service to downtown until 11PM, we were able to call him to pick us up when we were ready.  Would definitely stay here again.We were here for a concert and a weekend get away among friends and it is good. Service at the front desk was great and the staff is really attentive to the guests needs. I would defiantly stay here again and its close to a few good restaurants and a really good brewery across the street. I gave it 4 only because there are a few minor things in the bathroom such as a few cracks that make it look worse then it is. Other than that I would say all is well.The hotel is very nice, the room was clean, the service in general from all the staff was excellent. Taeffe at the front desk was awesome. She has spectacular customer service especially during this very busy weekend. I loved the fresh popcorn in the lobby each evening- What a treat!Breakfast was tasty and very appreciated. The location of this hotel was walking distance to many restaurants and shops. I'd stay here again!","I have stayed at various hotels in the West Nashville area on business trips, and I would definitely recommend this hotel as the best in its price range.  Comfortable room (incredibly comfortable bed and pillows), courteous staff, and a complimentary breakfast with great coffee to start the day.Great value hotel.   The room was large and clean, with a good sized bathroom.   The hallways smelled a little musty and the breakfast was not good, but what can you expect, it's free.  The staff was very friendly and courteous.  A couple of gripes were that the pool was pretty small and full of Bros and thugs, but what can you do on a weekend?",,,"['fantastic', 'rooms', 'clean', 'beds', 'extra', 'comfy', 'four', 'pillows',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-by-marriott-vanderbilt-west-end-nashville,Courtyard By Marriott-Vanderbilt/West End,3.5,$$,41,"Of all the Marriott options, it's never my first choice to stay in a Courtyard, but the Courtyard in downtown Nashville, which is the only Marriott in the heart of downtown, was overpriced the weekend I was visiting. So, I opted to stay in this part of town. And I must say, being in Vanderbilt was awesome. Staying here allowed me to explore a different part of Nashville and got me away from some of the tourist traps I would have otherwise been drawn into downtown.There are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance, but you are pretty much right next to the Vanderbilt campus, so expect a younger crowd when you go out. And if you overindulge, you're also close to St. Thomas Hospital as well. If you do feel the need to go downtown, it's only about 1.5 miles away.Check-in here was smooth and the room was clean. The ongoing construction across the street was a little annoying, but that's no fault of Marriott's. The gym is what you'd expect for a Courtyard ... nothing special. Just the basics. Each room also has an outdoor seating area, which for me meant staring into ... well, a courtyard.This is a Courtyard by Marriott.  In terms of rooms, bath fixtures, toiletries etc, don't expect the Ritz or JW Marriott, it is what it is--comfortable, clean, predictable and having the amenities that one would expect.  There are two things that really make this Marriott stand out.1.  The concierge staff at the Front is spectacular.  We interacted a fair amount with Gary, Lisa, and Keith.  All three were incredibly helpful and really seemed to take joy in trying to make our stay the best we could possibly have, including engaging with the kids, advice on places to see, eat, and driving directions on how to get there--I know in an age of Google Maps and Waze the last part seems less important, but Nashville as of this writing has a lot of construction related road closures on weekends, and their advice really made our lives easier.  Really friendly folks that made the stay better.2.  The location is great.  A short walk from Vanderbilt and Centennial park, and easily walking distance 20-25 min -- or a shuttle ride-- to the bright lights of Broadway and the honky tonks.  There are also a number of great places to eat a short walk from the hotel.If you are a single traveler looking for a place with a great onsite restaurant or swanky bar, there are other places that might fit your needs better.  If you are the type that does not mind venturing out a bit to enjoy the city around you, this is a great base of operations.I haven't been disappointed by a Marriott yet, and this spot is included. The room was great, the pool was wonderful and the staff was top-notch. I was hoping for a room with a balcony, and didn't get one when I got there. After calling and asking for one, they immediately moved me to a room that had one. And, they were incredibly nice and accommodating when I asked.One small detail I really appreciated was the bathroom. The shower was great and felt like home. Also, the hair dryer was full size instead of one of those little, crappy hotel hair dryers.Before booking a trip to Nashville, I took a look at the downtown hotel prices and about fainted, seriously $350+ night. When I looked on Marriott's site and found this hotel priced at $239, which was still more than I wanted to pay, however the same hotel was listed on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> for $179 which was far more appealing than the $239 rate by booking directly with Marriott. When booking with an external site other than Marriott you do not get credit towards your Marriott Rewards, but thanks to Marriott's Look No Further Best Rate Guarantee, I was able book the room at the same rate as it was going for on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> ($179), and to make the deal even sweeter Marriott even knocked the price down by another 25% bringing down my nightly rate to just under $135/night! Seriously a little homework saved me over $200 over my stay!When I first arrived I headed right to the garage, which was a mistake because access to the garage and hotel you will first need your room key. Luckily they were able to buzz me in without having me go back to the main lobby first. The garage elevators are actually shared with Tower 2, with additional rooms above the parking garage. Once inside you will have a short walk down the corridor to the lobby. The check-in process was super easy and thanks to an early check in with the Marriott app my room keys were all set as soon as I arrived. The lobby itself is large and shared space with an attached cafe and tons of seating, there is also a more private seating area with a TV alongside the Tower 1 elevators. My room was large and spacious and very comfortable with more than enough space to unpack and not worry about being cramped. The bathroom was large with a nice shower. The toiletries provided were basic, however they were Paul Mitchell branded which would have come in handy if I had forgot any of my items. The bed was comfortable, however it wasn't as firm as I had hoped but it still provided an enjoyable night's sleep. One major plus was the curtains closed sealing out almost every trace of daylight, which was great when I wanted to sleep in! Internet was free and decent, however it was a little tricky to get going at first as the landing page timed out, but ended up connecting you without the confirmation, however this was only a one time occurrence during my stay so it wasn't a problem.Now as far as the hotel itself, its located closer to Vanderbilt University, and only a short Uber ride to the bars and venues along Music Row. However there are more than enough options around the hotel to keep you busy. Places like Hattie B's Hot Chicken, The Row, Brewhouse, Cookout, Winners &amp; Losers, and more. I forgot to mention that parking is $26/day, however you are within walking distance to a wide variety of restaurants and bars, and a short Uber/taxi ride downtown. So this slight increase will still help you save a considerable amount over a downtown hotel. Overall I was pleased with the value and service I received will staying at the hotel, and would recommend it anyone visiting Nashville.Bedding and bed are poor, did not clean room daily, shower shrieks, keys never work, good location, however will not be back or recommend staying here.Decent hotel in a great location near Vanderbilt. Free shuttle service in a three mile radius, which will get you downtown.  Lisa at the reception desk is a wealth of knowledge and will always steer you in the right direction.I'm a business traveller who stays in the road 40-50% of the time.I love driving arriving at the Vanderbilt Courtyard to the valet who knows my name after 3 stays. Then, walking in to meet Gary at the front desk, who greets me like I've been coming there for 10 years. To top it all off there is a shuttle that takes you anywhere you need to go; dining, night life.I frequent many hotels on a regular basis, but none compare to the impeccable service I receive at the Vanderbilt Courtyard!This hotel has it's pros and cons, which I believe the overall pros pushed it slightly from 3 stars to 4.The people who work here are very nice, from the front desk to the people cleaning the rooms and providing service throughout the hotel. I needed additional shampoo and conditioner one day because I love to swim and the cleaning lady remembered and kept me stocked through the week. I love swimming, so my boyfriend picked the hotel based on the outdoor pool. It was quite relaxing and refreshing when we had a chance to go. I didn't get a chance to use the gym, but it looked nice. I usually love those two amenities the most. The room was typical of other Courtyards I've stayed in, but the bed was beyond hard. I ended up with back and shoulder pains every morning. With the millions they spent on the renovations, that should have been key. The best part is the good night sleep away from home, yet I never got it. Other issues were the TV had reception issues, static and channels going out and there was no microwave in the room. The TV had basic cable and no movies for rental which almost every hotel has these days. Then the room key issue, the room keys would deprogram and we would have to go to the front desk. The garage key wouldn't work, so we would have to get buzzed in and then the elevators wouldn't work. Although I never keep the key near my phone and know better, this happened at least 3 times. The best part was the location, the area has lots of great restaurants and bars in the area. We found a lot of places nearby and within walking distance, which made for some fun nights out.I am annoyed. This place seems a bit... Overwhelmed. Not a fan of their customer service. Very patronizing and not solution-oriented when it comes to questions. Will update after my stay but right now, not a fan.Great place to stay! Convenient location with great shuttle service. AGM Keith M. is AWESOME!! He went out of his way to make our stay extra special. All hotel staff are great from the management to the shuttle drivers to the cleaning staff. Stay here --you won't regret it!My husband &amp; I stayed here, we travel for a living so we stay at a lot of these hotel's, we have 2 Vehicle's so when we pulled in, it was tight, also a construction crew was parked out there and inside having lunch, while we took out luggage and went to drop off one car cane back to lobby and get the other Vehicle the manger was there looking for us, to yell at me and tell me it was there  busiest  time of day, between 1 &amp; 3 and get our 2013 Chevy 3500 out of there!!!!!! He spit on my lip, and was so rude we will never stay there again!!Worst breakfast buffet, nasty bacon, sausage ,cold hard eggs benedict, waited 45 mins for fresh to be brought out, was still terribleMy friend booked three regular rooms and a suite for my bachelorette party and bridal shower. We were staying Friday and Saturday nights. Friday mid morning, my friend checked in to all the rooms. She let the lady at the front desk know that the rest of the guests would be flying in and arriving at various times throughout the afternoon. The lady said all they had to do was give my friend's name and they'd be fine. My friend was unable to stay all day at the hotel as she had setup for the party to complete. The first guest attempted to check in and used my friend's name and was not allowed in to her room. My freon was called to verify this person could be added. At this time, my friend explained the situation and asked of she could give the names of everyone else who would be staying in the rooms since just giving her name as we were told to do was not sufficient. So she did that.Lo and behold, every guest that tried to check in was denied. Every time someone checked in it was a different story. The kicker was that one guest had to put down her credit card and was told it was just for a hold on the room. This is strange because my first friend had already given her card and was told to put all the rooms on it. Upon checkout, they charged that whole room to the guest and not my friend. It was an extremely awkward situation and I went to the desk with her to explain that we need the room on my friend's card instead. They refused to change it and made one of my shower guests pay on her own. I was visibly upset and explained that I was frustrated with every interaction I had with the staff throughout the weekend. I never got any apology or acknowledgment that there was a miscommunication. This hotel is fine for when you're a family checking in to one room. But I would never trust them wither a group event.I am in the midst of booking blocks of hotel rooms for my wedding guests and after this experience will take my business elsewhere.  Bad customer service is  a dealbrealer for me.I know Courtyard Marriott's are midrange hotels, so I'm not looking at it like it's a Ritz Carlton. I'm a seasoned business traveler and know what I'm getting into. This is a great location as there are tons of restaurants and bars around. This property looked to be newly renovated and smelled new. We arrived earlier than anticipated (around 11:30 am) and were only expecting to be able to have them hold our luggage, but they found an open room for us and let us in (Service Bonus #1). The menu button on our remote wasn't working and the housekeeper was in the room across the hall and switched ours with an empty room, saying she would later replace the bad one for them (Service Bonus #2). Unfortunately, it wasn't the remote, but the TV (it basically had to be pinged by the server). I made a call to the front desk and they sent up Engineering, who said he knew the person who stayed the previous night had TV issues and was waiting for him to checkout before he fixed it, but because the front desk gave us the room, he hadn't had a chance. In exchange for the nuisance, he gave us free movies for the day (Service Bonus #3) and a coupon for a free appetizer (Service Bonus #4).We ate around the corner at the Tavern, which is crazy good (review pending), and came back to the staff welcoming us by name (Service Bonus #5). Before leaving for dinner, I checked on the availability of a cab and they said the shuttle offers free rides within 3 miles (Service Bonus #6).The next day, my wife went out for a run and they recommended a 4-mile loop that took her through Vanderbilt and she said it was an awesome recommendation (Service Bonus #7), even though she got hit by and old guy in a car... not Marriott's fault. During that time, I went to the gym and saw all the equipment was new and the room was spacious, probably 25' x 50'. All the cardio equipment had individual TVs and one large one hung on the wall.Afterwards, I went to the Bistro to get us a few yogurts and waters, but they had closed 10 minutes prior. I didn't realize this and waited for about 60 seconds until somebody showed up. She apologized profusely for not realizing I was there and said they were closed, but was able to ring up my water and then said the yogurts were on the house (Service Bonus #8).Finally, I called for a wakeup call and asked if he could make sure there was a cab available at 4:15 a.m. for us. True to form, we got our call and the cab was waiting when we came downstairs (Service Bonus #9).For those of you keeping track, that's nine... NINE unique service items that the staff went out of their way to do. You may think those are small things, but in this world where so many people don't even lift a finger to help, an experience like this makes you happy you spent your dollars where you did.ROOM (Tower 2, 7th Floor King Bed facing North)FRIDGE (Yes)MICROWAVE (No)COFFEE POT (Yes)IRON &amp; BOARD (Yes)TV (Philips 32"" LCD HDTV)DESK (Yes)COUCH (Yes)FOLD OUT BED (Yes)INTERNET (Free WiFi)BUSINESS CENTER (Yes)FITNESS CENTER (Yes)PARKING ($22/day Valet Only)RATE (March, 2013 - $189/night)PROS** TV has inputs exposedJust RCA, SVideo, and USB inputs. ** Fridge has some cool featuresIt's a small mini fridge, but it can hold a good number of drinks, but a takeout container would probably take up an entire row. What's cool, though, is that there're 2 buttons on the fridge: 1) Quick Chill - cools contents faster for 2 hours, and 2) Snooze - essentially turns off the fridge so you can sleep easier (the sound is hardly noticeable though). ** Good # of outletsI probably only mention this because I had to rearrange furniture in the last Courtyard to find some. The lights on each side of the bed have an outlet, and there're 2 open outlets behind the couch. The rest are where you'd expect them to be.** Balcony with seatsIf you don't mind peering eyes (in the CONS section), my room overlooked the courtyard and West End. Has 2 seats and a small table, perfect for drinks.** On premise StarbucksI think it's only open during the daytime, though.CONS** Valet Parking is expensive &amp; required.$22 a day! At least you can have them pull your car out at any time of the day, 24 hours.** North Tower 2 rooms face Tower 1 roomsThis means that you can see straight into their rooms and they can see straight into yours, if you have the curtains open. Oh, and the thin veil like curtains block nothing. I could still see straight into anyone's room if they only covered using that. Being on the 7th floor means you're higher than Tower 1, but Tower 1's top floor can still see in to your room. A little creepy...unless you're into that sort of thing.OTHER COMMENTSVanity area is kinda small, but it's detached from the bathroom, which is nice so that the mirror doesn't get all foggy when you're trying to shave after a shower.Decent location, but there was construction going on in the hotel and in the nearby area making it somewhat difficult to sleep at night. They do provide you with earplugs and a noise machine (if you request one), but for my super quick trip to Nashville, I just powered through it. They staff was super help and there are great amenities at the hotel. No room service made this tired traveler a little more weary, but it's not the end of the world.The shuttle service, provided free, moved the hotel from a two star to a three star.... The driver, Miller, was customer service to the 9!  Took me to Walgreens and then wine shop ,) opened my doors each time,) Called before I came and spoke with the sales director, who seemed very helpful - but no luck finding her when I got here!  Both receptionist seemed busy and annoyed.... When I asked if I could get a glass of wine, she said no even though I was told by sales director they have lounge and although  it yet open, it would be no problem to open and serve before 6pm (which is 7pm est).  The room was very nice. But once again, I went back to lobby andRoom is pricey but comparable to the other ones nearby. They charge you 16.00 dollars a day to park your vehicle. They have a free courtesy van to downtown till 10:45pm. Rooms are nice &amp; clean. The free wifi sucks! &amp; they want to charge for high speed which is crazy. Over priced &amp; they charge for all the things that should be included for no extra.We stayed here for one night.  The rooms were fine, the beds were comfy, and everything was clean, but man were those shampoo and conditioner bottles tiny!  Like doll-house tiny.They charged us $20 including tax for self-parking in the garage, which was a little annoying.Overall, it suited our needs on our trip.Courtyard Marriott did not leave much of an impression on me. First off, I hate staying in hotels. I hate staying anywhere but in my own bed. Usually every hotel has a funky smell. Courtyard did not. I have to say that our hotel room was fresh and clean when we arrived, and I loved the pillows and the feel of the mattress to lay on. This was huge for me. The best translation of what my own bed is like at home. The staff was helpful. I needed shampoo and the front desk was all too willing to accommodate. I had a chance to meet the chambermaids, and they were just as polite. I happened to catch them before they were about to tidy our room and I told them to leave it alone. I have had their job, and it makes no sense that they should have to make my bed for me while I stay there. My friend wasn't around when I talked to them so when we got back from our Nashville adventure he looked upset. I explained but he still seemed a little irritated. In a way, it made me more happy because I don't like it when men think things like this should be done for them at all. Even if they are on vacation. I kept my amusement to myself. I also don't want people I don't know around my things. Even if they aren't important, I don't want anyone to invade my space and so much as move a bag in order to make my bed. I'm glad I was there to stop them. My friend just wanted to jump into his bed like Superman. Apparently you cannot do this on a messed up bed. My only complaint about the hotel would be the bar. They charged and exorbitant amount, $11, for a shot of Grand Marnier to be tossed into my margarita. The mix they used was terrible, and the liqueur makes it taste better. We also tried to order an amaretto stone sour (my childish travel partner likes fruity drinks), and they didn't even have the right liquor to mix it. As far as I knew an amaretto stone sour was a pretty common drink. The bartenders themselves were sweet; but they couldn't mix drinks at all. They couldn't even improvise well when it came down to trying to make up for what their bar lacked. In my opinion, if you're going to charge $11 for a shot of liqueur at all; then you better have the kind of bar equipped to handle all requests. Including mixologists.","What I can say - this is a Marriott. I was given a room with a king bed and a sofa. There is free wifi, but no free meals. This hotel is convenient for those visiting Vanderbilt, as the campus is only 2 blocks away (walkable distance). You can tell in the hallways and the bathroom the hotel has seen better days. It's a bit old and somewhat musty &amp; dingy. If you are going to do the self-parking, let the front desk know so that they can put you in a room in a building closest to the parking garage. I don't know the fee because they didn't charge me. [I don't know what it is with the last three hotels not charging me the parking fee, but I am not complaining!]   Would I stay here again? Probably. It is convenient to where I need to be for work, and there are enough restaurants within the area to explore.We were early to check in, and to our surprise, our room was actually ready. This definitely set the tone for our entire stay. The hotel was clean, and seemed to be somewhat newly renovated. The staff would always greet you and ask how you were. Morale seemed to be high. The hotel is in a good location. 4 blocks max. to get to a decent bar. There's also several food places (not just fast food) around. I would definitely continue to stay here!Typical Courtyard Marriott.Pros: Great locationFriendly StaffComplimentary coffee in the lobby.Cons:King bed seemed to be breaking down very shaky Some might not like $16 parking but no biggie.Pros:Newly renovated facilityNice comfy bedsCentral AC and Heat$5-7 taxi ride to downtownRight across the street from the 1808 grill, which has yummy breakfastFriendly StaffIn the rooms they have Paul Mitchell shampoo (which I love, so it was my pro)Self-parking (free.... I never got charged for parking, so I have no clue if this has recently changed or what, but we did have an employee discount) Valet parking if you want to payGive AAA discountsCons:The shuttle bus broke down on us and was running late a lot. It seemed like everytime we wanted to try taking it, it was already full or it took 20-30 minutes to even get there. I wouldn't rely on this for transportation, but only as a perk if you happen to catch it.I am usually pleased with marriott hotels This one exceptional because of the well trained helpful friendly staff Valet esp friendly.  Man with vacuum turned it off as we passed and spoke.  The little touches can make a place stand outI would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I'm in the 2nd tower and this is the 2nd room I've moved to. I moved because the original room smelled like 70 football players left their socks in my room. The 2nd room smelled the same way. Disgusting. I would never stay here again.Beware of staying here on the weekends if you are planning to sleep.  When we checked in I thought it odd that the were two pairs of earplugs on the desk in our room in the second building of this hotel.  Turns out that our room is facing an open air bar about two blocks away that has live music on its rooftop deck until closing time on Fri/Sat nights.  Would have been a key piece of information to have had when I made the reservation and/or checked in.  No mention on hotel website or from front desk personnel at check inOtherwise, hotel is newly renovated and staff is very friendly.  Would stay here again, but only Sunday through Thursday.I'm a Marriott woman. I am an elite member, I only stay at Marriotts, and I love Marriotts. However, I will never ever stay in this one again. The staff was really nice and that rate was right and it's two blocks from Vanderbilt's campus. However, there were bugs. Not the cute kind, either. The cockroach kind that climbs around on the seventh floor so you know it's bad. And the unidentifiable black bug on your white pillow kind. Totally grossed me out. I'll still stay with Marriott hotels, but not this one.First time in Nashville, stay at the Marriott. Staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and spacious for the two if us. Comfortable bed.My wife and I were in town for the St. Jude Country Music Half-Marathon, and let me tell you, the Courtyard is the business.  They are good.  Damn good.  And when I say they are good, that won't cover it.We encountered zero negative employees.  Normally you can find someone disgruntled at a hotel, or maybe having a bad day, but that didn't happen here.  I kept wondering if I was royalty or something.  We were greeted with swag bags from the happiest front desk staff ever to grace a hotel lobby.  They offered a free shuttle to and from the expo as well as the same shuttle service to and from Broadway.  And one of the driver's knew so much about the city he was like a tour guide!  The morning of the race, they started their continental breakfast at 4:30 a.m.  When we got back from the race, the staff offered their congrats and even had iced bottled water and Gatorade.  When we found out our floor was out of ice, someone brought up two small bags so my wife could ice her knees after the run.Wait, did I mention the bed?  Joker comfortable!  And the pillows delivered upon the wings of angels.  My only complaint, if I could call it that, was the lack of a small fridge in the room.  All of the positives far outweighed that.So you aren't a runner and are just in town, none of this running crap matters to you.  But a hotel that extends that kind of service on a consistent basis will surely extend that to anyone else, runner or not.  The stellar service we received from this hotel was so spectacular that we would not even consider another hotel the next time we are in the area.Its simple: the Courtyard wrote the manual on customer service this weekend and has set the bar pretty high.Valet team was fantastic!This place is fantastic! Cheery staff, helpful &amp; pleasant drivers, great shuttle. I was nervous reading reviews *after* booking, especially during BNI &amp; CMA week. We are very pleased thus far. Apparently the hotel has been updated recently. Will stay here again.I was underwhelmed by this hotel and felt that it was less nice than other Courtyards I have stayed in.  I booked this as my husband was trying to work on his Marriott points and it was close to the event we needed to attend.  I would categorize myself as a seasoned traveler and have stayed in accommodations of all types from very luxurious to youth hostels and everything in between and I feel I have a pretty good idea of what you get for your money in a hotel these days.  This rate was not high to me, but it was very high for the quality of the hotel.  It did not feel clean, it was noisy, and the lobby was always really crowded which made me not want to sit in it.  When we checked in there were a bunch of guys checking in with cases of Bud Light which perhaps explained the late night noise in the hallways?  We stayed in the second tower and the room was tired looking and kind of smelly.  I asked my kids to wash their hands as we were heading out to dinner right away and my daughter dropped the wet bar of soap on the carpet.  When I picked it up it had several hairs of varying colors and textures which did not happen to resemble anything on our heads, unfortunately.  The bathroom tile had yet another color of hair on it, again not ours.  It made me wonder if they ever vacuumed?!  The bed was terribly uncomfortable and after two nights I couldn't wait to get home.  To underscore the rather unpleasant stay, when we got our guest folio the rate was higher than what I had booked.  When I inquired, they told me the government rate had changed as of October 1st.  Since we had checked in the 3rd and I was not made aware of this I felt that the nice thing to do would have been to honor the agreed upon rate.  If I did not have a government rate and they tried to increase it without letting me know there is no way I would have paid it so I am not sure why attributing it to the government increase made it OK to them, but I didn't feel like arguing.  The fact is that they lost a customer, at least at Courtyard locations, over all of the above.  The rate thing was just kind of the cherry on the top of the rest of a marginal experience.  On a positive note, Nashville is a very fun city and we had a great visit despite the mediocre hotel.  I saw that someone else had written that if you have a car there is no need to stay at this hotel and I would agree with that.  Apparently one of their amenities is free shuttle service.  If you don't use that I am not sure what would make anyone stay here. There are plenty of other options.  Oh and if you decide to stay here despite my marginal review of the place, make sure you check your rate again if you book in advance.  I booked far in advance and when I went to double check the hotel address I noticed that they were advertising a much lower rate as the date got closer.this is just OK. nothing great but nothing bad. this place MUST get renovated by marriott in the next few years otherwise its going to look like a dump. had to stay here because nashville was sold out. they have a bar near the lobby but this entire place just looks old, not bad, just old. just gets the job done but not as good as many other courtyards ive been to. also this doesn't have the new food lobby design as many of the newer ones do. good location thoughGreat rooms, friendly staff, great service. As a bonus, there is a pool and jacuzzi area on the 5th floor. Rooms were nothing over the top - but all you should be able to expect in a hotel in a major city. Clean beds and bathroom, serviced daily. No sprawling views of the city as you are closer to Vanderbilt's campus than actual downtown. There is complimentary coffee all day, a shuttle service that runs every 15 minutes that can take you to downtown. Valet is quick, accessible, and relatively inexpensive for a city (think Boston or NYC). Hot or cold continental breakfast is served until 11 for $10 and $7, respectfively. When I go to new places I'm really only looking for a place to lay my head. The friendly and accomodating staff, open pool and jacuzzi, bonus of a shuttle service, and decent breakfast (although NOT complimentary) raised my expectations.Stayed here for the CMAs in November 2010. Overall, I think three stars is pretty accurate.There's nothing wrong with the hotel - I don't have any real complaints. As a business traveler who stays in tons of hotels each year, it takes a lot for me to be blown away by a hotel. The rate here was decent, the staff was friendly, and my room was spacious (enough). The whole setup with the two different sections of the hotel, each with their own elevator bay, was a little strange and confusing, but you get used to it.I'm not a Marriott person normally (I like Hiltons), but my Marriott friends assure me this is probably the worst Courtyard they stay at each year, so I'm not judging Courtyards based on this one. I'd stay here again if I had to, but if given a choice, I'd go one block away to the Hampton Inn.Staff is very accommodating and made our stay comfortable. We utilized the shuttle to get downtown for dinner and bar hopping at night, and getting a cab back was easy. The rooms are typical for a courtyard, but it was worthwhile for us to save some $ by staying here rather than a hotel closer to the bars on broadway.My friends and I stayed here for the Nashville Marathon. Starting at check in, the staff was super friendly and welcoming. The hotel even provided a gift bag for runners as well as Gatorade and water when we got back from the race. The shuttle was a nice bonus to take and pick us up from the expo and restaurants. It was raining race day, and the hotel even had ponchos for us. Courtyard went above and beyond! I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in town!I visited my cousin in Nashville and stayed at this Marriott.  It had the most comfortable bed that I have ever slept in. Ever. I dream of it.  I try to recreate it at home.  It isn't the same.  5 stars for that bed.Definitely one of the best Marriotts I have stayed in. The location is great. Just a very short drive to downtown, around the corner from music row, and easy access to major highways. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Nice view from the 8th floor. And the breakfast buffet rocks - biscuits, gravy, sausage, bacon, eggs, waffles, potatoes, fruit, and the typical continental breakfast fare. Try to book a rate that includes free breakfast. The service is phenomenal. Everyone who works here is super nice. It's the only hotel I have ever stayed at that calls you to make the room is okay and up to your standards after you check in and get to your room. Would not have a problem staying here again.","I stayed here for 1 night back in May, meeting with a friend for lunch the next day and going home to Kentucky after that, I was waited the last minute booking this hotel room, and because I thought I only going to stay one night, I'm not going to spend $200 or$300 for a 4 or 5 stars hotel room, and I wish I did spend that $200 or $300, because this is way lower category Courtyard than I expected. I got there very late on Friday night, the staff is friendly, I checked in without problem, of course I was really tired after working all day and flying over a bad storm and finally landed in Nashville. So I got to my room, which is really dark in there, not much lighting, and my view was a dumb gas station of the lovely BP, which I don't care much for it anyway, it was late, I'm ready to take a shower, eat something and head to bed, unfortunately the hotel do not have room service, so I have to call a locate delivery, the room I stayed at is very old, looks like haven't been update for a long time, the tv is not flat screen, didn't know people still using those big box tv, the bed wasn't that comfortable either, I laid on the bed for a little bit, and I started felling a little itchy on my back, so I got up and check and to make sure they're no bed bugs, which I didn't see any, but I see the bed sheet wasn't really that clean, so I put another sheet to cover it, didn't have much sleep, I was so tired. The next day, I was about to meet my friend at the restaurant approx .08 mile from this hotel, and I was going to call me a cap, but the front desk told me they have a free shuttle van taken people up to 2 miles from the hotel, and she can call and see where he's at, they told me he was only 10 minutes away, 10 minutes passed by, 15 minutes later, I asked, is the van going to show up soon? I'm late for my lunch reservation. 5 more minutes she said. 10 more minutes passed by, still no van, and I asked again, if the van not going to show up, just please call me a taxi cap, I don't care about the money, I just need to get there. Front desk lady called again to the van, and the driver got angry saying he is on the way and will get there when he's get there. I walked outside and looked around for cap, and saw the van pulling up, I jumped in and told him to take me to the restaurant, he don't look so happy, either am I, if you travel to Nashville, and you're on the budget, you probably can stay here, just don't expect what I expect, but if you like more luxury like I am, go to Marriott, is just about 1 mile away or the Hutton Hotel which is across the street, the reviews looked very good",,,"['options', 'never', 'first', 'choice', 'courtyard', 'courtyard', 'downtown', 'heart', 'downtown', 'overpriced', 'weekend', 'visiting', 'opted', 'part',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-nashville-downtown-nashville-2,Hampton Inn & Suites Nashville Downtown,4.0,$$$,44,"This location is pretty good for being in Nashville, not too far from all the action but not so close that you can't get some sleep! The staff were excellent and super professional throughout the stay. They get 5 stars on the professionalism of the staff. Other Yelpers have mentioned the greatness of the breakfast available here and I can say that things were not exaggerated. Sausage and eggs. Gravy and biscuits. Fresh Fruit and Yogurt. Waffles and oatmeal. Cereal and pastries. Coffee, tea, juice, milk...it's all here! There are also several times a day when there are other goodies, like cookies, hotdogs, lemonade, and other things.The rooms were clean and comfortable and there is a decent workout facility and a heated pool. Be warned though the price was not cheap around $300 for the night but then again all the hotels there in downtown Nashville are not cheap. I will certainly stay here again when Im back there.Great place to stay.  Lower rates than other hotels in the area.Very clean and friendly staff.We arrived very early from our flight.  Got to the hotel @ 9AM.  We were hoping to drop our bags off and explore.  We were blown away to find that they had our room ready!Simply the most comfy bed of all time.  Massive king with soft pillows to match.Our room didn't have much of a view but the hallway window overlooked the city.Location was key.  We went for an event at Bridgestone arena.  This hotel is literally a block away.  The SoBro bar district wasn't much further.  Plus tons of great restaurants &amp; attractions nearby.Breakfast was unreal.  Biscuits, eggs, bacon, sausage, homemade waffle maker, cereal oatmeal, on and on and on.  Plus they slightly changed it up every morning.  They also would randomly have snacks laid out.  Free cookies and moz sticks!A couple of pretty bad hiccups:The shower was awful.  Water pressure and temperature kept changing.  And I slipped multiple times.  I ate $h1t so bad the last time I fell that my big toe was purple the next day.  There was a bar to hold onto but this was the most hazardous shower of all time.And one of nights past midnight, the fire alarm went off.  No big deal but it took over an hour for them to figure out how to shut it off.  Plus we didn't have power until around 4AM when the lights of course kicked back on to wake you up.  I wasn't overly ticked off but had my flight been the next morning I could see this review going a little different.That wouldn't scare me away from staying again.A pricey stay (parking's not cheap either), but definitely worth it.  Clean, quiet room and very friendly staff.FULL GODDAMN BREAKFAST.  This cannot be undersold - they had basically everything you could want from a hotel breakfast.  The lobby was packed full of German tourists eating it all, but the staff was on top of it - changing out coffee pots, getting more biscuits, everything.  2 short blocks away from all the cool places on Main and Church and all that, so while parking is pricey, you can rest assured your car is safe in an underground lot while you listen to Johnny Cash Impersonator #242.This was a great place to stay. We are diamond members so we got an upgrade to the top floor and you see that round thingie on front? Yeah, that's the balcony that runs all the way from your front ""conference room"" to your kind bedroom with whirlpool tub and shower. Okay enough bragging about being a cheapass and getting free upgrades. I agree that the front desk seemed slow, but the hotel was clean and nice inside. Breakfast was nice with hot and cold options, waffle maker, etc. etc. Very busy. And this review shall be known as ""the one where we find out that we would not thrive in downtown housing."" Starting at 5:30am it was train horns, cars, car horns, etc. It's only a six floor hotel so it was especially loud in my opinion. Not their fault, but just be aware that if you're on that nice front round thingie (yeahhhh free upgrade!) you might not be sleeping in.Good hotel but I can hear the banging of construction as I sit here writing this. It's 730a on a Wednesday.If not for that metal to metal clang, this hotel is great. Quieter than the one we stayed at last night. We could hear people talking and stomping around due to thin walls:(Spent 4 nights here while attending a convention at a nearby hotel. I was extremely satisfied with my entire stay.   Everything was very clean. Room was nice and temperature was controlled by individual thermostat so it can be easily adjusted. Towels were high quality and absorbent. No tub; only walk in shower but plenty of hot water. Complementary Full breakfast, including waffles, biscuits &amp; gravy, oatmeal and more!   Also complementary was coffee &amp; tea anytime.  Every evening light snack and fresh cookies were again complementary. Room included a frig, coffee  &amp; small microwave. Staff was very friendly. Would definitely stay here again.Delicious breakfasts and snacks, friendly staff, and very clean rooms.Location location location...very conveniently located next to Omni Hotel and Music City Center.Check-in desk is understaffed...two people working during peak check-in times means long wait time standing in line.  Complimentary cookies in the snack area are a plus...they are tasty!  Flavored syrups are available to try to jazz up the Hampton Inn coffee.  The free breakfast area is jammed in the morning...there is lots of seating, and turnover is quick.  You probably will have to wait in line to make your own waffles though.Standard hotel room was pretty spacious and clean.  The king bed was definitely a feather comforter away from being a Heavenly bed, but it was comfortable and I slept pretty well.  Bathroom had a large shower and large vanity...was great!  The mini fridge did make a buzzing sound all night long, so I listened to music with headphones....which also helps since being in downtown Nashville, street and neighboring hotel guests can also be loud.In this day and age of electronics, there should be an in-room safe.  I felt safer carting my items back to lock up in my car's trunk than to keep it hidden and unlocked in the hotel room.Small parking deck with just two floor...I squeezed my car into the last available spot on the bottom floor, after accessing with a red key card that the front desk gives you....self parking is $19 + tax per night. There is a small elevator that accesses the lobby, but then you have to go to another elevator to get up to your room.  Safety, I guess.Had a great stay here, walking distance from Broadway in downtown Nashville, the Hampton Inn is clean, well cared for and a bit on the pricey side.You do get what you pay for, but be prepared to pay $250 a night.Breakfast buffet was awesome, some days they need more seats than they have but that's a small complaint. Friendly staff, lots of extras and clean, comfortable rooms are the norm.When we booked our reservation here, it was based on price and proximity to SoBro. I will start with my complaint, since I have only one. They charge $19 a night to park in their garage. Now I understand that parking in downtown Nashville is expensive, but hotels should make parking complimentary. With that said, the hotel was way better than expected. The room was typical, clean, nothing fancy. Where this hotel shines is its breakfast. It is amazing and complimentary. It almost balanced out the parking. Eggs, sausage, biscuits &amp; gravy, waffles, fresh fruit, cereals. I actually looked forward to it each morning. The lobby is spacious and comfortable and the location is just a couple of blocks from the honky tonk row and right across the street from the country music hall of fame.Nicest Hampton Inn anywhere, great location and super staff!  I stay in a lot of Hilton Hotels and was extremely impressed with this Hampton Inn.  The hotel was very nice, with a large and interesting lobby designed with spaces to mingle, TV gathering areas and quieter spots to read. The lay out allowing many different groups to have their own space.  The decor was interesting and welcoming - more of a warm feeling than most. The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Rooms were clean, fresh and ready when they were supposed to be.  The breakfast was an expanded, huge southern breakfast style buffet.  This breakfast had many more options than most breakfast included hotels - there was even a make your own pancake bar with a variety of toppings, grits and oatmeal, two types of eggs.  Excellent!  The pool area was very nice as well.  The location is very close to downtown restaurants, offices and events as well as the convention center. I walked everywhere.  Self parking is $20 and valet $24.  The valet was very efficient and friendly.  In a class of its own - you should definitely try out this Hampton Inn on your next Nashville trip!  I will certainly be back!!Excellent locationVery friendly and helpful staffFree breakfast both warm and cold with healthy optionsVery close to walking and running paths2 blocks from the action (still quiet though) and 1 minute off the highway. I would certainly stay here again.I didn't stay at this one, but Don the manager went way out of his way to help me. If you have any issues talk to him.Excellent location and staff was friendly and helpful.  Rooms were clean and well kept.  Breakfast is provided daily with your stay and they have a great setup with an awesome spread of food.  They also have snacks in the afternoon too.  Loved this place.I stayed here with a group of girls for my sisters Bachelorette party.  It was a great location because we could walk to Broadway as well as other attractions downtown.They have complimentary breakfast in the morning, which was clutch for us.My only issue was that they needed to put a charge on someone's card for the room when we checked in.  This was an issue because of the large amount for multiple rooms for a long weekend that would ultimately be split up between all the girls.  I've been to hotels where they'll hold your card or charge you something to be sure the card works but I've not had to put the entire amount on my card before checking out.If I would have known that before, I would have planned ahead.I will absolutely stay here again when I go down to Nashville with friends.Stayed in a king room for two nights in December 2013. The location is great, it is directly across the street from the Country Music Hall of Fame and a few blocks from Broadway making for an easy walk to and from the bars and restaurants.  The staff was helpful and friendly and offered suggestions for dinner.  They have free breakfast in the mornings, and there was a lot of variety, including a waffle maker and grits (welcome to the South!)  They offer self- parking in a garage underneath the hotel but it is a little pricey ($19/night).My only complaint with the room itself was that the sheets kept popping off the corner of the bed, which seems like should not happen in a hotel.  Other than that, it was comfortable and although I wished for a bathtub, we had everything we needed.I am VERY picky about hotels and was very nervous about staying in this hotel. The Yelp reviews helped calm my nerves, but I was still bracing myself for the worst... This place got 5 stars from me almost immediately. They provided great service, a great room &amp; bathroom, and an overall very clean hotel. Their complimentary breakfast is far from continental (waffles, danish, bagel toppers, biscuits &amp; gravy, etc). I kept looking for areas to critique, but I couldn't find anything... even the hotel decor is great. Plus a nice business center with free printing and free wi-fi for guests.To top it off the hotel is located near the heart of downtown Nashville - everything is in walking distance. I was there for 4 days and only used a cab from the hotel to airport. It was a GREAT stay and I plan on staying in this hotel whenever I return to Nashville.Wow, i've got to say that I was thoroughly impressed with this hotel! I'm almost sad that we only stayed here for one night. The beds were super comfy, the rooms were spacious, clean, the shower and tub was large, the showerhead was awesome, the television was nice and modern, breakfast served in the morning--- what more could you ask for? The parking is located right below the hotel in a parking garage and only for guests, therefore parking is easy breezy.Located in walking distance to all the bars and eating spots on broadway. We had a blast, and staying at this hotel made our one-night stay in Nashville a no-fuss quick get away.Would definitely choose to stay here again if I were ever in the area.I would like to give this 4 stars but there is no bar compared to other hotels for around the same money. Reception and check in was uneventful and nice staff and the rooms are nicely done with crisp linens. It's a few minutes walk from the convention center and down town so very convenient.Breakfast is great with a good selection of the usual. The WIFI works really well around the whole hotel and its free. This is a great hotel for your Nashville stay, sometimes it would be nice to get a quiet drink away from the crowds but as I say no bar. If your not looking for that you'll be happy.The staff are great, I didn't use the pool but it looked good.  Enjoy Nashville.Can't beat the price or the location.  It is convenient to walk all around the city.  The amenities are great! The staff was very helpful.  I love that parking was free.  Hot, freshly baked cookies and lemonade in the afternoon as well as a DELICIOUS free breakfast makes this a very comfortable  stay.","I visited Nashville for the first time this week, and I'm so glad I chose this Hampton Inn! I stayed with a friend for two nights, and both of us were thrilled with the quality of the hotel and the  proximity to the downtown area. Our room was clean and comfortable, and the beds were extremely comfortable. We took advantage of the complimentary breakfast each morning, which was delicious and included great coffee, biscuits and gravy, pastries, eggs, and fresh fruit. The to-go cups for coffee were a really nice touch. Although there was construction across the street, the workers seemed to keep the noise to a minimum in the early morning hours. The hotel is a quick walk to Broadway's bars and shops. However, downtown Nashville does have a fair amount of drifters, and we did feel uncomfortable one afternoon as we walked back to the hotel and felt as though we were being followed. As two women who have lived in Boston and New York, we were familiar with being cautious in the city and felt it would be smarter to take a cab for the rest of our trips downtown. We could have been overly cautious, but it was worth the $4 cab ride for peace of mind. This was obviously out of the hotel's control, so it doesn't affect my rating- just a tip!We spent the second half of our trip at the Opryland Resort, and we were much more satisfied with the comfort and value of the Hampton Inn. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Nashville!The worst possible experience from a Hampton Inn I've had yet. The atmosphere is that of entitlement. That we are lucky to be staying at their hotel. The food was horrible compared to other Hampton Inn's I've been to, and you had to argue quite a bit to get any help from the front desk. They also charge $20 a day for self parking and you receive over $35 a day just in room taxes. For the exact same amount of money, go literally across the street to the Omni Hotel.This place was awesome. Kid friendly plus fantastic staff. Walking distance to the district and great breakfast3/5 alrightso this is a great spot if you can swing it because it's just 2 blocks from broadway and pretty close to most everything else. the rooms are ok for the kind of establishment that it is. i did like their breakfast offerings, which came with our rooms. ever try whipped yogurt? it's kinda weird.First time staying at Hampton inn. Beautiful hotel and clean! Very good service and friendly staff. Best free hotel breakfast I ever had. Phenomenal!!!!!Convenient.  Staff is excellent, room is nice.However, construction noise starts at 6:00 a.m.  Heater is flat insufficient and fan comes on and off, making sleep impossible.  Comes on and off continuously and room is always cold.Thermostat appears to be limited, which keeps it coldI have several reservations here for future events and I am changing hotels.  This is just too much noise and too cold.Swimming pool isn't open until 8 a.m., which means no morning swim.  I have never seen a pool open this late.Very poor tv channels selection.  A major reason I won't be back.Bad overall experience. When we arrived, they didn't have the suite, we had reserved. The manager fortunately ""found"" a suite similar to what we wanted. The prices were significantly increased because of the Houston Half Marathon. The biggest disappointment was when we realized how incredibly noisy the place was. We stayed on the 4th floor and had to enjoy every motorcycle, car and partygoer passing down below on the street. We could not understand how it's even possible to get a hotel approved in downtown Nashville where high noise level would require much better insulation.  The rooms were otherwise clean and nicely furnished. Will not go back.4.5 stars actually. Was able to get a room here last minute through Hotwire at a very decent price considering the beautiful accommodations and location. It is a comfortable, highly stylish and super clean hotel just a few short blocks from all the action on 2nd Ave and Broadway. They have the best breakfast spread I have ever seen at a hotel included in the price; different styles of eggs, sausage, delicious fresh hot biscuits, make your own waffles and fruit just to name a few things. We also enjoyed some time in the large indoor pool and hot tub. Our room was extremely nice and spotless, the bed was very comfortable, but the part that knocked the half star for me was that I called and requested a King bed and they assured me I had it and when I got there I did not and they told me none were available. When I contacted customer service when I got home, they never responded.Out sanding everything! Walk into this lodge to wonderful service and a warm atmosphere. The valet gives great tips and directions and the rooms are large and comfortable. Best Part? All the great fun areas of downtown Nashville are within walking distance...bars, restaurants, stadiums, concert venues, everything! I say Nashville is a must visit town for anyone either single or married and this Hampton helped my wife and I celebrate our most memorable anniversary to date!Stay for a short stay over labor day weekend, hotel is in a perfect location 2 blocks from Broadway, across the street from the Country Music Hall of fame.  Hotel was very clean and presentable, rooms were spacious with a large bathroom.  Free Breakfast was a good treat and plenty of items to choose from.  Staff was nice and helpful.  Construction around the area was not an issue.Nice staff. Although we didn't stay there, they let us use the bathroom with no issues.Great location, not-too-shabby complimentary breakfast, and comfy beds = happy stay!If you're looking for somewhere to stay in Nashville and want to be close to everything without being right in the midst of everything, Hampton Inn and Suites is the answer to your dilemma. I loved the room -- super comfy beds but if you're looking to sleep in, keep in mind that the drapes don't close all the way. Hampton Inn and Suites is definitely on my short list of hotels to stay at on any future visits to Nashville!This is why I love yelping places on my phone because I can read reviews before I dare try something out.  On a road trip with my family from VA to CA (SD to be exact) we needed places to crash on the whim that was reasonably price but still comfy.  Never been to TN so obviously we kind of needed help in searching for a place.  Thank goodness for my phone and thank goodness I love yelping.This place is pretty awesome.  The rooms were big and extremely comfortable.  I asked the lady in the front if they have room service and as she mentioned that they did not I felt my heart sink.  We were all tired and hungry from traveling, so I kind of felt let down.  However, after she politely told me they had no room service available she also mentioned that there are plenty of restaurants nearby that deliver to your room.  TO YOUR ROOM! WHHHHA?  How awesome is that?!?  So we were able to chose from a wide variety of restaurants that delivered straight to our door...sometimes I still can't believe it.  I guess I'm not used to that but it reminds me of something that would take place in NY or something.  It's probably cause people around me are lazy or busy but either way I loved the fact that something other than pizza can deliver to your doorstep.For all that we got it was a good price as well.  Especially since we called when we were about 30 mins away asking for a room for the night.  The only flaw was that there was so much construction going on around the hotel and the surrounding streets that it was difficult to maneuver, but we did make it and that's all that matters.  Plus it's not really the hotel's fault that there was construction going on.  I took away a star for the towels that were not as soft as I prefer them and the fact that after I showered the water made a little flood in the bathroom.  No biggie I guess, just used the not so wonderful towel to fix it. :)PERFECT location!  5 minute walk to the main ""strip(s)"".  Next door to the convention center which is under MAJOR construction but, I didn't notice an noise or disruption at all (our room was on the opposite side of the building from the convention center).Our room was very clean and the bed was SUPER comfortable!!!  Nice bathroom with an actual shower, instead of the cramped tub/shower at many chain hotels.We paid an additional $18.00 for overnight secured covered parking...Well worth the price for the peace of mind leaving our car in downtown Nashville!I didn't have the free breakfast...too busy sleeping, and didn't use any other amenities, but I was very pleased with everything else!!!!On the pricier side for a Hampton Inn, but after staying there...I felt that the price was warranted!Great experience!We just stayed here for a weekend getaway and were thrilled with this Hampton Inn.  From the valet to the front desk and every other staff member we encountered, they were warm and extremely accommodating (we were kind of high-maintenance guests).  We were originally in a room on the construction side and requested a change.  They actually moved our stuff for us so that we could head out and enjoy the city and not have to wait for a room to become available.I always find that Hampton Inn's are just fine.  They are clean and reliable and you usually know what you're getting.  This one was nicer than most, with nice large rooms and bathrooms.  And yet the price was still very reasonable.We will absolutely stay here again if we return to Nashville, and you should, too!We stayed here in October. It was really loud. College kids walking by making a lot of noise kept us up for awhile at night. Then we woke up at 6am to the constuction going on across the street on the new convention center. It was louder than we expected. I wouldn't stay here until the construction is done. Loud beeping, machines--you are virtually sleeping in a construction site. There are other Hilton hotels in Nashville. I accidentally left something in my room--my bad--but the management didn't return my calls, so I didn't know whether or not they were able to retrieve it. After I called corporate to let them know about their lack of reply, their follow up was not professional. Even after the construction is over, I'll stay away from there. But seriously, wait until the convention center is completed before sleeping at this hotel.Clean rooms and friendly staff. We were passing thru town and we had no trouble finding a room at a reasonable price. The complimentary breakfast was awesome!  We will return in the futureThis place was reasonably priced with the perfect location.  We were within just a few blocks of downtown, which was totally walkable.  Our spacious room had two queens which was perfect for three girls.  We had plenty of space to keep our suitcases and get ready without standing on top of each other.  We had rented a car for our trip but we didn't need to visit the Ryman, Country Music Hall of Fame, and the bars on Broadway.  We could also safely walk back to our hotel after a night out which was great since we could save on cab fare.  You could probably find a cheaper place farther out but who wants to worry about parking or catching a cab.  After gorging yourself on delicious Nashville bites and a few drinks ( BBQ and coronoritas in my case), why not get in some heart healthy exercise?My wife and I stayed here in July 2012. We were in the most expensive suite they offer-$300+ per night. Though the suite was roomy there was no glassware at he bar. There was ""paper cup ware"" and the mattress was worn out, I.e., two ruts on for each sleeper.  Who wants a mixed drink out of a paper cup? The do-it yourself breakfast was ample. Plastic ware, paper cups, and paper napkins were in abundant supply.  I would've given hem one-star BUT the staff was excellent. So the staff get the bonus star. I've stayed places in large cities that were one-fourth the cost with better rooms and with GLASSWARE!Very impressed with this hotel. Great staff, great breakfast, quiet rooms with comfortable beds.","My wife and friends and I have been coming to Nashville and staying exclusively at the downtown Hampton for several years now, and they continue to impress me.  Just a few moments ago we had a potential snafu with booking dates and a certificate redemption.  After speaking with the very polite and friendly Dianne and David, not only was everything all taken care of, but we had a good laugh on the phone and my wife's birthday trip for a Beth Hart concert (rare in the U.S.) is all set!  Thanks again, this is why we stay.I stayed here for my vacation the first week of February. I definitely had a good experience. The people are great, as most in Nashville are. They have free parking and a hot breakfast included. They are very close to Broadway, which is downtown and where the honky tonks are. I am very happy I chose to stay here and would definitely stay here again.This would be the second Hampton Inn that I have stayed at in Nashville.  I make multiple trips here each year.  Since I discovered downtown Nashville as a great place for food and shopping I will not stay out near the Airport again.  This Hampton is priced right, very clean and the rooms are large. a short walk to multiple restaurants and live music!This is a brand new hotel, and it shows.  I've always been happy with Hampton Inn hotels and this one was no different.  We stayed here one night because the water in our house was cut off awaiting a plumber.The parking, underground, was very convenient and was provided with the cost of the stay.  The complimentary breakfast in the morning was the standard Hampton Inn breakfast of fruits, yogurts, etc.  I've always enjoyed their breakfast.The room was nice, with a good layout and a comfortable bed.  My one complaint would be that the heavy drapes wouldn't close over the window and our room looked over a parking lot with its lights shining brightly all night.The staff was friendly and attentive.  Admittedly, I didn't complain about the drapes - maybe I overlooked something...",,,"['location', 'pretty', 'good', 'far', 'action', 'close', 'sleep', 'staff', 'excellent', 'super', 'professional',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-nashville-3,Embassy Suites,3.5,$$$,60,"The Good:Fresh. Hot. Breakfast....Complimentary. Need I say more? If you know me, you know I'm a breakfast gal. These guys have it down in spades.   I also really like how the rooms are split into two rooms. It makes the sleeping area very private and separate, which is a good thing. The decor is pretty dang savvy. I like it. It's classy, like me!   I love the happy hour.1730-1930=free drinks. But make sure you tip your friendly bartender.   The fitness center is also impressive. It's bigger than most and features a hot tub and a sauna. Too bad I didn't bring my bathing suit :(. Love the bar/restaurant for a nightcap or a quick bite.   Oh...and can I mention that the shuttle is awesome? I called down to get a shuttle to Kroger because I thought it was within the 2 mile radius that Embassy serves, turns out...it was 3.5 miles away. They took me anyways...and brought me back. It was super convenient, and I was so happy I didn't have to get an Uber.The Bad:The fridge doesn't have a freezer component. It's just a mini-fridge..and that's it. What in the ?? I bought frozen meals knowing that every mini-fridge has a small freezer portion...but not at Embassy. Wack. I'm sad that they don't have a beer/wine opener in the room..and the hotel I've been staying at in my Nashville adventures has a full fridge and plates, bowls, dishwasher, and utensils. So it was kind of letdown to see that Embassy just had a wetbar and a mini-fridge. Especially when you stay for a week at a time..as I do. The Verdict: I like Embassy. It has the bells and whistles many people like, while I think it's lacking in some areas for long termers like me...but that's because I stay for a week or more at a time. Where it lacks, it makes up for in other areas. Everyone is different and has different tastes...and I think this place meets many peoples wants/needs.This hotel has a major ant problem. There are ants crawling over every surface in our room. I asked another patron about it and was told that they stayed here over New Years and had the same problem. Apparently this is an ongoing issue that they aren't doing anything to remedy. I have also run water through the coffee pot in the room 3 times and each time I end up with black grainy spots in the bottom of the cup. I have stayed at the TownPlace Suites around the corner multiple times with no issue. Will definitely go back to staying there.Let me set the stage...I travel for work, a lot. I stay away from the comforts of home a lot. I know a great hotel, a not so good one, and then I know the Embassy Suites in Nashville.  I want to believe it will be good, but it just never is. It's like they have sent every misfit Hilton Employee to this location, and every single one of them is missing the mark. Why am I entitled to say such things? Because I, myself am in the hospitality industry and I know what makes a good experience and a bad one. The people make or break your establishment and from the moment I walked into this perfectly situated yet sorry excuse for a dwelling I was ignored, over looked and simply made to feel like the staff didn't care. Check in was rude as rude can be. I was under my boyfriends room reservation, which I asked them to look at, but they insisted I was not added to the room. Yet low and behold when he called in, there I was, listed in the notes. Come on! A little effort and research would have saved both of us time! And first impressions stick with you! From there it just went down hill...Take their little ""market"" for example. Should your boyfriend get sick at night and need some pepto and a tylenol PM, you should be able to walk downstairs and acquire such items. The boxes were there, on the shelf, looking at me gleaming knowing that its contents was going to save my evening. But alas, the Embassy Suites staff has left two large boxes to sit empty on the shelf. EMPTY MEDICINE BOXES?!? Seriously? And surprisingly, or not, they didn't have any more in the back room. I do not blame the girl on the overnight shift at the front desk, she was very sweet and apologetic, but y'all are a team! Someone had to notice the damn supply was getting low! And frankly, things like this scream ""We don't care about our guests."" Made to order breakfast was advertised, and when I got there at 8:30, the omelette station and made to order eggs was closed. Y'all breakfast is served until 9:30! GET IT TOGETHER! I'll have a banana and some yogurt I thought, the hell you will said the Embassy Suites! We only serve green bananas to our guests! Serving inedible food says ""We don't care!"" For the love of fruit if your bananas came in from your supplier that way, run to the damn grocery store and get something EDIBLE for your guests until those ripen! The solutions are so simple and they continually just miss the mark.Attention to detail is a non-negotiable part of being a good hotel.  How they are surviving in this part of town with places like the Lowes and Hutton, who aren't that much more expensive, baffles me. I really hope something positive comes from writing this review.  I want nothing more than for people to succeed and they could be killing it and taking business from the afore mentioned, but then again, I doubt they have the energy to care about success, let alone read this lengthy review. Thanks Embassy Suites Nashville, you've shown me how little southern hospitality y'all have.This property has seen better days. It needs a face-lift and each room should be renovated and checked out.Check-in was easy and the desk clerk was pleasant. Our room was a basic early 2000 or late 90's style room. The TV was updated but they need to work through the basics to get it to a level where we would want to stay again.We selected valet parking since their lot is a pain to get in and out of plus there was only a $4 difference from self parking.The location is good and you can walk to numerous bars and restaurants. They have a shuttle that goes downtown and that was a definite plus.Breakfast was standard Embassy Suites fare. It opens at 7AM on weekends (I was still on Eastern time when I went down, no wonder they were looking at me funny and mentioned a couple times that breakfast opened at 7... I was there at 6AM. They were nice and let me get some obviously needed coffee).I don't think we'll stay at this property again as there are other updated Hilton properties in the general area in the same price range. Once they renovate we'll be back.I stayed here last weekend so I could watch my son play baseball at Vanderbuilt. The staff was very friendly with the exception of the night manager, I didn't catch his name but he was an extremely unhappy and unfriendly person. He might want to consider a career that doesn't require people skills. The overwhelmed lady working the waffle machine could have used a cup of coffee as well but the valets where amazing! They had recommendations for places to eat within walking distance and offered free shuttle rides all over town. I didn't even have to rent a car. The stand out however was Justin who worked the front desk. He was fantastic. We came in fairly late Friday night. He was by himself and he had a small crowd. He took care of all of us in a timely matter and addressed everyone's issues with a smile and professional attitude. He was very helpful the whole weekend. I found myself waiting to talk to him with any questions I had as the night manager was clearly not interested in helping with anything in any way what so ever. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfy. The cleaning staff were friendly and helpful as well.I would definitely go backClean! Great location to walk to restaurants. Awesome breakfast and cocktail hour.  Spacious rooms. Friendly check in. Will be back.The good: Breakfast is pretty sweet; they have most things you can imagine including a few traditional southern favorites and omelets to order. They also have a free happy hour every night until 7:30. The staff is nice, but that might be because this is Nashville and everyone is nicer here than in Connecticut, where I'm from. The bad: This is my second night in this hotel. First night, we noticed our toilet was broken and didn't flush. We know a thing or two about toilets, so we opened the back and flushed it manually by lifting the plunger thing on the chain. We did this all night and requested that they fix it in the morning while we were gone. Got back in the evening and it was still broken. We said to just leave it because we are checking out in the morning .... But then while performing the manual flush technique, the chain in the back broke clean off and we can no longer manually flush it. Pretty annoying (and super gross). This is a nice hotel from the looks of it, but I was pretty disappointed in this stay (stayed once before a year ago and it was fine). Everything seems just a bit worn and grungy this time. Some ripped furniture, some things out of place, and just generally a dirty feeling. Also... Sandpaper pillowcases and towels. So noticeably that they're irritating to skin. And finally, as I lay in bed writing this review (at 11:10 PM), I can hear loud music from a restaurant or bar on the back side of the hotel (my room is located towards the back right). It's audible to the point where I can make out some of the songs being played and definitely very distracting if you're a light sleeper.  Overall, definitely not staying here next visit. Disappointed in the service and the quality. Especially for the price.Embassy Suites Nashville - Vanderbilt A few months ago we stayed at the Embassy Suites and it was an interesting experience. We arrived and went to the bar downstairs, our bartender was more than friendly and we loved her! Our room was awesome- you can tell they have taken time to provide clean rooms for guests. The room was the best part. Breakfast is free in the mornings until 10:30 which is a pretty reasonable time. However, since we are gluten free, our options were limited. The eggs were sub-par, the bacon and sausage were pretty greasy but yummy, and the coffee was good! The area to eat downstairs is large and accommodating- we had a large group. The breakfast staff was very friendly at the suites.      Our second night at the Ebassy suites took a turn for the worst when we were waiting for the complimentary shuttle to take us downtown. We were informed that we had to be put on the waiting list and reserve the shuttle but we were never offered a list. One of the shuttle attendants (didn't catch his name) was extremely rude. We complained to the front desk- the staff at the front desk is friendly and offers us a $20 Uber coupon and we decide to order an Uber instead of taking the shuttle. After we talked to the front desk, the shuttle attendant (same rude guy) came storming in saying he could have taken care of us but we decided to make other plans in more or less words. We were shocked as he raised his voice to us and got in a verbal argument with us! We were baffled. I have never experienced something like this in a hotel setting. Very unsettling.      The next day we had a very late flight around 9pm so we wanted to pay for a half day. The late check out was 1pm and we were informed that a half day would be $125 and we could only stay until 3pm. The lady on the phone was rude and not understanding whatsoever. We definitely will not be staying in the Embassy suites any time soon, this experience totally turned us off.My room was huge and off the elevator.  I kept the door to my bedroom closed just to feel intimate in my large bedroom space.  The furniture was old fashion, not my favorite look.  The staff was very helpful and professional.  I would stay again.Just stayed here. Not overly impressed. Breakfast and happy hour was the best part. Service was poor, rooms in need of an update. Over a mile to honky Tonk and shuttle is nice but stops at 10pm. Wouldn't stay at Embassy again.Every room is a suite. It's kind of an Embassy thing.For this right-in-the-mix location of the Hilton offshoot, you get just that. The character and aesthetic are a bit archaic, so the trendy and hip-seeking may scoff at the digs. But the bed is comfortable, the suites are large and supremely clean, and there's a hot buffet breakfast with an omelet station. And for these things, I can forgive the sterile, 1980's Holiday Inn atmosphere.The location can't be topped. Astride Music Row, and in that sweet spot of midtown that puts you across the street from Hattie B's, and a block from Patterson House means dinner and drinks. Every night. Allthenights. Explore Vandy to burn off those unearned calories - that's why most of your suite neighbors are staying here. Pack black and gold.Self-parking in the attached garage (which is a nightmare to navigate) will run you $38 a day. So, load up on that comped bacon before the clock strikes 10am.I like this hotel, we stayed in room 1038.  Clean, great omelet bar, great location, free happy hour 5:30-7:30, family friendly, love the ambiance of the atrium.   What I don't like is that their beds are very HARD which makes it uncomfortable, but the bed linens are comfortable, including the soft pillows.  Late night (after midnight), loud noises outside, screaming yelling, expensive parking $22 a day, despite the few dislikes, overall I like this hotel!This Embassy Suites is located in a great area in downtown Nashville. We really enjoyed being able to just walk out of the hotel and venture to numerous eating establishments without a problem. The Self parking is $18 and The Valet parking is $22. We opted for Valet and the service was excellent!The hotel is nice. They have the standard fare for an Embassy with the Manager's Reception and the breakfast. The room was very clean and cozy. I am not a big fan of noisy rooms and this room was noisy. Loud air conditioning and plumbing. Also, since the room is facing the busy downtown streets it was pretty loud. Our housekeeper was very brassy. So much so that I opted out of cleaning services during my stay. Yes. She was that brassy. Aside from that the hotel is in a good location, convenient if you have kiddos, and great value. It is not luxury by any means, but hey....its Embassy Suites. If you're looking for luxury....uhmmmm....this isn't it. I would stay here again if I was attending another conference in the area and had my daughter (the suite gave her space) but the Cool Springs Embassy is better IMO.I try to stay mainly at Hilton properties. For the price point in and around Vanderbilt and downtown Nashville, this is one of my favorite hotels. The staff is mostly very courteous and the rooms are clean. They have a great breakfast buffet or cooked to order omelettes.It is less than a five minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and only about a 5 to 10 minute drive, depending on traffic, to downtown Nashville and all of the great music on Broadway.The stay itself was great, the room was slightly dirty (first night we found toe nail clippings on the carpet...gross!)House keeping would want to come in at the most random times, two nights they didn't come in all day and then wanted to come in at night around 6.. breakfast was excellent, the nightly rate was average, closer to the high side, but that was fine.I was disappointed with management and the front desk when I had left the hotel. About two hours after leaving I discovered I had let my pillow there (I have a medical condition and purchased this ridiculously expensive pillow via recommendation from my chiropractor) after noticing I did not have it I called right away (we were driving and had been in the car for about 2 hours) the girl working took my room information, home address and said they would mail it to me and charge the card on file. After not receiving in a week or so later I called again. They had not found it, therefore did not send it. I explained I called only 2 hours later; around 9AM...Apparently the girl never even looked or put a note in the computer. I called and left a message with the manager and never received a phone call back. I called (again) and talked to the front desk and explained it was for a medical condition and they said they would ask the house keeping staff...again never heard back. Needless to say the stay was great, the aftermath was terrible, seeing as I come to Nashville about 6 times a year, it is safe to say they lost my business<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g55229-d223681-r322604150-Embassy_Suites_by_Hilton_Nashville_at_Vanderbilt-Nashville_Tennessee.html&amp;s=be70ff19627073c83d33a93b925acdd48dfe56c67b8b3b60724baa546df9a5f1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>3 Stars because the staff was so nice and the location was perfect! They have a shuttle that you can reserve that will pretty much take you anywhere and its free (remember to tip!).The rooms were nice,.... except the mattress in our room we noticed on the last day had a GIANT mystery stain that looked like blood. It definitely wasn't wine.... wine does not turn brownish after it dries. It was sooooo gross. We didn't get a chance to try out the restaurant but the breakfast was free which was great but you have to expect not that great of food.Dated decor. Rooms are not soundproof (as in, I was awakened by the alarm set by the person in the room next door). Bed was saggy. Wifi was slow and didn't reach to bedroom, just living room area. Front desk staff was curt and did NOT go out of their way to help.I self parked because the valet didn't know how to drive stick. Breakfast was great!  The woman making waffles and omelets had a smile for everyone!We just stayed here. It was very disappointing compared to the embassy suites we've stayed at before. The linens were scratchy. The WiFi was terrible and barely worked at all. The vallets were nice when we arrived. We had used the shuttle but when we needed picking up they didn't know where anything was and didn't even obey traffic laws. The breakfast was alright but cheaply made. Went to omellete and waffle part to get a waffle and they say they don't make those.. Even tho it says they do on the sign and I'm looking at the waffle iron. The complimentary drinks and snacks were nice. This place could use a pool or something to enjoy besides a tiny whirlpool. Pretty disappointing. Also paying $18 to park is ridiculous. Its also very noisy being by the street. Sounded like someone was moving furniture the entire night of our last night. Lots of things to work on. I didn't mind the outdated decor.I came upon this place because the hotel I was going to stay at was in an unsafe area and the reviews were mistaken. So luckily I was recommended this place and sight unseen we booked it. We were on our honeymoon and this place is the place you would expect to stay in on your honeymoon. We had gotten a suite which had 2 rooms in it. You walk into a sitting room with a pull-out couch, arm chair, tv, desk, office chair, small wet bar, mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker with coffee and tea. Then you walk through a small hall past the bathroom with a shower,bath,full vanity and toilet. Then our room had a bedroom with a door, closet, 2 queen beds, tv and makeup vanity with full  sized mirror. The beds were very comfy and pillows were great and the sheets were clean. The whole suite was very clean and I am very particular about the cleanliness of my hotel rooms.   Hotel itself is great every weekday they have a reception with wine and beer and snacks like chips and salsa for free from 5:30-7:30. It is a great idea but the snacks are kinda sad and they never have enough for the amount of people that show up. The breakfast at this place is unbelievable. They have your normal cereal and milk, fresh cut fruit, yogurt. Then they have scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuits and gravy, bacon, sausage. They also have a lady cooking made to order omelets and waffles. On the side they have toast, muffins, donuts, english muffins and other pastries. Finally they have juice, coffee, milk, and sodas. They have plenty of room to sit the whole 1st floor is dedicated to eating and lounging. Services they offer are room service, exercise  room with sauna and hot tub. laundry and self-laundry, in house restaurant and a small store for snacks and things you forgot. The hotel is also within walking distance from many restaurants and a fabulous cupcake shop. It is a great driving distance from downtown. I only gave it 4 stars because the wallpaper in our room was peeling and patched, the room had an annoying unidentifiable squeak noise and it cost $8.50 for Malibu rum and pineapple juice and the bartender is horrible. Also you have to pay $18 for parking a night and their parking garage is bad it has weird hills in it and the spots are so close together and really close to huge poles.The staff was friendly and the hotel lobby/atrium area was comfortable (love the ginormous fountain). The room was clean and spacious. The complimentary breakfast and happy hour was nice although they promoted ""try our happy hour sliders"" on screens throughout the hotel every day but it was always just chips and dips and a few veggies. Parking was convenient and we used the complimentary hotel shuttle a lot to get to/from Broadway. The biggest complaint: Our room never got cool in spite of having the air on 60 degrees and the fan on high. I probably wouldn't stay here again because we really needed a pool to cool off after wandering around Nashville but the price was right and it was convenient.","A/C was horrible. Toilet overflowed at  6am and no one could help. No pool. Hot tub was broken. Hotel needs repairs. TV channels weren't coming in. They didn't have quarters for anyone wanting change fir the washer or dryer. Water pressure in the shower was HORRIBLE. Breakfast was good. Carpet in bedroom was sticky. I don't recommend thus one.I stayed at this hotel for the third time the first week of May. When I stayed in February I noticed the internet was working and the tv/cable wasn't working very well. I made numerous phone calls to the front desk about the problem. I told them I had many people staying there in May for my daughter's graduation and since we would be working while we were there, it was imperative we have good internet. They told me they were having a complete overhaul of their internet service and it would be completed before my next stay. I did not change my reservation. What a mistake. I had my whole family arrive and the internet didn't work, or the tv cable system. I asked the front desk and they said that the overhaul had fallen through. We had trouble with the happy hour, the breakfast, the parking garage problems, one room was so hot we put wet washcloths by the bed to cool down, constant problems with one room with the keys, etc. etc. I was not going to stop all the festivities to call downstairs every time something happened because between all of our rooms, that would have pretty much have been all we would have done. My bill for my 2 of the rooms was almost $2000 and it was the worst hotel stay I have ever had at a Hilton hotel. I know alot about Hilton hotels because I am a diamond member and I stay in one almost every week. On my last day, the icing on the cake was when they said I couldn't have a diamond member late checkout. That is when I lost it and told the front desk clerk ALL the problems we had and all he said to me was, ""Why didn't you tell us this during your stay?"" I told him I wasn't going to put a damper on my daughter's graduation by calling down every 5 minutes but I would definitely want this passed on to a supervisor and have them contact me. Never heard a word from a supervisor. Not even a phone call, email, nothing. Mr. Scott Balmaseda, the General Manager, never contacted me, but finally responded to a negative review on Tripadvisor saying how hard is to get the internet fixed and how they are on a waiting list to get it, but that is not advertised anywhere on their site, plus he didn't address the hot rooms, the fact you had to have someone walk to the valet to get them to use their key to open the parking garage access because the keys didn't work, and the valet employees said it happens all the time and needs to be fixed.  He didn't address the breakfast area closing early on May 10th, even though it was Mother's Day.  He didn't address the cable tv not working, the fact that the evening happy hour had fritos and hot sauce, really?? and wouldn't give you a bloody mary because that was extra. Really?  This place is a rip-off.  As anyone can see from my reviews, this is not my average review.  I review great customer service as well.  I hate to hear of anyone losing their jobs but it is evident Mr. Balmaseda does not have the skill or maybe the heart to run this hotel.  Shame on you Mr Balmaseda.I like the Embassy Suites especially their delicious made-to-order breakfast. During this stay, my family was lucky to get a room tucked away in a corner so it was nice and quiet. The service that we received from everyone was good. The hotel is within a walking distance from Vanderbilt University and many local restaurants. I think I will encourage my son to apply to Vanderbilt just so I can come back here again.Update 7-31-14: as a result of their email survey, post stay, the manager contacted me and ""made this right"" and even asked if there were additional issues. Well done.  So with that level of customer care I would change this review to 4 stars. He took care of a loyal hilton customer.  I've stayed at this property three times; business and pleasure. This experience was sub par because the tv in the bedroom was crappy. It was fuzzy.  The remote didn't work and it only got a few channels.  They did repair or swap it out. There was a three  inch screw laying in the middle of the floor. And wow. Glad I saw it or it would have hurt like heck to step on.  I wasn't really bothered by the crumbs on the footrest till the other two incidents (tv and screw). So the attention to detail was lacking this trip.  On top of that the parking as others have noticed is ridiculously right be it a ford explorer or a Camry. I was aggravated after the screw and the messed up tv so the extremely tight Parking lot was icing on the cake because with tax this ""suite"" was just over three hundred bucks for one. Night.  Wow. Expect a little more from a hilton property for premium dollars.I travel frequently for work and try to stay at Hilton properties. In my opinion, this hotel is not up to the Hilton standard. I read reviews and knew the age of the hotel before booking, so I asked for a renovated room due to my severe allergies. There is an irritating smell in the hotel. I think it's chlorine. The suite looks like they have attempted to do a low budget remodeling. The light switch plates are crooked and not attached all the way. There's a long Crack in one wall with a screw sticking out. Neither the bathroom nor furniture has been updated. The beds are very comfortable but the sheets are cheap and appear old. The made to order breakfast is very good, thus the three stars. If you are looking for an upscale hotel, then this one is not for you.I just got home from a whirlwind trip to Nashville. First time and had a blast. Wasn't sure about staying so far from downtown but it ended up being the perfect location. The free shuttle was so convenient and the drivers were great. Hattie Bs is a stones throw away and so worth the line wait. Check out the cup cake shop while you're there. Shout out to Eliu at the front desk. Always helpful and smiling. I bought some cowboy boots in town and he was so helpful in getting them shipped back home. I would stay here again on a return trip. Hilton properties are the way to go for quality and value!The rooms price was reasonable for location, free breakfast and happy hour. The breakfast is also open later each day during the weekend maybe to accommodate for people walking up later. The room we stayed in had a pull out bed and queen size bed. Very comfortable. The staff was super nice. I would definitely stay there again.Update: Quick front desk moved our room for us (6'5"" teenager needed a bed not the pull out).  We called and within 5 mins the manager showed up with new keys and a different room.  My wife said, ""...okay. That might make up for the bad breakfast and nasty bathrooms...""2.5 stars. Good intentions but poor execution. We stayed here when our son moved into college. Maybe they were overwhelmed with the crowd?  The valet was prompt and attentive, always ready with the car. However, the staff inside the hotel was either distracted or overwhelmed by their responsibilities. Rooms were standard Embassy Suites. Nice setup and functioned just fine. All the other normal benefits of an ES were near nonexistent though. We will be making reservations well in advance to stay somewhere else when we come to visit next time.Breakfast was just plain disgusting unless you waited in the long line for a made-to-order omelet.  Even then, only so-so at best.  The self-serve table with bacon, sausage and potatoes was covered in grease, food, spilled ketchup and hot sauce.  Hard to stomach.  Even the coffee experience was uninspired.  They offer tiny little styrofoam cups and only whole milk creamer. (Is only offering whole milk just a Southern thing I'm unaware of?  I don't think so, but maybe?)Main floor restroom had not seen a cleaning in what appeared to be weeks. As we were headed out for the day (and to get an actual breakfast) I stepped in to use the restroom. It was nearly unusable so I went back up to our room. Looked for a different hotel for our second night but because of all the college move-ins taking place not much else was available. We simply found a good breakfast spot outside the hotel.I think all Embassy Suite hotels are nice.  The valet is a good deal for 20.00 as the self-park is 16.00.  The manager's reception had been picked over, but I came at the tail end, but I got a nice glass of wine out of it.  The room was clean and everything was just right.  Breakfast was good, standard ES fare.  Met my expectations for what ES should be.Maybe I'm spoiled by the California Embassy Suites. The wifi was slooooooow. Couldn't even use it. The Bed was very nice, not much selection on the tv. Location was great about 1 1/2 miles from the Country Music Hall of Fame. The prepared breakfast was nasty. But the cook did a good job on the grill. No indoor pool ~sad face~ gym did have a state of art treadmill Sauna and hot tube were good. YStayed June 2014, traveled with family. I wouldn't stay there again if I didn't have too. Not horrible but not great.Customer service was fantastic. They run a complimentary shuttle in the local area, and they were very nice to take us and pick us up on several occasions. And they wee always very nice about it- never made it feel like it was a burden. I asked for an early morning taxi on the day of my departure, and they had it for me 10 minutes early. The location of the hotel is great- very close to Vanderbilt, and downtown. Definitely made use of the local spots, which includes several great restaurants. The only issue I had during this stay was some weird things in the room. For example, my bathroom sink would fill up whenever the person in the next room would use their sink. Or, the TV was always fuzzy in the early evening hours (god knows why). Their ironing board sucks too (if that's important to you, haha).By far the most accommodating hotel in the area. Celebrated a 50th birthday in Nashville with lots of friends and family and the staff at Embassy Suites made this happen. From start to finish the staff was helpful and amazing. Thank you Scott and Amanda Jacks for all of your help.Comfy and clean hotel. The gym is nice and clean with high tech cardio machines (touch screen with televisions and iPod hookups).The downsides: 1. breakfast for a gluten-free vegan - banana, grapefruit, oranges - everyday. Ugh. 2. The sun deck is located right next to all the hotel fans and generators - it's so loud! Not a relaxing place to hang out.We had a Bachelor Party at this location over the past weekend and it was quite a blast! The staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and allowed for some great in room partying. The location is fantastic! Right near music row with about 10 bars surrounding it. It is about a 2 mile trip to downtown Nashville on the main strip on Broadway. The shuttle that runs until 10pm will take you down there for free. The 2 hour free happy hour was great. The free breakfast is also amazing, omelet was delicious. Really I don't have much negative to say. The 'sun deck' is actually just the roof of the parking garage with a subpar view, still great for sunbathing or drinking and cigar smoking though.I actually believe I will returning for a second stay to this hotel in the future.I spent more time in hotels than I do my own home. As a diamond member of Hilton, there are certain expectations for this loyalty. But when I ran out of deodorant on the road, the managers response: ""ever since I've been here"" we have not given this out complimentary. You'll have to buy it!The hotel is nice and not in a bad area. Pretty close to a lot of restaurants and bars. The first night I checked in there was no hot water. The beds are comfortable. The breakfast is great and the complimentary happy hour is a nice touch. I would stay here again.Comfy rooms, bed was fine. the free happy hour and breakfast are excellent perks. close to Vanderbuilt and downtown.I was very very impressed by Embassy Suites! It was my first time ever staying with them and I really enjoyed the experience. The bed was comfortable, the shuttle took me just about everywhere I needed to go (and  provided entertainment) the shuttle drivers are close in age to me/majority of the people in my group and were very friendly. I loved giving the guy from LA a hard time. The breakfast they served was on point. I loved the fact that they had someone making fresh omelets. I ate one all 3 days of my stay. I also really enjoyed the fact that they offered a complimentary happy hour!! FREE BOOZE!! Who doesn't love free booze?!?!?! It's not the best quality, but it makes you feel good. I would definetely stay here again and I recommend others to as well!We stayed here during a road trip from California to North Carolina. We usually stay at Embassy Suites so I didn't think twice about booking a room at this location. While the hotel itself is impressive, the service was well below average with the exception of housekeeping and the friendly female bartender.Check-in was rough. The gal was not accommodating or even friendly in the least. Valet was unorganized and seemed confused. After coming through Oklahoma and Arkansas I was expecting some southern hospitality. Instead I felt like I was in L.A. minus the emphasis on grooming and aesthetics.There is no pool, arcade or play area so the kids didn't get that added touch so many other embassy suites have to offer. We did enjoy Nashville immensely! What a great city!Very pleased with my stay here, although a bit more expensive than expected. $240.00 per night. First, the location was terrific. Steps from Vanderbilt and a short walk to the District. Happy hour from 5:30-7:30 was a nice touch until they ran out of beer. Complimentary breakfast with omelette station works. Check-in was a breeze. Gym was surprisingly well-equipped with a nice sauna and tiny whirlpool. No pool. Rooms were spacious two-room suites in an atrium style hotel. Shuttle was largely unreliable.","Compared to other Embassy Suites, this location is subpar. The Tampa, FL Embassy Suites' kitchenette was twice as long, and the continental breakfast lasted until 10AM there instead of 9AM here. The front desk staff is pleasant though. Even though they probably only saw me once for check-in, the guy knew my name the next morning.You do need to stay on top of the front desk and housekeeping staff though. I called asking for extra shampoo/conditioner and pillows about an hour before we left, which never arrived. The items never arrived while we were gone for nearly 12 hours either. I was just too tired to call again when we returned.Thanks to the American Outlaws discount (supporters group for the USA Soccer Men's National Team), the room was $124/night. I was told over the phone the shuttle will drive you within a 2-mile radius, including LP Field. Upon arrival, we discovered the shuttle doesn't go across the river. So, even though LP Field is within a 2-mile radius, you can't take the hotel shuttle to LP Field.Also, beware valet parking is $19/night. I don't know what self-parking costs, but I am not sure if this was in the confirmation email. So, when I forwarded my roommates the email, they didn't know about the fee.Wifi is free in the lobby, but not free in the rooms. There are different kinds of wifi to sign up for; I just chose the $5.95 rate. Be aware the wifi is exactly 24 hours, not linked to the time you check into your room. Thus, if you decide to check in early at 10:30AM, but you're not checking out until 11:30AM the next day, there's an hour when you will not have wifi (unless you pay for another 24 hours).We only stayed one night, but I don't know if I'd enjoy this hotel if staying long term. It is quite a walk to downtown Nashville. We ended up taking a cab Tuesday night back to the hotel when it started raining. From Layla's Bluegrass Inn (see my last review), it cost $7.50 for cab fare, which wasn't too bad.  Oh, the most annoying thing of all was housekeeping coming to the door twice on the morning of checkout. It's like they wanted to kick us out 2 hours before noon. Sheesh!Great place to stay! The prices vary depending if there is an event going on. I was here on business and this is a great location! It is close to downtown, west end, Hillsboro area. There is a manager's reception from 5:30-7pm which includes free beer,liquor, and mixed drinks. In the morning they have a wonderful selection of hot and cold breakfast. The big win for me is the cooked to order omelette bar!This hotel is a bit overpriced for the services and the quality of service you normally expect from an Embassy. I think the amenities are better at the Hilton Garden Inn next door (and it's usually $30 cheaper).The Embassy has the nice decor of an indoor view of the breakfast area but the walls are paper thin. You can hear people talking as far as 3-4 doors down if you are watching TV in your living room. During my visit, the ice maker wasn't working.As a Hilton Honors Silver member, I'd expect they would honor my request for a high floor but instead we were on the 5th floor.The breakfast is alright.The shuttle service works well except on Friday and Saturday nights when they are usually booked solid. They are reliable, fast, and know the area pretty well.For larger vehicles, the parking structure is a bit tight as you drive up in the self park garage. It makes you wonder why they have the large pole in the center as you go around each level.I went to Nashville for my sisters wedding last weekend and stayed here for 4 nights, and couldn't have asked for a better experience. The hotel arranged it so all of the bridesmaids rooms were located close together, which made it easy to coordinate car pools, hair and make up. The valet's were wonderful, they always pulled my car around quickly and made sure that everything got packed into the car quickly. Also, the suites have free breakfast every morning, delish! Omlet bar, scrambled eggs and BACON (the most important food) every morning! There were some weird things, like the rooftop patio that was really a fenced off portion of the parking lot with patio furniture, and some of the areas of the hotel seemed warn. However, the friendly service made up for it.Location, fantastic. The hotel comfortable and clean.  I don't think you can beat an Embassy Suites especially if you are traveling with children. The breakfast alone is superior.  The manager's cocktail hour is generous and a good time.  The front desk man, I think he was actually a manager, was professional (of course) but he was also warm and quick witted.  It was simply a good stay.We were guests at the Embassy Suites Nashville/Vanderbilt from Dec30-Jan5.  I traveled with my two young adult kids to move my daughter to college there (from California). We had an amazing experience and are so grateful for all of the staff that we encountered.  I'm not the best at remembering names but Tim at the front counter was top-notch/as good as it gets for customer service.  His colleagues were also very helpful.  From the shuttle drivers, to the housekeeper, to the bartender, to the waiters and the amazing cook-to-order chef - we could not have been treated better.  This is a very guest-focused hotel.  We felt the value for the price was very good considering all hotels increase their prices during the holidays. Plus the price includes a full breakfast buffet and cook-to-order breakfast, as well as nightly appetizers and drinks (alcoholic too).  This property is very conveniently located to Belmont University, Vanderbilt, Music Row, Downtown, LP Field and Bridgestone Arena. It is approx 15 minutes from the airport and Opryland.Review...free booze was a nice first impression at the happy hour. Rooms were fine.  Not over the top great but adequate.   Walking distance to a couple of decent honkytonks.  Honestly, the Hampton at Vanderbilt is much nicer and a better value.I received the worst customer service from this hotel. They raised my rate on my reservation and transfered me 5 times to different people to help me. All either disconnected me, or I received a voice recording without a returned call. I was even transferewd to an out of state call center! We are a member of Hilton Honors, and always stay at Embassy Suites. Conveniently when I tried to post this review the system was down.Pro:  two-room suites, free shuttle within a 2-mile radius, free made-to-order breakfast (much better than the typical continental breakfast), free happy hour, Vanderbilt college bar scene nearby.Con:  have to take a cab to get to the nightlife downtown, have to pay for WiFi (for the price and other free stuff already included, you'd think the internet would be free), the noise from the open central lobby reverberates through the place so if you're a light sleeper it may disturb you, thin walls, rooms do smell a bit musty.I like the property, the staff and the location cannot be beat. The hotel is a bit older, but still well kept. The free shuttle offers a nice way to get around the city if you find yourself taking advantage of the free booze at managers reception at 5:30. The rooms are large so it's perfect for those longer stays. The space helps cut down on the stir crazy feeling I get from other smaller rooms over a week span. The free breakfast is a nice treat and the omelets are usually great. The place ranges form 99-189 per night, so book early and you'll have a great room at a great price, but don't forget they'll still send you away bowlegged with that 17.00 per day parking fee. Also, bone up on your Austin Powers parking skills before heading to Nashville because their parking garage is a freaking rubric cube from hell, and you're bound to kill yourself trying to park.My parents stay here a lot when they come to visit me here in Nashville, and I usually end up hanging out there a lot with them.  It has a great location within walking distance to a very large amount of restaurants and bars.  And when I say 'within walking distance' I mean walk in a 3 block radius and you'll hit about 30 different establishments.  Its also a short cab ride (around 5 bucks) to most of the popular tourist attractions and a lot of local shopping.They have their own parking garage with complimentary valet so you don't have to worry about finding a spot on cluttered city streets.  I love the inside of this hotel.  The center of the building is one large atrium style room full of fountains and cozy places to sit.  The hotel restaurant is an Omaha steaks and the bar inside offers a free happy hour for guests (yes thats right I said FREE happy hour).  They have a great free breakfast including hot and cold items as well as a custom omelet and waffle bar.The rooms themselves are spacious and clean, decorated in your typical hotel room style.  Most of the rooms also host a pretty great view of the city, especially in the evening.While we got a really good deal on a busy weekend, the hotel was not prepared for being fully booked. We stayed two nights and had two separate suites for our family.The biggest issue was housekeeping! While they decorated the beds nicely with our kid's stuffies, they did not clean the bathroom floors or left any bath towels! We called before noon and I got several calls in the afternoon if this issue was resolved, which you guess it, it was not. Finally at like 6:30 someone from housekeeping showed up, was visibly upset said some profanities about his management wiped the floor with some towels (still missed plenty of hairs (Yucky!) left and showed up 20 minutes later with some towels (I hope it were not the same as the ones he used for the floor! The breakfast while free was awful. Everything was basically out all the time, there was nowhere to sit and you waited 30 minute in line for an omelet that was not fully done because they rushed it. For scrambled eggs and bacon the wait was 20 minutes! Oh and did I forget to mention you have to pay for the Internet! Wow! The price was great for an Embassy Suites the service and the cleanliness was more of a motel that you pay by the hour. Oh one positive note the valet guys were super friendly and quick for a crowded hotel and the location is great!This Embassy Suites is pretty bombass for a few reasons.  First off, it has a most excellent location.  Right on Broadway, you can walk to many bars, restaurants, Vanderbilt, shops, and even some tourist areas.  If you are lazy or too drunk, it is very easy to hail a cab out front and even easier to have the valet guy call you a cab.  If you have a car you can park it in the hotel lot for probably a lot of cash or you can park back behind on Division if you can find a spot.  Second, the hotel is clean and nice.  The lobby and breakfast areas were clean and when you ride up the glass elevator you get a good view of the entire atrium.  All rooms are suites (thus the name, Embassy SUITES duuh! hehe) including a nice living area with tv, microwave, fridge, coffee maker, and wet bar.  The couch folds out in a bed if you have more guests than you were expecting. Surprisingly, we found the room to be quiet even though a convention of teenage girls checked in when we did and also a bachelorette party was located two doors down.  Finally, the place has free breakfast and FREE HAPPY HOUR.  You heard me.  And I am not talking JUST BEER - I got liquor.  Yes, TWO rum-n-diets for exactly FREE.  FREE BOOZE.  Stay here, get your pre-party on, then go out to all the bars in walking distance and go from there!This place was pretty much perfect for my husband and I. We did a long weekend in Nashville, and the Embassy Suites had a great price for way more than other hotels offer. You get a two room suite, which is perfect for us because my husband likes to watch TV before bed and I can't stand it, so he has his own special room for that. Free breakfast, which we tried once, was kinda awful. Greasy, weird, flavorless, etc. We decided to skip it the rest of the time and went down the street (about a block away) to Noshville (despite cringing at the name), where they have great breakfasts (if you have the belly for it, get the bagel/lox plate, it was killer).Oh, also: open bar dude! They have a two hour happy hour every night where drinks are free. Wine, beer, select mixed drinks, and some snackies. They have a nice middle area with couches and tables to hang out and have a couple.We got the free shuttle (within two miles) downtown, immediately freaked because downtown SUCKS. Holy new country hell. We slammed down a drink at Merchants and hightailed it out of there. If you are into really touristy, new country kinda loud party places, downtown is the place for you. It is not for me. Husband and I walked about 10 blocks over to the Station Inn, and listened to some lovely and live old country and bluegrass. Sweet relief.I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Nashville; there are plenty of good places to eat/drink around the hotel, but it's just far enough away from the madness (but with a free shuttle to the madness, if that's what you're into).I stayed on a high floor and are extremely thin.  I was able to clearly hear my neighbor's clock radio.  The gym is pathetic.  Skip it.So where did my business travels take me this week?? None other than Nashville, TN, home of all that country music has to offer. So I arrived at the hotel around 4:15 or so, and it was still light outside, so I had thought I would go ""sightsee"" a bit, since I've never been to Nashville myself. Yeah so that definitely didn't go according to plan, because everything closed around 5:00, but I definitely plan on going to see some of the surrounding sites next time I'm in town, especially since this hotel has such a great location. It's not far from many of the sites, Opryland, The Parthenon, Country Music Hall of Fame.Ok enough about the tourist talk, this review is about the hotel, so I should probably start talking about that......So I arrive at the hotel, and was pleasantly surprised, the inside of the hotel is very nice, and the rooms are spacious as well, they have a bedroom and then a seperate suite that has a sitting area. So it provided me with plenty of space to sprawl my things out. Every evening, the hotel has what is called a ""manager's reception"", where it's basically like a little happy hour for the hotel down in the lobby. They had some snacks and the best part....a bartender, giving out as many drinks as you want.....Mmmmm....can't beat that!!!  ;)   I tend to get bored traveling around by myself for business and not knowing anyone, so it was nice that they had this, where people from the hotel could mingle with one another and it gives you a chance to meet and talk to other people from all over the country.  (This is if you like to mingle, not so great if you like to just be left alone during your trips....LoL)......Well after the manager's reception, I was famished and was looking for something to eat. Didn't really feel like driving around too much at this point, so I just settled for this Thai restaurant down the street. Next time however, I think I'll plan to give myself some more time, so that I can make it down to Opryland, they have outlet stores there, and some great restaurants from what I heard.Two downers for me when it came to this hotel, was 1) You had to pay for parking whether it was valet or self-park in the garage adjoining the hotel.   2)  You have to pay for internet access in the hotel, otherwise you can use the business center downstairs........these were both bummers for me, b/c I feel as much as you are paying for a room at the hotel you should have those things included rather than be an extra charge.Anyways, all in all, I'd stay here again for business or otherwise, as they were very accomodating and had very friendly staff as well.we chose this spot from reviews on trip advisor. I would not hesitate to stay here again.  I never eat breakfast and the fresh omelets every morning were great. I was also amazed at the happy hour in the evening. not wonderful but I loved being able to take a glass of wine up to my room.  I also liked the suite set up.. much more space.  we would definitely stay here again.I stayed here on business a couple weeks ago. I love ES to begin with. Always good quality common areas and great rooms. The Nashville ES is close to downtown and near Vanderbilt Univ. The front desk staff were very helpful. Natalie who was a trainee helped us find a great place for dinner (Cabana near Vanderbilt...5 minutes drive..excellent atmosphere and food). She waited for us to get back from dinner and had gotten us cupcakes from a cupcake shop across the street for dessert. That kind of service makes you want to write a nice postive review!!OK. not great. Not a great value. I had minor problems the last few times I stayed. Location is great for me. Last time I was there in early July it was the worst. Our room smelled like a sewer a little bit and the place was pretty dirty in spots. Furniture and carpets are worn. I wrote a note and got a nice reply but it turns out those things are 10 YEARS OLD! No wonder. Breakfast was good. Over all quite pricey given everything. Lots of competition in the area tooI really like this hotel. There's a beautiful lobby/atrium area where you can sit any time of day or night. In the evenings they have free drinks and snacks, which I find pretty incredible. Breakfast is fair, but they have oatmeal and fruit among all of the junk-food type stuff, which is nice. The gym is pretty small, with only about 5 machines, and a bunch of weights/props. They're open 24 hrs, though. The great part, is that they have a hot tub and sauna! Open 7a-midnight, and hardly ever occupied. The rooms are nice, all suites as the name implies. A small fridge is in the room. No bathrobes, but they bring as many towels as you need. Overall it's a spacious place to stay, with quite a few services included in the price. It's a really relaxing feeling to get into the room at the end of a long day, grab a glass of wine, go out for some dinner, and come back to the hot tub. A GREAT place to stay!",,,"['good', 'fresh', 'hot', 'breakfast', 'complimentary', 'need', 'say', 'know', 'know', 'breakfast', 'gal', 'guys', 'spades', 'also', 'really', 'like', 'rooms', 'split',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-nashville-airport-nashville,Embassy Suites Nashville - Airport,2.5,$$,53,"First time staying at Embassy Suites. I regularly stay at Hampton properties and saw this location near a conference that was closer and better reviews than the Hampton locations.I have to admit that overall I was disappointed in comparison to Hampton. Maybe my expectations where too high.Check-In process was smooth. Did online check-in prior to arriving.Only real complaint about room was the toilet ran until you lifted the top and reset the inner workings. By the time I discovered it was too late to want to deal with having maintenance look at.I had some difficulty accessing WiFi and had to get assistance from the front desk.Personally I prefer to use stairs for 1-2 floors instead of waiting on the elevator every time. I could not find any staircases near my room other than emergency exits to outside the building.I would stay here again.The location is good, it has been updated except for the rooms , very small for suites . The beds very uncomfortable for the price you pay they should be top notch like all the other embassy's we've stayed. The restaurant that is here is extremely $$$$!!  The rooms are very clean, the sofa pull out you might as well sleep on the floor that's how bad the mattress is on it!I recently stayed at Embassy Suites at the Nashville Airport. Though the suite was was adequate for the cost, unfortunately the customer service was less than desirable. I accidentally left an outfit in the closet of my room. I reached out to the hotel a few hours after leaving and spoke to the night cleaning manager and she told me she would check and took my number but never got back to me. I left a message for the housekeeping manager and sent an email before she responded. When she responded she informed me that my clothes were not in the lost and found, but she would check the closet in the room as well but that was the last time I heard from her. I expected a higher level of customer service from the Hilton brand. I will definitely think twice about staying in another Hilton hotel in the future.Worst customer service ever!!!! I have now been hung up on twice and transferred to someone in Canada... I have now been on hold for over 15 minutes, and all I want is a copy of and invoice emailed to me... What is so difficult about this request??? Get your customer service act together!Always nice when you show up after traveling from California to find that the hotel has been oversold and they are moving you to a different hotel 10 miles away. I spend 100 nights a year in hotels - elite status, all that crap. It means nothing to people who either a) Don't care about their customers, or B) Are too incompetent to count rooms.As per usual for Embassy Suites they go overboard with the food and beverage service and that is awesome.  The accommodations are pretty decent, but the staff appears to he underworked and overtaxed and this makes them a bit absent or overwhelmed when we need them.  All in all I dig this place of couse but may or may not be back with so many options in the area.I travel a lot and like to stay at ES. This one is on the lower end and would not stay here again. the lobby area looks like it has been remodeled. My issue is the room. When going to bed the first night I noticed the comforter had fresh makeup-- lipstick and mascara as well as smelled like BO. It completely grossed me out. Secondly my blow dryer died the next morning. Looked old to begin with. Lastly the roomHad no closet or hanging area and no iron. Very strange not to be able to hang up business clothes?? Lastly lines to reception and breakfast very long and limited parking. Location does not allow for walking.Love it! Clean, friendly staff, free big breakfast, free two hour happy hour, and around the corner from my meeting place. Courtesy shuttle drove me on rainy days which was awesome!!!  Would definitely come back.Tight parking. Small bathrooms for a suite. Couldn't get the room cool enough. I stayed here a night after my flight home was cancelled. Only stayed a few hours so my review is a little light. I did notice that I could hear jets taking off from the airport while in the room. That is an airport area hotel for you. Front desk staff was friendly and professional.So I came here again over a year later. The lobby and bar area has been completely re-worked since the last time I was here when it was a disaster. Friendly service at the desk although they should add a few more people to check guests in to avoid the lines. Wifi was much better this time. My room was also so much better than last time being totally updated with new furniture, TV's etc.. Still, be advised this location fills it's front parking lots quickly and you may be forced to park in the back at the bottom of the hill. Close to airport which is nice.This is by no means the best Embassy Suites I've stayed at, but I can't say it's the worst. EB hotels generally hold themselves above the rest. This particular location needs some updating, but it's not terrible. There is one male employee that can jump in a creek. I met with him over the phone originally and then in person later, he is miserable. Anyways, I felt comfortable at this location and can't speak terribly about it. This is my second stay on location. It is consistent, but needs some heavy updating.This Embassy Suites is smaller than what I am use to. I was spoiled with the amenities at the one in South Nashville on our way through town last time around. The customer service was great through out my whole stay. Had a room on the second floor. Usually being a HHonors member I am assigned to a room on one of the higher floors of the hotel. No big deal as we were just tired and wanted to sleep. The bed was uncomfortable. It felt as if my feet were higher than my head when lying down. The pillows were very fluffy but did not provide much support causing a restless night. Breakfast as always was amazing. They ran out of disposable cups however the lady who looked like she was in charge said I could take one of the mugs with me. It didn't happen but was nice of her to offer. Was an OK stay. As mentioned, customer service was great.OH BOY WHAT A NIGHT! I want to start off by saying that this review would have been a 1, BUT thanks to my tweet and a quick acting constomer service staff, I am giving this place a 4. So we arrive late from a long flight from California. We go to check in and the women tells us we don't have a reservation...that we HAD a reservation for a week ago (the day we made our reservation). We explained that there must be some mistake, why would we reserve a room for the same day we were making a reservation.....The woman shrugged, told us we were charged for the room because we did not show up...and not only that, they didn't have the same room we requested. we would get a smaller SMOKING ROOM. UGH...so, defeated we tried to find the elevators...they are hard to find with all of the construction. We eventually found our stinky room and then decided to get out quickly and have a bite at the hotel restaraunt. The food was surprisingly good and I can't complain about that.That night there was some serious noise going on in the walls (construction?) which woke us up multiple times and finally woke us that morning nice and early. I decided to tweet about the early wake up call, and I was contacted by the Embassy suites manager who I explained the situation (the reservation, the noise etc) HE IMMEDIATELY TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING! Now that is what I call good customer service!! Although THIS hotel doesn't have much to offer right now with all the construction, I'm glad Embassy suites lived up to their name as being a great company...Perhaps this place will be better once the construction is done!Don't forget anything in your room here!  I realized soon after I had checked out of the hotel that I had left my Ray Ban sunglasses in my room.  I called them immediately and was directed to housekeeping/lost and found.  She went to my room and confirmed that she had the sunglasses and would have them mailed to me.  This was May 29th.  It is now June 21st and I still have not received the sunglasses.  I have called NUMEROUS times and no one can seem to help.  The lady who retrieved them for me confirmed that she gave them to the person in charge of shipping them.  However, this person is never available to speak with me and does not return my calls.  I travel frequently but will not choose this hotel again because of this experience.  I feel that one of these employees is sporting a pair of Ray Bans belonging to me!Ok, this has to be the worst hotel I have stayed at in a long time. Do not get swayed by the brand name or the lobby - the place is tired, old and had horrible customer service. To start, the type room I booked was not available upon check in.  They took the reservation but just could not hold the reservation. So the ""upgraded"" me to the premium floor which, as far as I could tell, meant it had a free vending machine. But, of course it was empty.  They said they needed to restock it. Then, I go to my room and there are no rores for the TV. After trying to call the front desk ( rang off the hook) I had to go back down stairs to tell them. Over 1/2 hour later, someone showed up. I was supposed to be here for three nights - I checked out after 1. I will risk it but a la Quinta or Hampton would be far better than this.Whenever we travel with the kids, my biggest requirements are an impeccably clean room, a safe location, and enough space for the four of us. This EB met all those requirements with lots of other surprises (it's been updated and renovated) Two room suite with a door to separate the bedroom space from the living space was a plus since the adults had some work stuff to handle and the kiddos needed to get to bed at a reasonable time. Free wifi for Hilton Honors members, indoor pool (with adult time only option), free hot breakfast, free cocktail reception, business services, and lobby restaurant were all pluses!! Lobby area was always well- maintained! Would definitely stay again!""This place still scrapping the bottom of the barrel to get folks to stay here."" -- Embassy Suites employee during my stay. Do.Not.Stay.Here. Don't do it. Do not do it. The hotel is under construction. The entire front of the hotel is fenced off with equipment laying around everywhere. The new ""reception desk"" is moved to under a canopy. The hotel has indoor rooms that wrap around in a square. But in the middle is a large construction area where the restaurant and other stuff used to be. It's all under a large tarp with equipment laying everywhere.Worse yet, the employee's comment was not about the quality of the hotel. Apparently, because the hotel is under construction, and anyone who has any options at all -- which given it's location is anyone arriving before midnight -- stays somewhere else. Which apparently means that the hotel's management has been very aggressive about bringing folks in who would not normally stay in a hotel.And neither of those is the issue I have. My issue is the price. When you book online and you think Embassy Suites in the Airport in a major city like Nashville, you expect a certain quality of hotel. One with a bellhop, a restaurant, business quality rooms. This is a hotel under construction, but priced at one that's not. So you'll pay the same price as you would expect for the brand and in return you'll stay at a work zone filled with folks you would never expect at a business hotel. This literally the worst hotel I've stayed at, and I've stayed at a lot.The rooms are decent, but because so few folks stay here, the linens and interior feel grimy. (I don't suspect that they get royal class treatment.) Worse yet, folks are probably harder on the rooms than most business class customers. In fairness to the employees, they're trying to make the best of a bad situation. But your wallet will be lighter as if you stayed here or any other Hilton hotel. Unfortunately, if you're reading this review, than like me, you booked and had no choice because it was late at night and wondered -- am I the only one that thought this experience was terrible. No. You are not.Which is why others should know: Wait until the renovation is complete or overpay for not knowing any better.I had a wonderful stay here. The room was pristine and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I have to agree with other posters, that parking is tight. That being said, even with the hotel being sold out both nights I was there, I had no issues finding a spot and the lot was well lit which is important when you are a woman traveling alone.I'd stay here again without hesitation.This is a SAD Embassy Suites.  So outdated.  It was like walking back into the 70's.  It fulfilled it's purpose (a place to sleep) and the people were nice, but it is in serious need of some updating.  I couldn't even find an outlet close to the bed, so my iphone (which is my alarm clock) had to go clear across the bedroom.  No hitting snooze for me on this trip! The good:Bed was comfortable.Free breakfast and evening reception like other Embassy Suites.Very nice staff.Extra towels, toilet paper, etc. left on my door when I indicated I did not want housekeeping.Small refrigerator and microwave.Fitness room was adequate.The bad:Lack of convenient outlets.Small bathroom.No comforter, just a thin blanket.My tv was tempermental - sometimes there was sound with no picture.Horribly outdated, which makes it feel unclean.Stayed here this time to try to save the client money (free parking alone is nice), but next time will just spend the extra and stay downtown.  This property did not meet expectations set from staying at other Embassy Suites.I read a lot of the other reviews before posting my own and I would've knocked down another star if I stayed in the room more than I did- 2hrs a day.Checking in: I got in at 12:30pm and tried to check in but of course no clean rooms ready-go figure; there never are before 3pm.  So i left my phone number at the front desk to call me when it was.  I got busy with work and never did get that call but by the time I was able to return which was 5am the next day, the room was tidy and ready for my cat nap thank goodness.  At this point, I didnt care the hotel was under construction but it would've been nice for a heads up since my allergies have been bad and this was a business trip for me.I tried calling for toothpaste several times and never got it.  Went to Walmart and bought one myself-strike there for the hotel.  Super loud during the day.  There was a family reunion going on, along with the construction so if were around during the day, I imagine the noise factor to be quite off-putting so I was glad to always be there after 2am and out by 7am each day.  Parking is inconvenient.  If you end up parking in the back, there is a long, long walk to the nearest entrance.  Did I mention the hotel is on a hilltop??  On saturday morning as I made my exit for the day, the fire alarm went off.  I expected to return to find my belongings soaked in water but luckily that was avoided.  But can you imagine?  If I was here on vacay, I definitely would've done what Alex did and leave to go somewhere else.So the second star is because I liked my room.  It was clean, spacious, and it made me feel safe unlike my experience the week prior in Wichita Falls.  Compared to that... I really am not going to complain.  I refused to shower at the other hotel-yea, thats how bad it was.  I didnt even last 5 hrs at that place- super worthy of a 1star.  This one though, they get 2 stars :)","My recent stay was excellent. Everything is updated although the restaurant staff seemed a little disjointed still. The breakfast was fantastic. Did I mention everything has been updated? If you need to stay by the BNA airport then this Embassy Suites should be on your short list of hotels.I'm a diamond member and will not be back and don't recommend when u go and eat at the restaurant look at the service nobody smiles  the vibe is too seriouse instead of relaxing not goodSpent my Birthday weekend here alot of TSU folks were here made me feel more at home.this hotel is massive yet quiet I always enjoy staying here because it has everything you would ever need and service here is always A+ I only wish all of their hotels were like this one..oh well back to the enjoyment !!Picture says it all! Except the broken door, non-working lights, dead lady bug family on floor by windows, fake rose petals behind the curtains, bloody finger prints on door (what's that you say? How do I know it's blood? Well, found this by the couch!) . First day, we didn't really complain just left the room for a couple of hours to let them fix things. Second day, we really wanted towels and toilet paper... Took 3 phone calls and finally tracked down housekeeping. Hotel has been renovated. Nice pool. Just filthy brand new rooms!We had a great stay. Very comfortable, clean, not noisy (as others have said) and a great breakfast.This place is kind of old and outdated.. actually YES it's definitely outdated. I checked in and somehow my reservation had  been mixed up and put as smoking rooms. There was no unsmoking rooms available. It was a disaster trying to get that resolved. They do have a very nice free cocktail and snack hour with live music!One of the worst Hilton brand stays I've ever had. Awful room on 2nd floor right by elevators. Loud AC and noise from lobby/open area below. Longtime Hilton honors member, and very disappointed in this stay. Would not stay here again and do not recommend.Room floor not vacuumed. Dirty, wet washcloth hanging over the shower. One bed looked like a 6 yr old made it up. Looked like the housekeeper had a fling in the room prior to my check-in, wiped her *ss with a washcloth, hung it over the shower, half made the bed and exited. Definitely didn't have time to vacuum. Nasty, nasty, nasty!!Creepy, dark abandoned restaurant area downstairs.This is now a much improved hotel after the renovation last year I read about in older posts. The atrium lobby where they serve breakfast and the evening reception is fresh and inviting.  Water pressure is good on a high floor and the water warms up instantly during morning peak hours.  The exercise room has treadmills, elliptical machines,free weights and fitness balls.  Adding a weight machine would get a very good instead of OK rating.  The evening reception is more generous than most other Embassy Suites I have stayed at.  The breakfast set up is confusing.  The sign letting you know there are two lines, one for made to order omelets and another for the buffet, can only be seen from one direction.  If you approach from another direction, it is easy to assume there is only the omelet line which can be long and slow.  Parking in the back lot is inconvenient since there is no direct entrance and you have to walk all the way around to the front to get in.  Read the direction to the hotel carefully.  It is not the usual easy on, easy off from a highway ramp and because of the lay of the land, the hotel is not very visible to ground guide you.  All in all, this is an above average Embassy Suites which I would stay at again.Managers evening reception has a star. Her name is Melissa and was serving the drinks. She was friendly and inviting. Food in restaurant is mediocre but drinks are great. Rooms are small for an embassy suites but still comfortable for a short stay.An older Embassy Suites that is definitely showing its age. But I personally like the extra room you get with ES so I have stayed here a couple of times. Their GM is a bit quirky and writes a daily letter for guests that you get when you check in. The hotel staff definitely take their lead from the service oriented GM because they are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. The manager's reception in the atrium has a live band/artist a few nights a week. Not really my thing, but there were always people down there so some people must like it.Overall, this ES gets a pass. I don't know if I would stay here more than a night or two, but it's close proximity to BNA makes it a no brainer.P.S. If you order room service, try the coca-cola braised shortribs. Totally delicious.Going for it: Free drinks from 530-7pm. Free breakfast, and it's pretty darn good. She Crab Soup....awesome. But very outdated.  Toilets barely flush, lamps on the front room desk did not work for serveral of us. The valet was not very nice, and sometime rude to some coworkers I was with this past week. We had a meeting on Saturday and just down the hall the Southern Music Awards were going on so we got to listen to all their music thumping from pretty much 12-5.  Those who booked our meeting side by side needs some training in common sense.Was not bad. I wasn't wowed by the setup or entry. The room was okay not horrible it was very roomy but the bathroom was small for a suite.  The room was hot I slept with no clothes on and the AC was as low as can be but still not cool enough.  I like the space. It was quite and the bar staff was nice. Also they have a huge gnat problem, not in my room but in the food areas and conference roomsIt was so bad that I packed up and checked into another hotel.I will start this review saying I'm a Hilton Diamond member, have been for years-- I stay at a various Hilton almost once each week.  Because I'm a frequent traveler, I have learned to put up with a lot.  You just have to, or you'll make yourself crazy.   Well, this was bad enough that even I left.  First, the ENTIRE lobby looks like a war zone.  Under construction?  Ha!  How about MAJOR renovation leaving the hotel basically unfit for human habitation?  That would be more accurate.  The place is a MESS with temporary dry wall, plastic sheeting hanging everywhere, industrial construction equipment all around, etc.So anyway- here's my experience from Wednesday night:I land, call for the airport shuttle, wait on hold for 5 minutes, and then finally get through and am told that the shuttle will be there in 10 minutes.  I wait outside at the hotel shuttle spot in the sticky Nashville heat for 20 minutes, then call again.  Wait on hold for 3 minutes.  Am told the driver will be there in 5 minutes.  He is, but close to 30 minutes after I call.  Then I get to the hotel, and the people at the makeshift front desk are friendly enough, but the man at one desk has stains all over his shirt, and the woman helping me rolled her eyes at the shuttle driver and mumbled something to me about not knowing where he was. (Hence the delay in picking me up.)  Fine, whatever, and the hotel it is a DISASTER, as I described above.  I get a room key, go into my room, and it's bad.  EVERYTHING is old, the sheets/blankets are extremely worn, and the bathtub grout is covered in mold/mildew.  The carpet is peeling up at the edges and was really dirty-looking.  Still, I was going to carry on.  I left my bag in the middle of the room, and went down to grab a salad or some fruit from the cafe.  That's under construction, too, and I couldn't for the life of me find anyone to help me.  There were boxes and crates of wine and food sitting in the hall, the carpet was stained, and I was just over it.  I booked a room at a downtown hotel that I knew I could trust, called a taxi, and left.  I think that it's extremely irresponsible for the Hilton corp. to allow this hotel to remain open and operate in these conditions.  As I said, I am a longtime Hilton Diamond, and this experience was just about enough to make me switch to another chain.After crawling into bed, I felt a foreign substance on the blanket that looked to me like some sort of dried bodily secretion.A couple of months ago,Our house's pipes froze and broke. We were looking for a hotel to live in until the pipes were fixed. We went to a different hotel but it smelled bad ad the toilet broke,so we left.when we came here,we saw the construction on the 3rd floor and when we went into our room....IT WAS GREAT! The toilet didn't break,there was a tv with all my kids favorite tv channels,and best of all,there was a pool and an exercise room on the first floor! I didn't rate 5 stars because there was some key problems. First, we lost the keys(actually one of the kids lost it) then,we lost it again,my fault this time. But overall,everything was greatAm here as I am writing this...what a dump. I can't believe Hilton has an Embassy Suites they let get to this state of disaster.  If we had not been driving for 11 hours I would pack it up and move on.   Carpet in room is disgusting, everything is sticky-door handles, etc.-obviously the manager must feel about cleanliness as is the appearance of the hotel.  What a disgrace.   I used points for this and definitely need a refund.I am a HH member and I've stayed at many embassy suites. This location is by far the worst. There is no waffle maker at breakfast at this location which I love about a lot of the others. When we came back into our room after the first night they had serviced the room and things went downhill from there. They took all of the shampoo/soap and left us no towels/washcloths so we had to call to get them to bring up towels &amp; shampoo/soap. The sheets were wet that they put on the bed so it smelled musty so we had to call the service desk again and when we called, there was no apology or concern, just an ok, we will come change the sheets. When they came in to change the sheets, again there was still no apology, she just walked in, changed the sheets, and did not even say a word to us. My stay was definitely not up to par with Hilton standards. With all of that being said there was one staff member that really made this trip an overall good experience. She went above and beyond what would be expected so therefore I am not going to give this hotel less than 3 stars.Buyer beware!!! Booked a king room on premium floor. Arrive at 5 to check in. No rooms available due to housekeeping. Waited 2 hours .was place on 5 th floor. Premium floor was on 9th floor . I had paid extra for the premium floor. When questioned, was told to go up to the 9th floor when I wanted the amenities. Complained due to rate and lack do series . Moved to 9th. Amenities code did not work. Checked out the next day . The following day erroneous charges appeared for 100 dollars. Called no one could tell me why left multiple messages for managers and accounting.  No call back for over a week. Call embassy national customer services to open a complaint.  Told I would hear mack for the gm in 72 hours. No call or resolution . Called customer services back said the hotel said I checked in with 4 kids obviously damages occured. I didn't check in with 4 kids. Told them I didn't and thst this was grossly incorrect as well.  I questioned that if a child was in t he party that it automactically meant there was damanges. No response. Didn't check in with 4 kids. Nobody ever able to tell me what damages were. Told that they would contact the gm again. Requested superior above gm since no response and it is now 17 days later. Told nobody above gm. Questioned that there  was no supervisor in the whole company x 3. Finally told a cs manager would contact me. No contact still. Ready to contact an attorney on principle.Let's make this simple for those in a hurry..... stay away from this hotel until they have finished construction!! Better yet, wait one or two months after construction is done to give them a chance to learn how to manage......Details: Yes, it is convenient if you need access to the airport. The only advantage.Noise is persistent throughout. Hotel design has inside rooms wrapped around an atrium area that is exposed for all floors, so any noises made on the first floor echo throughout the hotel (I assume since they still have no carpet or anything to dampen the noise). Not sure when actual construction started today, but I heard various noises as early at 6 AM. Rooms: We have stayed at 2 other Embassy suites on this trip, this is a distant third in room size, layout and quality. Bathroom is cramped, furniture seems to be strewn around the room and not placed with any play. Floor-to-ceiling drapes are hung about 3 inches too short, so just lay on the floor. Service: Check-in was okay, person was at least friendly. They did have a managers cocktail hour with pretzels and chips/salsa. One person was manning the bar, so there was a 10 minute wait minimum for anything to drink (even Cokes). Yes, they charge full price. No advantage whatsoever, other than airport access. I listed a ""Pricey"" considering what you get for the money........An interesting trip. After two Embassy Suites visits, I was ready to make that our ""go to"" vacation accommodations. After this, I think other places are in order.","This hotel is under renovation / construction - BEWARE!Stayed in a fourth floor corner suite away from the elevators. At night there were loud bangs, never did figure out where they were coming from.The first thing that hit my nose when I got off the elevator on the fourth floor (every time, all week) was the smell of cigarette smoke. Day, night, did not make a difference. And the fourth floor is a non-smoking floor.Turned the corner to head to my room, there were six or so chairs being stored in the hallway. And someone was nice enough to leave a half-drunk bottle of water on one of the chairs.The room was clean, except for the nearly full pack of marlboro lights in the nightstand. The room did not smell of smoke, but I thought it interesting anyways.Due to the renovation / construction, the fitness center was not available as advertised and there was no warning or notice to that fact before reserving rooms. The hotel staff was nice enough to point out that they had an agreement with a Holiday Inn Express to use their exercise room. They even had a shuttle that would take you there. Upon arriving at the HIE, I was rudely directed by HIE staff to the worst excuse of a fitness room I have ever seen. Two treadmills that were not only in bad shape but in need of repair (one would not raise for an incline and the other needed the tread waxed, even the machine told me so.) Ugh.Twice during my stay at the Embassy Suites I attempted to take a nap. Good freaking luck. The construction noise defeated me both times. Unacceptable.Also, due to the contruction, more than half of the parking lot was unavailable. But you can be darn sure that the contractors' trucks were parked nice and close to the front door.Positives: Clean Room, free breakfast was pretty decent.When I arrived at Airport called for the scuttle and desk clerk told me 15 minutes, well ended waiting 55 minutes for the airport scuttle and no one even cared at the front desk, Requested non smoking room and was told that mine room was non smoking - hmm room stinks , green stripped wallpaper and pink shower tile - Hello Disco days..... There are far better hotels at better price near the airport then this place. I won't stay here next visit.The hotel Manager personally called to apologize and let me know they are working on updating the hotel by Q4,2013 so please try again. I will up them one star, and hope things get better.First time we stayed here it took 2 hours to get into our room because of a 'house keeping' miscommunication. No problem, manager gave us a free night on the house for our next visit. Fast forward 4 months and I call to make a reservation using my gift voucher only to be told there were no rooms available. I call a second time and mention nothing about the voucher and have no problem making a reservation. I show up at the hotel and am given a room with no heat.45 min of engineers coming and going doesn't solve the problem. We get upgraded to available 'governors' suite. Sounds nice until we enter a room that reels so heavily of smoke I could only conclude some sort of illegal gambling operation must have just cleared out. No problem, the manager moves us to another room, this one has heat and decent smelling air. So I settle in. Getting ready to take a shower I see that the shower curtain is host to a large and prosperous colony of gelatin like mold. This will be the last time we stay here, even if they offered me a free night.I wouldn't stay here again... Why, you ask?  Because even though this Embassy Suites has the typical managers reception (Beer/Wine happy hour) as well as cooked to order breakfast, those benefits did not weigh out how out dated this property was.  I have to say that the staff was very friendly and helpful, but even that couldn't overcome the dilapidated condition of the property...If I were just to see the interior of the room and guess what hotel it was, I'd guess Motel 6 or Super 8.  I saw the other reviews on this property before I stayed here, but I didn't believe it was that bad...I was defintely wrong.  There are plenty of other hotels in the area, I wouldn't recommend this one until they did a major remodel.I was in Nashville for work and this location worked well for my colleagues.  It's not a favorite hotel but there are good points:-location-accommodating staff-shuttle from the airport-drinks and appetizers during the managers evening event-friendly bar feel  -with a lot of locals - in the hotel-extensive breakfast buffet - standard with the embassy propertiesI did not love the rooms, but it was fine for a night.  Not a bad hotel by any means.I tried... and tried to hit that third star on this review.  I tried equally as hard to keep the two stars!  But... I am keeping the two stars because the staff here is really very nice and friendly!  However, this place (as you can see from all the other reviews) is SO DATED.  In fact, when I walked into the room, I took a picture with my Iphone and sent it to a friend and told them I was staying in the Brady Bunch's guest room!  Honestly... Hilton should shut this place down and give it a face lift like no other.  I'm no Rookie either.  I'm a Diamond member of Hilton and have stayed at a number of Embassy Suites.  The rooms in this place need help.I want to give this hotel 3.5 stars.I took off 1 star for location and another for a slight stench that comes with having smoking rooms (something we are no longer familiar with in North Carolina).However, if you are doing business in the massive business park that surrounds this hotel, you'd be foolish to stay elsewhere.  Not only is the price right on the money - but the features of this hotel are excellent.Free shuttle with Hayden - Excellent.Breakfast in the lobby - Delicious.Manager's Reception with free cocktails - Obviously Awesome.The ""Limo"" we got with Rene - Horrible &amp; Overpriced.The pool is great, hot tub is bubbling, and the workout room is a bit tight.The rooms are very comfortable, I love the separation in space you get with a two room suite.  The beds were definitely upgraded as well, very comfortable and large.Most importantly the staff is awesome and handled everything for us quite quickly even though the hotel was packed for a holiday weekend.Next time I'm in Nashvegas I'll probably look for something downtown, but I would have no problem staying at this hotel again and again.Just my two cents.I've stayed at a number of Embassy Suites properties.  This one had all of the typical features: cooked to order breakfast (reminded me of being back in college), managers reception(excellent), open lobby and two room suites.  The staff was great.  This property is in need of renovation.  We had a difficult time working in the room because of the lack of electrical outlets.  The internet also seemed to get slower as you went on the higher floors.The fitness room and pool were in excellent condition.A hotel room is no longer a place to sleep, it has become a satellite office.  Because of this, I'm not able to give this hotel a better rating.Awful, old and outdated. It feels as if the rooms were taken from the set of Mayberry!!! In addition, the customer service is abominable. Television service isn't working and the carpets throughout are filthy. These things are in addition to maze one must travel to get around the hotel due to construction. Finally, the type of room I reserved was unavailable. This place is awful ---pink bathroom tiles, granny furniture, moldy fridge and all.It was nice that I was able to check in at 11:30PM. I booked the room as I left Saturday morning with friends. They live some 2 hours away, so we were going to go for lunch and head back to drop them off. I was going to return Saturday night to stay over and catch my flight out of BNA Sunday. The desk clerk seemed inattentive and distracted and was impersonal. It was somewhat a unpleasant surprise to see him the next morning to check out. I went to give him my key and he received it, but just stood there. No ""thank you"" or ""was everything okay"". Aside from the customer service opportunity that Embassy presented with me, the room was fine; bed was comfy, towels soft, and room clean. Two stars for customer service experience.I must concur with the reviews here.  We arrived and and had the linens replaced because they looked wrinkled and used.  Avoid this hotel at a all costs.  The other Embassy on Broadway is a lot better.  There is no contest.Embassy suites is a great step up for minimum cost when you travel for a week long trip.  This location is a little hard to find, but it is close to the Airport and the business I need to get done while in Nashville.  Staff was very nice when I had a late check in.  The two room suites are nice to spread out.  Free breakfast (Full) and managers happy hour is good after a long day of meetings.",,,"['first', 'time', 'staying', 'embassy', 'suites', 'regularly', 'properties', 'saw', 'location', 'near',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/omni-nashville-hotel-nashville-3,Omni Nashville Hotel,4.0,$$$,151,"The Omni is one of several major conference hotels in Nashville. You can't beat the location or the access to ""music city"" the country music hall of fame is across the street and the museum actual is attached in the rear.  The back walkway houses the famous country music poster makers with a museum and display of the classic old opry and other acts.  Nashville is music bars and food. No shortage of any of that!  The lobby bar has some great entertainment and great food.  Bbq (pulled pork sandwich) also quite tasty! Reasonably priced and casual dress. There is a more expensive steak restaurant (Bob's) I have tried it yet. Too much cheap street food and bbq joints nearby too even wanna steakhouse meal   My room is a corner suite. Very nicely appointed with great views. Pretty good service all around. If you are on a business trip or want a high end Nashville hotel I will always choose Omni over other chains.The pancakes and waffles are great for breakfast in the restaurant or room service.Omni Hotels are the only hotels I try to stay at. I have always had great experiences at their hotels across the country. The Omni Nashville is a very nice hotel, and located right in the heart of Downtown Nashville. The room was really nice, upgraded amenities, beautiful pool and gym. From the standpoint of amenities, its a great choice for a stay in Nashville.The reason I am giving them a 3 star, is because of the sub-par customer service. From the check-in with the front desk, to any requests we had while there, the staff handled them more as a task and nuisance than as a guest service. For the premium price paid to stay at a 4-Star hotel with a nice room, good location, room service etc there are plenty of options... But the customer service is why I always chose Omni. For me, the Omni Nashville really lacked in this department. Maybe because we were there over Christmas and the employees were not happy to be working the holiday... I am not sure. Any call to guest services was handled by what seemed to be a very annoyed female that seemed to be inconvenienced by the phone ringing. Getting an additional pillow, or hair dryer took alot of time, and I ended up apologizing for making the request because of how it was handled by the employee on the phone. Asking for bottles of water at check-in, which as a SelectGuest member are supposed to be complimentary, were out of the question, but I was instructed that I could go buy some from Room Service or the gift shop.Dont get me wrong though. There wasnt anything incredibly bad about our time there, but there was definitely nothing exceptional either, which actually was very surprising with the track record I have had with the hotel chain. I will continue to patronize Omni at other locations, but next time I go to Nashville, Ill probably look at other options where my hotel stay doesnt feel like an inconvenience.So THIS is the place to stay in Downtown Nashville. But be willing to fork over a little extra $$$. In my opinion, totally worth it. I was in town for a long weekend with girlfriends for the Taylor Swift concert at Bridgestone area (which is a stones throw away). The location is centrally located which was our main reason for picking this hotel. We had to drive a few times but , overall, you could go a whole weekend and stay Downtown and find plenty to do. Just bring some comfy shoes.There were a few little hiccups. The main issue was that when going to our room , we opened the door to find a room that was NOT cleaned and looked like someone had just checked out. The bed wasn't made and there were pillows all over the floor. Gross, gross, gross and not what a group of gals want to see on their first night in Nashville. Not sure why that happened  but the person at the front desk assigned us to a new room (after many, MANY apologies) and comped WIFI(normally a fee) for us our entire stay . Worked for us.  Our newly assigned room was super spacious for 4 gals to share and the bathroom was rather roomy and not cramped in the slightest bit. One of the cool things about the hotel are all the amenities within walking distance. The hotel is its own playground. There's a Southern style restaurant, Kitchen Notes, right off the lobby. Their bar is open late so that you can order drinks and then venture to one of the cozy areas in the lobby to hang out, gossip and peoplewatch.   Bongo Java coffee is also downstairs to get your coffee fix in the morning. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Hatch Print Gallery are attached to the hotel as well as several gift shops with souveniers and items you forgot to pack!  We also took advantage of the fancy on site day spa, Mokara, which I highly recommend making appointments for months in advance.  There's also a pool and fitness center which is a given.   Valet service is provided and they charge per day (with in and out priviledges) . Only thing I think that doesn't make sense is their big , ornate front entry with the heavy doors. While they are gorgeous, I don't think it makes sense to have when there isn't a regular doorperson and arriving guests have to open the heavy doors while dragging in their luggage. Also, on a bright note, one of my friends misplaced her necklace. She checked with housekeeping and lost and found throughout our stay. Thankfully, someone had found it and turned it in. The hotel handled but they had security oversee and confirm delivery of item, probably more for liability purposes.So, for the most part, we had an exceptional experience. But 1 star knocked off for the first room we were assigned to upon check in. That is a complete NO NO for a hotel of this caliber and a bad first impression. Thankfully, our stay ended on a high note.I most often stay at Marriott's or their derivatives when I travel.  This was an attractive hotel with attentive, friendly staff.  There was a day when our room was not cleaned and on the other days the cleaning was substandard.  This needs to be fixed and if so another star would certainly be warranted.  I was especially enamored with the rooftop bar which will be rated separately but suffice it to say that this is a great amenity offered by this hotel.  Hotel rooms had city views!  The hotel was a pleasant walk away from the convention center allowing escape at the end of the day, nice venues to stop at along the way and convenient access in the mornings.  Plenty of restaurants, coffee shops ... within walking he hotel is also close enough to the Vanderbilt campus to enjoy University amenities and sample nightlife and music unique to Nashville.  Many nice venues near by for music,  all of very high quality!4 night stay. Modern yet inviting.  I love the lobby fireplace and seating area. Clean room, clean bathroom, clean closet, clean furniture. The bed had nice comfy pillows, however the mattress was wayyyy to soft for my liking. I loved the view from the large window. Other than the mattress the room was quite comfortable. The hotel restaurant offers a delicious breakfast, order from the menu or buffet but it is quite pricey.  Hotel staff as well as restaurant staff were friendly and efficient.  A relatively short walk to Broadway. Overall I had a great stay but some will find it's too expensive others will think it's worth it.Beautiful hotel and pool. Enjoyed my stay there very much. And the fried green tomatoes in the restaurant were a delight.My wife and I came for our anniversary and let me tell you... By far the best Hotel experience I've had! It started with the valet being super polite and had outstanding customer service. We check in and they told us they had gave us a free upgrade. Come to find out we go to the 18th floor and walked into our room. They upgraded us to a king suite!!!! The room was AMAZING! Huge living room, huge bathroom with a tub, 2 toilets haha, and the list goes on. I will be saying with Omni in the future, they earned my business for life!Loved this Hotel in the heart of Music City.  Was here for NHL All Stars. Central to all the All Star activities. Beautiful hotel with great restaurants. Kitchen Notes Restaurant  was great for breakfast &amp; brunch. Lovely Southern feel.  Barlines was the house bar with nightly country music. Mexican restaurant with outside eating is where we snacked on tortillas &amp; guacamole &amp; listened to country music.   Country Music Hall of Fame is part of the hotel.  Just walk down hall &amp; U are there.  Mostly friendly staff.  We had a ball Y'All !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We stayed here during our stay in Nashville. We wanted a place to stay that was close to everything and boy is it! The Omni hit the mark on everything from cleanliness, vibe, service, amenities, atmosphere, view, convenience and location, location, location! We had an incredible view that stunned us every morning and every night, just gorgeous! Our room was very comfortable, functional, and modern with above average amenities.  The hotel overall had amazing music themed decor and a fun vibe. Honestly, I can't say enough positive things about this hotel. We loved our stay here and plan to stay here on our next visit to Nashville.The Omni Nashville is gorgeous, the lobby has high ceilings and a beautiful chandelier, it also has a swanky library-like waiting room that is kinda cool to meet in or hang out in.The location is great if you are going to honky Tonks but also great if you want to have a nice place to return to after those Honky Tonks. The food offerings in the hotel are great, there is a steak house, a bar called Barlines, fresh-farm to fork style restaurant, coffee shop and attached to a museum which has a great taco shop called Taco Sexto or something like that.The rooms are great, the beds are very comfortable and allow you to sleep well.Become an Omni Select member, you get free wifi and a free hot beverage delivered to your door every morning.Also, the customer service is great, i tend to have many many questions and I called the front desk multiple times and they answered all my questions and were always friendly and accommodating.I noticed a Retreat to Romance package on the hotel website, which i thought sounded perfect for my fiance and I! I booked everything online through the hotels direct website and was very excited. When I went back to look at confirmation e-mail I noticed that there was no sign of the package I thought I was getting, which said it's not supposed to expire until December 30, 2016. I called to hotel to inquire about that and was first set up with someone very rude who basically said, ""that isn't even something we offer. Do you want to keep the reservation or not?"" So I called back again to speak to a different person, just because I want to know what I'm paying for. I spoke to a woman whose name I think was Michelle and she was very, nice, calm and helpful. I don't think she worked at the actual Nashville location, as she put me on hold to ""call their front desk and ask about this."" She said that the Nashville's location isn't offering this package currently but i could pay for a bottle of wine to be in the room upon delivery. I e-mailed the hotel customer service before any of these phone calls to see about my reservation and I didn't get a single response. I'm thoroughly disappointed in the customer service I received. If it's not something that they're offering any longer, then it should not be on the website and definitely shouldn't let me click and book it with a confirmation number at the end. I'm not even sure I want to keep my reservation after the horrible service I received from the first woman.Wow, what a beautiful new hotel in Nashville.  I normally stay at another chain, but The Omni was booked as part of a meeting and I was pumped that I was able to check it out.First class valet service and a beautiful spacious lobby.  They have a few shops throughout the hotel too as well as a couple of restaurants one being what looked like an upscale steakhouse.  Honestly, I wish I had another night there to properly explore the entire property.  My room was a very nice size and of course modern. I don't get any extra benefits at the Omni and my room was quite nice.The exercise room is the best I have ever seen at a hotel. A really big space with plenty of cardio machines, free weights, weight machines, kettle balls, etc....trust me everything you would need.  They also have a very nice outside pool so bring your swimsuit....This is the tale of two hotels  - or desk help. It was the best of rooms, it was the worst of rooms. I was coming to a conference and arrived with 22 of my people. The woman orchestrating it was seriously dialed in. I arrived late after everyone only to discover that they didn't have a room. Due to the ice storms in the area, no availability until the next day. Seriously? 21 other people set up correctly, I was missed, there's an epic ice storm, and no availability? The woman at the counter was super nice and said she would check with her manager. Came back several minutes later and had a room! Last one and would put me into it. I thought, 1st floor or disabled guest room. I arrived and it was the exec suite. Holy cow it was nice. I felt like I was in the movies it was so epic.Stayed a week, told everyone how I got super upgraded. Then when I checked out I almost wanted to throw up. They charged me top rate for an exec suite. I'm like, this will get me fired! No way the new person said, I'll knock $100 off. Like it was already 7x my companies policy rate. Imagine how that went over as I tried to explain to my COO. With 21 people, I'd have told someone to share a room if I had known that. Counter person #1 led me to believe I was being upgraded. Had I known, I may have even switched later in the week.I still feel gouged. Check your rate if you ever get switched rooms is the moral of the story. And my sign in didn't have a rate! Make sure it's there.Tale of two hotels - or hostesses. Great room. wonderful place. nice people. Stayed for weather. Over charged like a maniac.Very nice, beautiful and modern hotel.  3 restaurants and a bar on location.  Great food for room service!  Free wifi!  All around a great place and great experience.Rooms are beautifully appointed, very classy and elegant - the fiance was impressed. Too bad I didn't get a chance to really utilize the room because I was attending my conference at the very convenient Convention Center right across the street.The front desk and staff were organized and helpful as well as the print center which allowed for complimentary printing of our boarding passes and tickets. Though we didn't use the gym, it was clean and provided towels and headphones. There are restaurants attached, some small shops, many conference rooms and room key activated elevators. Bottled water and wifi was also complimentary in the rooms.The one thing this place is really missing is breakfast. They do not have a complimentary breakfast that would be the cherry on top of this beautiful place.Overall, I would stay here again as it is convenient to everything! A 7 minute walk to the main strip with bars, food and shops, close to the Bridgestone Area, a stop on one of the hop on/off bus tours and only 15 minutes from the airport. We had a nice short, but very nice stay here!Be very careful of the Omni special offer solicitations. I booked a special weekend get away for my wife and I only to find out the package that I thought I had booked was never offered at my location anyhow. I got all the way through the booking process with a confirmation number without knowing I wasn't booking the package that I had selected.  I literally could've shown up with my wife thinking I had booked a special package only to find out I hadn't booked anything but a standard room. I brought it to the attention of management and they were dismissive at best!  Poor customer service!For OMNI's 100th review I must say this hotel is GRAND!!!  This OMNI is sexier than the OMNI DTLA, not bad for my first impression of Nashville Downtown.  I had the pleasure of staying at the OMNI for a business conference so I decided to fly in on Sunday and get settled in before a week of meetings and to explore!  Whoa, just WOW, from the minute my taxi dropped me off, I was greeted by the most pleasant professional bellman (why can't Californians be this polite)? must be a TN thang? The entrance is just marvelous, ample seating throughout,  exquisite chandeliers that are eye catching and how can I forget...you're instantly greeted by the sound of Tennessee country and rock music faintly playing in the background. Check-in was also a very pleasant and speedy experience!  Professional. I went up to my room and continued to be WOW'd by all the charmed detail! Fun artwork, large desk, one hell of a fluffy king tufted bed, pantry with a mini fridge, bottled waters (join their specialty program, sign up online to take advantage of the free perks) a large sexy bathroom with a beautiful walk in shower with glass doors from floor to ceiling, average vanity products (though I ended up donating my products at my conference to a charity project) so I can't speak to the quality. Excellent views of downtown from the 15th floor.  Luxurious robes and slippersExcellent location, walking distance from Broadway, and believe it or not we walked all around town in 35-40 degree weather.  Yep, that's right this Cali gal survived the cold.I tried all of their restaurants since this was home for the week.  Barlines - 4 stars This place was loads of fun (great for pre and post cocktails) excellent space for networking after the conference, live acts playing, some knocked it out of the park and others well lets just say they should keep their day jobs. Nonetheless, entertaining after a glass or two.  Mainly bar type food.  Their pulled pork sandwich was a solid three stars.  Insane whiskey list and decent beer and wine lists.  Great friendly service.Kitchen Notes - 5 stars(review to follow)ORDER THE BRUNCH BUFFET !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $19.99 Likely one of the best hotel breakfast/brunches I've had in a while, again great customer service, sexy decor and DELICIOUS food.  Nuff said.  Bongo Java Coffee Shop - met all my coffee and tea needs! 4 stars Bob's Steak &amp; Chop House - review to follow  solid 3.5 starsThe hotel is very big, inside is a super cool poster shop called Hatch and a few large gift shops you're sure to find something to meet all your needs.  I fell in love with their mason jar shot glass and guitar magnets!  Nearby the convention center, The Grand Ole Opry and did I mention it's connected to the Country Music Hall of Fame and...the Broadway strip? :) score!So with all the above praise you're probably scratching your head on why the four stars? Well,  I'm your stickler traveler that inspects her room before I even begin to unpack. Yep I pull back all the bedding, inspect the bathrooms, closets etc.  I found my bedding to be stained on both the comforter and sheets and noticed my toilet bowl was not cleaned, if you know what I mean. I immediately contacted the front desk and they rectified  my situation promptly and professionally.  I was offered complimentary wine and cheese plate (pretty standard at hotels when they have a mishap) to which I gracefully accepted.My overall experience was a very good one, including my experience at the conference which was also held on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the OMNI.  We were provided breakfast and lunch on most days and the food and service were just great!  I would definitely return to this OMNI when in Nashville!Attended a conference here, didn't sleep here (rooms were booked). Although the front doors present a grand appearance, they are heavy and quite cumbersome. I don't know how anyone with a suitcase could manage, and many I witnessed could not.  There were valets to help with the first set but you're on your own for the second set. Place was clean and restrooms were kept clean even with the many conference attendees descending on them at breaks. Unbelievably, there was not courtesy coffee &amp; tea in the lobby - something my hotel (across the street) provided. In general, room arrangement for the conference was convoluted and not very well planned out. Based on this experience I would not choose to stay here.Oh Omni, how I wish all hotels were like you. We arrived early Saturday morning and we're able to check in right away. The room was beautiful and had big windows, but the view was not so great. The bathroom was big and has a box shower, toilet, single sink, a lot of counter space and a magnifying mirror. The room had a king bed and a couch. It was decorated very well.Concierge: we spoke with Lauren and Ryan and both were SO helpful. They each gave us so many great recommendations about Nashville and also got us tickets to the Opry for that night. Convenience: there is a car at the hotel which will take you anywhere in the city that's within a 3 mile radius. Our drivers were Joe and Jason and were also so nice and helpful giving us some ideas of where to go and what to do. You just go down to the concierge desk to request the car or you can call a number which they give you upon check in. Within the hotel there is a bar (Barlines) which is very good - I have a review for that place - a cool poster shop called Hatch, 2 restaurants (one steakhouse and the other we went to for breakfast but I'm pretty sure they have lunch and dinner there too), a little food shop and the country music hall of fame. The hotel is very big and open and all the staff we spoke with was very nice and welcoming.First time here at the Omni.  We are on the 21st floor.  What a view!  Beds are comfy.  Showers are nice - with all the products you need for shampoo, etc.  The only minus is their shuttle staff isn't too friendly compared to everyone else.  I would definitely come back!  Oh I forgot to mention the gorgeous library with a large gas fireplace- so comfortable!","This hotel is supposed to be one of the nicest ones around and you would think for the price we paid it would be. But alas no. There was food under the bed. The sheets and bedding was dirty. And one of the days there was even blood on one of the sheets. The shower liner had mildew on the bottom. When brought to the attention of the housekeeper supervision the issues were fixed. But in my opinion when you spend 200+$ a night there should NEVER be an issue. When we check out tomorrow we will let management know about the issues and see what happens. I will update laterThis is a beautiful new hotel in downtown Nashville with one of the only outdoor pools in town. It's a pricey date though, and we had some service issues that I wouldn't expect at that price point. We paid to stream Amazon prime and it cut in and out - when we called for service we got an apology, but no help or reimbursement. Same story on a disgusting housekeeping oversight. The spa is great and the pool is very nice, but I'd wait to visit again after some competition opens and they have to get the service a little tighter, or drop the price.I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to Nashville, and stay at the Omni, for the 2015 Anytime Fitness conference. It was beautiful, we got an incredible suite, and everything was so clean!!Rotten. 1. Thermostats are Motion sensored without an override. So every night you wake up at 3am drenched in sweat from a 10 degree increase in your room temp. If you set it at its lowest setting (65) it doesn't get past 68 no matter what. 2. Fridge in room didn't work. Coldest setting had new milk spoiled within a day. 3. Room didn't get cleaned daily. 4. Despite reservation request no crib in room at check in. Took a couple of hours to get one. Absolutely nothing worth writing home about. Won't stay here again-image tainted for Omni overall.Beautiful hotel,  great staff!   The team is always smiling and eager to assist with any needs.  Will definitely keep this hotel on the list for my return to Nashville!This hotel ranks in our top 2 faves in Nashville. We stayed several days before our children joined us for Thanksgiving in the city unexpectedly. The staff is not only professional, but they all seemed truly interested in making our stay fabulous. They handled a last minute room change to accommodate 4 more with ease and offered excellent recommendations on area events &amp; dining. In room dining was always prompt and the food was above average at a minimum. The hotel restaurants are both top notch, but, the chai at the hotel's coffee shop was probably the worst I've ever had, ever. But, I digress. Kitchen Notes' Thanksgiving brunch was so phenomenal that I'm reconsidering our yearly traditions to accommodate coming back again and again. The suite we stayed in had amazing views from the 15th floor. The beds and bathrooms were both above par for the area. All in all, the room, the front desk and bell staff delivered WOW. Which is exactly what we look for when finding our ""go-to"" spots when we travel. Omni is now written in permanent marker at the top of our Nashville list.In all fairness, I have to add the couple of downsides I found: 1. Valet seemed to be very unorganized and dirty at times, with trash cans overflowing, etc. It's unfortunate that they are the first and last impression of the hotel because they really didn't match the level of service or presentation found once we walked through the doors. 2. The business center is completely sketchy and I felt like I was breaking and entering when I had to print business docs off after 6pm during our stay. Once inside, the system was so complicated to even access the internet, that I ended up leaving early the next morning and stopping by another hotel to get my work finished. I have 2 college degrees and even the front desk couldn't walk me through the computer home screen. That's just overkill. Minor details, but really disappointing because the hotel has all the right things to be THE best!First off everyone is very professional and accommodating.  Valet, Bellman, Check in Staff all top notch.  The hotel has great views of the city line and is very convenient to Bridgestone.  I found the room to be ample and modern and served our needs.  I have eaten at all of the restaurants and you cant go wrong and they meet all price ranges.  The notes buffet is a good way to start your day!While you pay more, the extras are there and the hotel is still fairly new.  Remember to join their specialty program to take advantage of their benefits!!I am very disappointed with the Omni Hotel! I'm writing this review because I really wanted to get a job working at the Omni. After calling and calling leaving a few messages for the HR Department, I still did not hear anything! My application and resume was very professional and impressive! I applied for the Spa Attendant position and have worked at many spas and salons in my past work history. I have 10 years of customer service experience along with 8 years in retail/sales! I would of been perfect for this position. So, finally I emailed them pretty much begging or an interview, they emailed me back and we set up a phone interview! They never called so I called the HR Department making sure I wasn't supposed to call them instead! I never heard back from them! I am disgusted with how unprofessional they are! I will never go back to the hotel.As a Nashville local, I typically don't stay in hotels here. However, my Wife and I decided to stay there last night and eat at Bobs for dinner. Awesome room! Extremely helpful staff. This will be a regular thing for us. Free wi-fi would be a nice touch.For my first ever visit to Nashville, I could not have asked for a better place to stay!  The hotel itself is gorgeous!  High ceilings, beautiful warm colors and dramatic light fixtures.  The staff is friendly and warm and and access to everything is a breeze.  The Bongo Java coffee shop is great!  the coffee is not your run of the mill stuff and the staff is super cute!  Kitchen Notes is a wonderful dining option as well.  The serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and the space is gorgeous, bright and chic and the food is deelish!  Their unlimited biscuit bar is worth a visit.  Aside from the lobby and restaurants, the rooms are beautiful.  Mine was on the 21st floor and had the most amazing view of Nashville. There was cool art on the wall, cozy robes in the closet and good lighting in the bathroom.  Room service was reasonable and quick and all the electrical outlets and USB ports were super helpful while working an charging up. The location is pretty fantastic and a quick walk from SoBro and Broadway.  It is across from the Bridgestone Arena and the Country Music Hall of Fame (which is also worth a visit)Overall a great property and I look forward to staying here again soon!Celebrating 15 year anniversary in Nashville and so glad we selected to stay at the Omni. We were upgraded to a suite and how sweet it was. The view of Nashville from our room was wonderful and so close to much of what should be seen in downtown.The Omni is a beautiful hotel in downtown Nashville. It's a very short walk to downtown and most tourist attractions. The hotel staff is VERY friendly. On multiple occasions the women cleaning the other hotel rooms would step out and say hello to me. They have late night room service and I ordered a pizza one evening that wasn't too bad (I don't expect much from room service at 3am). I LOVED the bath/shower. Great water pressure! The shampoo and conditioner were really nice too. The lotion has a great scent!My only complaint about the Omni is the television. There are very limited stations to choose from and many of them were not working on my TV. You can purchase movies to watch but it was $12+ even for indie films. Usually I'll bring my Amazon Fire TV or HDMI cable to watch movies and listen to music in my hotel room but Omni is sneaky and doesn't give you the ability to change the input on the TV. So, if you have children who will need to be entertained or want to spend a lot of time relaxing in the comfy hotel bed, this place is not ideal.Beautiful hotel. Great staff. Every need taken care of. What else can I say !Can't wait to visit again.I am a HUGE Omni fan. I stay at an Omni whenever I can. This Omni just doesn't have that ""Omni"" luxurious and catered to feel about it. It is just missing that ""thing"" most Omni's have. The Omni is an excellent location and beautiful hotel. I felt like my only option was to valet park. I think there is self parking but it's not very close to the hotel. I didn't like that. I would rather have easy access to my vehicle. Concierge was rude and she came off as talking down to me. When I asked a simple question she acted like I was an idiot. The room was nice and clean. The bed was not as comfortable as I would have expected at this price point. The excellent location is what interested me in the Omni. I will definitely go back to the Nashville hotel I usually stay with (Loews Vanderbilt)on my next trip. It's worth the Uber ride. The Omni would be a close second to Loews Vanderbilt.Whoa!Where did this come from? In fact, where did all this Downtown exuberance come from? You'll have to forgive me: I've been gone for a long while. Things don't look as familiar as I'd thought. When I first heard that I was staying in a hotel in Downtown and I couldn't place the cross streets, I prepared myself for some polite 'mhms' and judging -- even though I knew it was an Omni. I couldn't have been more wrong.This is an Omni from top to bottom. It's just... grand. The exterior of the building creates excitement. There's so much hustle and bustle and the black onyx exterior is just crazy sexy. Walking in, you have no choice but to be overwhelmed (in a good way). The lobby is cavernous. The chandeliers are impressive. The seating is ample. And, THERE'S PINK LEMONADE AT THE READY! Done. Done. I was satisfied from that moment. You had me at 'hello.'Check-in was a breeze and my agent was chatty and kind. Good impressions. I went up to my room and... yes. This was the life I was meant for. My Deluxe King Suite fit me like a glove. The room had multiple defined areas making the 'suite' designation accurate. I was charmed with the ornate bureau, fun (and thoughtful) artwork, solid wood desk, overstuffed bed, butler pantry, luxe robes, vanity products, and sinfully-wonderful bathroom. I would have been happy spending all my time in the hotel and room. Loved it.So, with all this praise... 4 stars? Yes. Unfortunately, there was an incident at the hotel. During my trip, I got my hands on a custom pint glass. I collect pint glasses. I drink lots of beer. I love my pint glasses. I left my glass on my desk near my datebook and satchel. I came back to my room... and the pint glass wasn't there. Was it stolen? Thrown away? I called the front desk... and received indifference. They, eventually, forwarded me to housekeeping... who never returned my repeated calls. In the grand scheme of things... it's a pint glass. But the experience did dull some of the exuberance I had up until then. Come here and enjoy... but keep your items packed/hidden/in a safe?I just attended and worked at an event held at the Omni Hotel. Everything was top notch, first class and outstanding. The staff were helpful, courteous and professional. The food was great the bar service excellent. If you have an event or a function the Omni is the place to go.Nashville has needed a hotel like this for a long, long time.  In general, I have usually stayed close to Vanderbilt and taken a car to downtown if I needed.  The Omni gives me a reason to stay downtown again.  The hotel is great on its own, but the location and proximity to Broadway, the new convention center, etc sure doesn't hurt.  The rooms are nice, well appointed, and decent sized.  Many of the views are great.  The pool during the summer is supposed to be some sort of 'scene', but I looked and only found some people that were in dire need of some rays working on taking corrective action.  That being said, it is a nice pool.  Gym isn't bad at all.  I've been in the suites and they are big and perfect for a group HQ if you are having a fun weekend in town. The staff from the front desk on is great.  I say from the front desk on because I think the valet, bellmen, and doorman situation is something I would expect at a Holiday Inn Express.  Total confusion in the front and not much hustle.  And this was on a Wednesday afternoon.  I basically had to walk inside and grab a bellman to help out my wife....because, for some reason, despite the fact that SHE WAS WEARING A WEDDING GOWN and was getting out of a black car, no one asked her if she needed any help.  Really poor.  I'm not sure what the doorman situation really is, but I have rarely seen that post manned by anyone willing to open a door.  (I have, however, seen a few doorman looking people standing in the lobby talking amongst themselves).  Again, easy to fix, but at this level, it shouldn't have to be fixed, it should just be there, you know?  But, I'm not going to let that take away from the review.  Every time I have been here, the front desk staff has been warm and accommodating when asked.  All the facilities are still nice, shiny, and new.  All this comes at a price, and it seems that the Omni is kind of pushing Nashville rates to a new level, but if anyone can get it, they should be able to.I was here for a conference and was blown away by the facilities. Honestly, I live in Nashville and had never been to this hotel before (didn't really even know where it was, exactly). Everything you see, touch, and smell are super high quality. It's trendy  and comfortable without being too modern (Hotel Indigo), too stuffy, or too overbearing. This a great spot in downtown Nashville.Bonus points: They have a Bongo Java on the first floor. Bongo Java=Great coffee.NASHVILLE, TN: The Nashville Omni is the premiere property in Nashville and is a delight.  The hotel is large and spacious, the rooms are clean and modern, but with some ""NashVegas"" decor in them.  It pumps appropriate music all day and night in the lobby to get you in the Nashville mood.  The service is good and the location is stellar, right downtown next to the best eating and nightlife.Very nice hotel. Front desk staff and concierge staff were very helpful. The room was always cleaned at a high level. Our folio was emailed to us when we woke up on our check out day. Bar Lines was a great scene with good food, drinks and live entertainment!!! Breakfast buffet was yummy with tons of choices. I would have given them a 5 star review but we went for a convention and the catering/convention department left a lot to be desired:(","Beautiful hotel in a great location. Directly across from Music City Center and walkable to most attractions. Attached to the Hall of Fame. Fun shops (Hatch Printing and Five and Ten). Nice food and beverage choices at Barlines and Kitchen Notes. Nice quiet fireplace area. Friendly staff. The only downside is pretty bad housekeeping service. Left the room at 7:30 AM one day, back at 5, room not cleaned. Another day, bed made, all wrinkled, towels eschew in bathroom, and used barware in the room.Finally, nice roof pool with attentive staff.Stayed here with my wife for two nights. Very nice hotel. Although, I reserved a room with a King bed, I was put into a room with two double beds. The valet was very helpful and nice. It is $30/day for valet parking. The gentleman who assisted us with the luggage was an excellent representative for the hotel.   The first morning the housekeeping crew came through and was a little pushy with my wife in regards to cleaning the bathroom even though she was using it. They set the used coffee cups and a glass outside the door on the floor in the hallway.  These items stayed in the hall all day long. The shower was great. It had plenty of pressure and we were on the 16th floor.  Being that high, afforded us a wonderful view of the city.  We overlooked the Music City Center.Almost everything you'd expect from a five star hotel...*Friendly valet and reception? check.*Spacious lobby and comfortable rooms? check.*Adequate fitness room and pool? check.*Bathroom amenities and robes? check.*Convenient location? check.This hotel is brand new, modern and beautifully furnished... it's clean also.  The one thing missing was a mini bar in the room, which is not a necessity, but nice to have.  They do have several restaurants on-site, but I didn't get a chance to check them out during my two-night stay.  There is something else a bit off, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  Regardless, I had a very pleasant stay here during Yelp's Spring Break and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel or stay here again in the future.  Whether traveling for work or pleasure, you can't go wrong at the Omni Hotel in Nashville!While the Omni isn't terrible, it is incredibly expensive for what you get and I can't imagine coming back.If you have a car, the parking options are bad and overpriced-valet or overnight parking. Despite calling ahead for the car to be ready early the next morning, the valets did not have any records and we were left waiting for 10+ minutes. There's absolutely no vending machines inside; if you want a snack or soda late at night, you're out of luck. Make sure to sign up for the Rewards program to get free wireless internet.Last-check out the Country Music Hall of Fame exhibits tucked behind the elevators. You'll find some cool costumes and the Hatch Show Print Shop.I can't think of one thing I didn't like about my stay at the Omni Hotel, aside from the raucous guests who were partying loudly on night one in the room across the hall from mine (they were kicked out of the hotel, from what I later heard). Okay I lied. There was one slight snafu at check-in, though it was quickly rectified. The woman I checked-in with said my reservation had been cancelled. I assured her that I had not cancelled my reservation as I was there for a work trip. She was able to get me into a room and no further problems were experienced. (I have a feeling the cancellation probably happened when I called a few weeks before the trip to inquire about something to do with my room, though at no point did I say that I wanted to cancel my reservation.) The guest room was large and had everything I needed. I love when the nightstands have outlets built right in - so convenient! The room and bathroom were spacious and very clean. I felt very comfortable staying there for the three nights I was in town.My colleague and I took advantage of the UPS business center and transactions were seamless. I also hit the coffee shop on several occasions which was solid. Finally, the gift shop had a really vast selection of necessities, which was great because it didn't seem like there were any pharmacies nearby.  The location of this hotel really can't be beat. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!Omni Hotels aren't typically my first choice, but it's definitely the place to stay in Nashville. Between Yelp's Spring Break, 3 weddings and (what seemed like) a zillion bachelor/bachelorette parties this was a happening place last weekend.It's a very large hotel with a grand looking lobby. My room was modern, spacious and clean. My view wasn't anything special, but then again Nashville isn't known for it's scenery.I did make use of their massive gym, which has every piece of equipment you could need to get in a good workout. I also spotted a nice outdoor swimming pool. Note to self: bring a bathing suit next time.Unfortunately, I had to cut my trip to Nashville a day short due to an emergency back home. They couldn't have been more accommodating at the front desk and didn't charge me for the night I skipped.Overall, it was a very pleasant stay and they'd be one of the first hotels I'd look into for future visits to Nashville.Stayed at the Omni Downtown Nashville for Yelp Spring Break! Although I didn't get the special Yelp rate, I did book through a deal website and got a similar discount. I believe it was about 230 a night. I stayed in a double room with 4 girls total. At first I was a bit horrified that 4 girls would be sharing a bathroom and living space. However, the Omni really stepped it up a notch by letting us use the spa facilities to ""freshen up"" before and after our check in/out. I couldn't believe it! The spa welcomed us with open arms and we got to use their mirrors, lotion, hairspray, sinks and showers. How very accommodating!  Also, the lobby offered us free bottles of water. When we had a mix up and asked for the free water sent to our room and they sent fancy bottled water for $$, they apologized and let us have the fancy water for free! So nice. We had also requested some champagne flutes and forks sent up because we were celebrating a birthday and had cake and champagne. Another amazing freebie was the Omni personal driver. Too bad we found out about it a bit too late, but we loved our driver Justin. They will take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius of the hotel FO FREE. The pool area is seriously awesome. The hottub can easily fit 20 people and I just love the cabanas and how they are first come first served, unlike dumb Vegas hotels where you have to pay for 'em. Loved the gym too with free water and headphones!All in all, I felt the Omni went above and beyond my expectations for a hotel. I definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Nashville and will hopefully stay here again next time.This hotel had everything we expected and needed. Ample free parking, room was clean and spacious, coffee available in the lobby, friendly staff. We stayed here the night before my friend wedding. Great value for the money.Hotel - beautiful, large, welcoming, comfortable and very clean. The grand entrance had a welcoming committee to greet and open the very heavy large doors, ample seating, a separate conciergeleft of the front desk, a 'library' area which was private enough to read the newspaper quietly or just relax, a car service to bring you anywhere, places to eat, drink, shop and tour. A great location with the Country Music Hall of Fame and Hatch Print Gallery attached to the hotel along with gift shops, coffee shops (Dunkin Donuts next door) a delicious steakhouse (make reservations), lots of shopping, tours and restaurants in walking distance around the main street, Broadway. Each room has a nice work area in front of the large windows and a small refrigerator (so bring your own water). Don't expect a tub in these rooms, stall shower with adequate pressure is what you'll find here. The TV is great, however be prepared to pay for wi-fi. Parking - valet or self park in the building next door. We opted for self park and always found a spot on the ground floor. It's a short walk to the hotel, so be prepared to walk about 1 city block. Staff - very friendly and extremely resourceful!  I wish I could list all of their names, but everyone was professional, knowledgable, friendly, extremely helpful and knew the in's and out's of the city!  I had 2 days by myself in May 2015 while my husband was at a conference and was set up to go on a bunch of tours, 2 of which kept me in the hotel and then I walked to the  Ryman, Johnny Cash museum, Goo Goo's Chocolates and Betty's Boot Shop which are worth mentioning as they were fun things to do alone prior to meeting back up with my husband and driving to the Bluebird Cafe (be prepared and purchase your tickets 2 weeks in advance on-line).  Housekeeping was fantastic and a daily tip didn't seem enough for keeping our room in such perfect order. They even folded my clothes which I had quickly tossed on the bed as we were running late for a show. Southern hospitality rocks!Would recommend this OMNI for the location, staff, comfort (the bed was so comfortable for a hotel, as we were in 6 hotels over the course of 3 weeks and this was the most comfortable), and services. You get what you pay for and it's worth every dollar spent!I was here with 25,000 strong for the 2015 Beachbody Summit, and nothing about this hotel was disappointing. The staff were all very friendly and the rooms were extremely nice and well-kept. There were 4 of us sharing most rooms, and I was in the same boat with two females, one being pregnant, and her husband....needless to say, we weren't always the tidiest being on the go and needing multiple showers after workouts galore, not to mention that comfort was a necessity. This place always had our room turned down and cleaned up daily, our towels changed out and you would never have been able to tell we were a group of smelly, sweaty fitness buffs!! We enjoyed an amazing breakfast buffet every day and even lunch and a few cocktails in the hotel restaurant, as well as room service. The seminars and workouts that were held in the Omni were comfortable and easy to get to. I was sad I didn't get a room booked in time for next year, but the fact that it's sold out within 20-minutes is telling that we all didn't hate the stay!!Great location, clean and modern.  We had a blast in Nashville for the weekend and loved the Omni.  They have a nice rooftop pool, perfect for bachelors and bachelorette stop relax during the day.  Next time I'm in Nashville I know where to stay.The hotel to stay in Nashville is the Omni hotel!My friend and I were treated like queens from the time we arrived for Yelp Spring Break until we checked out a few days later. Our room on the 12th floor was beautiful, clean, the beds were some of the most comfortable I've slept in and massaging shower. I actually felt like I had a back massage after getting out of the shower each day. The hotel is right in the middle of all of the action with the Country Music Hall of Fame, Hatch Show Prints right in the complex. All of their team were extremely friendly, helpful from arriving at valet, check in, staff taking bags to our room, the cleaning staff - perfect stay all around.When I return to Nashville there's only one place to stay The Omni Hotel!Love this hotel! The staff is incredibly helpful &amp; friendly. Large rooms &amp; comfy beds! The pool area is pretty cool-has a lounge deck &amp; pool bar area. The restaurants &amp; museums are great!We stayed here in the month of June on a random weekend getaway. You have the option to valet , but keep in mind you can use the overnight parking a street over which is 18 bucks a day ..We used lots of room service , my fave cocktail was the "" bees knees"" . And the beds are super comfy.. We didn't need to get back in our cars the entire weekend , we walked to the local restaurants and bars .  The internet service is very slow so I used their wifi which is 10 dollars a day added to your bill.. NoteMy only concern was the Sunday before our departure we went to the restaurant for brunch . I ordered 1 mimosa and it was 50 bucks . Didn't know that until I got ready to leave. I'm assuming I bought a champagne bottle for that rate so my server should've asked if I needed my glass refilled . Other than that all in all my stay was okBEST HOTEL IN NASHVILLE!And here's the pointers: -Rooftop Pool with Bar. Probably the best in the downtown area with plenty of space to relax, swim, and lay in the hot tub. -Complimentary coffee every morning for each person in the coffee shop. You get a card and have to fill out what you want and you can bring the card with you the next day. -Complimentary shuttle with the nicest drivers within 3 miles and all you have to do is call the number on the card or go to the lobby. They will pick you and give you an estimated time of how long it may take. Depending on the time and day, it can be anywhere from 10-30 minutes or no wait time! They will even take you from one place to another in Nashville. -The museum tour begins at the hotel and everything is walking distance. I would stay here again and no place else. OMNI is perfect!Beautiful hotel, great staff, amazing food! Best hotel in Nashville,  and it's close by attractions.  If your looking to relax (like myself) you can do that here. The staff goes put of there way to make you comfortable.Hotel is amazing. The service in the restaurant is despicable. They need a serious management adjustment- especially with Katie. They are losing a ton of business because of who they employ. We came down from NYC to stay at the Omni and our experience was ruined because of Katie and her staff. She should be fired immediately. Her horrible judgement and disgusting attitude is a poor representation of the hotel and customer service in general. Wouldn't return because of that staff.Don't get a room on the bar side of the hotel.Our room was wonderful, with great views.The service was OK.But, really the noise rom the bar was excessive and lasted until after 2 AM!.We called several times, but they couldn't do anything (Its their bar!)We were very unhappy and tired.We will not stay here again until they can fix their own noise issue.The hotel overall was very nice and the room was also good. The location also made it very easy to get to the multiple areas for nightlife and was walking distance. We would stay here again if we traveled back to Nashville.I always love this hotel and this trip is no exception.The shuttle is great - you can get just about anywhere in the city that you need to be quickly.  But the location is such that, at least for most attractions and dining, it is a gentle walk.If you don't have a club card, get one.  They will press clothes, shine shoes and deliver free coffee/water/paper at no cost.  It probably helps with the upgrade when you request on at the desk as well.For this trip I am a flier, but parking is available at the hefty price one could expect.The staff is lovely and very warm.","Very conflicted with this review. Yes, nice hotel, nice staff, good location.But,Don't nickle and dime me for WiFi.Do a better job of answering the Valet phone. And this place is a little noisy...as in you hear people walking and talking in the hallway while you are trying to sleep.But, I really like their bar - ""Barlines"" which is a combo singer/songwriter stage, dance floor, and sports bar.Yes, I will gladly stay there again...just wish a few of the very minor items were taken care of.The good, the bad, and the ugly.This new beautiful hotel has all the little touches that make your stay that much more enjoyable. Lots of towels in your bathroom, and they aren't wimpy small towels either. Outlets all over the room, even one inches away from your pillow. There is no mini bar in your room but they have a mini bar menu you can order from and they bring it up to you, and the prices aren't crazy high...$2 soda.The Internet costs $14.95 a day for premium to have faster Internet, otherwise I think it's $10 a day. I think it should be free, since I'm paying $179 a night.The one thing that is absolutely driving me nuts right now at 6:30am (after my first night here I'm still on PDT so really it feels like 4:30) is you can hear everything going on outside your window! I'm on the 19th floor (out of 21) and hear loud trucks, the train, and now construction!!! MY STAY WAS JUST ABOUT PERFECT UNTIL I CANT EVEN SLEEP IN! this is probably why I'm giving it three stars otherwise it would be a four. And four because they don't have a shuttle to and from the airport.Great location nice rooms. They could get some scented candles going... Some weird smells in the hallways. But otherwise. Nice.We had a great stay at the Omni, and it's a gorgeous facility. A few highlights:- We arrived early (9 AM) on day of check-in and they gave us a room anyway. Plus, it was a corner room with a great view.- When they were late with our morning beverage (definitely sign up for the Select Guest program), they sent up a full carafe with a tray of treats and a handwritten apology note.- The desk provided numerous supplies, sewing kits, etc. when needed and were super quick.- The location is phenomenal--walkable to anywhere, attached to the CMHOF.- The coffee shop is an actual, good, hip coffee shop.The negatives:- It's pricey, but you do get what you pay for.- The tax is surprisingly high ($40 per night on our room).Great place to stay in Nashville, especially for a special occasion. I'd love to go back.Beautiful hotel with plenty to keep you entertained. The sports bar can be a bit loud as they broadcast from there periodically.. but the band later was spot on.  Good food and drink selection.  They also have a nice bourbon/whisky selectionThis review is for the lobby, the restaurants and the ballrooms. I was recently in Nashville for a conference and some of my team stayed at the Omni. Our team dined here every morning for breakfast at the Kitchen Notes restaurant inside the hotel. Kitchen Notes makes me think of sophisticated country when it comes to decor. There's a very airy at-home feeling to the place. Each morning we sat at a large table for all 10 of us and ate the breakfast buffet. Every day we were there there was fresh fruit, oatmeal, Chobani Greek yogurts, three different types of biscuits made from scratch (buttermilk, sundried tomato and lemon poppyseed), gravy to go with the biscuits or butter and different types of scratch made jams, muffins (gluten-free as well), scrambled eggs plain or scrambled eggs with meat and veggies, sausage and bacon. AND, a pan cake. Not a pancake. A CAKE of PAN. It was like a circular 9-in cake that was a pancake. It was cut into triangles slices, like a normal cake. It was so moist and yummy! I highly recommend that cake of pan-ness. The service was great as well. We had large kettles of coffee, orange juice and water scattered around the table. Condiments were brought to you by request. Free creamer was delivered to our table every morning for our coffee. Empty plates were promptly removed. Everyone was amicable and happy to help. The hotel lobby is big. It reminds me of a Vegas hotel lobby. There's a small area that looks like a gentlemen's club with deep leather seating, bookshelves lining the walls and a long fireplace. Comfortable seating everywhere as well. The entire lobby area was kept very clean. The staff were more than happy to answer questions or point you in the right direction. They also have a coffee bar, a fancy steakhouse and a bar/grill. I had the opportunity to go into their Barlines bar and taste a really funky Long Island IT. I don't think the bartender knew what she was doing, but the entire place was packed to capacity and she was really busy. The first night it rained there and the hotel staff had to create a ferry system to shuttle attendees to and from the Omni to the Music City Center. Employees took umbrellas and walked people from the Omni across the street to the MCC and back. It was really nice since they didn't have enough umbrellas and ponchos to give to the thousands of people there.I got to attend a reception on one of their ballrooms one evening. At first I thought the ballrooms were on ground level, but they were one floor up. There's an interactive maps near the check-in counter that pointed me in the right direction. The food at the reception was very tasty. There was a mash potato bar, where you scoop mash potatoes into a martini glass and put toppings on it such as corn, cheese, bacon, brisket and even shrimp! I didn't think the flavors would mesh that well, but they did. There was also lighter fare offered like fruits and cheeses. The food was constantly being replenished and dirty plates were constantly being removed. I can't attest to the quality of the rooms, unfortunately, but I highly recommend eating here or hosting an event.Amazing business conference hotel perfectly laid out with exceptional restaurants, shops and located close to all the action.  Service is exceptional and my wife and I would jump at the opportunity to come back.  Well done Omni owners and staff!Wow, I'm not even sure where to start.  My brand new husband and I were passing through Nashville on the way home to Kansas City and decided to splurge a little and stay at the Omni.  We originally booked a premier king room online about 2 hours before we arrived that day.  Before we even get out of the car, the valet greeted us with such enthusiasm and eagerness to assist.  We go inside of their beautiful and majestic lobby to check in and were greeted by the clerk.  My husband decided to let her know that we were on our honeymoon and see what we could do for a possible upgrade.  She hit a couple of keys and presto, 10 seconds later she said we were upgraded for no additional charge.And wow did she upgrade us.  We were upgraded to a King Suite Executive room on the 15th floor with a beautiful view of downtown Nashville.  We felt like absolute royalty.  This room has 2 bathrooms, shower and tub, double vanity.  2 huge flatscreen TVs, a sitting area, a beautiful bar and an amazing closet. After we had our bags put in our room by the kindest bellhop ever we decided to check out the Country Music Hall of Fame.  We didn't even have to step outside since the Omni is connected to the Hall of Fame entrance.  After about an hour and a half we come back into our hotel room to be greeted by a bottle of champagne on ice, 2 champagne glasses along with a card congratulating us from the front desk staff.  I can assure you, even if we were not upgraded, this hotel is worth every penny.  I cannot rave enough about the helpful and accommodating staff.  We didn't walk past one staff member that didn't smile and make us feel welcome.  Thank you so much Omni for making us feel special.PS-free wifi when you join their free loyalty program!Omni Nashville has created a wannabe Omni loyalist. You know how it normally goes...you find the adorable boutique hotel, but no gym. The conveniently located downtown high-rise with a view, but no full length mirror. The spot with a cozy bed and solid wifi, but no late-night room service. I kept waiting for the ""but"" from the Omni - it just doesn't exist. No detail was forgotten when building this expansive and centrally located lap of luxury. From the second you arrive, everyone with an Omni name tag makes it their mission to take care of you. From the head concierge guy (I really wish I had gotten his name!) who got me an immediate ride via the complimentary car service, to the doormen with a sense of humor mixed with just the right touch of professional (shout out to Rich), to Cory at the coffee shop who learned my name and my order after one visit, there was not one bad seed. It's evidence that this passionate culture trickles down from corporate and sticks with their employees (who they must take good care of considering their Pollyanna attitudes.)The gym is a definite plus compared to other hotels. It's practically the size of some stand-alone gyms with ample machines, clean sweat towels, cold water, yoga mats - the works. And, oh, the pool. I spent a solid two hours one morning soaking up the sun and the buzz of Downtown Nashville. It's resort-like. One snafu - I wanted to order breakfast at the pool on my last day so the bartender directed me to the phone ordering station with an in-room dining menu and a sign reading ""Please dial 0 for food orders."" That 0 took me straight to nowhere. To be exact, it took me to quite the sassy operator who put me on hold twice just to ultimately tell me that I needed to go back up to my room on the 18th floor to order room service or wait 50 minutes for poolside delivery. So, I ate breakfast elsewhere. It sounds super picky, but when a hotel works it's way into the upper echelon of my heart, a bitter ending can kind of bum me out. I know I could've said something to a manager/concierge and they would've absolutely righted the wrong, because they had a proven track record throughout my stay, this was just an isolated incident. That teeny mar aside, I will stay in this hotel again and again on repeat trips to Nashville. To me, there's no reason to stay anywhere else. I'm already talking my girlfriend out of having her bachelorette party in New Orleans, just so we can stay in this hotel, and experience Nashville, of course. I understand there's a price tag associated with service like this, and for the Omni's efforts to ensure their guests are happy, I will always be happy to pay that premiumThis hotel was great!!! Close to all the action, friendly , and clean. Would stay here again !Feels very Hard Rock Hotel -- love the feel, great vibe, clean -- awesome options -- great location -- Excellent addition to Nashville --!Excellent excellent hotel.Best lobby I've seen in some time.Too many things to review. Everything about The OMNI is Class Act.Would definitely recommend when staying in Nashville.If you're main purpose in visiting Nashville is to go to the Country Music Hall of Fame, then you must stay here.  The hotel is attached to the Hall and offers you the shortest walk, all indoors to the museum.  In between are a few shops and you can go to as well.Customer service really impressed me.  Very happy overall.  Great location.  Can't really think of anything that wasn't perfect.  Would love to come back!  Highly recommend.I stayed at the Omni in July while attending a conference. This hotel has a fantastic location directly across the street from the Music City Center. I thought I had been told that the two were connected, however, and I couldn't find any skyway nor did anyone I know find one--so be sure to check weather and take an umbrella just in case.The rooms are very nice and comfortable. I stayed in a queen suite, which had a desk (useful since I was there for work), chaise, and the bed was really comfortable. I don't drink coffee or tea, but there was a coffee pot ready and waiting to serve. I did have room service one night, and it was really quite good, with some good things on their menu.Omni has a loyalty program that you can join and one of the perks is their morning beverage service. That starts immediately, on your first visit, so I took advantage and had a glass of orange juice delivered to my room each morning. The other real plus to the loyalty program is free wifi in the hotel room--that alone is worth joining their program prior to your visit. I believe that without membership, you can use free wifi in the lobby, but you would have to pay for it to have access in the room. Even if I never visit an Omni again--quite possible, since I don't generally stay in hotels this expensive--I'm glad I thought to join before I got there so I could avail myself of those fantastic benefits.The Omni gets major points for having lots of outlets! For some reason there are hotels--and I mean even newer ones, like the Aria where I stayed last year--that have hardly any outlets or put them in weird or hard to reach places. Omni had two outlets built into the desk and the bedside table, too. Thanks, Omni! I was able to keep my iPhone and iPad fully charged and didn't have to keep them halfway across the room.This hotel is also connected to Hatch Show Print and the Country Music Hall of Fame. I didn't visit the CMHF, but stopped into Hatch Show Print; if I had done the tour of one or both of these, it's nice that it was so super convenient. There are also two restaurants in the hotel, Kitchen Notes and Barlines, and both were pretty good. Plus, Barlines has live music!Miscommunication about crucial information on part of the Omni staff. Was degraded and insulted multiple times by the Director of Front Offices when I expressed my concern about policies not being provided prior to booking, particularly when I called in advance for that information. We felt so uncomfortable my husband and I decided to cancel the remainder of the reservation and stay elsewhere. The Director coldly informed us he will be charging us for that evening; we had checked in 3 hours before. It really gave a sour start to our Christmas vacation (the next day was Christmas Eve). It truly was the most disappointing hospitality experience I have EVER had.Excellent location, beautiful pool. I loved my room. The shower was gorgeous and spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. I'd definitely recommend staying here if you have to be in Nashville on business or for a conference.When I entered the doors of the Omni on 5th, I felt as though I was whisked away.  It is magnificent.  It is exquisite.  It is unlike any other space Nashville has to offer.  The sleek lines, the smooth marble, beautiful fixtures all add to an amazing space - and that's just the lobby!  I loved the items hanging on the walls that spotlighted both country music and its stars.  I loved the feel and vibe of this place.  I so want to go when I have a better opportunity to explore.  I have a feeling I could walk around all day and still be missing so very much that it has to offer.  This is the kind of place that even I, as a local, would love to stay to be near the heartbeat of Nashville.  If the rooms are as visually striking as the main floor space, visitors are in for a treat.  I look forward to visiting again and again and seeing more of this enchanting edifice.This is truly a hotel designed with the traveler in mind. I could not find fault with anything about the room, the bed, service, etc. Even wireless access, that Achilles heel of every hotel on the planet, always connected quickly and ran like a rocket. Can't remember the last time I had that experience. The elevators are even great, and the close proximity to the new Convention Center makes this a terrific place to stay for a major convention which was exactly the purpose of my trip. Effortless and a pleasing stay, exactly what I want when traveling on business!Great room.  Loved the shower. Convenient to downtown music and restaurants. Yummy breakfast buffet.  Van Morrison tribute band at Barlines.  Would definitely come back.","SURPRISE TAX!Now that I've got your attention, I recently stayed at this hotel and definitely enjoyed my stay, the hotel is beautiful and the staff is friendly- even the house keepers!! The beds are wonderful and the pillows almost made it home in my suitcase.The only downside, I know a lot of people talk about the cost of the hotel, and yes it is more expensive than others but it is really beautiful and you don't have to wait for an elevator (they are split by groups to avoid long waits) however, after spending 300$ a night to book the room, when you go to check in you also get a nice little addition of $50 a night for tax. I get that tax is necessary but that then makes it 350$ a night instead of 300$! Ouch! But you get what you pay for. I'd still stay here again!Luxury: I have been to Nashville many times and stayed at 5 different hotels downtown. This is by far the most upscale. It is almost out of place in Nashville. I've stayed at a couple other Omni hotels and this blows them out of the water.Location: A couple blocks from Broadway, exactly where you want to be. Price: Honestly it is pricey for Nashville, but you get what you pay for. We lucked out and stayed in a room block for a friend's wedding.  Food: You are better off leaving the hotel. You are Nashville... what are you doing eating a the hotel? This didn't affect the rating; expensive drinks and food at any hotel is expected. Pool Bar: Awesome. This alone is reason enough to stay here. One negative is the bartenders are slow. There is always a line of people waiting to get drinks (which are pricey $6-7 a beer!). They need to be better staffed during peak hours. Honestly it wasn't even the crowd, it was just extremely slow bartending. 10 people online for 20 minutes with 2 bartenders...Gym: I work out everywhere I go. This gym has pretty much everything you would need while on travel. Recommend this hotel. I will be back.PS The most confusing elevator system on the planet. Some elevators only reach certain floors. If you have stayed there you know what I am talking about.Bring your pocketbook!The Hotel   This is a very fancy high end hotel and expect to see really nice cars in the valet parking and people wearing expensive suits. You have to use your room key to go anywhere like the elevator, pool, fitness center, and your room so you know this is a secure place. Pool is on the 4th floor, A hot tub that seats probably 20 people, many nice lounging chairs, and a pool to swim laps (Not to play in). There are 2 restaurants inside both higher end. Expect to find very nice fitness equipment that is very new and well maintained. Internet is $15 a day but just sign up for there Free perk rewards and you get a free internet and free beverages in the morning. here is other perks i just cant remember, check the website) Also given you are right in the downtown area, it is safe to walk around during the day/night.  --Location--Right next to the country music hall of fame3 Blocks from the Ryman auditorium2 Block from the Bridgestone Arena (NHL hockey arena)5 Blocks to the Tennessee Free Museum (Its Worth It)6 Blocks from the capitalI recently stayed here during a business conference and was very impressed by the Omni! Check-in was a breeze and the lady at the front desk was very courteous to upgrade me to a higher floor in a corner room at my request. They were out of city-facing rooms, which have the best view, and although I overlooked some construction sites, I did have a nice view of the river and Vanderbuilt University in the distance. As others have mentioned, there are two sets of elevators to separate service to the higher versus lower floors. I don't understand why this is so confusing as the elevators are clearly marked and the front desk managers clearly point this out to you upon check-in; it's not different from any other large hotel set-up. My corner room had two full walls of floor-to-ceiling windows to take in the full view of the surrounding area and take in the beautiful glow from the city lights. My room and bathroom were immaculate and I did not notice any weird smells that others reported anywhere in the hallway (although I was on one of the top floors, which have nicer rooms). My favorite things about the room were: 1) the amazingly comfortable beds (they have different pillow options, too); and 2) lots of easily-accessible power outlets (no having to unplug lamps and move furniture around). The only negative to my stay was the beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows would crack loudly from temperature changes, so if you're a light sleeper you might want to get ear plugs from the front desk.The hotel itself was conveniently situated across from the Music City Center (where my conference was held) and right next to the Bridgestone Arena and Country Music Hall of Fame. The main drag of honky-tonks and bars, as well as the symphony house and Ryman Auditorium were within 2-3 blocks and an easy walk.There are several in-house restaurants, including a steakhouse, coffee shop/cafe, bar/grill and casual restaurant. The steakhouse was very pricey, so I didn't go, but I did get coffee and a small bite at the Bongo coffee shop several times and had drinks and late-night appetizers at Barlines several times, as well. I heard from others that the Kitchen Notes casual restaurant was not good. The coffee at Bongo was always well-crafted by the baristas (if not a little slowly, since they pay great attention to their foam art) and the drinks and foods at Barlines were strong and delicious, accompanied by lively bands each night. During the weekend we did have terrible service at Barlines just because they were so busy, but other than that no complaints. There's also a convenience/souvenir store called the Five and Tenn that sells pricey souvenirs and clothing, as well as various toiletries and electronic gadget accessories in the event you leave something at home.The lobby itself is beautiful, with stone floors, stone-covered walls, large lighting pieces and a small collection of country music artifacts.This hotel is incredibly expensive if you don't get a group rate, but I felt the costs would be worth it if you really wanted a nice place to stay after a night on the town in Nashville.TIP: Register for the Omni Select Guest rewards program (which is FREE) to get free WiFi during your stay and better room upgrades and additional freebies. Also request a room on a higher floor as a lot of late-night noise comes off the streets of downtown.I had to attend a corporate function there today. WTF, who builds a hotel of this scope with no damn parking garage? I had to use a lot across from the CHF, which charge in increments of 1, 2 or 6 hours. So, I ended up having to walk back to the lot and ended up spending $30 for parking. I wouldn't stay at this hotel if the damn room was free.I was very excited to stay at this hotel for a business trip to Nashville. It's a new hotel and is located in the heart of downtown. From day one, I was extremely impressed by the great customer service here. Everyone is extremely friendly, courteous, and helpful. When I checked in, I was super early and my room wasn't ready yet. The front desk took my cell number and texted me as soon as the room was ready, which wasn't long at all (and I had time to go explore the Country Music Hall of Fame while I was waiting, which is connected to the hotel).The hotel itself is gorgeous: very modern yet inviting. It's also huge: almost like a big Las Vegas hotel on the Strip. There are several dining options and a couple of stores in the hotel. The rooms are quite spacious, well-equipped, with lots of amenities (little mouthwashes and shower gels!). I requested a quiet room, and I was placed on one of the top floors, which was pretty quiet and had a beautiful view of the city skyline. The bed was comfy, as were the pillows, although I wish they offered slightly firmer pillow options as well as the squishier ones. A couple of weird things: first, the rooms have central air which is individually controlled by each guest. That part is great. But the central air is LOUD. Every time it kicks on, it sounds like a scary monster is coming to eat you. It took a while to get used to and made falling asleep a challenge. Second, the doors and walls of the rooms seem a bit on the thin side. Even though I had a quiet room in the sense that it's located in a less-trafficked area, I could still hear a lot through the walls and doors. I feel like other hotels have sturdier doors and walls. Finally, there is an occasional odd smell throughout the hallways, and I smelled it in the bathroom at one point, too. Other reviewers have pointed it out. It almost smells like...dry dog food. Very strange. I tried not to think about it: again, it was only there occasionally. And, the WiFi works great, when it actually works. I had to reconfigure the WiFi on my devices at least eight times per day, which is a huge pain, especially when you are paying $10 per day for the service. There were also some concerns about cleanliness. On the day I checked in, my hotel room bathroom had, ahem, multiple pubic hairs on the floor, along with a large footprint on the floor. I also had a towel with big gray marks on it. I called the front desk and alerted them to the issue, and my bathroom was cleaned properly thereafter, but the experience left a sour taste in my mouth. Cleanliness is probably the most important thing about a hotel, and if my room has issues, what else about the hotel has issues, you know? I later found a dirty mark on the bedspread as well. There shouldn't be any dirty marks on things. This is a four-star hotel, and it charges $200+ a night, minimum. There are no excuses. Would I stay here again? I probably would. But I'd be sure to mention these issues to the hotel before I made my reservation. It's a new hotel and hopefully they are still working out the kinks. It really is a beautiful facility, and aside from the cleanliness issues, I really enjoyed my stay here.Great hotel.  The staff were very friendly and my room was super clean and comfortable.  Everything seemed new and updated.  I stayed here for a conference that was across at the Music City Center - so this was super convienient.The parking situation is my only compliant.  As a woman traveling alone, the self-parking at the Music City Center was not a great option.  It was ""a block away"" as they say - but that was a huge block...where you then have to go into a nearly deserted garage.   Kind of creepy.  I moved my car after a few hours.  Since it was only about $10 more, I moved to valet.   I was quoted by many that it was $30, and only found out upon checkout that they add tax to the valet.  Lame.Overall nice stay....and it was cool that the Hatch Show Print was in the side of the building inside the lobby.The absolute best way to experience Nash-Vegas! Convenient walk to the Bridgestone arena and lots to do within walking distance. Also convenient enough to broad street. The concierge is 5 star and they will hook you with free stuff. All you have to do is ask. If you need a ride somewhere they've got you covered. It's first come first serve and they'll even pick you just make sure you know what time is the latest they offer it. But if it's busy expect a wait. No worries though, just call a cab. It definitely makes for the best experience when visiting Nashville.The location is in a  rough neighborhood. The hotel is gorgeous.  Service is  excellent.  The rooms were beautiful but very small.   Unfortunately I could hear  all sound outside my room . The restaurants in the hotel were very good . The staff were very friendly.  The food at the meeting rooms were not very goodI loved the Omni my husband &amp; I stayed here for a weekend stay in nashville. We wanted to stay downtown &amp; close to the stadium. We drove down and stayed in bowling green, ky on the way to make it cheaper to be able to afford a place like the Omni... Be forewarned if you need coke, etc use the vending machine not the convince store or take it with you! We pulled up at 4:30 for check-in on a Saturday and with a short quick line were checked in and in our room by 5:00. We chose to use the bellboy and he was helpful, friendly, and helped us get all our belongings to the room without any trouble. They cleaned our room while we were out and about on Sunday and it was much appreciated and everything was clean and tidy! Including the bar glasses we brought from home. The bed was comfy and the sheets were soft! I told my husband I can't think of any other place I would want to stay while in Nashville.5 Stars in every way!Make no mistake, you are going to pay for this hotel.  But once you get past the sticker shock and really think about what you're paying for, luxury, exceptional service, location, and convenience, makes this hotel worth every penny!The rooms are swanky with a capital S!  Completely modern and super comfortable (think soft mattress, plush pillows, and giant bath towels).  The service was exceptional.  The hotel check-in was technically 4pm, and we were staying here during one of the busiest weekends in Nashville (NCAA Women's Final Four).   A couple days before our stay I received an email detailing the online check-in process, and proceeded to do so.  It made our stay that much better!  Even though check in was at 4pm, I indicated during online check in that we would be arriving at 2pm.  Given that the hotel was 100% booked, I didn't expect anything, but our room was ready and waiting for us when we arrived 2 hours early!  Not only that, but you don't have to wait in line when you check in online.  Your room key is ready and waiting for you.  Talk about amazingly convenient!The doorman remembered us as we came in and out of the hotel, telling us to enjoy our show on our way out for the evening, which really impressed me considering we found out the hotel was actually over-booked!  The location is prime, within walking distance of everything.Thank you to the entire Omni team for making my fiance and I feel like royalty during our Staycation!Best hotel in Nashville! Rooms well-appointed. Very quiet. Comfy beds. Very friendly and helpful staff. Walking distance to Broadway , honky tonk central, arena and convention center. Excellent bar with live music on site. Great coffee shop for breakfast. An awesome gift shop with real gifts you'd actually want to bring home to friends and family. Bonus of Hatch Show Print being on site too - an even better funky gift stop.My first time in Nashville, and I am here for a business conference. I have attended over 15 conferences with the company I work for, and this is the first time that a hotel has run out of the ""block"" of rooms reserved at the conference attendee rate. In addition, this is THE FIRST TIME I have arrived at the designated conference hotel, only to wait 2 hours for my room to be ready. This, DESPITE the fact that I took the hotel up on their email offer to check in the day before I arrived. I have not even gotten to my room yet, and I am totally turned off.October 2013. Comfy bed and room. Nice pillows, stylish but not overdone decorating.Great view from our particular room on the 15th floor. Quiet. New. Potential to be very nice after recent-opening tweaking. A pleasant walk to convention center and great location to main shops roads/restaurants.Irritating parking/unloading where they didn't want you to use their luggage carts yourself (so we were told) and where there's no cheaper parking on-site, just valet, they said. (Not a lot of luggage carts either.) Line of cars arriving spilling out onto street, where we were waiting in line close to the intersection.Not very good cell reception (didn't pay for their wifi but could create personal hotspot which was still unreliable and often slow.) In-room TV had some channels with poor reception. Room keys also for use in elevator readers not reliable, and they put instructions in the actual elevators during our stay, whereas no one told us how to use them when we first arrived. Opened room door more quickly. We were told they got a bad batch of cards.Found ice room several doors away from elevator area after hunting when told by staff it was next to the elevator. Fitness room has great view and acceptable equipment, no real mention of it easily found in the literature in-room. Pool appeared to have possible handicap lift (saw through window.) Of 2 glasses in room near ice bucket, one visibly dirty. Open package of cotton swabs in bathroom with one swab gone. Running toilet fixed, within hours of reporting it, while we we out. Wire-type shower holder didn't hold their small bottles or some other things well. Toilet paper holder a little far back for my stiff back. Nice magnifying mirror mounted in bathroom. Bathroom lights didn't seem very bright, and the switches seemed backwards to me, where the first one should turn on the lights at the sink, not in the shower area?Starbucks there had great coffee and fast service. Did not eat in hotel.Last night of conference not correctly charged conference rate on bill but fixed at front desk in person before leaving.We had the best experience at the OMNI in Nashville! The hotel was grand &amp; luxurious and the staff was so friendly and accommodating! The only downside was on our last day.. housekeeping knocked on our door at 9am until I finally got up and asked her to come back later as we were still asleep. (I travel often and haven't had this happen before.) Make sure to keep the sign on the outside of the door. Aside from that there are 3 restaurants within the hotel (all delicious) as well as a coffee shop! And you're within walking distance to everything in the city!! Highly recommend to anyone! This should be the ONLY hotel you stay at if you can get a reservation!!!!My wife and I stayed there due to an event we were having in the hotel. The room was fantastic. Super clean and very comfortable bed and pillows. The views were spectacular and the hotel staff was super friendly and attentive. The restaurants in the hotel are also quite good. Kitchen Notes has a wonderful Sunday brunch special, bottomless mimosas for $5! Would recommend this as a great place to stay if you are looking for a classy and elegant place to stay.Rooms switched. We were confirmed in June 2013 before this hotel was finished being built for two queen beds. Received my confirmation on April 9th for the queen beds and I am sitting in a room with a king bed and a roll away. I said this isn't right at all and then they asked if I wanted to cancel my reservation. Really? After I am already here?They took the experience I wanted for my family away. The Hilton is just as close and BETTER SERVICE I am sure.Well, OMNI, just when I thought you couldn't do any better, you've really outdone yourself here. With a hotel brand that's already among the elite in my book, OMNI Nashville, you just may be the grandest of them all.1) Dear sweet loyalty ambassador Lauren Oliver:You are the best, kindest, sweetest, most diligent, and most enthusiastic loyalty ambassador I have come across among a group of already wonderful loyalty ambassadors at OMNI. First you so generously greet me with a BEAUTIFUL King Luxury suite upgrade that was just fantastic for a most perfect weekend getaway. Then you welcome me some more with some wine and great assortment of complimentary cheeses-- a perfect way to unwind after a travel day. Then you set-up a splendid GHA discovery local experience at the Smith House along with a hop-on-hop-off tour of the city. It was a most marvelous evening of history, fun, and fine dining for my friend and I.  Then you continue with the kind emails on restaurant suggestions and music venues while explaining each option with great detail and enthusiasm and proceed to make reservations for almost every meal and entertainment item on our agenda. Finally you just continue to smile and represent the true essence of extraordinary customer service that really sets the OMNI brand apart from all the others. You made my stay extraordinary. It was the most perfect stay at the most perfect time.2) Dear stunning lobby: Well you are just beautiful. Thank you for the visual pleasure every time I walked back ""home""3) Dear Mr Chauffeur: You are awesome!Ma'am would you like to be escorted in an escalade wherever you'd like to go within a 3 mile radius of the hotel?Why yes I would!!How much will that cost me?Why nothing of course! We here at OMNI rent Escalades from Enterprise just to escort our guests around for free4) Dear Dining Services:Thank you for my most enjoyable morning beverage to greet me dailyand for the free red bulls (as a black level guest) to keep me awake and alert to enjoy a jam-packed weekend5) Dear Housekeeping:Thank you for the free pressings, to make sure I was looking sharp in Music City and for the most comfortable, impeccably clean haven to get heavenly sleep6) Dear OMNI Staff:Thank you for the smiles. All friendly. Always welcoming. Clearly you all come from the same school of, let's be amazing and extraordinary to our customers so they can accept no other. You've really made it impossible for me to stay at any other brand. And when I do venture off because I have no choice in that particular city... you keep me running back in appreciation of your exceptional standard of service.7) Dear Bank account:I know I made a dent in you from this trip. But I think you would agree that it was worth every single penny.Brand new hotel in the heart of downtown Nashville. Five star all the way. Rooms are top notch, staff was very helpful and friendly, and the food was excellent as well. If you're looking for a hotel in Nashville, this is it! The only word of caution I can give you is be mindful of parking and consolidate vehicles if part of a larger party. There are not many parking options in the area and the hotel charges a steep $30 daily valet fee. Great stay; highly recommended.The credit card I left on file was charged for more than 1,000$ of unauthorized expenses. Stay at your own peril.","['omni', 'several', 'major', 'conference', 'hotels', 'beat', 'location', 'access', 'music', 'city', 'country', 'music', 'hall', 'fame', 'across', 'street', 'museum',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/renaissance-nashville-hotel-nashville,Renaissance Nashville Hotel,3.5,$$$,167,"An overall wonderful experience from top to bottom with this place.  Every person I encountered on the staff was warm and friendly - from the valets, front desk, room service, bartender, restaurant staff, Starbucks crew, and housekeeping. Wonderful people! And you can't beat the location for downtown entertainment. AND an in-house Starbucks!The Room - Immaculate.  The rooms are updated with a great modern look that is crisp but comfortable. The overall look from the hallways to the rooms was very impressive. The linens had a great light clean smell and felt wonderful, and the beds were amazingly comfortable, so much so that it was tempting to stay put. There are lots of well thought out touches with charging stations and convenient outlets for all your tech needs. Aveda products in the bath!?! Awesome!  Simple small coffee maker in the room was stashed in the entertainment center with everything you need for a quick cup of coffee or tea in the room.  I wish I had a room in my house like this place!Room Service - I've never had nor had heard of Nashville Hot Chicken until the Uber driver taking me to the hotel mentioned I had to try it while in town. I wasn't sure I was actually going to get to a restaurant that had it while on my trip, but the hotel had it on their menu so I gave it shot. I am a big fan of spicy food.  This was CRAZY hot. I couldn't finish it, as it was too spicy for me and left some serious afterburn in the back of my mouth and my tongue was swollen.  It still had some nice flavor, but if you aren't into spicy, or even if you are, WATCH OUT. I'm not sure if you could order it not as hot but worth a shot. I also had the Brussels sprouts which were great. Food service was prompt!I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on a trip back to Nashville. It was one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had!Pros: -close to Broadway-swimming pool and hot tub-staff was nice and tried hard-room was cleanCons:-hotel was a little run down in general-bathrooms were very outdated-loud-even on a weeknight we could hear music from Broadway at 3am-the heavy room doors slam all throughout the night-very expensive rates.  For what we paid you'd expect coffee in the room or continental breakfast or something.  These were NYC rates for a sorta run down hotel.  Wifi, water, coffee, etc, ALL extraIf we returned to Nashville we wouldn't stay here, partly because of the noise and partly because of the condition of the hotel for the rates.Absolutely will not stay here ever again. Drove 7 1/2 hrs to be told they did not have a room. Even though we have had the reservation for weeks and even called half way through our trip to confirm we still had a room. Just ridiculous and will not be back!  Might be amazing once you actually get into your room, but being treated that way has lost my business.Two blocks from Broadway and all the honky tonk spots in downtown, you're going to be very challenged finding a better hotel location in Nashville. The Renaissance is what we call a ""full service hotel"" meaning that it has onsite parking and a restaurant, fitness center, room service, concierge lounge and such.I was upgraded to what they called a ""corner room"" and though it was on the corner at the end of the hallway, it only had windows on one side of the room. The view, as you can see from my picture, was super awesome. Nice sized room with a work desk (ah, there's where they hid the power outlets) and nice shower. Well laid out with nice decorations and a warm feeling. I opted to put out the little sign that skips room ""styling"" and earns an extra 500 Marriott points.Very nice concierge lounge on the 24th floor which has a really good breakfast, a solid evening hors d'oeuvres and desserts. Decent coffee up there too, though there is also a coffee shop in the lobby.My main concern is the $38/day valet parking. Even the lot across the street is $20. Yikes!Nice hotel but it is EXTREMELY noisy in the rooms as the hotel room doors SLAM closed every time...  With this being close to the Honky Tonk bars and also used for business travelers the doors up and down the halls slammed all night, and all morning...  I've been to many hotels with heavy fire doors similar to this and they have figured a way to reduce the noise...  This certainly needs to be remedied...So I need to review this hotel from two different perspectives: corporate travel vs. personal travel.From a personal traveler's perspective: I thought that at $250 a night, the hotel was glamorous enough, well tended enough, and large enough to warrant the cost. Most importantly it's a two block walk to some of the best tourism spots off Broadway like Tootsies and the Wild Horse Saloon (if you go bring your key card to this so that you don't need to pay cover). However, I found the $10 charge for internet per day and the $17.95 for breakfast pretty steep on top of my already expensive daily rate. I also thought they could have done a better job replenishing towels on a room they knew had a lot of people in it. From a corporate traveler's perspective: If you have work in downtown Nashville, this is definitely where you want to stay. It's a fun spot and you get to expense all of the things I listed as a detraction above. Favorite part of the hotel: the view as you ride the elevator up 17 floors.I have not stayed in a room overnight, but have been in them for various events and parties, as well as dined and played at the Bridge Bar. Hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous...the food is good..everything is really pricey...Also, I have noticed that any time I have ordered at BridgeBar, there was one amount on my receipt, and another amount charged to my credit card (since I get automatic text alerts every time a purchase is made)...I don't know if it's an automatic gratuity or what...but if, let's say my amount came out to $28.00 subtotal on receipt, my card would text me that $34.00 was actually charged, before I even wrote in the tip and handed it back to the waiter..So my card could wind up getting charged $40 if I added a $6 gratuity...I've asked for an explanation on this a few times with nothing. Staff within hotel is always friendly, but not at bridge bar usually..I do recommend staying here to friends who are visiting Nashville quite regularly if they want to be right downtown.The best customer service I have EVER experienced in a hotel! Every person I encountered was friendly, knowledgeable, and seemed to be genuinely happy with their position in the hospitality industry. I truly appreciated feeling welcome, especially on my first visit to such a wonderful city!!Hopefully I will be back soon :)We recently had a business meeting in the convention center. We inadvertently did not order lunch for Day 1. (""Ooops."") We realized this about 10am day of, panicked because we had 50 people who assumed lunch was scheduled to arrive, and we called Conference Services. A lunch showed up - sandwiches, salads, cakes, drinks - right at noon as if it had been ordered all along. Scrambling for an unplanned lunch for 50 is no easy task, but they made it seem so.A massive space with a great location...just a block off of Broadway.  The restaurant is solid and I love how bands just seem to spin through.  Nashville is so outstanding that way.I really like the gym...big space with about a dozen of various cardio machines.  They have a multi weight rack and just a couple of leg machines. They also have some standard weights with a few benches.  You won't get much of a a lift here, but enough to do a quick maintenance day.  Focus on cardio while you are here muscle head....hahaThe Club Lounge is nothing special...a bit dated, but it has extended hours so you can always grab waters or a ""to go"" beer.  I love having The Starbucks in the lobby for a quick coffee to go.The rooms could use an update...they are looking a bit tired, but the beds are wonderful so that's a plus. Again, location is outstanding so you really can't go wrong by staying at The Renaissance...I've stayed at many Marriott properties and I was looking forward to a nice girls/bachelorette weekend at the Renaissance Nashville.  A couple of us arrived early this past Friday morning (9:00am-ish) and decided we would drop our luggage off and see if it was possible to check in yet.  Unfortunately, the girl working at the front desk must never have worked in customer service before because her attitude from the get-go was horrible.  She said they were ""booked solid"" for the weekend and that we had two King rooms for our reservation.  Here's the problem: there were 8 of us on the trip, sleeping 4 per room.  We explained this to her and she curtly responded ""I'm sorry there is nothing I can do."" I am 99.99999% sure that ""there's nothing we can do"" should NEVER be in your vocabulary if you are working in this kind of job.  What she SHOULD have said was ""I will see what I can do"" or ""you are welcome to try and check in later to see if anything else becomes available."" But no. Completely rude, unhelpful, and unapologetic.  Frustrated, we told her we would wait to check in and went to get breakfast.  Lo and behold, when we returned around noon with the rest of our group to check in, another girl working the front desk was able to put us into 2 Queen rooms with no problem whatsoever. She even was able to get us 2 rooms right next to each other so we could all be together.  She was pleasant and a total 180 from the unfortunate character we dealt with at first.  Thankfully, we enjoyed the rest of our stay here once the check-in disaster was over.  The rooms are bright and clean and the location can't be beat.  We ordered room service pizza late both nights and it was surprisingly delicious... I've had some pretty generic hotel pizzas but this will do the trick if you get some late-night hunger pangs.  The Starbucks in the lobby is a nice touch though it does tend to get busy in the mornings, as is to be expected.  This was my first trip to Nashville and I will absolutely be back, though my experience with the first receptionist may make me think twice about where I stay next time.Wanted lunch at hotel when we arrived. Grill not working in main restaurant and 3rd floor deli had only a very limited menu. Didn't much matter because as soon as we found that out, the hotel was overwhelmed with hundreds of hungry conventioners on lunch break from convention center next door.  Ended up ordering pizza in the room from a local place nearby. So epic fail on feeding your guests, guys.All rooms are apparently the same except slightly larger corner rooms. Seating in room is desk chair and very small side chair. No comfortable spot to relax except bed. Bed and pillows not very comfortable, a bit saggy. Attempts to get foam pillows failed, they were as limp as feather.Tv fixed to wall and wired to block any attempts at changing input, so useless for anything but the hotel's cable channels. Why do some Marriott family hotels have cool input strips for the tv and others block all input? Tv reception was oddly poor.Reasonably cold and dark. Nearby construction will wake up the vacationer by 7 or 8 weekdays. Some really nice views from high floors.Very convenient to Ryman, Bridgestone and general drunken madness on Broadway. A bit more of a hike, but still doable, to new Ascend amphitheater.Got a couple bottles of wine from the bar/deli during the stay for the room, but neither downstairs or third floor bar were anyplace i'd want to hang for a drink.Staff all friendly and helpful. Overall, a meh hotel in an ok location.This hotel was really nice and in a great location. We got a free upgrade to a corner room which had spectacular views of downtown and the river. Our room was clean and had lots of attention to detail things like free to use phone charging dock, AVEDA shampoo and soap and extra towels. There is a Starbucks in the lobby and the hotel bar/restaurant is on this bridge thing which has great views and is very open. It's an easy walk down to Broadway, the public library (which you can access through the parking deck), and Panera is also a block away. I will definitely stay here again when I go back to visit.2 night stay here. Everything was awesome! Staff was very accommodating . Valet was offered and we accepted . Easy to deal with.  Starbucks inside the hotel  which for me was a big plus. They offer a wonderful breakfast buffet.Rooms were clean and the beds were really comfortable .  There's a iPod Dock in the room.  I definitely  recommend this hotel. It's right around the corner from downtown. Literally one block. Convention center is attached so it makes. It so convenient . I'll be back on the flip side.I stayed here for 5 nights while in town on business and had a pretty good experience. The hotel is in a good central location with close proximity to the popular Broadway Street area.My room was styled well, comfortable and clean. It had everything I needed including a beautiful view of the Music City Center.  It was nice to have a refrigerator and safe in the room, which is not always the case with these joints. If I had to complain about something in the room it was that the refrigerator never got really cold, but it did the job so really it's not a big deal.The few interactions I had with the hotel staff were polite and professional.  They keep the place very clean and I never had trouble getting service when I needed it.The hotel has a Starbucks, a small bar, a large restaurant and a separate larger bar known as ""The Bridge.""  It also has a nice convenience/gift shop in case you need a last minute item or gift.  Prices for each are what I refer to as ""hotel high"" so prepare to spend money.  Since I was here on business this wasn't an issue for me.One thing I liked is that as a Marriott Rewards member the WiFi was free and I was able to earn points by not using housekeeping, so if you want to save on internet and earn points make sure you sign up in advance(<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marriott.com%2Frewards%2Frewards-program.mi&amp;s=f3c76038ca5a4322c938a7df0765ca3640253964d333bc913e4bae338a9dad0d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">marriott.com/rewards/rew...</a>) or when you first arrive.Overall I had a really nice stay here and I would recommend this place to friends and family that are visiting Nashville.*This business is gun carry friendly.I enjoyed our weekend here!  Friendly staff ! Loved valet service!! I've used Valet in other places, but this location was the fastest and super friendly! They always greeted you with a smile and friendly hello. Breakfast bar was okay, didn't have all kinds of options, pretty basic, but you can make an omlette! One thing that I loved was the Starbucks in the lobby!!! We stayed on the 23rd floor, great view!Great location- close walking distance to Broadway,  Country Music Hall of Fame,  Ryman and more! Comfortable room and pleasant staff.  If wanting g to be close to downtown Nashville attractions,  this is your place. We arrived early with no rooms ready,  they ended up preparing a room within an hour when we were expecting 3 or more!Great location, nice rooms, but a few things turned me off... The hotel bar was closed by 11pm. We had been to a concert at Bridgestone arena and weren't quite ready to be done for the night, but it so happened to be the weekend Nashville got hit with six inches of snow, so it was cold &amp; icy and we didn't want to walk back down to Broadway... Disappointed. Luckily, we had a stash in the room.  Second thing that really irked me was WiFi was only free in the common areas. You had to pay if you wanted it in your room. What a ploy! Especially, if you advertise that you have free WiFi. Not impressed. Had we stayed more than one night, this would have really irritated me.Nice hotel  in downtown  Nashville  with a very elcectic theme room, very  appropriate for where were, in the heart of country music.The hallway  carpet  was cool with  the mural of guitars, pretty awseome.The  downside is that it is  freezing in the hallway, way too cold for my liking that's  the only bad thing I have to say.Two things work in synergy here: lots of elevators and a Starbucks (opens 6am) in the lobby.Of course the hotel is about 4-6 blocks from all the music &amp; bbq on Broadway.  Very convenient to walk back from a long night at the bar.","As far as corporate hotels go, this one is about as bland and cheesy as the next. The location is great, though, right by all the honky tonks. The reason I'm inclined to give 1 star is because three mornings in a row, we were woken up by drilling against the side of the building. Every phone call to the front desk was addressed with a ""Oh, there should have been a notice"". No, there was no notice, not a single day we stayed there. There was no offer to move hotel rooms, nothing. On the last day, and after several complaints across our group, management finally, and BEGRUDGINGLY offered us a free breakfast, but after returning to our room, there was a man peering in doing construction. I literally made eye contact with the guy. Management told us, verbatim, to ""close the blinds if it's bothering you"". Nashville has so many better hotels with much better hospitality and character, and no wakeup calls via drilling. I'd suggest making this hotel your absolute last option.Where I was born Where I was raisedWhere I keep all my yesterdaysWhere I came back and settled downWhere They'll put me in the groundThis is my townSure it's a song written by Montgomery Gentry but it personifies Nashville and the Renaissance Nashville Hotel.I didn't experience any problem, noise, maid service issues or naked single (0r married for that matter) women attending the plethora of bachelorette parties that supposedly occur in this hotel. If they did... Who's complaining?I love Chelsea up in the Concierge lounge and Sandra as well. Not so much the man that was doing breakfast. He was quiet and not much was ""available"" at 8:30 when he was working. The front desk staff was extremely helpful and courteous and had an abundance of information and found some of the best eating that Nashville had to offer due to them. The decor was labeled by some Yelp poser as a ""hotel trying to be hip and relevant"". They are hip. This is Nashville, this is current, this is relevant and this hotel is a worthy return which I'll do. Note to manager.. if you really want the dirty on your bell staff/valet you'd be in touch.Nice place, excellent customer service, clean, modern rooms with very comfortable beds, all located within a couple blocks of the Nashville strip on Broadway.  Book it.Came here for a three night stay. Standard hotel, quite large, reasonably sized rooms. Nothing special. Large lobby area with elevators that took ages to come. Helpful staff. best things about this hotel is the bar on the third floor. The Starbucks had a long line anytime you fancied a coffee. It is a convention hotspot so was always extremely busy. It is conveniently located but I wish I'd stayed at the hermitage a block away which was smaller and cuter!Fantastic hotel, friendly staff, great location for anyone wanting to enjoy all that #Nashville has to offer.  Close to every single activity, event &amp; wow the food. ""Acme Seed"" is an absolute must with a rooftop deck that is fantastic. Great scene &amp; right on the water.  If you are looking for some really good local fare you must stop in at ""Stillery""! Overall the options are endless but recommendation is to avoid the tourist traps at all costs &amp; go for the local &amp; authentic #NashvilleBeautiful hotel just a few block from Broadway. Beautiful rooms, huge spaces for having events, and a delicious hotel restaurant that had the most amazing food. Starbucks inside, beautiful views and friendly people. Can't go wrong with this hotel. A must stay on our next trip.Great location, very central! We experienced very good customer service during a big conference and everyone was so welcoming and helpful. The hotel is in great condition and very clean. Only thing that didn't sit well was that there were only three running elevators which caused a delay in the mornings.I loved this place. We stayed here for MTAC (Middle Tennessee Anime Convention) last Easter (2013) and I spent a lot of time in the room due to catching my sister's illness just as she was getting over it. I had also been here once before for a college church conference. The beds are nice and the entire place is just cool. It's probably the coolest hotel I've ever stayed at and I felt so fancy staying there. I know its unlikely that I will get to stay here again because I'm gonna be a poor broke teacher, but I totally would if I could afford it.Liked: - Citrus CrushI have been starting to fall back in love with Marriott's Renaissance thanks to their re-branding. While it takes awhile for all of the hotels in a given brand to update, I was happy to see that the Nashville Hotel has finally been updated. That being said, I really wouldn't  categorize this Renaissance like others in the brand as it is more of a convention hotel. Pros:+Location- Attached to the convention center if you happen to be attending a convention, and it is conveniently located within 2 blocks of Broadway+Starbucks- Some times you just need caffeine in the morning to function and luckily there happens to be one in the lobby+Staff- They seemed really friendly and nice, especially the doorman and concierge. They were able to provide excellent dining and activity suggestions.+Beds- they were extremely comfortableCons:-Location- Outside of Broadway, you needed to drive to other areas of the city, i.e. Westend, East Nashville/Five Points, the Gulch, etc.-Noise - On the weekends, this hotel attracts a lot of bachelorette parties and during the week, you can get some louder guests as well. The walls are paper thin like others have mentioned and this can get annoying. -Lobby/public space areas- There really doesn't seemed to be smaller than some of the other ones I've stayed at in which you could gather to work with coworkers if need be. -Elevators- They took awhile to call and go up or down to your selected floorThis is a great hotel with so much yo offer and wonderful staff service! I enjoy all that Music City has to offer, and the location is the center of everything.Beautiful hotel in probably the perfect location within downtown Nashville.If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay and walkability is a concern, look no further.   This hotel is within walking distance to almost everything the downtown has to offer.   For those needing to journey away, their concierge service was top-notch and a cab was never more than 2 minutes wait.Lack of 1 star on my rating for the confusing hours of both the coffee cafe and the bar.My husband and I stayed here for one night during our stay in Nashville. Excellent location, very clean and great service. Valet was pretty expensive but there is parking garage almost directly across the street that offers $10 parking per day so thats where we parked. My only gripe with this hotel is we had to pay $10/day for Wi-Fi. Doesnt Motel 6 offer free Wi-Fi? For the price of the room, we were really disappointed about the lack of internet availability when it seems this comes complimentary pretty much everywhere else. Otherwise great hotel and would recommend other than caveat for Wi-Fi.While the hotel is right downtown and has a lot of great modern amenities (Apple charging docks, flat screen TV, etc) I found the lack of soundproofing a bit of an issue.I was in town for a conference and being that this place is right in the thick of all the honky tonks it was hard to sleep because I could hear music ALL NIGHT from the 20th floor.The decor is nice and modern and everything was super clean and well maintained, but I feel the noise makes this hotel impractical for anyone that isn't here to enjoy the nightlife.As good as it gets for a 4-star at this price! Good location - Broadway is around the corner, so are the event centers, and Nissan Stadium is a nice walk. Nice to have a Starbucks down stairs. Especially for the refills. Service is excellent -  inside and out. I hope to have the chance to come back again with my family.I was visiting Nashville for a conference at the adjoining Nashville Conference Center and a stay at the Renaissance meant no morning commutes or long distances to walk. This hotel is located just off Broadway, where all the action in downtown Nashville occurs. Its the perfect location for those attending a conference next door or wanting to be near the honky tonks and other downtown attractions. The hotel itself is excellent. There is a Starbucks on the first floor and complimentary fruit-infused water (apple cinnamon, blueberry orange, etc) for an afternoon pick-up. The Starbucks is a franchise, so don't expect to use your Gold Starbucks Card perks here. I didn't try the bar or restaurant, but the furniture in the lounge across from the Starbucks is both modern and comfortable. Its a great place to watch the World Cup and people-watching, which the bartender will comment on from time-to-time and make you laugh. The concierge service is truly excellent. If you need change for a 5, they will do so and they will also hold your luggage until your 3 p.m. check-in. This is great for those of us hoping to get an extra day of sight-seeing in before our conference starts and occupies the rest of our Nashville stay. They also offered to let me check in early because rooms were available, but I did not take them up on the offer as all I wanted to do was drop my bags and run to the farmer's market for Georgia peaches. The exercise room offers a full set of weights, towels, complimentary earbuds, treadmills, elliptical machines, an outdoor swimming pool, stretching mats, shower and bathroom facilities, and locker room. There is also filtered water, but this machine tends to overflow and leak onto the ground. The rooms are up-to-date, with a large flat screen, leather rolling chair for your desk, and plush beds. This was perhaps the most comfy of beds I have ever slept on, and I had a great night's sleep every night. The bathroom shower head is perhaps my only complaint. It is a single stream, rather than multiple streams of water. Otherwise, there is a sleek bathroom countertop, excellent lighting, a half foot of magnified mirror, and Aveda products. I recommend this hotel for its location and its excellent service. I wish there was free wireless, but it may be purchased at a reasonable rate.I thought the rooms were updated and clean.  I had a great view from my window.  The location is absolutely perfect....two blocks from Broadway -  I would stay here again for sure.Location Location Location! This hotel is right by Broadway and the Predators arena.  Several good restaurants within walking distance.  The rooms are nice.  My only complaint was being told there were no king bed rooms available (eventhough that is what I booked) and that I had to upgrade to a King Corner room if I wanted a king (instead of 2 queens).If you are traveling on business on a Friday or Saturday night then don't stay here. The live band in the bar area is so loud and my room overlooked that area. With the TV on and a sound machine I could still hear word for word of all the songs. I'm there for a work conference and have to get up super early. Called the front desk and they said there is nothing they can do and that the band plays until 2AM. Hotel is sold out and can't even be moved to a different room. Very frustrating. The location is great but I would only stay here again if I was visiting for fun and not business. They should at least tell people about this when they check in. Here's to a sleepless night and a very long day tomorrow. Hotel is decent and clean though!***This Renaissance is nice while the Concierge Lounge is just okay; room rates are very high here so you can find better value outside of Downtown Nashville***I personally prefer Renaissance to Marriott when staying at a Marriott brand full service hotel.  Renaissance's rooms and the hotels themselves are much more contemporary than what you will find at Marriotts.  The Renaissance Las Vegas is surprisingly nice for an off-The-Strip hotel and both the Renaissance Boston at Patriot Place and Renaissance Boulder showcase luxurious rooms.  In several ways, this Renaissance is similar to those properties, but it also falls short in certain areas.My room for the most part was nice.  The room had a good look overall and it featured an exceptionally nice and sleek bathroom sink.  The furniture was contemporary too and I really liked what they did with the flat screen TV by mounting it on the wall as opposed to just sitting it on the dresser like most hotels.  The room was comfortable too though the A/C probably did not get as cool as I would have liked.There were a few areas where my room could have been better though.  The in-room safe was not working and the shower head delivered a straight on blast as opposed to the nice rainfall shower heads that a lot of Marriotts are now using.Outside of the rooms, there were some areas that could use updating. The hallways had a dated look (the doors to the rooms were dated too and had an unattractive light yellow wood color).  The Concierge Lounge for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members is under renovation so they have temporarily moved it to the Ryman Room on the 3rd floor.  This temporary space obviously did not deliver the standard Concierge Lounge ambiance.  There were no couches and no nicely designed and restaurant-like table options.  Instead, the room was boring and banquet hall-esque.  They tried making the room nicer though by bringing in a few flat screen TVs.The food here was not that good considering the high room rate, but there were high points.  For nightly appetizers, there was really good and sweet BBQ pulled pork as well as a great variety of hot and cold options even if a lot of it was in the mediocre range.  This Concierge Lounge offered BBQ pulled chicken, buffalo wings, hummus, chips and salsa, crudite, very standard cheeses, chicken sandwiches, roast beef sandwiches, BLT wraps, strawberries, caprese salad (decent), and rye bread topped with a cream cheese mousse and smoked salmon.Desserts included a wide variety of cake and pie slices including chocolate cake, red velvet cake, apple pie, and really good pecan pie.Breakfast was a letdown as nothing really stood out.  The lounge served scrambled eggs, mediocre sausage patties (though sausage patties or links at Marriott brand Concierge Lounges tend to be below average), muffins, bagels, Danishes, croissants, sliced fruit, whole fruit, hard boiled eggs, cheese, deli meats, oatmeal, individual boxes of cereal, and assorted juices (including overly pulpy orange juice).The fitness center was big and good and this hotel offers an indoor pool.Service throughout the hotel was pleasant.This Renaissance has a pretty good location.  It is right in Downtown Nashville and within walking distance to many key Nashville attractions (very close to the Ryman) though you do have to walk through a few deserted blocks to get to some of these attractions.Room rates are high at this hotel.  I think part of it has to do with just how desirable Nashville is, but you will pay significantly more at this Renaissance than similar downtown hotels like the Minneapolis Marriott and the Denver Marriott.There are definitely good things about this Renaissance, but I think the room rates (coupled with paying a high price for valet parking) are just too high given the good but not excellent quality of this hotel.  Since traffic in Nashville is not that bad, it might make more sense staying outside the downtown area where room rates for Marriott brand hotels are much less.This Renaissance offers valet parking for $32 per night. There is also a city operated parking structure across the street that is $10 per day on weekdays and $5 per day on weekends (no in and out privileges though).This was a great hotel near everything. Everyone was so nice. The rooms were great from the beds to the shampoo :-) Make sure you get the card of the pedal taxi before a night out on south Broadway! Worth the call.","Terrible place to stay.   The hotel staff are friendly,.... Unless there is a problem. I stayed here for 5 nights this week.  On the 2nd night I awoke to a strange pain.  I had a tick attached my skin.  This has never happened to me anywhere!On the 3rd morning,  I awoke with a rash on my right wrist and on my forehead.  I went straight to the front desk to ask for my sheets and pillows to be exchanged.I was told that I must have brought the tick intro the hotel via my luggage and that maybe I had contracted the rash somewhere in my travels.  They brought in a pest investigation company and reported they found nothing unusual,  so my room was fine.  They told me they were closing the case as Marriott was not at fault I am a doctor and do not have ticks or pests in my home, nor has anything like this happened to me prior to this stay.   I was very tactful to the staff, but VERY offended by their rude insinuations.  I requested new pillows and sheets once again and finally received them.   I will NOT stay here againThe hotel was nice.  Great location to restaurants, bars, and sporting events!  Construction is happening next to the property and work starts early during the week so NO sleeping in.I had stayed in this hotel a few years back for a work conference, so when looking at hotels to book for my birthday trip... I knew this place had all of the requirements. Starbucks in the lobby? Check! Walking distance to Broadway and the Ryman? Check! Comfy bed and clean rooms? Check! A word of caution though: I actually booked this, what I thought, was directly through Southwest, as a nice little flight and hotel package. I did eventually find out, the Southwest packages are booked through a third party company... and after I couldn't find the confirmation email a few days before the trip, freaked out and called Southwest who put me in touch with the company. They promptly sent me a new confirmation email so I thought everything was good to go....So when we walk into the lobby to check in.... they can't find our reservation ANYWHERE. I was started to freak just a bit... I did not want my epic birthday plans to be ruined! The front desk guy asked that I email him the confirmation on the spot, so I did. I am not sure what happened, but David at the front desk was very accommodating... gave us a small upgrade and my birthday plans were saved!!! Yay~ This is not a 5 star hotel, by any means, but it is nice, clean and works... especially if you are only staying a few nights. The only thing that was wrong was that it didn't seem the heater in our room was working very well... so it was a bit chilly... but we weren't in there too long and the comfy bed and covers kept us warm when we were. The Ryman is also just right around the corner... takes about a minute.... so if you are flying in for a show or want to get a little honky tonk out and about on Broadway, this place is a great option. PS. Wifi will cost ya about 10 bucks a day.I've stayed for the second time and my stay was even better than the first, nice staff, clean, comfortable beds and a great club lounge! The views are amazing and it I close to bars, restaurants, Bridgestone arena and the music city convention center. I'll stay here every time I'm in Nashville!We did not stay here... this is a review of the entertainment skyway.We stopped in to escape from the Nashville heat and the crowds. There was live entertainment (name escapes me at the moment), good food and great service. The prices were reasonable as well.The entertainment area is located upstairs in the Skyway that crosses over Commerce St. You can people watch, cool off, have a drink and a bite to eat all while listening to live music.Great location. Very poor amenities club level leaves something to be desired compared to other ""higher marroit"" properties.   Really could use a face lift.  It is so hard to believe this is a category 8 hotel.Fantastic service!  Concierge exceptional.  Had an hour to kill and the concierge actually drove me to a nearby tourist attraction for a quick photo op!  The hotel is beautiful and located in the middle of downtown, a couple of blocks from the famous Nashville music scene!  What a great hotel!Average for a Marriott in most aspects.. The hotel is HUGE and offers plenty of options for conventions, meetings, etc.  The rooms were recently remodeled.. but the bones are still the same.  The walls are paper thin.  You can hear everything from the hallway and rooms beside you.  Someone above, below or beside started their shower as 6.30 am.. I would have thought there was an open air shower beside my bed.Nice hotel, great location. My room was ready so I was able to checkin early which was great. However, the lady behind me apparently hasn't checked out since a hotel employee used his key to open my door to let her in! That's truly unacceptable. I stayed here because the Hilton was full and would again but as my second choice. Room service was good. Clean room, great view. Love the Starbucks in lobby.EXCELLENT HOTEL! Stayed here for a long girls weekend (Thursday-Sunday) with two of my friends and we were blown away with the entire staff! So Nice! The concierge lounge is open during the week for gold and platinum Marriott members and we loved it-Starbucks coffee, fresh fruit, and hot breakfast was a very nice touch. I am a loyal Marriott rewards member and travel a lot for business and can honestly say this is one of the nicest Marriott's I have ever stayed at. The staff made our experience. So helpful! Very convenient to downtown for going out at night or daytime shopping.Great location near everything, a pool to keep the kids happy, a tunnel to the library (again, keeping the kids happy), a really good restaurant/bar area, rooms that were well appointed and cheerfully decorated, and a Starbucks in the lobby.  I kind of wanted to live there.Pros: Location. This place will save you can fair because it's such a short walk downtown, to the convention center, LP field or the arena. Good free weight room. Cons: Price. For a hotel this expensive they shouldn't nickel and dime customers on internet. High speed internet costs $15 extra per day. Parking is $7 self, or up to $25 per day for valet.Think of the Greyhound Bus of hotels, and you're here at the Renaissance in Nashville.  Everything about this hotel, from the  service to decor screams annoying, convention go-ers.  Walking around the lobby without a lanyard and name badge sets you apart from the rest.  The room rate I paid was exhoribitant for the quality of the hotel at $450/night plus valet cost of #39/night and the fact that they charge for wifi is absolutely ridiculous.  The restaurant is like a Denny's, no offense to Denny's, and the food is worse.  The decor of the hotel overall is dated with a 1970s vibe.  Everything seems a bit dirty.  Thank God they had a Starbucks in the lobby, as that was the only positive aspect of this price gouging adventure.  Stay at the Holiday Inn Express instead.Great hotel and the best location in downtown Nashville.  This hotel is directly across from the Bridgestone Arena.  We were able to watch everyone going to and from the Justin Bieber concert.  We attended the Predators Game on Saturday night, it was nice to just have to walk across the street.  And when you are ready to go hit the bars downtown, the hotel is just steps away (the only bad thing is you do have to walk up a slope, which gets a bit difficult after a few drinks :-))The hotel itself wes nice.  The room was spacious, especially the bathroom.  The only negative (well for me) is that it was an ""all in one"" bathroom, so while I was trying to get ready, I was getting steamed out by my other half showering.  The staff was slow in getting us extra towels and cleaning the rooms.  I am going to attribute that to Justin Bieber and the Nashville Predators being in the hotel.  The hotel was at capacity almost our entire trip there.The concierge lounge was nice and well stocked.  The staff in there were very friendly.Parking kinds of sucks.  We decided to just pay to park in the parking garage across the street, you don't have to walk too far, but for this Floridian, , you had to walk outside it was COLD!  I highly recommend this hotel!Great staff! Bathrooms need updating. No safe in the rooms, no fridge either. It's REALLY noisy! You hear music ALL night, trains, sirens, horns (we're on 17th floor!) and the walls are thin (honeymooners next door...WE CAN HEAR YOU!!!).  The walls shake when doors are are left to close by themselves. Having said all that great location, good room service food, great restaurants and bars nearby.The best part of this hotel is it's right downtown and you can walk to everything.  I also love the beds at Renaissance and the rooms are nice.  My 2 complaints are the elevators - it takes forever to get from your floor to the lobby.  There are multiple elevator shafts but only a few work (maybe this has been fixed now?).  And the second is valet - I'd have to wait up to 15 minutes to get my car.  I'd love to just park it outside of the hotel but that's the price you pay being in the city.Maybe it's the fact that I live in Los Angeles but I found EVERYONE here very helpful, friendly and nice.  We were greeted warmly, our room was a good hotel room, the hotel was well kept and the upstairs bar had good food and a good (not big) selection of wines by the glass.  Fist impressions are everything and the staff here is fantastic.  Close to everything.The good: The beds were super comfy! Roomy was spacious and clean. The bad: Soundproofing could use some work. People/children were running up and down the hallway early in the morning, which made it difficult to sleep. Wifi was $10, which seemed quite high.This has been a very pleasant experience.  Rooms are pretty good.  Beds are comfortable.  Everything is clean.  Great shower head with alternate settings to cater to your preference.  Amenities are pretty good.  Cell service is terrible in the meeting room wings.  I mean really terrible!  Service has been really great!  Concierge desk has been amazing!!  Extremely helpful and always smiling!  Check in was pretty easy.  Parking is a bit of a nightmare and it is a couple blocks walk to get anywhere you may want to eat/drink/hang out.  The restaurant at the hotel is ok.  Menu needs work.  There is a bar on the third floor of the hotel that is pretty cool.  I would recommend this hotel.This hotel is a 1980s eye sore behemoth to begin with.I lived in Nashville last year and visited the Renaissance hotel daily because they have a great Starbucks with wonderful employees.  Unfortunately, it turns out that this is the best aspect of the place.  I stayed here this week while visiting the city and it was not a good experience.During the course of a four day trip, with one notable exception, I met with very poor hospitality service for a hotel in this price range.  On the first night, out heat did not work.  On our second day, the maid neglected to make up the room at all.  When we alerted the front desk, she came but didn't end up making the bed fully (she just pulled the covers back without ordering the sheets).  When this same scenario recurred the following day, the front desk staff recommended that we call each day to ask for maid service and to check to ensure that the maid would come.  It did not occur to me that this burden should be on the customer.A few other notes: the tap water is terrible and they only provide two tiny bottles of complimentary water on the first day of a multi-day stay, the tv selection is terrible.  The place has a shabby feel to it overall.On a positive note, the views are nice from the upper floors and the hotel lobby is pleasant.  One of the concierges was extremely helpful and even changed my mother's watch battery for her.","I am in Nashville for an executive meeting and happened to bring my family with me. The room is nice and clean, the elevators are quick and plentiful, and the shades on the windows cover nicely. That is about all I have nice to say about this hotel. One of my reasons for giving this two stars is because the indoor pool and their policies. Today my wife and two boys were swimming and since I had a break I went to see them. The pool was full of young adults that were drinking. I didn't care for their rowdiness or their language. I asked the person over the fitness center to talk to them. I was told that they were fine drinking in the pool as long as they don't have any glass containers. I told her that my children were in there and her response was that they were monitoring the situation. I then asked my wife to leave the pool area with my children. I did not care for the reactive nature in which she was going to handle the situation. This hotel is not kid friendly.One last point is that people are out in the halls being rowdy all night long and leave their messes behind. Cheese nips covered the floors in the hall this morning. What a surprise. Too loud and the tint on the windows needs to be fixed. The current tint is bubbled and you cannot see through some windows.This hotel is very nice. The staff seems genuinely concerned about your stay and very service oriented. The concierge lounge has one of the better selections that I have come across and I stay in hotel 40 weeks a year. Great spotThis review is for the 3rd floor atrium lounge.  We were looking for somewhere to relax and have a drink away from the craziness on Broadway.  Walked over here, thinking ""hotel bars are mellow"".  Made our way up to 3, and found Melissa and Tony, great bartenders and conversationalists.  My Manhattans were perfect (stirred, not shaken - how many bartenders even know that any more?) and Tony hand-stuffed bleu cheese into olives for the wife's dirty martinis!  It was a great way to kill an hour or so and another example of the wonderful people of Tennessee.  Great place to stop.Overall a letdown...can't compare to other Renaissance hotels we have stayed at. This, the former Stouffer hotel, is older, though it is being renovated. The lady at the desk that checked us in was very nice and friendly...however, the bellman was less so. He told us where everything was in the room, but didn't bother to put our one rolling duffel on the luggage stand, or even offer to get us ice.  We were ""lucky"" to be put into one of the newer rooms, a corner room on the 15th floor.  The room had a killer view of downtown Nashville, and looked great with its modern, minimalist decor. However, it felt pretty cramped for the three of us, especially after they finally delivered the crib to our room. Now this is a pet peeve of mine, but I have a list of requests that have been saved to my profile for five years. As platinum elite members! you would think they would actually look at these requests on the reservation. Well, I did get my feather-free bed...they stripped everything away except for a blanket and sheet, and three of those tiny foam pillows on our king bed. No crib, no extra pillows or towels. When we called down to request those thing again, we got an earful of attitude...no, those requests were never made... sigh, OK, they'll bring them up. An hour later, the crib arrives. I have to ask again for the pillows and blankets.  Another hour later, finally the pillows arrive but no blankets...sigh ...OK, they'll do us a favor and get those as well. Ugh. Check the damned reservation...all requests were made a month ago when I made the reservation!The worst part of it, however, was the bathroom...the friggin toilet didn't work right...it couldn't flush anything. Every time we flushed, it barely made it down...we had to call down to have it plunged three times in two days. The piece de resistance, however, was that there was no Hot water...there was lukewarm water from the taps...couple that with a really weak shower head, that equals a miserable cold shower. Management never offered to move us, or even apologize for this lousy experience. And keep in mind, this hotel is not cheap...the going rate was $310 a night plus $32 a night for parking...Not everything was bad...the parking valets were always friendly and amazingly fast...the doormen were helpful as well. The location and views were great. But the room itself...ugh! We'll try the Omni next time.Here for a trade show.. THE BEDS ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD ! I found myself peeling myself from Broadway ( walking distance to all the amazing bars with non stop awesome music ) just to get back into the most wonderful silkyish sheets i have EVER been in !! The only thing is the price its like $300+ to stay.. prob bc of all the business people.. but if you have the doe .. stay here! Friendly staff .. structure parking on the other side of the bridge sky way.. plenty of space.. great size clean gym with a clean pool.. Love it!.. oh and $10/day wifi.. WTF with prices so high.. we should get it free!!If your traveling to Nashville the Renaissance hotel is a good place to stay. I have staied at this location several times and each time its been a great place to stay. People are nice. rooms are nice and i love the beds here. You are one block from all the action. you can be at many of the local bars in about 4 min.We initially had reservations at another hotel for our trip and it turned out to be a nightmare, but the Renaissance saved us!!They heard our story and offered a free upgrade to a room with a beautiful view.  We even woke up the next day to a personal note from the concierge hoping our accommodations with them were making our trip experience turn around.  When we checked out, another worker offered to drive us to the airport in the hotel Escalade instead of trying to cram into a cab.  Everyone we met provided such great and personalized service.Just blocks from the main drag, very safe area.  The Starbucks in the lobby is a nice addition.  The lobby also has specialized easy and free terminals from which to quickly print your boarding passes.  The only con I can think of is the charge for wireless internet.Overall a fantastic experience, we will absolutely return to both Nashville and the renaissance!A friend and I came to Nashville for a wedding and stayed at this hotel from 1/2-1/5. Upon our arrival, I authorized the agent to charge my card upfront for what she said was the full amount, and is reflected on my receipt (given at check-in), for our entire stay (1/2-1/5). Our stay there included an employee discount, which we thought accounted for the lower rate. After getting an email from my bank today, I noticed that on 1/4 I was charged two additional amounts that were not authorized, along with an additional amount on 1/5, also unauthorized. I called the hotel to try and get clarity on what happened. I spoke to someone named Lee who said that we, for some reason, were charged separately for each of the nights we were there. Apparently that's not how the Renaissance normally does things, according to her, but for some reason, this is how it was done with us. So, the original agent made a clerical error and charged us less. Ok, I understand that, they could have contacted us; she went on to say that someone left a message in our room - no message was ever received or seen. If there was a billing error, they did not try to reach me by phone or email. They could have also locked us out of the room, and that definitely would've have prompted us to visit the front desk.  Instead, they went ahead and charged my card without my authorization, they never informed me, and never provided a final receipt with the additional charges. Aside from this sort of huge thing, the hotel stay was fun. Enjoyed their retro-ish decor. Customer service post-stay, very incredibly unhelpful.Don't get an adjoining room here. Can hear the neighbors clear as day. Namely their TV. And it's not blaring.Great location! Clean. Friendly staff. But I have to warn anyone especially families or people beyond bachelor(ette) party age that there are MANY of these gatherings going on at/or nearby the hotel. The pool is crawling with them. We had an incident while there this weekend that may or may not be a rare occurrence but a bachelor party returned from the bars early morning (3am) and were quite rowdy. Eventually I believe the hotel took care of the problem (we ended up calling security), but I believe it's part of the scene also. Just unexpected.I absolutely loved the Mac and cheese they serve downstairs at the Lobbies Lounge. Made with Gouda and shrimp. Best I've ever had. Also had a chicken sandwich at the Bridge Lounge that was amazing! As far as the room goes, the beds are super soft and comfortable. Has a fridge but no microwave. My view was of a brick wall. They only have free wifi if you are ok the first three floors, otherwise you have to pay for it. The shower pressure was awful. Pretty close to downtown, walkable.Nice hotel. But a few odd things... toilet paper is all the way in the corner. You basically have to get off the seat to reach it. Tub is not deep enough soaks. Club room on 24th floor is tiny. Just basically the size of 2 hotel rooms. And breakfast offered is just okay - eggs, pastries, bagels, fruit. Eggs were a weird texture. They were scrambled but watery. Room service is no better. Ordered soup and didnt get a spoon. Wifi is not free. $10 daily for regular speed. $14 for high speed.We arrived with no problem, had the valet service park our car and went in to check-in.  The front desk was friendly and all was going well until we got our room.  The ""Do Not Disturb"" sign was on the door which was strange, so we walking in.  It was immediately clear that someone was either staying there or they had not cleaned the room at all.   Neither of the beds were made, there was used hotel soap on the counter in the bathroom along with used towels.  There was also an empty drink bottle sitting on the desk.  I called down to the front desk and asked them if they had by chance double booked that room. They informed me that we were the only people assigned to that room and according to their records, that room had been cleaned.  The lady that I spoke with was very nice and said a manager would call us back.  When she called us back, she told us that they would be bringing us up a key to a new room.  We got into the new room and it was alright.  The only complaint I had with the new room was that small things like the pens don't get switched out.  I needed to use the one in the room, but it had some disgusting white gunk all over it.  Other that it is was a good stay.  Breakfast was ok.  I probably wouldn't pay to stay there again, but the location is convenient.  The valet service was the best thing I had to say about this hotel.  They were awesome, super nice, and very prompt.Nicely appointed rooms-4 stars.  Disaster that is the elevator bank-0 stars.  Complete overhaul needed.  5 elevators that intend to serve the entire hotel?  Doesn't work.  Especially when all elevators access all floors.  For a hotel consistently this busy---a fix should have happened the week after it opened.  Better yet---should have been designed correctly in the first place.I've had quite a few business meetings and lunches here! Staff is always friendly and the food is alway superb! Chef Nick always delights my friends and I with great selections of food choices at The Commerce Street Grille! If you're there and would like to impress your guest for lunch/dinner, call ahead and ask for Jean to be your server if possible!The Renaissance is a nice hotel and us am excellent choice if you are looking to stay in downtown Nashville. If you're a Marriott Elite snob like me, then this location is an added bonus. The parking is typical of any hotel located downtown. It's $29 and change after tax per night. I loved being placed on the 25th floor which could only be accessed with a key. The concierge/executive floor was only one floor below and offered breakfast and evening light fare typical of Marriott hotels. I was really impressed that because I'd my Elite status, they offered me 25% off all meals at any restaurant in the hotel-score! It is also extremely convenient to all the downtown bars, pubs, restaurants and the like on Broadway (the main drag). Morton's, Panera and Subway are all just a few steps from the property. If you have a car though, I would definitely take the short drive to Arnold's for lunch. It's cheap down home cooking that will keep you satisfied for the day. Don't forget to try the chess pie - it's really sweet, but if you have a sweet tooth like me you'll love it.The bathroom left much to be desired. It had a fake renovation look, however, it was clearly outdated in comparison to the rest if the hotel. It was also pretty small. I seemed to get stuck with a toilet that would not flush. Unfortunately, I had to call down to the front desk twice and actually walk down there in order to get it repaired. It's never a good thing when your toilet does not flush. What made matters worse was that the manager seemed annoyed by my request for service. Didn't even bother to apologize for the inconvenience. The toilet was repaired after the third or fourth call. No bueno. I do wish I experienced better front desk service in general. My encounter with Liz at the front desk left a bad taste in my mouth for the property. Sometimes people just have bad day's. She seemed to have multiple.  On a good note, the bed was very comfortable. I could've slept for days. I do wish I experienced better front desk service. My encounter with Liz at the front desk left a bad taste in my mouth for the property. Sometimes people just have bad day's. She seemed to have multiple. The bar area located on the third floor is also pretty spectacular. You can stop there for drinks and a meal. The best part is that it stays open until 1 or 2 am and many nights you'll find people dancing the night away. I was not impressed with the size of the workout facility. For a hotel of this size, they should really look into expanding this space. There were only 3 eliptical machines and perhaps 5 treadmills. The area for free weights, etc was super small, so at 6:00 am you had to fight for space. During my week at the Renaissance, I had to get up at 5:00 am each morning in order to get a machine. If you are not there before 6:00 am you will have to wait for a machine. No bueno!Overall, this is an excellent property and I would definitely recommend it. Just be aware that the valet and front desk service may have several ""off"" days.The Nashville Ren is a very nice property, I'm not sure that I would pay rack rate but my corporate rate makes staying here a no-brainer when I'm in Nashville.  Everything downtown is within walking distance and you could probably get by without a car if  needed.The hotel has beautiful views of downtown from the higher floors and executive lounge on the 24th floor.  A Starbucks in the lobby is a nice amenity to kick off the day.The pool and fitness center are small for a hotel of this size.  I like to swim laps for exercise when I am on the road but the pool here is too small for lap swimming.The rooms are well appointed with comfortable beds and large HDTV's.  I have no complaints about this property, I'll stay here again when in Nashville!Great hotel downtown, close to everything.  Bonus you get Marriott points!We met some friends at the hotel restaurant for a nice, relaxed dinner just prior to walking over to the Ryman for Santana. We are often scrambling around for a dinner place prior to Ryman concerts and tend to overlook this one as it doesn't show up on Yelp when searching for food. It should. We had excellent drinks, excellent service from Justin and great food. I would recommend several of the pasta dishes, one person enjoyed a very good steak and the salad was also top notch.Being charged $13.95 per day for wireless is a bit 2001, don't ya think? Even McDondald's offers free wifi now. I expected better.  Save yourself $20 a day and park across the street in the parking garage.We also had a nice penis-shaped stain on our carpet to welcome us.","Cool Hotel, great staff, excellent beds, had a great room with a great view.It feels authentic and has been in the area for years. Staff are all friendly and helpful not a lot of attitude from the staff. Lovely front desk staff.Although pricey because its by the main strip, it was a nice atmosphere. It had modern amenities and decorating..the upstairs bar was very chic and a great place to congregate before or after events. I would stay there again!Commerce Street Grille - I took my fiance here for his birthday this past weekend and was a little concerned when there weren't many guests there but all turned around when we sat down. Service was amazing!!! James our waiter was very helpful and friendly and so was the manager that night. The food - Best filet I've ever had. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only was it amazing but the portion were big and have to have help from fiance to finish it. To finish our night off we had cheesecake and pecan pie :) so so good. We will definetely be eating here again next time we are in town.My friends and I decided to go to Nashville for the day but didnt want to spend much on a room so I used my points. Best decision! Got to Nashville and checked in early. Upon checkin they provided me with a free movie rental (didnt use - wanted to see Nashville, not a movie), 25% off the restaurants in the hotel and 50% off breakfast in the morning if you got there by 7:30am (definitely didnt use since we got in at 1am). The room was A LOT smaller than I expected but it had two beds and a bathroom so that's all we needed. After a night of fun, we headed back to the hotel. We all still wanted one more beer so we went downstairs to the bar but it closed at 9:30?!? However the janitor told us that their lounge was still open so we went there. Got a beer and ordered some food - nachos and the flatbread - amazing! Definitely hit the spot!! Beds were comfortable as always. Great stay.I loved this place. Has Starbucks in the lobby, staff is super friendly, nice bar area and conveniently located a block away from all the great spots on Broadway - the only negative is the super slow elevators.Worst hotel that I have stayed in.  My bathroom tub did not drain properly while I was taking a shower so I had to hold the drain open while showering.  The Disney Jr channel that my kids wanted to watch did not show properly even though all the other channels worked fine. Lastly, the continental breakfast is only for guests on the 25th floor and can only be accessed with a room key and you cannot upgrade your room key to give you access. But you can always order their expensive room service. I am very disappointed. I have stayed at Holiday Inn's that cost 25% of the price I paid and gotten better service and a free breakfast!Planning an event here and I just want to commend the customer service! Caroline has been my event planner and she is great!Second time here, and while I still think the rooms are to small for what we paid and the elevators are pain.... I am adding a star for one reason.The food is good! Finally a hotel that gets how to do food and not leave the customer feeling cheated. On the Saturday of MTAC my fiancee and I went down to The Bridge for drinks and dinner. We ordered some calamari, which was as I expected, expensive for what it was (almost $10) and an appetizer. What we got though was tasted far better than I expected (really good actually) and was far more than an appetizer portion. There must have been at least enough for four people in that one bowl of calamari we got. And it was very good.The following night after the convention was over, as a member of the MTAC staff, I was invited to the staff after party at the hotel restaurant. The con big-wigs had paid for a fully catered meal of fried squid, wings, pizza, pies and drinks. I stuck with the wings, a slice of apple pie (leaving the crust) and more calamari. The food was amazingly good for hotel food and actually quite filling.I might have considered raising my rating to five stars if not for the fact that the hotel did not give my friend the fridge she requested for our room when she reserved it. Other than that it was a consistent experience from last year.This review is for the ""Bridge Bar"" only in the Renaissance. I came on Memorial Day weekend and NO restaurants were open past 2 pm. NOTHING! Which is why we went out of our way to go to another hotel a few blocks away for something to nibble on. First off, this bar is BEAUTIFUL. Probably one of the only restaurants with a ton of natural light - most other restaurants in the area are in windowless rooms and pitch black. It was nice to have some light for once. Unfortunately, despite the friendly service and AWESOME fried green tomatoes, I have to dock a few stars because they were just out of everything. So I'm exaggerating but the soda was all flat b/c they were out of CO2, they were out of certain juices and other drinks...it seemed like their already limited menu was limited even more.However, the fried green tomatoes were AWESOME here. They had rice, black eyed peas, and were very crispy without being too greasy. I had never had them so I don't have much to compare them to but I was very happy with my choice.If you're craving some sun, this is the place to come. You're welcome for the obnoxious rhyme.Overall just meh as far as Renaissances are concerned. Good location as Broadway is a very close walk. Staff was friendly, room service was more reasonable than most hotels, and the concierge lounge put on a decent offering. Downsides- dated, though the furniture is newer. Also, beware of the elevators- I had a room facing one of the outside elevators and it was quite loud, I had to move. In general, the sound proofing is pretty subpar.Compared to other medium sized cities with a hotel connected to the conference center, Nashville lacks a bit in a quality hotel.  I stayed here for the first time 23 years ago when I was a high school student in town for All-State Choir and then again 23 years later as a convention chair and Nashville resident.Since the late 1980s, the hotel has certainly changed for the better.  The lobby decor and amenities have great improved.  The views from every elevator shaft could possibly be some of the very best of the city landscape and beyond.  The Skybar which used to connect the hotel to Church Street Station Mall is now a sleek vibey lounge with great views east and west.While the rooms have been updated, you'll still see the remnants of an aged hotel (stained tile grout, brass door hinges with layers of paint colors, cloudy window panes).  The joy is, even through the cloudy windows you still get a spectacular view from almost any room and vantage.Second time we have stayed here and I couldn't be happier. I've stayed in a few downtown Nashville hotels and this is the best!  Rooms are clean, staff is friendly, location is excellent, what more could you want? Oh and there's a Starbucks in the lobby! No disappointments here, we'll be back.Nice hotel. Not the biggest lobby but enough place to meet with friends. Bar upstairs on 3td floor towards Patkade is a nice chic place to hang out. Rooms are modern and clean. There is no safes in the room. Staff are efficient and friendly.The bar at the Renaissance Nashville Hotel is quite a hidden gem. A great place to gather before a Titans or Predators game, offering Wine Wednesdays, affordable bar food and multiple TVs. The parking makes it an easy place to begin the evening.Bad experience!!  The shower didn't work at all. After traveling for hours, I was hoping for a nice hot shower. The shower's faucet was broken so we had to wait an hour for the building engineer.  That proved to be a temporary fix because the hot water didn't work at all the following morning. The guest services staff was rude and acted as if a cold shower was no big deal for a $225 room.This is a beautiful hotel in downtown Nashville. Clean, modern and friendly staff. Starbucks is within the hotel, on the second floor you will find a beautiful pool and fitness center. Our family enjoyed our stay here and we will return again.Over all not bad,  staff friendly, and helpful.   We just had a few issues.   Elevators made no sense,  five of them but it took no kidding 5 minutes to go to the first floor after we started keeping track.   Friends went from the fourth floor to the first but the doors didn't open and went to the fourteenth and got stuck.   Plumbing was incredibly loud.   You are going to know when your neighbors pee and definitely when they shower. We also didn't have a bottom sheet on the bed.   But my wife is sexy as hell.I stayed here for a conference, due to lack of parking around the city and with three conferences going on at the same time it was worth it. I also got a room discount because of the conference. It was in waking distance of the conference, and downtown Broadway ave.  The beds were comfortable and the bellhops were very nice and friendly. However the hall an room were very dated and over priced. But as it turns out they were renovating the floor below me. Hopefully the rooms will be better the next time I visit Nashville.I've stayed in Marriott's across the county and this one was ""ok"".  Nothing bad to report, but I also felt that it was a bit expensive compared to what you get.  Only glitch is that the lady at the front desk said they would call when my room was ready but she never did so I waited an extra hour.  Front Desk  B-Restaurant BRooms B+Doormen and Lobby Staff  A- Location A- [right around the corner from Broadway]This is an older hotel. The rooms were smaller than I expected and compared to the other Renaissances I've stayed in, it seems like it could be due for a remodel.  So keep this all in mind before you get here and you're disappointed.  The location is great. I used points so I can't comment on price.  The beds were insanely comfortable. Probably one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've stayed in and I travel a lot.The staff was super friendly! I was very very pleased about this.  Also, I left a dress in my room, realizing it after we were on the road for an hour heading home. I contacted the hotel and they sent me back my dress. I was so glad.The concierge lounge is small but well stocked.Really my only complete was that housekeeping came by ~3 times the morning we were scheduled to check out. If we're going to check out at noon, wouldn't it make sense to come by after that? Idk I'm not an expert on this.I saw some people complained about the parking situation.  Seriously? If you're in a city of a decent size, most notably in it's downtown area, it's unlikely that there will be an attached parking lot, people!  The parking garage is across the street from the hotel. You have do drive down the street and turn the corner to enter the parking garage.  Park on the 4th floor. There's a pedway connecting the parking garage to the hotel. Just take that and you'll be on the hotel's 4th floor.  Not too complicated. Minimal time spent ""outside"". The garage is covered. The weekend price is very reasonable ($5-$7/day).Overall, I recommend this based on the staff friendliness and location.","['overall', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'top', 'bottom', 'place', 'every',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/gaylord-opryland-resort-and-convention-center-nashville-8,Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center,3.0,$$$,676,"What a fun place for those that want to get to their step goal while taking in the sites!  I love new places and I love walking so when friends of ours were staying there for a baseball convention the weekend of Jan. 9th, I jumped at the chance to finally check this place out. My fiance and I met up w/ my best friend and wandered around for at least an hour. I loved the waterfalls and foliage.  The place is clean and I couldn't help but think if you were to get married here, you wouldn't have to leave to get pics anywhere else b/c the the scenery is so serene.  I didn't find any of the employees to be overly friendly or friendly for that matter...  We saw their room which had a king bed and she said a small fridge- it was typical of other Marriotts.  There are a lot of places to eat but from what I gathered, you'll pay way more than what the food is worth- my suggestion would be go somewhere else for a plethora of dining options in the Donelson area.  Parking was easy in and out- we didn't have to pay as we had a guest w/ us BUT if you just want to check it out w/o paying, park close by and walk over.Ugh...I hope to never stay at this hotel again. Had to come here for a work convention...As soon as I checked in, I wanted to jump in the shower, but the previous guest's used soap and shampoo was still in the soap rack. Disgusting!The hotel itself was nice enough, but it was so huge!  TOO huge...There was no rhyme or reason to the layout, you couldn't really cut across the gardens totes to get to the meeting rooms.The food was subpar, the few shops were all very cookie cutter...nothing unique to any of them.I don't know if anyone else provided the same feedback from my company, but I hope to never stay here again.I call this hotel the Complex Complex. I have stayed here twice for a work convention and have to say that I still got lost at this place. It is quite expansive and for some reason I was always looking for a central lobby or landmark but got lost in the tunnels and hallways looking for my room. The room was average and you can get a view of the interior biodome or if you are lucky, a window to the outside.  I would have liked thicker comforters and felt like I just had a sheet on the bed. The water in the shower was never really hot. The hotel is split into three areas (Cascades, Delta and Magnolia). Even with a map, I feel like you need to ask for directions because it all feels like a maze. The conservatory feels like a rain forest with all kinds of tropical fauna and waterfalls. It was 25 degrees Fahrenheit outside and snowing and inside the biodome, you don't even notice it. I wish I had some more positive reviews but I was just not impressed with my stay at this massive hotel. I really could not wait to go back home.Room Tip: Get a map and good luck finding your room.The Gaylord ""biodome"" format isn't new to me, I've also been to the Gaylord Texan. Having said that I liked the layout of this one a lot, it had a nice variety of spaces under four separate domes. There was a big selection of restaurants, I only hit two (most of my meals were part of the convention) but food was good if not overpriced. I however found a lot not to love with the rooms. At least in the delta wing the rooms were consistently cold and oddly the HVAC rans run constantly instead of as needed. Beds oddly didn't have a proper blanket or quilt - in January. Fortunately a call to the front desk got me a couple blankets. The pillow covers were threadbare along with falling apart headboards. The towels were the quality of a cheap motel. The rooms were simply subpar for half the price. If you can, skip this place.This review is just for walking around, and not for actually staying here.This place is a fun labyrinth. My friend brought me here during the holiday season and we walked around to admire all of the decorations they had up. It was a good mode of exercise without involving the cold outdoors. They have cutesy little shops inside that make for good souvenirs. I'm sure you have to pay extra for the pretty rooms that have balconies facing inside the main area (the outdoor balconies face... the mall?)We stayed at this resort for four nights last week while my husband attended a conference there. The resort is grand, beautiful and well kept. All of the employees that I came into contact with (from restaurant servers, to the lady at the spa who did my pedicure, to the lady who gave us our Delta riverboat tour) were attentive, friendly, and full of suggestions on things to do and see while at the resort, and also the easiest ways to navigate around the resort. One of the bellmen in the Magnolia lobby actually helped us pinpoint our Uber GPS pickup location.Every atrium / neighborhood is unique in its own way and has something to see (walk the gardens, ride the river boat, sit by the falls). The fitness center is HUGE and has tons of cardio equipment (and the individual cardio TVs actually worked) and tons of nice weight lifting equipment. The outdoor pools were closed for the winter but the indoor pool was large and tranquil.My spa pedicure was to die for. I enjoyed hanging out in the spa lounge before and after my appointment.Our room was in the Cascades neighborhood which is the last neighborhood to be remodeled (we learned this from a tour boat guide). Even though it was not remodeled, the room was kept up well and clean. The TVs have this cool feature that allows you to login to your Netflix account and various other apps. The maid came at decent time each day and did an excellent job cleaning. We were very pleased with the room portion of our stay (although there is SOOO much more to this hotel than just your room!).One day I needed out of the hotel so I walked to the Opry Mills mall next-door. It was about a 10-15 minute walk. There is a complimentary hotel shuttle on the half hour of each hour though.Two complaints (minus 1 star so really just fair warnings): #1 - the lines: mid week the lines for everything were almost unbearable (coffee shop, breakfast places, etc). they really cram a whole lot of conferences in and the place gets crazy#2 - the prices: food is very expensive for what you get (my two egg, hash brown plus biscuit breakfast @ Cascades was $22 before tip! Two rolls of sushi and a non alcoholic mocktail @ Wasabi was $44 before tip!)MUST DO'S:- relax by the falls in Cascades in the AM with your coffee or in the PM with a beverage of your choice- ride the Delta river boat AT NIGHT (we highly enjoyed hearing the history of the hotel and seeing the view at night...bring a beverage along with you)- watch the Delta fountain shows from the balcony outside of the pizza place on Delta island (we loved the ""Aqua"" show @ 8PM)- go up the the Delta mezzanine for a beautiful view of almost the entire Delta atrium- splurge with dinner at Old Hickory (you will get the most bang for your buck here... be sure to make reservations in advance)Also note that an Uber ride to downtown (Honky Tonks / Broadway) was $16-$18 (so if you are planning on eating elsewhere figure that into the cost you will save over the expensive resort restaurants).OVERALL: this is something to do and show around out of towners. I've been here at least 3 times, but twice was more than enough for me. A OK rating for me. I'm not a big plant person but I think if you are then you'll love this place. WHAT: Inside is basically a jungle garden forrest with a man made river running through it. You can take a boat ride on it during business hours and they take a photo of you that you can purchase. I think it's better to see inside during the day. But better to see outside at night especially during the holidays when they have all the Christmas lights decorating the trees outside. KIDS: Every time I've been here they have some kind of children's exhibit fun activity for them. It's usually during a range of hours though. EAT: Restaurants are definitely over priced but it is a hotel so that's expected. Ice cream place was yummy. Nice bathrooms. I thought this would be a more happening place at night with the bars, but they were empty. PARKING: $21 for self parking. Free if up to 20 minutes but I swear their clock tacks on an extra 10 min so you have to pay the fee.Dreadful stay at the Gaylord Opryland. Check-In: Aggressive check-in woman.  I simply expected a King room that I had reserved.  She stated that bed type reservations were simply ""requests."" She proved her point by sending me to the farthest room in the 2200+ room hotel basement (I'm not kidding...I had to find the only elevator that went ""down"" from the lobby level and then walk past the hotel laundry department to get to my room).Pillows:  Three postage stamp sized pillows for the king bed were not enough for one person because they were so flimsy.  While on the subject of the bed, the sheets were so thin they were see-through - kinda gross.The room-service Eggs Benedict were atrocious. A rather anemic looking plate (see photo) with a ramekin of the most horrendous tasting hollandaise sauce I have ever experienced. Do they buy this powdered sauce mix from an army surplus store? Nothing else on the plate - no hash browns or potatoes of any kind were included with this eggs Benedict... Cheap kitchen, not so cheap price. The rooms are dated and certainly very dark and dreary. The windows have been locked shut (see photo) so don't expect any fresh airDead battery in the in-room safe (see Photo). Oh joy!!! What a process to get a battery:  Called to explain that the battery in the safe was dead. They sent security to confirm that yes, the battery was dead (the flashing ""BATT"" was a giveaway I guess. The security person then authorized a maintenance person to come and change the battery. Maintenance arrived and replaced the battery. So glad I had an hour to kill in my dreary room for this lovely experience.$30 (one way) Gaylord Resort shuttle to the airport was just one of many outrageous charges at this hotel.  A cab is a $25 flat rate for up to 4 people.  Housekeeping arrived at 5:50PM to clean the room.  I had called hosuekeeping at around 3:30 simply to make sure they hadn't overlooked the room.  The snippy person on the phone said: ""Because this is such a large hotel, we have until 6PM to clean your room.""  Well OK then.  I guess she was exactly right.  I've never experienced anything like it and I practically live in hotels. On a positive note, the bellman that carted our luggage (for miles and miles) to our room was a delight.  I think his name was Nick? or Victor?  He said that he started at the hotel in 2001, took a break, and came back to work there.  He was charming and pleasant.  Also, the ballroom dinner was very good with attentive service during the reception and the dinner.Nashville is a likable city but my stay at the Gaylord Nashville has made me dislike Nashville immensely.  It's one thing to have a tired convention hotel but I did not expect the surly staff to go with it.Note: This is not a review of the accommodationsI met up with some friends here because we wanted to stroll around the holiday displays. First, this place is a freakin' maze. It took us about 20 minutes to find each other. There are walkways at all different elevations, walkways that dead end and no real landmarks to tell someone where you are. Very confusing and the maps are not helpful. Second, the decorations and displays are pretty lame. Definitely not worth the time, which brings me to the next point: more than $20 for parking? What a joke. This isn't Disney World. Not worth the money.We had lunch at the Jack Daniel's Saloon, and it was one of the worst meals I've had in recent memory. My burger had such a gross flavor that I ended up throwing away nearly all of it. The waitress didn't even think to ask about it when she took away my full plate.Skip this place!So far 45 minutes in valet line to check in and still 2 cars back. So, not worth a dime in my book.Update, very slow morning... Still waited over 20 minutes to get car so we could leave for town. Did enjoy watching the valet guys stand around and play shadow basketball. Good timesHow did I not know about this winter wonderland? We did a great holiday getaway, took in the Gatlin Brothers dinner shoe at the hotel and toured the Christmas displays.  If you have mobility issues and have a scooter...you will need it..so bring it along...the place is the size of Delaware.  Using a cane or walker?...They rent scooters at the front desk area for $50 a day.  Retail shops are great...your biggest problem will be picking one of the over 20 restaurants.  We ordered eggs over easy from room service on a busy weekend and they arrived in perfect shape...WOW!But the thing I was the most endeared by were the thousands of families from all over the world that have made family reunions at this property a holiday tradition.  We saw hundreds of families lining everyone up on holiday decorated staircases, in front of poinsettia Christmas trees, and other displays for family group selfies...I came to tears when I saw a middle aged Jewish man offer to take the family photo of a group speaking Arabic...this hotel is a great holiday stop.(Two tips for management:  1.  I had a great spa experience..and recommend you put together some end princess packages..ala Disney...for the mom's and girl's of these families to get group mani pedis...  (ala Disney's spa traditions for younger girls...stock some tiaras..).  2.  Put up some Christmas backdrops in some of the extra space in the Tennesee wing..or elsewhere ...and let families get professionals to take some holidays family photos just in case the selfies fail..perhaps you do and I missed it..but it would be easy for you and would turn  profit...)The grounds at Opryland Resort is nothing short of stunning. All the landscaping is well maintained, and it's a mini-town under a giant dome (think Jim Carrey's movie The Truman Show) full of shops, restaurants, bars, a spa, and even a indoor riverboat tour (think gondola ride at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas). Every room as a view of the courtyard/town, and it's so convenient that it's connected to the Convention Center. The rooms were clean and modern. The bed was comfortable. I loved having the blackout curtains and the balcony that you can sit out on and enjoy the view. My only complaint of the room would have to be the temperature control. It was impossible to get the room to a comfortable temperature. Honestly, with the hotel being as big as it is, I'm surprised it doesn't have some sort of internal transportation system, i.e. golf carts, stops on the riverboat, etc. I, of course, was given a room on the farthest opposite end from the convention center as possible, and I was schlepping a heavy backpack for the 3 days I was there, so needless to say, my currently pregnant self was not happy with how much I had to walk just to get to and from my room and the work conference I was attending. There is an airport shuttle which runs every half hour as well as a shuttle that can take you to downtown Nashville (you can buy a day pass).It really is a cool place to stay if you've never stayed there before. Even if you don't stay there, make a stop there just to see the place and walk around. It's an experience to remember.This hotel is one egregious mistake. While the atriums are certainly stunning, the dated hotel rooms, poorly managed food services and overly rude staff work against the few niceties that the hotel failingly attempts to offer. I had to move hotel rooms due to a sewage problem in mine, asked about wifi and was told I had to be a hotel guest (which I obviously was), and not one restaurant has over a 3 star rating on yelp...but they certainly have 5 star prices.I stayed here for a conference way back in 2007. It was gorgeous, the hotel was clean, there was a lot of southern hospitality. Everywhere I went I told people this was amongst one of the best hotels I've been to. I've always wanted to come back because my first time was such a great experience.Fast forward 8 years and I'm finally back. On this trip, my connecting flight in Washington, D.C. was cancelled and I wasn't be able to catch another flight until the following day. I called the hotel to inform them I was still coming and not to give my room away. The guy I spoke to said that would be fine, but he thinks I should also talk to the customer service manager. He transferred me and I got a recorded message asking me to call back during business hours.The following day when I arrived, I was assisted by Kimberly. She had nasty fake red hair and a stank face. She didn't even return my greeting!!   She informed me there weren't any rooms available since I didn't check-in on the right date. Instead, she could put me in a room with a sofa. She told me that they'd provide a foam mattress topper for the pull out sofa bed. I was appalled!! Why would they have rooms without beds?!! I told her I called and a guy told me my situation would be okay. Even though he transferred me, I didn't get a hold of anyone. I demanded to talk to a manager. After several minutes of her making a stank face and several huffs and puffs later, Kimberly decided not to call her manager but magically ""found"" a room for me. This just goes to show she was lying and trying to cheat me since they overbooked! Baiting me with a room and switching me for a substandard room!I was assigned to a room in the delta section of the hotel. The beds were lumpy, the pillows are super thin and worn. I was not impressed.On top of the poor service and lumpy beds, this already expensive hotel also charges an $18/day resort fee: fitness room, two bottles of water per day, slow internet, etc. The hotel/airport shuttle also costs more than a taxi so don't use it!Also, our conference brought over 4,000 attendees. Why the hell would the restaurants NOT be opened for lunch?!!! Only a handful (Cascades, Stax) were open on a Monday?!! The lines were long and pretty ridiculous.Once again, when I checked out of the hotel at 3 AM (I had a 5:35 AM flight out of Nashville), I found two unfriendly woman at the front desk. Their hair was thrown up in a gross looking, loosey goosey, half ways pulled through ponytails and stank faces. They looked like shit and sounded grumpy. WHY would they employ such unprofessional people to represent the face of such a beautiful resort?!!Lastly, if you plan on visiting Nashville, this hotel is rather far from the hustle and bustle. A taxi ride or uber ride is about 20 minutes each way. This is very inconvenient. If you plan on never leaving the resort, and it's completely possible to never leave the resort during your stay, then the distance to civilization won't be a big deal. But what's a trip to Music City without enjoying the music scene in The District?It's the most ginormous resort I have ever seen. The reception was a mad house with hundreds and hundreds of people checking in for New Year's eve. You would have to see it to believe it. We walked from one themed area to another, and another and another, you could lose a few pounds walking around, improving your memory as you get lost from the turns and corners while navigating around and spend lots of money. There was a ice sculpture event going on also which we didnt go to. However in one of the atrium there was a water fountain show which was spectacular. There were many convenient store where one could find bath salts or lotion or souvenir, many F&amp;B outlets to hang out. It's quite a place to check out....Huge hotel in terms of atrium space and where the rooms are placed. So big, in fact, that you have to obtain a map at the front desk to see which wing of the hotel that your room is located at. I wound up staying within the Cascades wing, and even getting to the elevator was challenging both to myself &amp; other guests, even through the use of the map.Steeped in prestige within the Nashville area, the Gaylord Opryland hotel is somewhat reasonable in price in terms of what is offered. I paid roughly $129 for a one night stay while on business, and the most memorable feature of the hotel wasn't even the room. It was most certainly the majestic atrium areas that contained fish and waterfalls, and fountains, as well as other amenities expected for a resort-style hotel. The eateries, such as the coffee cafe, had prices that were expected for any hotel comparable with a Marriott Courtyard cafe, and the quality was good. You have the choice of having valet parking, or parking your car in the adjacent lot (quite massive) that you'll have to walk a little more than two city blocks to get to the hotel. Upon entering, you'll encounter two massive front desk areas on both sides of the lobby. Considering that this hotel is always busy, the process was somewhat efficient, even with 10 people in front of you. The rooms itself was okay and up to my standards. The furniture, particularly the bed, desk and bureau, was somewhat unique yet possibly common to how furniture was made in Tennessee fashion. Hard to explain. Although the furniture was updated, it had an old, classic feeling to it. Nonetheless, staying at the Gaylord Opry is like walking through a massive work of art with Luciano Pavarotti singing ""Nessun Dorma"" in your ear as you walk to your room with a glass of scotch. Truly memorable.The Opryland Resort is nothing if not spectacular! Delta Island with its fountain and boat rides is bustling with shopping. The Garden Conservatory is relaxing and serene. The Cascades Atrium has many waterfalls.There are many restaurants to choose from. The food is pricey; but, it is very convenient to have all of those options available without having to go out.  Stay away from Jack Daniels Saloon though, it was by far the worst service and food Ive had in a long time and super pricey.This is quite a spectacular hotel, with the rooms facing huge (as in HUGE) atriums filled with plants, waterfalls, rockwork and rivers. There are many restaurants scattered about, and the theming is really well done. Having been to the Gaylord in Orlando, I was surprised to be reminded how much larger and nicer this Nashville one is.As with any giant hotel, there are hordes of guests, so part of the trick of staying here is to try to avoid the rush. That means not arriving right at check in, when there can be 100 people in line at the front desk, particularly on a Saturday night. And if your room includes breakfast, go early before the lines form.Staff is very friendly, so as long as you can avoid the crowds it's a good place to stop in Nashville (note that it is nowhere near downtown, though).While I have not yet had the experience of stay in one of the rooms yet, I will say the atrium is stunning. It doesn't feel like you are in Nashville once inside. There is a man made river with a gondolier and beautiful garden grounds. Do not visit if you don't have some extra cash to spend. Everything from the food, to the shopping, even a simple ice cream cone is outrageously expensive - so keep that in mind.This is definitely something everyone should experience however when visiting Nashville. I do plan to stay in a suite soon, and will update my review accordingly.I was there for a professional convention.  It was horrible.  There is zero customer service.  The blow dryer in the room was from 1987 and did not blow hot air.  The air conditioning system is also outdated.  The ice machine didn't work on many floors.  It was very large and I had trouble navigating, but if they had friendly, knowledgeable customer service agents easily accessible, it wouldn't have been a problem.  When we got to the check-in line, there was maybe two agents there.  1300 people were registered for the conference. I've had to call a couple of times and when they couldn't help me, they just asked me to call back (not taking my name and number and offering to return my call).  This is supposed to be a swanky hotel, but my experience was unpleasant. They need an overall customer service training session ASAP.","The gardens are really the most amazing thing about this place. The fact that something like this place is under one roof is amazing. I was in the area and just happened to walk in. The parking is expensive but we found a dirt lot near the freeway. So it was about a one block walk to the hotel. This place caters to large meeting places and conferences. All I did was walk around when we were visiting the Country Music Hall of Fame.Stopped off here on the way to Nashville. 20 mins free parking will get you a whistle stop power walk through the gardens. Really impressive!This property is beautiful, big spacious, great greenery, the atrium gardens and river with the boat are a site to see and explore. The room was a descent size and had a great cute patio, the bathroom i wished would have had two sinks but it was good nonetheless and fridge. the only thing was the room did take a bit to get to the temp I wanted it at, and also was a little humid, but the door open to the patio would clear it. Otherwise this was a good spot to stay, lots of shuttles, nearby places to eat, pools and workout rooms were awesome.A giant convention center hotel that is totally cold, impersonal, uncaring, and lacking basic signage and help once you are trapped within the bowels of the facility.The rooms are nice, and despite many complaints to the contrary, I found the internet service to be passable.As a Marriott Rewards level at the Platinum Premier status, I can tell you that you would never know it here.  There is no attempt made to offer any special amenities or benefits for a Platinum level guest.  So you may as well be John Doe to these guys.The property is so massive and the directions inside are so convoluted, missing, and misleading that you can easily get lost.  It is NOT fun.Honestly, if you have a choice, stay elsewhere.Never for the rest of my existence will I voluntarily stay at this Gaylord property. Upon check-in, we had to wait two and a half hours for the room to be ready. Thankfully we had rented a car so we didn't have to sip overpriced cocktails at the hotel bars. When we did finally get the room keys, we had to navigate this maze monstrosity - the directional signage leaves much to be desired. I once asked a member of the staff if he could direct me to the ballroom I was looking for, and he looked at me blankly before saying, ""I work mostly in the lobby area, sorry.""The billing was a nightmare, too. My company had paid for all of our employee rooms, so we only had to provide a card for incidentals. But for most of us, not only did the company get charged, our credit cards were charged, too.I came along for the ride to hubby's 5 day convention and was engulfed into a giant bubble city. Here are most of the ups and the downs of my stay.THE GOOD:It is a beautiful property. There are streams and bridges and fountains and ponds all laced with gorgeous flowers and plantings. Sort of like being in Oz. I kept looking for the Munchkins to no avail.Most of the resort employees are wonderful. At my request, I received extra bottled water every morning and at no charge. The Wasabi restaurant rocks! I enjoyed delicious Sushi that tasted like it was flown in from Japan.Every meal I ordered, by the pool or at one of the resort restaurants, came quickly and was delicious.The Spa! If you are having a treatment you are able to utilize everything in the Spa that day. Sauna, steam, shower, lockers, teas, fruit and nuts, coconut water, shampoo, conditioner, a plush comfy robe, relaxation room, plus everything you need to dry and style your hair before you leave...AND, the fantastic pool adorned with cute cabana boys.A Starbucks with lots of gluten free selections. (Shocking, really.)There are several great retail shops that include a Johnston Murphy and Cowgirls and Angels.Free Wi-Fi because we are Marriott repeaters. THE BAD:It's freakin' HUGE and it takes days to learn directions! Leaving a trail of breadcrumbs doesn't work as the staff sweeps them up quickly. And, some employees don't exactly know their way around. (Um...'scuse me but this should be on the final exam before hiring.)Only a few restaurants are open during the day. Food is extra costly at the hotel restaurants. For example, my ""large"" bowl of tortilla soup, although tasty, was a cereal size bowl and cost $9.00.You are living in a creepy bubble. The environment, temperature, music and smiling employees are completely controlled. Hunger Games, anyone?I don't even know where to start with these guys. Disclaimer: I got a $50 credit from them after complaining.I compiled a list of things wrong with this place.  There are too many to make this a fluid post, so I'm just going to post them as I wrote them.  Keep in mind this is for a place that portrays itself as a high end resort.- Only 3 pillows for a king bed- Tears on headboard (see pic)- No ottoman for the old, worn chair- $23 to park plus a ""resort fee"" of $18- Beat up furniture long overdue for replacing.  One nightstand was missing knob- Carpet worn and was separating from wall- Dirty walls throughout room and bathroom- Said I had FedEx package when we checked in.  Told me where FedEx office was.  After walking forever and making many wrong turns, it turns out FedEx office was closed.  Also, I actually had no package.  It was for another person with same name, picked up days earlier.- Fridge was leaking and not working- No signage anywhere in the hotel with directions to Opry Mills- This place should have phones everywhere for people who are lost- Many employees did not speak English- Operators there have this annoying routine they do.  They answer the phone and say, ""To better serve you, could you please state your name?""  So I say, ""Bill.""  ""How can I help you?""  I'm like, why did you ask for my name?- Very long waits on hold to speak to operators- We had a birthday cake and needed something to light candles.  They had nothing!- Pot of coffee from room service:  $14 for small and $17 for large- There is no contact information for the hotel GM. In most quality hotels, that info is at the front desk in form of the GM's personal business card.- Bill was screwed up when we checked out and we had to have it fixed.- They slap a $50 charge for incidentals even when you have a credit card on file, which is BS.Bottom line is that this is not worth what you pay.  Very stressful staying here.  Hard to get around and no one there to help you.  But believe me, they couldn't care less about negative comments when they are raking it in.The hotel itself is massive and quite impressive when you first walk in and the landscape throughout with the many fountains makes for a very nice setting. Lines can be long for checking, they are a Marriott partner which helped us by pass or would have been 20-30 minute wait. Pros- beautiful hotel with a lot of waterfalls, koi ponds, and  running water.Beds imo are very comfortableA lot of shopping and restaurant options.Cons- service at restaurants and quality of food is below average. Although there are many different places to dine only half were open. If you are going to stay you would be best served eating elsewhere.Do not come here unless it is on the company dime. Seriously.We are halfway through our vacation and are already itching to leave. 1) The ""extra"" costs (including water) are Manhattan prices or higher. Literally every time we turn around we are astonished at the high price or the hidden fee. We are on vacation and expect to pay a higher price at a resort, and yet are still floored at what is happening. 2) They should take the word ""resort"" out of their name. It is 100% a conference center. Sure the gardens are pretty and well manicured, but there isn't any place to relax and be comfortable. I cannot stress this enough. Unless you are coming here for a conference, don't. 3) All those restaurants they boast having... 9/10 are closed all day. They are either completely closed, or closed for a private event (remember, it is 100% a conference center...). So, if you want to eat here, you have to go to one of 2(?) that they have open. 4) Think this is a nice resort to stay at while you visit Nashville? Look back at my #1. The shuttle that takes you downtown is $20/person. Lol. Thanks for nothing Opryland.This place is the worst marriott I have ever stayed in, and I am a Platinum member. Total rip off every-time you turn around. It should not be called resort, because there is nothing to do. Only one or two of the restaurants are open each night and they are all atrociously overpriced. And they charge you 20$ per person for a shuttle to go into town. 25$ a day in parking, and 4$ for a coffee. Its like a bad joke. Trust me look elsewhere. Id rather be at the courtyard. At least there I can get a reasonable breakfast for under 20$.The atmosphere is superb.  The rooms are adequate.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Now for the negatives:  there are over 2,800 rooms and only one sit-down restaurant in the entire place to get breakfast.  It is beautifully set, but not that large.  There are a couple of coffee areas in the Conservatory area with a total of 16-20 seats in  a very dimly lit, grungy corner. Yuk!All other restaurants open much later in the day and some not until dinner time.   There are no seating alcoves or hallway seating areas anywhere that I have found.  There are two gigantic fireplaces in the Magnolia lobby.  Each have seating for six people.  All in all, you will be able to walk miles and miles in here, but good luck finding a place to land.  Is this really southern hospitality at its finest?  For that, I'd give it only one star.Visiting Nashville you have to come here right? Right. So I did. The idea was to come in and look at the gardens and walk around.  First red flag: $23 for parking? You've got to be out if your mind. Madness! There was no way we were doing that. My friend and I are from NYC, we're walkers. We decided to park across the street and hoof it. We entered the lobby and just started to look around. The signage is not the best. Perhaps they don't wish to have obtrusive signs, but it's confusing as hell. The employees actively avoid eye contact with you so you don't ask them anything and when you do, it's clear they only know about the section they work in. Which I get, but it's not helpful to a visitor. I was impressed at the scope of the jungle/lobby area. That took a lot of planning and takes a ton of maintenance. The plants are beautiful and lush. I can imagine that it's more colorful in summer, assuming they plant flowers as well.  Water features were also nice. The rest of it seems really contrived to me. Beautiful in that Disney way, which is perhaps what they were looking for. Im glad I went and visited. It was something to see in Nashville, that I had heard about forever.So, four stars. Wasn't blown away and we often found ourselves drunk and confused wandering around. It's really easy to get lost here and it's frustrating the people who work there aren't always capable of helping you find your way. Also, the restaurants open and close without warning. That's kind of annoying - planning to go somewhere for dinner walking what seems like 5 miles to get there and they are closed. The Valet was weird.. We pulled up and instead of coming to open the door for us, the group of kids working in the valet just stood there. Maybe this is a Bible Belt slow thing : ) haha in LA the valet open your door before your car is in park sheesh. I would stay here if you are visiting Nashville for the full country music and experience. If not, stay downtown!We came here for the express purpose of checking out the multiple lobbies of this expansive resort! I can see why it is a convention center because there is a TON of space to accommodate large groups. The lobbies are absolutely beautiful and it was a nice break from the TN mugginess that we had been experiencing during our visit! My mom, kiddo and I did a huge lap around the place and were not disappointed for a DIY free walking tour. Lol. There is a boat tour that you can take, but we skipped out on it since we were in a hurry to get to dinner. It puts you in mind of a lot of the Las Vegas lobbies, without the flair. To my disappointment, the majority of the staff there is not very friendly, as compared as to the majority of the people we had met in Nashville. Often staff would pass us and not speak or even make eye contact with us! We were tourists just like any others wandering around and this was definitely not a ""tony"" property, so I do not know what that was all about. I am not sure if I would bother with staying in the hotel, just because it is SO large and feels disconnected, community-wise. I saw guests at check-in but I do not envy those who have to make the trek from one side of the hotel to the other. Again, it is worth your time to look and walk around as a ""to-do"" in Nashville!I booked a stay at the Gaylord Opryland Resort on Priceline for a Friday-Sunday in the beginning of August. I'm going to start with the negatives:We got a good rate for the room but were surprised by the resort fee. When checking out and paying for parking, I was charged this resort fee again despite having already paid Priceline for it. I fought it but the desk worker wasn't having it. We were not given a print out of charges underneath our door like a message on our phone the previous evening told us we would. Because of this, I was unprepared to fight an incorrect charge. The line was long, the worker didn't believe me, and I didn't want to make everyone wait while I looked through my email to prove I had already paid this $18/night charge. The second huge negative of our trip was the maid service. We had a wake up call scheduled for 9 but a little after 8 we hear banging on our door. I thought it must be next door because who the heck is knocking on our door that loudly at 8? They knocked again and I opened to find a maid. She gave me some towels. I was half asleep still so I honestly don't remember telling her to not come back but maybe I did. No one ever came back to clean our room. Thank god we had gotten more towels or that would have sucked. After we left for the day around 10, we removed the do not disturb sign I had put on the door when the maid showed up. According to the hotel people are cleaning until 6 PM. And still no one cleaned our room. I can understand why a lot of people might be up and at 'em on a weekday as this hotel is attached to the convention center. But it was Saturday. We checked in at 1 AM the night before. We had a wake up call for an hour later. I know the maid couldn't have known that, but I really wish she could have. And dang it I just wanted to not be the one to make the bed. Another not great surprise was believing valet parking was $23. When we saw self parking we figured it had to be cheaper. Wrong. Self was $23 and valet was $31. Just a mix up but disappointing. For the positives of this hotel:The main reason I would consider staying at this hotel again was the downtown shuttle. It was fantastic. For $20/day or $30/3 days you could ride the shuttle back and forth as many times as you wanted. Someone else in the hotel told me that uber was $20 one way. We rode it around 11 and then came back during the hottest part of the day. We got cleaned up and rode it back for dinner/going out. It was great to not worry about drinking and driving. The beds were soft but not crazy soft. It was interesting walking around the hotel lobby and looking at all the water falls and such. One great thing about our room was outside the bathroom was an additional sink and vanity. It made it a lot easier for two girls to get ready. Next time I might consider rebooking if only for the shuttle. It was the hotels saving grace. If not I would just stay downtown since we already had to pay an arm and a leg to park any how.This is my second night here and I will start with the good stuff. This hotel is magical, I have never seen anything like this place. The restaurants are good. The steakhouse food was amazing but we waited 1.1/2 for our steaks, Alan was our server and he was a sweetheart. The breakfast buffet had a lot of selections and all the staff where very friendly and helpful.  Now, please stay somewhere else to sleep!! When we checked in, we first walked in to see hair, mud, and blood on the floors. With little kids, I just cleaned it up and called the front to let them know. The front was very helpful and made sure the room was cleaned, even calling me to make sure it was to my standards.  But my reason for the 2 stars is the noise. Our room (g1009) faced the parking lot. They had busses lined up throughout the day and night. The noise was unheard of.  Waking my 1 year old from naps and sleep. I called the front and they said it would be removed, but it wasn't. They still stayed this morning and loaded people up. When I tell you how load it was! You would not believe me. If you like your sleep, stay elsewhere and come here for the day. Not worth the money and daily fees. I'm booked to stay till Sunday and I'm waiting to speak to a manager this morning. I will be posting more pictures and comments of the rest of our stay.For the price, I expect more. It's very noisy in the rooms and pillows are so flat - my neck hurt the whole trip. I called room service and asked for synthetic pillows instead of down and they were just as deflated. Zero blankets in the room, just sheets which were in pretty bad shape.There are barely any plugs in the room for your electronics and a previous guest unplugged the iHome, probably to charge their phone. I called the ""consider it done"" front desk and asked them to reset my clock radio and she says, ""what time does it say now?"" It's wrong, does it really matter?Nothing is free with your stay. The resort fee is $15 plus tax, which includes wiFi and 2 water bottles. Wow! Parking and shuttles are extra.Was here for a conference, but stayed in the Cascades area which is almost a mile to the convention center. If you're staying for a conference, book in the Delta area unless you want to hike over every morning.The shops are all overpriced cheap and tacky souvenirs. Many of the restaurants are closed a few days a week and nothing is open late.I think my expectations might have been a little too high. From everything I had read or heard about the Opryland resort, I was set on a week of awesome amenities and plenty of relaxation and pampering. However, I was met by fairly unhelpful signage (it will tell you to take elevator ""R1"" to access the pool area from the spa, but not actually how to find the spa), rooms keys that were continuously deactivated (causing many 0.5 mile hikes up and down stairs and over bridges to get to the front desk and back), and amenities that were open...sporadically (I know, I know. The first week in November is probably not peak season. Tell that to my $300/night rate.). It's a great place to visit once, but I don't think I'll be back!My husband eloquently described our stay this way: ""it's a beautiful place. Not sure what all the hype is about though.""To give a couple of examples of what I consider to be sub-par service for a place so obviously vying for an upper class clientele:-Waiters/Waitresses not saying anything after you are seated, just standing and assuming you will speak first to give a drink order-Restaurant staff placing the bread basket in front of just one seat (instead of mid-table) and not describing the contents-Sparkling wine, ordered by the bottle, not being chilled at the table and having to refill glasses on our own-Having to pay for parking with a credit card, because the room key wouldn't work to allow us out of the self parking lot, and the gate employee coming over to tell us that is what we had to do if our key didn't work (it's not...more inquiries at the front desk led to the discovery that we would have been double-charged for parking that day had we not inquired further)-Restaurants being closed with a generic sign asking us to visit another option (without stating what or where those options were)-Restaurants and shops closing at 8pm. Acceptable on a weekday. Completely unacceptable for what is sold as an ""inclusive"" resort on a Saturday night.Maybe my stay was out of the ordinary.  Maybe.Just finished a 3 day stay at the Nashville Gaylord hotel.  The place is ginamous. The layout leads you to many long walks getting to and from your room. Here is the lowdown as we saw it.Rooms were typical fare. We had to get reassigned to get a king even though we had requested it. The king room had a nice view of the loading dock, dumpsters and standby generators.  Not a real issue as we did not come to sit and look out the window. The staff was mostly friendly though the English was a struggle for some.  We got lost one evening trying to find the ice cream shop and one of the staff dropped what she was doing and insisted in personally escorting us over there. When we left we got lost and came back to the ice cream shop and the same lady then took us all the way across the facility to our rooms.  She got a nice tip for her helpfulness. I did get yelled at by a staffer protecting a table of box lunches. Told me his table was closed and to go to the other table. I gave him a look and complied. Walked 30 ft to next table and got box, turned to leave and his table had been swarmed. Stupid. They were all the same lunches.  He did not get a tip. The hotel is convenient to surrounding shopping and Opry, but the traffic is very congested.    The shear size and the atrium would dazzle kids. They were decorating for Christmas and it looked like it would be a wonderland when lite. We were with a corporate group so I don't know what the rates were. Looking online I'm guessing $250 plus taxes and such. Parking showed to be $24 a night.  We had quite a long wait for valet parking and calling ahead did not help. I would note that my 3 stars are pretty good. I rarely give a 5 as that would mean there was nothing left to possibly improve.  But this facility did lack the edge of some of the better Marriott properties we have visited.I love this hotel! I've stayed here once but have been here multiple times during Christmastime. The hotel is massive so if you're with family, make sure you keep an eye on the kiddos - it's easy to get lost in (I've done it more times than I care to admit). The room I stayed in was clean, really pretty, and had a nice view. Hotel staff are friendly and willing to help you if you need it. I HIGHLY recommend coming at Christmastime, it is simply gorgeous. It is close to the Grand Ole Opry and Opry Mills mall (literally walking distance) and about 10-15 minutes from downtown. Also close to the airport. Definitely one of my favorite hotels in Nashville!","horrible housekeeping, concierge, restaurant service!! do not stay here if you value respect or customer service!If you want to see Nashville - stay downtown.  If you want a resort - go elsewhere!  Pools - a joke.  2 very small pools.  Don't open until 9am, and even at 9:30 on Saturday morning the 'Pool Closed' signs were still up and there were no towels!  The Cascade pool was packed because the only other tiny pool was closed due to dirty water.  Then within an hour they made everybody get out of this pool because of a ""chemical imbalance"" in the water.  If you can't keep 2 tiny pools clean, you are not a resort.  Housekeeping - on day one we left early, and returned to our rooms around 5pm to relax and get ready for dinner.  Rooms were still dirty, no clean towels.  Called down and was told housekeeping has until 6pm to clean.  WHAT?!?!?  I have never stayed at a hotel where you sat in a dirty room all day!  Despite request for early service, our rooms were never cleaned before 5pm.  Unacceptable.  WiFi - free wifi, generally slow.  I was constantly knocked off, had to login several times a day.    Restaurants - $4.50 for a cup of fake starbucks.  Whatever.  I guess if you call yourself a ""resort"" you can do that.  Restaurants were overpriced and always seemed to be closed, even when they were scheduled to be open. There are tons of great local eats if you have a car - The Pharmacy, Arnold's, Puckett's (Best fried chicken &amp; waffles!).  I wouldn't waste your money here.  Also, they boast live music every night.  All we found was 2 guys singing Margaritaville in Jack Daniel's bar, which smelled so bad we walked out immediately :)  Parking - In a word...Extortion.  $30/day + tips for valet (where people complained of having to wait 30 minutes to get their car) or $25/day for the pleasure of parking in a lot a mile away.    Keep in mind you're already paying a daily ""resort fee.""  I guess that's to keep up the 2 dirty pools...  The atriums are beautiful, waterfalls and foliage - but that's about the only compliment I can give.  The only thing that makes this a resort is the $18 a day resort fee they charge.  If you really want to experience Nashville - stay downtown!Came here to walk around and enjoy the lushness of the plants. Wow this place is amazing. So many types of trees, plants and flowers. I can't imagine how much work goes into maintaining it. Thumbs up Opryland.We stayed here for one night only due to it's proximity to the Grand Ole Opry. As you can see by the photo's, the place is gorgeous. And enormous. Did I mention expensive? And I don't mean just the room charge, I paid in advance so I knew the price. Everything there is expensive with lot's of hidden fees. For instance, when you pay $318 for a room wouldn't you think the parking lot would be included in the price? Um, no, you pay an additional 24.00 for the parking lot. And what exactly is the $18.00 ""resort fee"" which is added to the bill? I'm not certain but I think it was for the wifi. I never did quite figure that one out. The $38.00 meal from room service is actually a $52.00 meal....somehow. The room itself was clean and comfortable with the furnishings being a cut above most hotels in quality. But that apparently  doesn't mean you won't be awakened at 3:00 am by drunken hillbillies screaming in the hallways and beer bottles left in the elevator.Still, I enjoyed my stay there and it was nice to catch their shuttle to the Opry instead of having to mess around with the traffic.I plan to attend the Opry once each year but it is unlikely that I will stay here again. I will either deal with the traffic or see if I can find another hotel with a shuttle. Not trying to discourage anyone from staying here though. It really is beautifulAre we sure that the Great Wall is the only man-made structure visible from outer space? You'll excuse me for wondering whether the Gaylord should be included on that list. Driving up I wondered if those astronauts up on the ISS weren't also gawking at this monstrosity. When I learned that an up-coming conference I had to attend would be held at Opryland, there were a lot of expectations conjured up surrounding this piece of Americana. What I wasn't expecting was an edifice with its own biosphere. Good grief. Rivers, rainforest, waterfalls, and a complete plantation-like village all under an expansive, glistening, plexiglass sky. The one thing I'll remember from my time at the Gaylord Opryland is the labyrinth of lobbies, corridors, and gardens. I think I spent a third of my time just trying to figure out how to get where I was supposed to be. And, those large, randomly-placed floor plans with the mocking ""You Are Here"" red dots were rarely helpful. After about 2 hours here, all I could think was: Overkill. But, this is America, ain't it? And, $20 a day parking. Yikes! They entrap you in their consumer maze and leech you dry of your life savings. In all fairness, my experience wasn't entirely negative. All of the conference facilities were top notch and we had nothing but pleasant interactions with hotel staff. My biggest complaint in this area was that our main meeting hall was FREEZING! If you're there for a conference, just bring your coat with you. Besides that once we did stumble upon our desired corner of this behemoth, we generally had a positive impression.Well, I can definitely say it was an experience. But, I don't even want to think about what the carbon footprint of this monster is.I'm here for a conference so I did not pay for the room but it certainly is quite roomy.  I wish the peep hole on the door were a little lower as my size 5' 2"" body could not look out and see who was (mistakenly) trying to get in my room at 10:30 pm.I will say the property is just beautiful but a bit confusing, I had to be at the governers room for a session and struggled with the map.  I found a staff member (collecting room service trays) and he was kind enough to walk me over there.Food from room service was not very good and I knew it would be costly but after the day I had yesterday trying to get here I felt I deserved it.  I ordered the all American and it was here withing 30 minutes delivered after they call you back to let you know it's ready and on its way.Bed is comfy enough and the room is clean which is all I ask for so 5 stars for that.Checking in took a little while but again with multiple conferences going on it didn't surprise me, you were kept entertained with a guitar playing singing cowboy who was quite amazing.Overall I probably wouldn't stay here if I were paying for it, too expensive and too noisy for my taste.This place is breathtakingly beautiful!!  I am simply in awe of the size, beauty, friendly staff and amazing ambience. We were given our rooms as a complimentary gift. We thought we would get a regular room, which would have been 100% fine with us. However, we were given an Atrium view room with a King size bed. We were shocked and surprised at the hospitality at the front desk. Our rooms are bigger than average size and perfect. Perfect beds, firm and comfortable. Extremely clean rooms with modern decor. Bathrooms are small but really how big does it need to be?  We have walked around most of the hotel. It's HUGE!  There is so much to offer. Arcade, dining, drinking, family fun, golf, river tours, shuttles, and so on. There is a ""small"" shopping Main Street area that is super cute. Live music all over the place!!! The hotel is so big you need a map to get around. It's like Disney for adults and kids too. If this isn't enough the Grande Ole Opry is 15 min by complimentary shuttle, the Opey Mills mall is close. Downtown music row and the museum is about 19 min away. Such an awesome experience all the way around...This hotel is amazing!! It is huge!!! The convention center is perfect for your business needs.  There are awesome places to dine. There's a gondola running through the hotel that is a must see .    It's close to downtown Nashville. The grand old Opry is right next door. The mills are around the corner as well . It has great shopping. You'll definitely do a lot of walking.  You can't get around that because of the size of the hotel. You can catch s can to get downtown . It's around $20.  There's enough to to do in the surrounding area if you don't want to venture out.  I would stay here in a sec on my return. Friendly staff , very helpful.  The prices are the same in the area. $$$I'm going with a 1 star rating. It is a beautiful hotel and the gardens are amazing. Other than that the overall experience is not good and left us feeling raped and abused. Long lines, slow service and high fees and prices on everything. Such as $30 for parking - one night. $18 resort fee - big rip off. Slow check in desk. All the time anytime of day or night. Mediocre food. $50 breakfast for 2. Hard to get around the hotel. The staff seems worn out and not really interested in providing good service. Overpriced rooms. We were there and most rooms were empty and yet they gave us a room with an outside view of a parking lot. Don't even attempt to discuss with them the outrageous fees or other issues. They are so tired of hearing it they will not entertain your issues. I'm sure this place was built on great service but wow they have lost it.Oh yeah, there was black mold in the shower area.This place is not for families. Be prepared to spend 450-500 dollars in food for three days. 24 dollar milk and cookies. No food from outside is allowed.  Restaurants in the hotel are more expensive than anywhere else in Nashville.  Ordered a pizza from outside restaurant staff was very hostile to me when I brought it in to hotel.This was such a beautiful convention center. We were told to walk the gardens and have lunch here. We do not expect it to be so large!  The streets reminded us of a ""clean"" New Orleans with the amazing ironwork outside the stores and the river running through it was stunning !  We sat at a bistro table enjoying the waterfall and watching the tourist in the little boat. If you have a few days in Nashville this place is a MUST SEE!I have mixed feelings about the Gaylord Opryland. For background, my family is from Florida and we stay at the Gaylord Palms (Orlando) about twice a year. That said, the physical plant here during our Christmas stay is nothing short of spectacular. I cannot imagine what the landscaping requires but they should make a reality TV show about it. The hotel is made up of four large hotels connected with giant glass ceilinged atriums filled with plants, waterfalls, walkways, boats in lazy rivers, fountains, and more. You have the feeling of being outdoors even though you are inside the whole time. The attention to detail is mind-boggling. Unlike other reviewers I found the Christmas decorations to be breathtaking and more than adequate; I just can't see how even the most picky guest could feel that the holiday was overlooked. The fountain light show is a must-see and the true Christmas holiday music was welcome. I could go on and on about more details (the outdoor Nativity, the giant Christmas tree, the beautiful lights on the grounds etc). Now for the not so great. First, perhaps not surprisingly, the GOH charges for *everything* and everything is pretty expensive in the GOH, from valet or even self-parking ($24/day). Worse, and I hate to say this, the service was well below expectations. The staff seemed harried and unhappy. Because you can't pull into the breezeway without a ""ticket"" you are required to queue to enter the hotel. Last night the valet staff was possibly on strike. There was a double line of 40+ cars and nothing at all happening in the breezeway but we were all held up by a single hotel manager who wasn't letting anyone in except for whenever a single valet appeared. After 20 minutes my wife got out, walked up and asked the poor guy what was going on. He said he had no idea why but the valets didn't come in to work. All of them. We abandoned the entryway and self-parked and entered on the other side of the hotel. We had an incident of late delivery of luggage when we checked in, which required multiple calls to the front desk and eventually a tense exchange where we were told that during a four-hour period our luggage had ""probably"" been attempted to have been delivered but because we didn't stay in the room (for four hours at dinnertime) the luggage wasn't delivered. I complained to the general manager who comped us four (4) breakfasts (even though there are five in our party and he confirmed that twice). I suspect that the service problems are a result of Marriott's acquisition of the property, but I'm just guessing.Finally, the room was meh. On check in, we asked for an upgrade and were provided one at a $65/night up charge; only problem was the view was of the trash handling facility for the hotel. I'm not kidding. Even though we were here in winter, the beds only offered a thin sheet --there were no comforters or blankets anywhere in the room! Fortunately we all brought sweats to sleep in (plus doubled socks).Now I understand the low ratings. The people were friendly, grounds were beautiful and beds comfy. What ranks it low and makes it so frustrating is lack of staff/service and overpricing. Everything we did took twice the time it should of for this caliber resort- Parking valet:  20 min. ($23 to self park even for just an hour) Room service for coffee and 2 oatmeals (55$): 50 minTrying to get someone on the phone: 10-15 min! Waiting in line to Check in at midnight: 25 min I'm writing this review hoping the management reads it and thinks about makings change and adding staff. If the service was up to par the costs wouldn't seem so ridiculous.Marriott Executive Platinum and so far this hotel has not lived up to its overhyped websites, it has under-delivered to say the least. We have experienced not having been greeted at the door on arrival, to having to get my own language cart at check-in, trying to track down someone to valet our car and even the unpleasant hostess staff at the restaurant for lunch right after check-in. The only person that was nice to us the entire stay was the bellhop that finally helped us with our bags.At $300 a night, I expected much more. I've been treated better at $80 per night courtyards and had better rooms in much better conditions. The rooms are old and outdated, lack plugs for today's electronics. Lights, Mirror's and bathroom are old, rusted and showing lots of wear; this hotel needs a major update or lower prices to reflect the condition. We had stains on the bedlinens, the throw pillows and even the blankets themselves. This was very gross and no one at the hotel cared about it one bit.Not having a Concierge Lounge is a big setback, if you don't have a lounge then at least provide a credit or coupon for breakfast for the loyal customers and elite members. This hotel is all about charging you to death, they charge and overcharge for everything that you need. Wi-Fi is poor only had one bar the entire time in my room and this at $12.99 per day. I think you can do much better and stay at a different hotel for the money. They even charged $9.95 for a 15 minute boat ride on a fake river.We just about went broke after eating inside the resort for one day. We shared meals most of the time and still didn't even come close to having an affordable meal. The various resort taxes and fees just complicate the pricing and add to the overall bills. $32.00 to valet park or $24.00 to self-park! That just does not add up, maybe $12 to self-park would be better.So for three night stay, 2 people in a standard room, parking and three meals (1 each Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner) $1,687.27 was the total price, all this along with having a dirty room, unclean linens.GO SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDGO SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDGO SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDGO SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDWe are here for our 30th wedding anniversary. This place is amazing: Easy to relax, easy to have fun.... With a wonderful staff. Some reviews complain about prices and crowds. Considering the quality and what must be maintained here, this place is a great value, even in comparison to other four and five star hotels I've stayed at. If you can't afford it, stay and dine elsewhere. Also try and get an atrium room, the balcony is worth it.Excellent pools and fitness center.The crowds are cyclical, and not an issue.... You can also plan on staying during the week to avoid them.In each restaurant we enjoyed good that was consistently very good to excellent... With excellent wait staff always.Things to do: the Opry is great, and I'm not much of a country music fan. The mall is nice if you're a shopper.We love to walk, and this is an excellent place to do it... Garden paths, waterfalls, fountains, bridges... Very nice.... Plan to get lost in a good way.Check-in was great, WiFi a bit weak at times, and room carpeting is getting a bit worn... But the rooms were very clean with comfortable beds and gray a.c. It's a unique venue, with amazing people who operate it. We will be back!This place is unreal. It's like a little city and botanical garden inside a biome. Hard to believe this place exists. The gardens are beautiful, the set up is wild. There's restaurants and coffee shops and retail shops located inside. You really have to see this to believe it. Only drawback: it costs $21 to park in the lot unless you go through it all in under 20 minutes, then its free. So either book it through the place or go park about 10 minutes away at the mall for free. Side note, when the zombie apocalypse occurs, I'm coming here. It has everything.My second visit to the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention center occurred about two weekends ago. The bad news is that this place is pricy and they charged about $23 for daily parking - which I think is ridiculous considering how much you put out for the room. The good news is that they give discounts to military and professors - not significant enough not to put a dent in your pocketbook but anything is better than nothing. The special they ran for teachers included two complimentary breakfasts and two shuttle rides which was a great deal. We enjoyed the breakfast buffets and the scrambled eggs but didn't use the shuttle because we did other things in the area. I do love that the wifi is free in all the rooms and throughout the hotel and that the outdoor pool had a DJ in the afternoon. Another great thing about the Gaylord is that it is adjacent to the Grand Ole Opry and mall. It's also conveniently located to downtown. It's a large space so if you walk around you will get your daily exercise.Today we spent the day in Nashville so we decided to stop in at Opryland after hearing so much about it from friends and family. This hotel, convention center and resort is incredible. The indoor gardens and delta are breathtaking while the staff here is pleasant and helpful.This complex has a little bit for everyone. They have a great selection of restaurants and they also have some great shops. We enjoyed sitting at their Falls restaurant overlooking the waterfalls. In the end we thoroughly enjoyed our experience and have made a promise to ourselves that we will return during their Christmas celebrations.The Opryland hotel in Nashville Tennessee has to be the second biggest hotel I've ever stayed at.  I have been to Vegas a bunch of times and this hotel reminds me of being in Vegas. The only difference is that the Opryland hotel is in the middle of nowhere there are no hotels comparable to what size in the area. When I arrived I had no idea how big this hotel was. The person who does travel frequently and stays in a lot of different hotels I was amazed at the sheer size for a non Las Vegas hotel. When I walked into the main lobby I went to the check-in area and it was decently crowded. I waited about five minutes and then I had a employee carry my stuff to the front desk. Everything went great with the checkin except for when the employee took out a map of the hotel. He explained me this is where I was and he took a sharpie and he draw where I had to go. On the map it looks like it wasn't that far and I felt fairly confident that I could get there. I left the front desk and went from the main lobby into the first planetarium dome. That's when it hit me how big this hotel was that it was going to be in adventure trying to find my room. I kept following the signs and looking at the map that said where my room was. All I ended up doing was getting myself more confused. Finally after about 15 minutes of trying to figure out what hallway I had to go down I ended up just asking an employee for help. The gentleman was extremely nice he took my stuff and he assisted me right to my room with no problem. The room itself was nice it was a double room I had three sinks in my bathroom I had a walk-in shower and the room was a regular hotel room there was nothing special about it. The room that we did have did not have an outdoor balcony. In the hotel itself there are three different conservatory domes. Each has their own name the one I stayed in was the mezzanine. In the entire hotel there is over 3000 hotel rooms. There are three pools. 16 to 18 restaurants and bars. There is also three convention centers well as the grand old Opry center. There is a full-size movie theater attached to the place to that had all the current movies. Just a huge FYI. This place is big and you will be walking a long time to get wherever you have to go inside of this hotel. I did go out to eat at one of the restaurants and I asked the waiter how long it would take to walk from one end to the hotel to the other. He told me that one day him and another employee actually wore the step counters around work. The employee told me that he walked over 3.2 miles in A six hour shift. The restaurants and bars in this hotel are okay. I did not like the old hickory steakhouse at all. I did spend a lot of my time at the fuse bar just be prepared that the drinks are expensive. The Jack Daniels restaurant was okay nothing special. They do have a bar by the main lobby called the falls. I did enjoy that bar they had tables where you could sit out and there's a waterfall that runs down through the bar I thought it was really cool. Another really cool feature of this hotel is they have a gondola ride that goes around the entire hotel. The whole entire river in this place has fish inside of it pretty big size fish to Coy's bass carp. When you stay here you do get charged an $18 amenities fee. Basically it covers a list of things I am posting a photo that shows all the amenities that you get. The price of the rooms are pretty expensive you're basically paying for the view of each conservatory room and all the amenities at the hotel offers. Overall I will definitely be back here I think it's a really cool place to visit especially if you have little kids. The price of the rooms are expensive but I feel that you do get a lot. The biggest tip that I could give anyone coming to this hotel is bring comfortable walking shoes you will be walking a lot. Another tip that I have is they specify this when you check-in but make sure that you keep your hotel keys in a separate pocket from your phone or your credit cards. You do have to take a cab ride about 20 minutes to get to downtown Nashville. PROS:- beautiful scenery- gondola ride through the hotel- staff is helpful with directions - friendly staff CONS:- pricy- you walk a lot. It takes forever to get from point a to point b - you need a map to get anywhereThe ambiance of the hotel is nothing but extraordinary. It's like nothing else I've ever seen in a city. It's like a city in a city. There is plenty to do if you're staying as a guest and if you have a deep wallet. This is probably my 12th or so stay here at this hotel. There are plenty of restaurants to fit your taste buds or cravings, there are plenty places to walk, plenty places to shop and much to see in general. This hotel is absolutely gorgeous. But lately they seem to be offering less and less. The prices of the restaurants have doubled, the quality of the food has went down, there is less of a wait staff everywhere, and the valets did not even pick up the car when making the phone call we had to go physically hand them the tickets and wait over 20 minutes for them to pick up our car with maybe 4 cars or so under the awning, and numerous valets standing around. I would recommend visiting this hotel as a casual walkthrough, but as to staying here and paying the outrageous rates and getting so little in return now, I find it hard to justify the stay.The staff used to go above and beyond to make sure you have an exceptional stay, but now you hear valets screaming at taxi cab drivers, valets not wanting to pick up your car, and staff that is tired and complaining of no breaks and management seeming to be non existent, and waiting 10 to 15 minutes to even get the initial drink order . This used to be my number one choice when coming to Nashville but now with the higher rates and not getting the resort style feel, I can't even say it's in my top five now.I truly hope that they turn this resort around and get back to their roots. I would love to continue to make memories here, but for now its just a place I will walk through.","Quick check in.  This visit I had a great view with a balcony.  Prices are still on the high end but the service was great.Amazing resort!! It's huge so get a map. Luckily there is a shuttle to take you everywhere. There is even a shuttle to take you to the grand ole opryI'm glad that this is a Marriott property (elite!!) and the price is not that much different than the other options in the area.I'll start by saying this place is HUGE and is a destination within itself.  You don't even have to leave!  And the face that it was during a monster snowstorm, and everything inside was kept at an ambient temperature was awesome... I could still wear the shorts I packed, and didn't have to go buy and emergency winter wardrobe!There are a lot of nice shopping opportunities, but the prices were a little higher than I prefer to pay... however, not out of line for a convenience markup.The hotel itself looks great!  It's in good shape, and clean.  All of the staff we encountered were wonderful.  They even have a Marriott Elite check-in line.  However, the one lady working it was busy with one guest while myself and 15-16 other guests waited for over 1/2 an hour (while watching regulars check right in)... they should've moved someone to help weed-eat the line!  If you are going to be that busy at check-in,  you should have let me check in early as I had requested (and you denied).The restaurant we ate in Sunday afternoon was a bit blah (and when I send back 2 meals because they are inedible, you really should send a manager to talk to me!).Not a bad hotel... but management seems either overworked, or insensitive... either way... what should be a 5 star experience is now 3 STARS.However, for the money I would still recommend this place of the competition!So it appears I'm the black sheep of reviews on the Gaylord Opryland Resort.  Our company flew us out to Nashville for a FY15 Sales Kickoff Conference. I had a room here for 3 nights.Check in was interesting....They had 3 people checking in about 80 new arrivals. Luckily for me, I was only 10 people deep and so my wait was pretty decent. Something like that wont ruin my impression of this place.Gaylord Opryland is a beautiful resort. I spent most of my time in the atrium, listening to the waterfalls and looking at all the palm trees, architecture, koi in the river, etc...I understand why many people bitch about the layout and how far it is going from one section to the other, however.....have you ever been to Vegas?? If so, this place is a cake walk. I'm pretty sure if this was small, and compact...it wouldn't be a convention center.My room was just fine for what it was. It felt a little dated, but it had every amenity that I needed. The bathroom had a spacious shower, and enough counter space for me to lay out toiletries for my stay. House keeping did a great job of cleaning my room daily. Lots of hotels have a habit of picking up all your personal stuff and either puting it in piles, or moving it around enough that it leaves you with a really insecure feeling.  What I appreciated was that they simply straightened out my stuff and left it where it was.They have many places to eat and drink here.  I didn't eat at any of the restaurants that were housed within Gaylord, so I can't speak to that. I would suggest taking a cab downtown and hitting up some good ol' Tennessee BBQ. Cab's from Gaylord to downtown are $25 and $1 per head after that. So make sure you plan for that one.Service was great all around. Even when having breakfast and lunch in the convention area, I was impressed with the food they brought out. It was no culinary master piece, but it was a hell of a lot better than i've had in the past at Ceasar's Palace in Vegas. Would I spend my own $$ at this place?? Ehhhhh, I dont know....I think I would look for a hotel that's more centrally located. However as far as business is concerned, I think it's great for business meetings, conferences, and events.This resort is absolutely wonderful, I enjoyed the scenery that occupies much of the inner layers. Stayed here for a conference and have to say that most of the staff was friendly from the maids to the front desk workers. They also have a nice number of restaurants within that cater to many palets such as Italian and Asian. The little street near the center of the resort gives people more a bar scene with a pub and wing bar that both have decent portions for food without outrageous prices. The bedding and sleeping experience was very nice. Decor was fairly modern but didn't express any particular flair that would set it vastly apart from any other mid grade hotel chain. Very positive experience overall.What a mistake staying here.  First off, I know it is a giant place and all that, which was neat to see and experience.  You have to travel a bit to get to your room, which involves waiting for very slow elevators each time.  The rooms were ok, but the walls were paper thin, you could hear doors opening and closing and talking in the hallways all night.  I also had to listen to the people in the room next to me ""making love"" - that was very loud as well.  Oh joy.  Tried to get out of the parking lot the next day took about $20 min, card was not coded and had to pay $21 for parking.So, per Wikipedia, This hotel is the largest non-casino hotel in the Continental United States outside of Las Vegas and also ranks as the 29th in the List of largest hotels in the world.  So, with that said, prepare to walk... A lot.... Especially if you are attending a conference.  My room was in the Delta section, and it was a good 10-minute walk from my room to the Magnolia section of the convention center.  But, I do recommend you find time to walk around and explore, and try some of the different restaurants... The gardens are beautiful!  You can even take a boat ride around Delta Island.Room was old and worn.  Carpet stained badly.  Thermostat didn't work.  Bed very uncomfortable.  Shower head sprayed in all directions at the same time.  Nice view of giant garbage crusher. ;)Too expensive despite the nice atriums.  Food way too expensive.  Extra charges for parking, internet, and even more for fast internet.  You will do a lot of walking and easy to get turned around.Best for convention stay, but not for a one or two night business stay.  You can do much better at one of the nearby hotels.I probably will not stay here again.I just didn't love it.Let me start by saying that I do travel for work quite a bit and I like nice hotels.PROS: Huge and cute looking.Tons of restaurants/barsBeds were comfyCONS: Staff didn't seem to know what they were doing at any pointHotel is a mazeBreakfast was weak.Hot spots and wifi were blocked.It is far from downtown Nashville, so just keep it in mind.I stayed at the hotel for 4 days and 3 nights to celebrate my engagement and also my fiance's birthday.. Checkin was a long wait and we were sent to the wrong room with all our luggage so we had to come back down and get that sorted out.We tried to dine at several of the restaurants in the hotel over the couple of days we stayed there, but I'm not kidding every single host was extremely off putting and rude.After all the failed attempts of eating with in the hotel.. We finally decided to try out the falls bar very beautiful. We sat down for probably 15 minutes and no one would serve us.. I went to the bar to grab out drinks and that took like 10 minutes. So I bring the drinks back to the table (2 drinks for 27) and I taste my drink and it is awful. I proceed to stop a server walking by and tell her that I didn't like the drink and was hoping she could switch it out... She says yes and comes back with another drink. Sits it on the table and says I'm sorry but your going to have to pay for this drink and I said I'm not paying for another drink I already bought a drink and didn't drink it. So she shrugs her shoulders grabs the drink and leaves.The real kicker to the whole thing was I want to management and spoke to the food and beverage manager. She really didn't even apologize for the horrible service she just offered me to go back into the restaurants and sit where I was just treated with bad service! I was outraged and said no that I would not like to go back in there so her next best was to get me the drink that I had paid for!!!! I literally have never been so disappointed in hotel management! There saving grace is the beautiful scenery. Absolutely horrible staff.Extremely overrated and overpriced! You are paying for a name! This place is confusing to navigate and the employees at the restaurants were kind of rude. The room was not bad but for the price I paid it could have been better. The spa is overrated as well.If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  The Gaylord clearly valued bringing in big groups, like the Beta Club National Convention, over providing the Country Christmas experience they heavily promoted.  I had hoped to begin a new holiday tradition, and begin a low-stress all-inclusive option this holiday, but navigating thousands of some of the most poorly-behaved and disrespectful middle-schoolers was not what I had in mind.  I witnessed more pushing, swearing, and running through crowds than I have ever seen at a family event (and that includes the St. Patrick's Day parade in Chicago).  Gaylord missed the mark. They could have managed this situation better. They could have had the student group together in one of the 4 hotel areas, rather that dispersed among the families trying to have a relaxing holiday. The food lines are ridiculously long. They don't have enough staff to manage the demand. And the staff are clearly stressed as well -- they, too, have gotten increasingly rude in the last 24 hours.  Total Fail, Galylord!The Opryland Resort is nothing if not spectacular!  Delta Island with its fountain and boat rides is bustling with shopping. The Garden Conservatory is relaxing and serene. The Cascades Atrium has many waterfalls.The hotel is huge with over 2,700 rooms and 3 lobbies. We ended up at the Magnolia lobby for check-in only to find that our room was in the Delta section at the opposite end of the hotel. If I had known ahead of time, I would have gone to a closer lobby to check-in.Our room was nicely appointed as you would expect in a Marriott managed hotel. My reason for withholding the fifth star is the high cost. The room cost is high enough but then you tack on an $18 resort fee for the two bottles of water in the room, WiFi access, and boat rides, and $24/$32 for self- or valet parking. Then there's the prices in the restaurant; the breakfast buffet is $24 per person. Prices in restaurants is high, too.  Buffet breakfast is $24 per person!Bottom line: Spectacular resort, but pricey, all-in. The amenities are not cheap and their costs have to be picked up somewhere. Forewarned is forearmed. Enjoy a wonderful stay, but don't be shocked when you get the bill.DO NOT STAY HERE. We are on a company trip so it's hard to grip about a free trip right?  Wrong. To start with parking is 23 dollars. So you have to pay for the hotel plus the privilege to park there. The hotel staff is rude by most counts and treat you like you don't know where your at. We haven't made it twenty feet in the lobby and they are telling us we are lost (after checking in). The rooms while nice have very stiff and uncomfortable beds. We did enjoy our view. The pool closes at 5pm so if you like to swim you only have a few hours to do it.Restaurants. Where do you start? If you are lucky enough for them to be open you will be disappointed by the prices, quality and service. All of which are subpar. Tried several restaurants over four days and they were always closed or not honoring their advertised hours. Best recommendation here is to eat out.BRING YOUR OWN DRINKS. A mountain dew is 3.50 and a beer is 5.99 (ONE BEER). Did I mention the mountain dew has expired four months ago?PARENTS AND DISABLED. This is not a stroller/wheelchair friendly hotel. Yes there are walkways etc but they are inconvenient and out of the way. Be prepared to drag strollers up and down steps. Last night can't wait to leave. Wait we can't get into our room because our keys have been deactivated. Don't have to check out until the next day. After waiting almost fifteen minutes In the hall we finally got our news keys to get in.This is not a well managed hotel. It has a beautiful environment but it is overshadowed by high prices, poor service and bad quality. If you are coming to Nashville do yourself a favor and look for other Hotels. You can save a lot of headache and MONEY that you can use on other fun stuff.Gave two stars because of the appearance of the hotel.. It is amazing. But that is where it stops. I judge a hotel on the helpfulness and the friendly and welcoming attitude of the staff and this staff has none of those qualities mentioned here.. Boarder line rude and nonchalant attitude with no desire to make you feel welcome.. All that I met so far is non caring  and wanting a big tip. Got no help in unloading my bags from the taxi, the gal who check us in had no clue what she was doing because when I asked her a question she said ""whatever"".. Great response.. I hope I didn't make a mistake and could have saved money, time and been welcomed somewhere else..This place is way to big and unorganized.. If you like to wait a long time and talk standing outside I. The cold by all means valet your car.. You will wait 20-30 minutes to get your car!!! When Marriott took over quality took a vacation!!!Visitors Beware: Our flight was cancelled so my husband and I decided to visit the hotel and check it out for our next trip to Nashville. Their parking is not well explained. It looked like 20 minutes free and then $5 per hour. We enjoyed waking around and when we left 26 minutes later they charged us $26! Ridiculous. We won't be staying there in the future. Lots of options in Nashville that don't do business like this. They need clearer signage and a reasonable parking fee.This place is huge with a lot to see. We didn't stay here, but I would like to in the future. The rooms looked nice. We walked around and took the boat ride. The boat ride wasn't worth $10, but it made a few in the group happy to do it. They had all the lights up for the holidays already. It was very pretty on the inside. The place offered shopping and restaurants. Unless I plan on booking a hotel room there, I probably won't be back for a while. In my opinion, it's good to see it once.Came here for a business trip. So far it's amazing! The place is huge, I walked around and definitely got lost. There are also multiple stores, gift shops and bars in this one hotel resort. The staff is so amazing, every single waiter or waitress greets me when I walk into a dining hall or conference. They are cheerful and kind. They also are very helpful when I get lost in this place which is very often. It's a great place for business conferences but I've been seeing a lot of families too and people on vacation.For the price of the room we should of had better service and more perks. Free Wi-Fi would of been nice and they also blocked my hotspot from working not a good place.I am glad the FCC found this out.I booked a room a couple of months ago. We arrived there today, travelling from NJ and were turned away because they were overbooked. The clerk at the front desk summoned a manager who apologize matter of factly, telling us that ""upper management"" regularly screwed things up.She offered to get us a room in a downtown Radisson which we declined.We have traveled quiet extensively and this has never happened before.Very shabby way to treat people.Book somewhere else.","I booked a hotel room for 2 people in a double occupancy room... Instead what I got when I checked in was an atrium room with no real beds. Worst part is I'm an elite marriott member and the worst accommodation/problem solving to meet any reasonable needs. One of us forced to sleep on a pull out and the other on a couch. Awesome job marriott and I'll make sure that my negative experience is heard across the globe. Worst experience, worst customer service, might as well be a motel 6.#marriott #gaylord opryland #customer service #discrimination #negative net promoter #manipulation #trending #pissedoffconsumer #ripoff #gettingscrewed #integrity #loyalty #rewards #18007217033Do not come to this God forsaken place @ Christmas. Traffic is awful. It is not worth it.Huge hotel with shops and small restaurants ($$).  There's short indoor walking distance to the auditorium and ball room.  The hotel accommodated patrons visiting for graduations, proms, bridal parties, clubs, etc.  Many atriums for chilling out and walking.  The hotel has a community feel and at times felt like cruise ship when walking by the rooms.  Fully staffed and had a nice lobby.  My favorite was the island style restaurant with the lamps all around.  Many spots for photos.Very well located hotel! Beautiful inside! Many options of restaurants and you can easily spend your whole stay without leaving the hotel! Because this hotel is so different and beautiful, you can get a big line just to get to valet parking ($30/day) or you can pay $27/day and park yourself... With suck a big hotel, the $3 dollars difference made me use valet parking. If there is a concert in town, this hotel is craziness! The rooms are a bit outdated, like the hairdryer was the one I remember as a kid... A while ago... But overall, great hotel and stay!I have now stayed at the Gaylord Opryland Resort twice, and I have no complaints. I find that their service is great, and their employees are friendly. I traveled on my company's dime, so I can't complain about any of the costs associated with this place, but I will say that eating in the hotel is very expensive if you are paying your own way. Each of the hotel restaurants I ate at (Solario, Cascades, Fuse Sports Bar, Paesano's) served fantastic food, however. Dining at the vast food court and chain restaurants over at the Opry Mills mall is much cheaper. There are also a few stand-alone restaurants just off-property, across McGavock Pike (Cracker Barrel, Caney Fork, etc.)Let it be known that this enclosed resort is sprawling, so you should bring along some comfortable shoes, but the interior space is beautiful and lush. While the Grand 'Ol Opry and the mall are adjacent to the hotel, there isn't much to do in the immediate area, but there is a movie theater/IMAX and Dave &amp; Buster's in the mall. The General Jackson showboat is docked along the Cumberland river, which runs right next to the hotel grounds. The conference I was here for hosted an evening dinner cruise on the General Jackson, and the experience was phenomenal. For those that want to get to downtown Nashville from the Opryland Hotel, they offer a shuttle for a cost. They also offer an airport shuttle that is available at a cost as well. The hotel provides a complimentary complex shuttle that circulates around the property, dropping off at Opry Mills mall, The Grand 'Ol Opry, the General Jackson, and the Inn at Opryland, which is across the street from the resort, and is owned by Gaylord Hotels.I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference just these past few days. I was expecting such a wonderful experience since this Hotel is very popular and I heard many good things about it. To my surprise the stay was as if I was staying at a 1 star hotel.The Room Key: First I would like to say that I understand that the hotel keys are very very sensitive, however for me to have to get a new key at least 4 times when I only stayed three days is beyond ridiculous. I kept the key away from the phones which I was told was a must and still unable to use it. The amount of time it took to get a new one as well was unacceptable.The room: For a hotel that is this beautiful from the outside and inside the rooms to have awful beds and even worse covers is yet another thing that is unacceptable. The amount of money they charge for the stay should cover for at LEAST good sheets and mattress. The restaurants: mediocre food and expensive pricing. Went to RAVELLO and the calamari was rubbery and tasted as if it was Microwaved. Disgusting. I understand this is a very highly rated hotel from most but I definitely would recommend something else for this amount of money a nightThis is not a conference friendly hotel. The food is too expensive for what it is. Vending machines cost 2.50 for a can of soda and then the resort fee doesn't even include the steam-room.  You have to pay 25 extra for it.So my stay was quoted online as $269 a night. When I checked in they said there would be a resort fee of $40 or so which included Internet. Great.On checkout: They had state tax $26. Local tax $28. and some other fees which brought the fees to about $80-100 or so. So 4 nights was around $1400. I don't mind paying but the service sucked. Housekeeping would come and offer to clean your room just about when you are read for bed! It just wasn't worth it plus the hidden fees. The room directions are confusing and everyone got lost trying to find their rooms. People talked about southern hospitality??? What southern hospitality? All the workers are from Egypt! Pros: The carpet was nice. I liked the water falls. I liked that we can walk to the mall. I liked the garden area. I liked the shoe shinning service near the magnolia lobby. The rooms service food was great. I ordered a pizza. Would be nice if they had attentive staff who is aware that almost everyone will get lost their first time and try to help guests to their rooms. Not coming back here.Beautiful place! So magical during Thanksgiving time with all Christmas decorations. This place is perfect for family stay. I took my family to a sushi dinner in the hotel but result was a little disappointing. The fish did not taste fresh.I stayed here for a conference and it is a beautiful hotel. The rooms were clean and it was great to stay at but a few things to know about before going there. First of all, it is the most confusing hotel to walk around in. After 4 days there, I finally figured out how to get to my room without getting lost. Secondly, just know that you will wait in line to check in and check out pretty much every day of the week. Thirdly, while we were there I think there were like three other conferences happening and like a bazillion groups of kids there. I get it, it's summer and groups are coming to Nashville because it's a great city but don't think you're going to you're going to have a relaxing, quiet getaway. There were kids everywhere, running around at night having fun. They do offer shuttles to places for free and one to downtown for 20 bucks which is very useful.Overly pricey rooms, but the gardens are great to explore and keep you all-inclusive for a weekend getaway. Nice hotel. Would return again.We booked an atrium view several months ago for a special occasion and we are looking at the side of a building.  See attached picture for our view. If they put you behind a shed that should not qualify as an atrium view in my opinion.Very disappointed with my room. The bathroom is disgusting ... Mildew in the grout in numerous places, bathroom wallpaper pulling away from wall. Just gross. On ground floor with a door that opens into the parking lot. I might as well be staying in a motel! So not safe! And I'm seriously let down too...I stayed here for my first anniversary and it was so great. Is it because I'm paying a groups rate for a teaching conference? Either way, very disappointed.If you are a fan of long winding walks to get around the hotel, slow food service, over priced items, then Gaylord is for you.  Where do I start? (business trip for a conference)1) Breakfast a the Cascades, at least one coffee cup or glass was dirty at the table each morning.2) Breakfast buffet, besides being over priced with limited choices, the item were usually not hot.  I am sure some people like cold biscuits and scrambled eggs.3)  Findely Irish Pub, over an hour to get sandwiches, while we watched other tables get food.4) Thermostats are limited to how cold the room can get, I know this is being picky but I like to be able to get the room cooler than 70. 5) Since it is a 'resort' type hotel, then everything is nickle and dime extra charges.  For example, I will FedEx items to myself at the hotel that I will be staying, for hold pick up when I check in.  Since FedEx has a small office near the convention section, they have an agreement with Gaylord that item will not be sent to the hotel for pick up.  Instead you have to pick up at the onsite FedEx, and FedEx gets to add a 'handling fee' for holding the package.  6) $15 / day 'resort' fee a way to make pay high mark up for limited wi-fi service, limited to your room.  I fyou want wi-fi in the hotel area that is extra.  Even for the Elite Marriott members, which is free at other Marriott's.I would not return to this hotel 'resort' again.Wow!  The concierge needs training ASAP!  Literally refused to move over behind the counter to put himself in front of the customer.  Your not working the register at McDonald's....adjust to the customer.  The lazy draw was the no look pass of the document we requested.  I even said, ""really? Aren't you going to say anything? Close us out? Thank you have a great day?""  The concierge just looked down. I was too much in a rush to address it. Worst service ever.  All the staff at the hotel seem ""over it"" not motivated and irritated with the guests.  Lazy waitresses or loud talking waiters at the fine dining restaurant.  Like really?  Do you need to shout about my foi gras? When I say I didn't like it you ask me to be specific....  Well here's specific....it sucked.  Tell that to the chef.  Everything he said was so loud!  It could have been the blaring band music....yeah that was appropriate.  He actually said they ""normally"" close us when a band is here.  I also felt it to be strange that when I called for reservations earlier that morning the staff member told me there was nothing available at 8:30 or 9 but 915 was available. I came at 8:45 to have a cocktail before hand. I walked right in and proceeded to look at the restaurant empty tables. I'm not sure if the staff just don't want to work?  Avoid this say staffed hotel.Grand indeed! It's Texas sized! Huge! 10 x's bigger than the Las Vegas Bellagio Atrium. This had 3 different huge, high ceiling atriums, a boat ride like Disney's Pirate's of the Caribbean, Twin Waterfalls, tropical lush garden paths that snaked around with mini waterfalls along the way and it had a skywalk to take it all in from above.  There is fine dining throughout the property.  This place is gorgeous, grand and gosh darn awesome to take out of town guests like me! Nashville is sweet like sweet tea! Love Gaylord Opryland Hotel3 years ago had to come here for a work meeting and ended up lost and confused in the bowels of the hotel. I tripped on stairs and ended up in the ER. And my work is having another meeting here this week. I leave tomorrow and I'm dreading being back at this hotel so reminiscent of the movie the shining.Full disclosure: I've never actually stayed at the Opryland hotel, but I'm sure I'd enjoy it.  The facilities are beautiful and awe-inspiring.  The Boy Scouts of America held their national meeting in Nashville this year, so I volunteered to help out.  I was on-premises for four days, and enjoyed every minute of it.  I even ate at their burger joint one day.  Sure, it was expensive, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.I was very impressed with how efficient the staff was.    It's obvious that they are practiced in serving a lot of people in a short time, all while making everyone feel special.Tip!  Call for military rates if you can.  You'll save $$$ at a phenomenal hotel!  But definitely get your food from off-campus, otherwise, be prepared to pay.What can I say that hasn't been written already?  Nothing, it's huge.But here's the thing...I stayed here BEFORE and AFTER Marriott took it over.  Let's just say it was better and more personal BEFORE.  Yes, you can still get the same great service etc, but there was more staff around to help before.  I'll be backThe Gaylord Opry was underwhelming. The 52 (or so) acre establishment was like a maze! The layout itself was confusing and we needed a map to get from any two points in the hotel. After we located our room we found that it had not be throughly cleaned. There was still trash left from the previous occupants as well as smudges on the windows, lamps, remote controls. The room looked nice at a glance but overall just felt drab. The food I would give 2 stars-- tasteless and overpriced. Overall my stay was overpriced and unimpressive.This place is HUGE and the only reason I can think to stay here is because you're attending a conference.  Seriously, it makes no sense to vacation at a place like this because you could stay inside all day and really it wouldn't matter what town you're in.  Rooms were fine and comfortable.  If you do have to be stuck at a conference for a week, it's nice to feel like you're outside, I guess.  There are a ton of restaurants on sight.  Mexican cantina was decent, and the Library is a great place for cocktails.","['fun', 'place', 'step', 'goal', 'taking', 'sites', 'love', 'new', 'places', 'love', 'walking', 'friends', 'staying',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-hotel-nashville,Doubletree Hotel,3.0,$$$,113,"This Doubletree Hotel appears nicer online, than what it ends up being in real life - isn't that always how it goes?  The price was right for our quick trip to Nashville - and it's walking distance to all of the bars and music venues - so we ended up here for the night.Pro's:1. - all of the staff we encountered were super friendly.  Valet, Doorman, Front Desk and the in room dining attendant.2.- The lobby bar/restaurant is nice and spacious and very well utilized by the patrons3.   The cookies - you can't go wrong with Doubletree cookies - not ever!Con's:1. The hotel is old, dated and while somewhat refreshed - seems like they've put lipstick on a pig.2. The sink stopper was broken - and the top had been unscrewed.  I fixed it - but there was definitely some toothpaste residue.3.  Taking a shower is like being in a hot tub - it fills up with water fast and barely drains.4. The popcorn ceiling in the bathroom is coming off- so it looks really tackyOverall, the hotel is A-OK; however with some significant investment by ownership - it could be the jewel it probably once was.  If you're a Hilton Honors member - then this is a good option - otherwise, I'd probably stay somewhere else.I tend to like Doubletree properties when I travel, but this one is exceptionally poor.They didn't understand how to accept a third party booking (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> for instance).  They looked befuddled, and did not have a supervisor on duty.The rooms were wretched, and smelled like spilled beer.  If you're looking for a discount room for a bachelor party, you could do worse.  But, if you're a business traveler, have a family, or want to relax, I would really look elsewhere.  It's still a bit of a hike to Broadway, uphill.After a 15 hour day of driving, we pulled off in Nashville to find a hotel to stay at. I've always heard good things about Double Tree hotels, so we decided to stop there. The front desk worker was very nice and friendly, however it didn't seem like she new what she was doing. Check in process was quick which was nice; however once we got up to the room, we were completely disgusted. After putting our bags down we had noticed several hairs on both beds, hair in the shower, poop on the toilet, dust on everything and dust ruffles that were half way hanging off of the bed on the ground. It almost looked as if nothing had been cleaned, just remade the bed with dirty sheets. After calling down to the front desk, they set us up with another room. Even though we were grossed out, we decided to give them another chance. This time, the first thing we did was strip the beds and check the bathroom. We found hairs in both beds again along with stains all over the sheets. Though the bathroom in the second room was better, the beds were not. And after a 15 hour drive and $200 price tag, we decided there was no way we were going to sleep there. We were very disappointed in the rooms and the fact that none of the workers seemed to feel bad about our terrible experience. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.Service was honestly really rude while I was checking in...room was fine, but the bathroom door was broken. Overall, it wasn't the best experience for me with Hilton...though they do have delicious cookies!This review is for Andrew, the gentleman at the Concierge desk. After a cancelled flight, our party of 6 had to find a new location to stay overnight. We found a great deal on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> and decided to book it. Once we got to the hotel,  we headed down the the Concierge desk to try to find some activities and dinner plans. We were on a bachelorette party as well. Andrew was so friendly (and hilarious) and made a couple of outstanding recommendations for us. He called a restaurant to ensure that there was live music and made reservations. He spent a lot of time chatting with us and gave us some great ideas for activities. After we got back from dinner, we found a bottle of wine and chocolate covered strawberries from Andrew in our room. Super thoughtful and it made our stay that much more enjoyable. we love you, Andrew!Greeted with a warm smile and a warm chocolate chip cookie at check-in, we knew immediately we were at the right place. We booked through Hotel Tonight and got an affordable deal for our girls' weekend in Nashville. However, you'll have to tack on a $30 PER NIGHT parking fee. I would suggest researching cheaper parking spaces prior to arrival. Our room was perfect for our needs - two double beds, plenty of mirrors for getting ready, and an spotless modern bathroom. We couldn't have asked for a better location. We never needed a taxi and were within walking distance of all our itinerary stops. No issues during our two-night stay!Easy check in, friendly staff, clean room, hot shower and within walking distance to nightlife attractions - what more could you want? A cookie when you check in? Yeah, well you get that, too!Seriously - had a great stay here while working a tradeshow at Music City Center a few weeks back and have no complaints.This hotel was great for our downtown Nashville needs. There's a convenient airport shuttle for your business travelers as well as a local downtown shuttle (tip your shuttle driver!) free from the Doubletree. I enjoy the early check in capabilities online for Hilton Honors members - I liked that I could select my rooms prior to arrival. Makes it easy when you have larger groups traveling together. The front desk folks were super hospitable - they held packages for us, make accommodations for late arrivals (extra key for that one drunk friend that got in really late) and even allowed a whole bunch of ""can i have a cookie?"" requests. If you're up earlier than the hotel Starbucks location (6a on weekdays, 7a on weekends), they'll hook you up with some coffee for free, just ask. Great perk after a long weekend before heading to BNA.The rooms were solid - I was under the impression that Doubletree hotels were all allergy-friendly, but that's not the case at this location. Be sure to ask for them to de-feather your room prior to arrival. I had this noted on my HH profile, but still had to ask again at check-in.Free wifi for HH members, but paid for non-HH. Overall, great stay and will happily stay here again in the future.This was conveniently located if you want to tour downtown.But I have to say downtown was a let down!!Not the hotels fault that the town desperately needs work! Always go through internet booking...we got $167 a night versus $209 through trivago before the million dollar add ons for taxes!!! Valet parking is another $30 daily.Our room was nice, clean &amp;  comfortable with the minor problem of bathtub drainage.Water pressure in the shower was wonderful. Restaurant food was average. I had the nachos made with ""cheese whiz"" I would not recommend. Bar was decent and live music was good both nights.A filming of the Nashville show was going on outside that made it inconvenient for us peon guest! So if you need to stay downtown this was probably a good choice. I think I saw enough in 1 trip!!My room was clean.  Very nice lobby.  Staff was pleasant to deal with.  Breakfast was ok, but not special.First, holy cow $30 PER DAY to park?! That's ludicrous!!! I did not tip anyone and strongly advise against anyone tipping when you're forced to pay $30 a day. That's just nuts. I went and got some take out and tried to sit in the lobby (at a non-restaurant table) to eat. A snotty server at the restaurant told me I could not eat in the lobby, I needed to leave.  She acid I couldn't eat Anywhere in the lobby. So I went to the desk and the manager said absolutely, have a seat. So I ate dinner, but then on the elevator back up to my room, this young guy started telling me a story about how he lost $2,500 at a strip club last night. I thought he was going to hit me up for money, but he didn't. Instead he got off on my floor and I noticed he had a gun on his hip. I am in Tennessee, I get it, I've got no problem with guns, but is just so unusual to see some redneck walking around in the hotel with one who isn't police or something. The room was fairly quiet, but the bed was rather convex, like they hadn't flipped the mattress in a few years. Free WiFI and newspapers, a plus. Expensive parking, uncomfortable beds, and some strange interactions drop this down to 2 stars.I've never seen a double bed used in a single room before. That was the start. Tried to order a pizza to the room per the advertisement downstairs- no one answered after 3 calls.Went downstairs to order it- waited 45 mins for it to come- rudely treated the entire time. The service here is horrible. Sad because they have a great location but not worth being treated poorly.Valet costs $26/night, but they're slow. Oh and if they can't fit all the cars in their lot they park you car in the lot across the street. Gym has free weights, two stationary bikes, seated bike, three elliptical machines, three treadmills (if you're over six feet, don't hit your head on the ceiling!), Precor FTS Glide, stretch trainer, and mats.The rooms are ok - I don't feel like you get what you pay form. We had a room that was at the end of the building and was in the shape of a triangle. The view was nice, but the room was meh. The toilet and shower were in one room but the sink was in the main area - no privacy. The pullout bed was like sleeping on coils. I was simply underwhelmed.This review is mostly about the restaurant at the Doubletree, Fourth and U.  The hotel itself has been good, what you would expect for a Doubletree.  Room is clean and nice.  Service is good.  Valet staff works well.  The restaurant would be a big disappointment when you consider you're staying in a Doubletree.  My waitress was pleasant and did a good job, but the menu itself was VERY limited.  And the food quality was average at best.  I ate dinner at Hotel Indigo (The District) last night and was much more impressed, to the degree I will book there vs. the Doubletree next time.  Offer a good steak, a nice fish, and some chicken.  Dress it up with some memorable sides.  Unremarkable might be the best descriptor and when you are paying for the Doubletree in this downtown location you expect a little something more.This is your standard DoubleTree hotel, but the location is amazing. We were able to park our car and not use it the entire time. Word of advice, park in the structure across the street for only $24 a day. Hotel parking is way more expensive, you have to tip and it takes at least 30 minutes to get your car from the valet guy. Hotel itself was clean. the rooms are good sized. Ask for a room higher up. We were on the 7th floor (I think it has 9 total) and had a great view of the city and mountains. Staff members were friendly and helpful. We had no problems with our stay.I not a fan of writing bad reviews but I owe to all the yelpers to be honest. I've given 2 stars (but really wanted to give only 1) but that is for one of the gentleman bartenders, the shuttle drivers and the sweet late night security guard. The hotel room wasn't so bad but they did not have any extra sheets/blankets for the pull out couch in our suite. We left our towels hanging around the room (5 of us) but they still took them and washed them. Ugh! Aren't they only supposed to do that if they are on the floor in the bathroom? I'm from California and given the drought and my always ""reduce, reuse recycle"" attitude, I just find that frustrating. But the real reason I'm giving the low score? I left a pair of expensive shoes behind as we had to run out the of room very early in the morning after a late night out. I called on 2 separate occasions and was transferred both times to the lost and found department. I got their voicemail both times that asked to allow 24 hours for a return phone call. I left a detailed message each time and never received a return phone call. I then followed up with a call again to the hotel and asked to not be transferred to the lost and found but requested that they help me out to ensure I get a response. The gentleman was trying to be helpful (but not at all  friendly) and eventually told me that he could not guarantee that he would be able to call me back. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor, of course who did not answer the phone. After yet another detailed message, no return phone call. All of this occurred with in a week and a half of our stay. When we booked the hotel, it was because all of the other hotels in the area were sold out. I get it. You go were you get the best of everything-location, accommodation and service. This place really misses the mark for service. They've left a very bad taste in my mouth and therefore I would NOT recommend staying here.If I could give negative stars I would. This place was horrible. So my friends and I just got back from this shack. Stayed for two nights at a ridiculous amount of 299.00 dollars a night. Valet was nice but nothing above 1-2 starsHotel was horrible. The front desk guy who greeted us was rude and very unfriendly.Room needs updating and cosmetic work done. The shower heads at midget height. Last shower I took this morning the tub wouldn't drain. Cleaning lady came in yesterday unannounced while I was sleeping and my buddy was watching tv. What we thought was a free buffet ended up being crappy food at 17.00 dollars a plate. "" which by the way should be free. Pool is one step above my bathtub. It was cold and dirty. Kept on seeing hairs floating by me. Place is close the the strip but that's about it. Parking is 30 dollars a day which seems way high to me. For almost 800 dollars for two nights I will be looking to take my business elsewhere if visiting Nashville again. You've been warned....I had a horrible experience at the Doubletree Nashville Downtown during my stay 9/13-9/14.First off I took an Uber from the airport to the hotel.  The Uber driver had to drop me off the block before the hotel because the valet line was back out of the drive, through an intersection and into the next block.  My girlfriend, who was driving, arrived about 10 minutes after I did, and sat in that same valet line for at least 25 minutes.Upon reaching the lobby, I was greeted with a line stretching through the lobby and around the Starbucks in the back of the lobby.  I stood in line for at least 30 minutes to reach the front, I say ""at least"" because that's from the time I decided to start keeping track of the time.  It was longer, but I'm not sure the exact time.  The funniest part was watching new people walk in and the look on their faces when they realize how long the line is and the colorful comments associated with that realization.I will give the staff credit.  There was someone, I'm assuming the MOD, walking the line of people, offering free drinks.The hotel featured no dedicated HHonor's elite check in line, when I questioned the staff member walking the line he simply replied, no we don't.I have stayed in much larger hotels in much bigger cities (NYC, Vegas, etc.) and have never experienced a check in situation like this.  In reading other reviews online this is apparently a regular occurrence.  Otherwise the hotel was okay and was in a good location.  However this pre-check in experience will lead me to look elsewhere when in the city again.Weekend trip to Nashville with friends. Great hotel! Location is about three blocks from Broadway. Great service! Pretty good standard rooms.Did a three star Priceline deal and were placed here. Great location-close to Broadway and music museums. The lobby and sitting areas are modern eclectic. The rooms could use a little updating but the beds were comfortable. Overall with the Priceline price it was a nice stay.","Typically I have no issues with Hilton hotels, but during our stay there temperatures were extremely low and our heater wasn't working. They were kind enough to offer us another room on the same floor but the heat also did not work in that room, maybe a floor issue? They did make an attempt to come up and fix it but nothing changed. A little disappointed by it!This location is in downtown Nashville and other than typical city parking challenges, it was a very nice hotel with excellent service and a very nice clean room. I would recommend parking across the street and save $10. The parking garage was easy to access and you didn't have to deal with valets. This is a great location if you want to explore downtown Nashville without dealing with parking your car. They also had city bikes which would be a great alternative to walking. During our stay, there's a Thursday night event with live music and loads of food trucks. It was crowded, noisy and wonderful!Stayed here on a Saturday night and had a great visit.  Purchased through Priceline at a bargain.  Staff was courteous, friendly and efficient.  Be sure and ask for parking prices, valet parking was $30+tax.  Free shuttle carried us to the Grand Ole Opry at the Ryman and picked us up- very convenient.Rooms were clean, beds were very comfortable.  Cookies at check-in are a real treat.Rooms were clean and the hotel smelled nice, reminded me of that Vegas hotel smell, kinda tropical.  All the staff were friendly and polite.  They have a shuttle which will pretty much take you anywhere within ten miles for free.  This was a plus because unfortunately we had to park our car and trailer with motorcycle's at the Hilton downtown because the Double Tree would not take the trailer.  The shuttle driver was very cordial and helpful.  Very good location near Printers Alley and Broadway St.My family and I try to stay here anytime we are in Nashville. We have never had a bad experience. I love the location, and the staff are ALWAYS friendly and helpful.The beds are comfortable.  The location is incredible.  The construction that starts at 8am on a Saturday is unacceptable.  When we called the front desk to complain and asked for a room change, we were told that it's on floors 2-8 and we would hear it anywhere.  It's like a jackhammer and it's insane.  When on vacation, one usually likes to sleep in a bit and relax.  Impossible to do here.  DO NOT BOOK until construction is over.Also--$30 per night valet fee?  Come on now.Typical DoubleTree hotel with an amazing location.  Stayed here on business.  A couple blocks to the nightlife and easy to get in and out of. I am a Marriott person, so I am a little biased.  The beds are nowhere near as comfortable as Marriott beds, but the room itself is nice.  I will say my room was sandwiched between a bachelorette and bachelor party.  This made for noisy neighbors, but not the hotel's fault.  It seemed like the whole hotel was overrun with ""button down stripey dudes"" and ""bachelorettes on the loose"".  This made for incredible people watching.  So much pent up frustration and energy poring out of these 20-30 something's....I love it.  Nothing better than standing in line at the Starbucks (onsite) at 10am and hearing all of the stories: ""i could have totally banged that one chick if her friend didn't interfere!""  It is a basic bitch shit show.Stayed here a couple nights last week while visiting Nashville. It was reasonably priced in comparison to other downtown hotels, but we didn't mind the few walk block down to Broadway to save about $50 per night.Everyone working was really kind to us.. definitely went out of their way to say hi and smile, which I really appreciate. Clean rooms, and in a great location. Not much more I'd want!A four block walk to Broadway and they also have a shuttle to take you and pick you up.A television that never came on, a shower without a shelf/tray to hold your shampoo, soap, etc. and a no option, high dollar valet fee. Add these highlights to a pretty healthy room charge for an outdated hotel, you get the idea that there are better options when staying in downtown Nashville.Susie Hughes behind the bar literally saved my hangover.  The woman is amazing. Transfer her to the Chicago location and I will visit weekly !terrible service. failed to inform us of $30+ valet service. we just drove up and they were all ""we'll take it!"" with NO explanation. $3.50 sodas. maid knocked on our door at 8:50 am which pissed me off. upon checkout, person at desk was curt and rude. sat down in lobby to read a book from their bookshelf, books were glued together. TERRIBLE. oh, and $17 breakfast. don't give this hotel your money.This is a story of two rooms. One was at first appearance to be in good order. Then found out the phone was not working and one wash cloth for two people to share. The caulking around the tub was a bit moldy and looked messy.  Otherwise a good room. However, the second room was a bit stale and smelled very moldy. They said only one room with a Murphy bed was available or they could spray the current room with Lysol. For my friends with asthma...not a good option. Parking was a little pricey at $30 a night. On the bright side, close to downtown and they have a shuttle that runs from 7am to midnight.Hectic entrance area with tiny turnaround driveway and loads of people standing around waiting for their cars.  Not the best first impression.  But one of the valet guys is really cute...that bumps it up half a star...he was on duty when I left, so if he was there at the beginning that may have been a better first impression.  Thanks for finding my car which was hidden behind the entrance so I could leave.Rooms are definitely functional and not fancy, a bit tired looking and in need of renovation.  The bathroom is tiny, with the sink vanity outside the bathroom with the shower and toilet.  And no room safe...what gives? In this day and age, with all the electronics that people carry around, there should be a room safe.  I had to hide my iPad and computer, put up the do not disturb doorknob sign and hope for the best. The last day we were there, the do not disturb sign on the door disappeared, luckily, we were checking out.Security is lax, with all the people coming and going.  Our first morning, a homeless was riding in the elevator with us as we headed out...smelled horrible...not sure which floor he came from but he got off on the floor with the pool.Definite plus for this hotel is the location...very close to everything in downtown Nashville.  I easily found many restaurants only a block or two away and many touristy places to visit also within walking distance.Really not happy at all. Made arrangements last night for shuttle. Was told to be in lobby at 550pm for ride to airport. Was told they would call out my nane. Noone came. When I asked evening desk staff about the shuttle he didn't know anything about shuttle. Finally had to beg him to call for me since doubletree staff made arrangements and I didn't know who to call. He called and told me they were closed. No assistance with other arrangements. I could tell I was bothering him. Sour note to leave Nashville.Paper thin walls..neither you can talk at normal voice without disturbing others not you can help hear others talk in their room!!! Bathrooms poorly lit... Not worth the $$180+ per night!!!!Help was friendly. Room was clean. Bathroom needs maintenance ASAP. I addressed the shower not draining water they sent a man to room he was in and out in 3-5 mins. The next morning I had to shower while standing in filthy water with black stuff floating around. (Not an exaggeration at all) complained again while checking out and got a ""thank you for telling us"" even after I showed a picture of the disgust. For the price I would try something else.The location of this hotel was great and the valet people/shuttle driver were extremely pleasant but that was about all.  We went to Nashville for a party and we were suppose to have 4 rooms next to each other and they were not.  The biggest problem we came across was when looking for a lost shoe under the bed I came across POOP!  Yes it was extremely disturbing to know our room was not cleaned thoroughly before we entered.  2 managers came up and picked up the poop and just said sorry and walked out.  That was it.  We felt that they didn't treat us fairly because we were young females who came for a Bachelorette party.  We felt we should have been assured someone was coming in to clean our room.  Not to mention the bartender who was working downstairs was extremely rude.  Good thing Nashville has lots to do and places to go because being in that hotel was not enjoyable at all.  I gave it 2 stars because the bell hops, and shuttle drivers deserve a raise and made our horrible experience bearable.I stayed here a full week for a conference and it was alright. Not as fancy as I thought it would be considering it's the double tree, but it wasn't bad either! The staff was friendly and the food at their restaurant was phenomenal. We had most of our meals in the hotel because everything on the menu was so great. I honestly think that was the best part about the place! Rooms were clean but the maids always came to clean really late in the day. They also left a nasty body oder smell when they were finished with the room. It was gross, a hotel so fancy should at least provide deodorant for the staff lol Anyway, it was ok. Perfect for a business trip.Overall, a really nice stay. Started out a bit rocky. Pulled in around 11 pm Friday night and the valet guy was on his own.  ONE guy on long holiday weekend. Seriously? That wasn't cool for him. Finally got the car valeted the tandem bike in storage and the dirt bike we brought all situated.  Hit the bar for a drink and she calls ""last call"" at 1158 pm on a Friday night with what looked like a wedding party of 12 still in the bar...we got one round and she didn't turn another couple who came in a minute after us.  Still odd. Before bed we put a hanger notice on our door for breakfast @ 9 am via room service.  930 we called and they answered asking, "" oh that was your card?""  It didn't look promising we were going to get our ordered meal from the night before.  They offered us a free breakfast available downstairs which we passed on as they are already complimentary.  Enough said.  From there it got better.  The staff at the desk came to know us rather well and this was both am and pm staff. Very welcoming with greetings as we came and went and we felt it to be genuine. The bed rocked.  The shower pressure even better. Housekeeping was great. The location was perfect. Minutes from a short walk to Broadway. Would totally stay again.  The front desk staff secured this recommendation.","This hotel is beyond inept when it comes to the front desk!! Do not stay here if you can help it! Three reserved -in-advanced rooms, all on one credit card, has resulted in six different guests being harassed, overcharged ( a $50 holding fee was charged to one persons bank as $850 for one example: thanks to Kelly at the front desk!) some guests were told they couldn't have keys even though they were on the list to get keys. One room was told they had to pay again. A Fiasco beyond what this space can hold! Every time we think it's resolved, someone different calls from the front desk saying the room already charged needs to be paid for again. Great Bachelorette party weekend, but feeling VERY regretful about the poor hotel choice ! Unlike any hotel stay any of the twelve of us have ever endured.The location for this hotel is amazing.  Sadly, the it stops there.  My husband and I are Hilton Honors diamond status, so he had booked a room for two nights for a girls weekend with my friends.  Upon checking in, my name wasn't on the reservation, so Tiffany, at the front desk, gave me an incredibly hard time checking in.  While I appreciate her concern for security, my ID address matched my husbands account, as well as the credit card that was used to hold the reservation.  My husband was currently in flight, traveling for work, so I was unable to get a hold of him for him to ""clarify"" that I was indeed allowed to check in to the hotel.  I showed her emails forwarded from my husband with the reservation and also offered my husband's HH number, but she was truly awful to work with.  She offered for me to speak to a supervisor, which I accepted, and of course he allowed me to check in.  I was humiliated, and her snarky comments throughout the remainder of the check in process were  totally uncalled for.  She didn't give me breakfast coupons, so I had to make another trip to the front desk to get them.  I will never stay here again and I intend to call Hilton and let them know.This hotel is convenient to downtown and within walking distance to lots of stuff.  The price is lower than the rest of the downtown hotels, so was not expecting the quality to be as high.  The lobby is a little confusing, as the entry level is not the check in, but you need to go up the stairs to get to the main level and the elevators to the rooms.  There is an elevator that will take you up to the checkin area, but it is not really clearly marked or located.The lobby and restaurant look nice and are typical of Hilton, however the breakfast buffet is cheap and appears to be of low quality, closer to what I would expect at a holiday inn or similar line, not a Hilton brand.  We opted to go out for breakfast and I left a review of the 417 Union where we went for breakfast.  A Plus for having a Starbucks in the lobby!The hotel smelled slightly like disinfectant when we first arrived, and then when I got to my room, the room had a very strong smell of bleach.  The smell was so strong that after a few minutes in room, my asthma started to act up and I was forced to go ask for a room change.  They quickly moved me up to the sixth floor and apologized for the inconvenience.  The new room didn't smell of bleach, but had a slightly musty odor, that I assume was moisture related.  Overall the room was average, but nothing special.  A little cramped with the two beds and the bathroom was quite small for two people.  The paint was peeling on the bathroom ceiling, and the overall feeling was that the hotel had seen better days.  Noticed that when I checked in, there was a dirty plate in the hall, and about 3 hours later, it was still there when I went to move my stuff to a new room after dinner.  I even saw at least on of the hotel staff walk by the plate and leave it there, so not impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel.I would not choose this hotel as my first choice, but a reasonable price for a good location.  Service was good and the people were all polite.Pretty disappointing. In room dining-don't even bother. They delivered our food to the wrong room, threw it away and it was 45min before we got restless and called down curious.  They gave us $25 worth of vouchers to use the next day. We ordered breakfast, two American breakfasts and a waffle, the balance was $29. Food was sub par. They didn't even bring ketchup and Tabasco or water with the meal. Explore other options. The rooms are average. Kind of dated.****EDIT: The manager called me after I posted this and was very apologetic. He said the hotel is due for a renovation soon and the kitchen staff was being trained. He promised to credit my Hilton Honors account with extra points. It's a week later and no points. I'm not calling him back about it. It is consistent with the rest of my stay though and I'm leaving it a 1 star rating.****Original Review:A very disappointing stay. I was there three nights. I'll not stay at this hotel again.The Good: The front desk staff were helpful and friendly. The bell boys were also helpful and friendly.The Bad: The room was really dated. The ""free"" internet was SLOW. I had a room with 2 beds and that was a good thing. The first one was very uncomfortable. I changed beds in the night. The 2nd bed was not much better but enough I could sleep. The AC unit appeared to have a mind of its own. At one point I just turned it off so the room temp would remain stable. The food from the kitchen isn't bad but it's not really good either. I ate 2 meals downstairs and ordered 4 for the room (1 of which never arrived).The Ugly: I ordered breakfast in-room three times. The last two times I ordered the night before because the first time I ordered it took 45 min to arrive. The first breakfast eggs were cold and they put the butter packs on a hot plate. The aluminum packs were completely empty when I opened them. The butter had melted and drained out. The 2nd breakfast was ordered the night before for 7:30AM delivery. It arrived at almost 8. They had subbed the cereal without asking me first and the yogurt was HORRIBLE. I can't comment on the quality of the 3rd breakfast. It never arrived. I also ordered it the night before for a 7:20 delivery time. At 7:45 I called and was told they did not have the order. The person was not even apologetic. The dinner I ordered in room took over an hour to arrive and was not bad but not really good either. Also one of the elevators had door opening issues. Twice it took me to my floor, opened the doors about 6 inches several times, closed and promptly returned me to the lobby. This happened on two different days and it was reported to maintenence the first time.Ok, not great. Good value for the price though. Clean (enough) rooms and friendly staff. I was really disappointed in the food. I had the breakfast buffet and a few catered meals (was here for a conference) and every meal tasted the same. I would stay again, but eat somewhere else for sure.The lobby is clean and elegant, which is what a hotel should be. At first, it may seem odd that the main lobby floor is actually on the second floor, but you get used to it. There is a concierge and a door greeter, which I like. There also a couple of shops and a Starbucks on the main lobby floor.As a diamond member, I get free breakfast, which was good. I actually sat in the wrong area for free breakfast, but I decided to seat myself because I didn't know where the host/hostess was. I waited 5 minutes at the host's stand, but chose a table with an outlet. The host initially tried to move me, but I declined, explaining I already had my luggage and everything else settled at the table. He finally gave up and understood.Valet parking, taxes, and the room were a total of $191.85, but this is a beautiful hotel. There are also places to eat within walking distance. I am definitely staying here again!Rooms are clean but dated showing signs of wear. Front desk staff are polite and friendly. They do not however have a Hilton Honors desk at reception so check in can be long at busy times. My rate had breakfast included and supported the usual fare in buffet form. The servers at breakfast are hit and miss. Some care, others clearly do not. During my stay the person cooking at the omelet station certainly was not a morning person. Overall reasonable valueFor starters it's under construction. Failed to mention that anywhere. They checked strangers into our room and were rude to us about it. The front desk says they'll do something and then they won't do it. They lost my package and continued to say different lies-- it's in your room, it's in the mailroom, it's in the mailbox, it didn't get delivered, and finally it got delivered to the hotel next door"". They found it after I left and now Eli the manager won't return my calls about it. At least reimburse me for your mistake!  Breakfast was another fiasco. We, along with 10 other guests waited to be seated for way too long. Staff walked by and didn't even acknowledge us. It was beyond frustrating. We went to starbucks. Save yourself a headache and don't stay here!!! NOT a vacation spotA great center hotel. Wonderful staff and a top notch room. Everyone was incredibly helpful during a crazy business visit. A great Chicken Salad and solid wine list too. The windows are big and give you a cool view of the city and other buildings. One of my favorite Hiltons on this book tour this summer by far and will be back again!Seeing as I did not pay for my stay at the Doubletree, I say it's magnificent!! But my loyal and superawesomebetterthanyours bridesmaids DID pay for my room, and they had mucho problemos. Checking in: 45 minutes. Lady behind the counter, do you not see the case of Coors Light with blue bottle labels as cold as the Rockies slowing fading to white? They're fading because you're taking so long to eventually tell my posse you won't split the bill between them. You're literally turning blue labels to white with your frustrating explanation as to why your hotel isn't very accommodating. Your hotel also managed to lose our request for a joining suit. How do you have our reservation but not our request? Is that very hospitable? No. I have a hideously ugly rhinestoned cowboy hat with veil and Elton John-inspired Bride-To-Be sunglasses to strap on and you are WASTING PRECIOUS TIME! Adjoined double-bed rooms later and we're ready to get our party on, in front of the pool with floor to ceiling glass windows, where a bachelor party is taking place. Perfect. They won't mind seeing us waive around our phallical goodies, will they? In addition to prime peepshow quality windowing, we had our take of lustrous bathrooms. My room featured water-stained ceilings with paint chipping, while our adjoining bathroom looked like monkeys with a lot of frustration to vent had stayed there. For a week. Kudos for having a pool, in-house Starbucks (that closes WAY early), and prompt service staff, but the check-in was a no-go and the bathrooms were sick. I expected better from a Doubletree.When we went there on the first night the only parking at  the hotel was valet and at 1:00 am they called us and said there was a upgrade for suite so we packed used and went and then when we went to our new room there was someone sleeping in there. Not a good hotel but if you go keep the room you get and also the valet person was the only nice person.Doubletree sits in the heart of downtown nashville it's convenient to everything and walking distance as well I love the professionals at guest services and always enjoy a quiet place to stay and enjoy life downtown as well. The Breakfest bar is great they have a chef and will cook to order.parking is a little steep @28.21 per night but there are other garages down the street.The guy who checked us in was great, but other than that the staff here is awful.  I am a long time Hilton rewards member and I tried to add my card, but the lazy employee was ""too busy"" to look me up to have my account added.  The hotel is overpriced at $200+ a night and is somewhat of a brothel.  We were on a floor full of bachelor parties and there was constant noise.  There was also an elevator down for most of the weekend and it took close to 15 minutes once to get an elevator.  You would think that the hotel would get someone out within 24 hours to fix an elevator.  It was down almost the entire time during our 3 day stay.  If you want a nice peaceful Nashville hotel then look elsewhere.My husband and I were road tripping Tennessee and Kentucky. We decided to stay at the hotel because of the location, unfortunately that is all it offers. When we requested a refrigerator to be brought to the room, because we were traveling with perishables, we were told all refrigerators were given out already.( it was 3:30pm, a half hour after check in on a Wednesday, questionable) Plus, my husband and I felt like there was actually a caste system about the hotel. We suspect if we had a platinum or gold standing with them, there would have been better service. They obviously cater to business people and not the worn out traveler. We ask for a higher floor room, we were given a floor 2 room. This is the same floor for the pool. I expressed a sensitivity to chlorine, and was brushed off. Told to let them know if it really does bother me. Overall, not happy with the stay for only one day ... Ps- if you stay and need to park a car; drop your luggage off then park your car yourself , save yourself the $30 a day charge. There are numerous lots that charge $10 a day in the area.All in all... A great hotel! Excellent location and staff was friendly and very helpful! I visited the front desk daily for something or another and was always assisted quickly and with a smile. The decor in the rooms could definitely be better (hence the 4 and not 5 stars) and the bathroom was seriously small but since we really just used the room to Sleep and get ready it wasn't bad at all! Definitely would recommend and/or visit again!We stayed here 4th of July weekend so the whole city was slammed and hectic, but everyone at the hotel was super nice. And they were able to accommodate us checking in three hours early. Rooms were nice and clean. Very short walk to Broadway where all the bars are, I think three blocks, and there are actually bars and restaurants on all the streets as you're making your way to Broadway. I knocked off one star because the elevators are extremely slow.. We always had to wait forever. I could have walked up the stairs much quicker, but I didn't know where the stairs were. The lobby is a little confusing.Late night post concert food!!  Awesome!!  So inexpensive!!  Biggest salad eeevvvveeeerrrrrrrrr!!!    Like 11 bucks!!  Can't beat the price!!   Fries were superb!!  Fish and chips about the same price!The bathroom ruins the entire stay; pealing paint, mold and rust on the ceiling.  Plus when you take a shower you are standing in six inches of water.  Definitely not worth the money.The main benefit of this hotel is the close proximity to Broadway and the cheaper (if you want to call $400 a night cheaper!) rates than the other downtown hotels.  Stayed three nights with some girlfriends.  Beds are comfortable but double size is very small for two people.  The AC was horrible and we woke up very uncomfortable and sweaty two mornings in a row.  The bathroom was very outdated and not cleaned properly when we arrived, nor throughout our stay.  The final straw was when a manager knocked on our door at 11:45 pm saying there had been a noise complaint about us.  We are all mature upper 30s-40 year olds and we were only watching TV and talking at the time.  If the walls are that thin, then there is a problem.  Tiffani at the front desk was beyond helpful with our problems and super sweet.  We did think most of the staff was very friendly.  Downtown Nashville is fun for one or two nights especially if you love live music.  Definitely try the Pedal Tour (be warned it's a bit of a work-out but fun!) and for the BEST chicken ever go to Hattie B's!! Fun trip but unfortunately we would never stay here again.","I'm surpised by some of the negative reviews left about this hotel. Ok it's not a Four Seasons or a W hotel, it's a doubletree hilton and does exactly as it says on the tin and more. We stayed two nights over the weekend and got a great rate on Hotwire, it was our secret hotel. The only negative was that our bed was v small, I think it was a queen and for someone who rolls over a lot in the bed my bf was not thrilled about the size of the bed, but apart from that I found it to be super clean, staff were v welcoming and accommodating and they came right up to the room when needed (they had forgotten to give us our warm cookies when we arrived so they came up to deliver them!) all in all I'd give it 4/5 stars for what it was!Small rooms.  Room literature says pool open at 6:00 a.m., but actually opens at 7:00 a.m. which is simply too late if you are here on business.Staff is friendly and helpful (this has greatly improved since I have been staying here)Required valet parking of $25!Excellent for business at the State Capital, a little far for walking to downtown areas.  They do have an excellent shuttle.Great location and very friendly staff. Room was comfortable and good breakfast. Good place to be for cma fest as it is centrally located to downtown and the stadium, a walkable distance to all venues. I would avoid eating other than breakfast here as the service was very slow and nothing too impressive. I was astonished at how cheap the food was though, so if you have time to spare, it won't hurt you to dine here. We stayed here for CMA fest 2013 with the hotel at completely full occupancy and all has gone smoothly. There was a small wait for the elevators after the concert one night, but that is to be expected. Hilton Gold, so I stay at a number of doubletrees and this is one of the best.The staff at the hotel was competent and friendly.  Couldn't have asked for more in terms of customer service.  The food served for our meetings was very good.  The breadsticks were as hard as rocks, but all of the other food was quite good.  In spite of the renovation, rooms smell musty (my room and 2 of my co-workers experienced the same odor issue), tubs don't drain well (prepare to be standing in inches of water by the time you finish a short shower) and the exterior of the windows are filthy.  My room, even though recently renovated, wasn't exceptionally clean either.  It's obviously been a long time since someone thoroughly vacuumed (lots of dirt on the floor near the back of the desk area), and my room wasn't vacuumed at all during my 3-day stay.  Internet connectivity is horrible throughout the hotel (guest rooms and common areas) and drops on a regular basis.  There was no working ventilation system in my bathroom which turned into a steam room after a shower.  The a/c system won't cool the rooms to anything near the low end of the thermostat range.  (I found the room warm, humid, and mostly uncomfortable most of the time.)Can't believe the low average rating of this place; we just stayed a few days ago and had a fantastic experience. My new go-to hotel! PRICE- The cheapest you're going to find downtown is ~ $140/night (pre-tax). We got the ""Ultimate Package"" in the junior king suite for $170/night (pre-tax). This included valet parking (even self park at other nearby hotels runs about $20), breakfast, and late checkout. And the room was enormous!!! COMPLIMENTARY- Delicious, warm cookies at check-in. Wifi! A shuttle around downtown (however, we didn't use it so I can't really speak to that). SERVICE- Everyone--the valet, front desk, room service, housekeeping staff--was friendly, courteous, and smiling. Service over the phone was also lovely; I called prior to making a reservation with questions and once during our stay when we couldn't figure out the wifi. Both of the women I spoke to were patient and informative. And, for the record, the wifi is really simple!OTHER- Very clean. Room service came with a free bottle of water, which was nice and unexpected. Contrary to other reviews I skimmed, elevators always arrived promptly, though I guess it depends on when you're staying. The pool is very small, but there is a nice seating area with large skylights. CONS- The shower head was bizarrely low. It was almost too short for me and I am 5'3"". Not sure what was going on with that.My typical home base when I'm in Music City.  I keep coming back for the following reasons:1) Location - walking distance to all of downtown.  Yes, it's up a hill, but after eating and drinking to excess, I'm sure I can use the exercise.2) Price - they generally have rooms available at the government rate, which is what I need for business trips.  The rooms aren't anything special compared to other hotels, but they are generally clean.3) Fitness room - multiple machines so you're not waiting forever, and you overlook the street and can watch people go by (as an alternative to the TVs)4) Staff - I wish I could remember her name, but there's one lady at the front desk who always greets me by first name even when it's been months since I've last been there.  She is AMAZING!  And, in general, everyone is pretty nice and helpful5) The cookie!Great customer service - excellent cookies!Super breakfast club service (it is worth it!)I really enjoyed the location and experience at the Doubletree. Only downside is the bellman never got my bags (in and out of the cab) Nor were they able to hail a cab.Also - definitely would not pay more than $150 for a room.I stayed at this hotel for one night on Sunday, October 13, and this was the worst experience I have ever had with a Hilton property based on the incompetency of the staff. I'm a Hilton Honors gold member and this was my wedding night. I've stayed at countless Hilton properties this year, and Double Tree is one of my favorite Hilton properties by far. With multiple options available in downtown Nashville, I opted to go with the Double Tree for this reason. When I chose this location, I had anticipated it being an exquisite experience for my first night as a newlywed. I wanted a special night for my wife. Upon my first arrival at around 1:30 in the afternoon, the valet just stood there when I pulled into the drive; no one greeted my car or welcomed me to the hotel. I should mention that years ago I had worked valet myself, and on this occasion I was accompanied by my Best Man who happens to be a manager of a prominent valet company. We both knew this was unacceptable. The welcome only got worse from there. When I walked up to the front desk, we were again not greeted. We walked up to one of the two people working at the front desk and asked if it was too early to check in. It was before 3:00pm, so we acknowledged that  we arrived before normal check in time, and this was understandable that our room was not yet ready. I asked if I could just run up to the room to drop off a bottle of champagne and some champagne flutes so that they would be in the room upon our arrival later in the night, but the man I was talking to couldn't answer that question. He turned to who I'm assuming was the front desk supervisor, and without looking up she just shook her head annoyingly to say no. I then asked if someone could put the champagne and flutes up in the room with some ice when it was ready, but the desk attendant (who's name was Aaron I believe) again could not answer my question. He again asked the other front desk attendant to see what could be done, and her response to Aaron was, ""That's not my problem. I'm about to leave."" At this point my Best Man and younger brother, who has worked in the service industry for almost 10 years, stepped in and said, ""It's only his wedding night"". At that point Aaron said he would make sure the champagne was kept cool and put into the room. The other front desk person still couldn't have cared less.When I arrived later in the evening around 9:00pm to check in with my wife, the valet staff this time welcomed us and so did the front desk staff. However, when we arrived to our room, the champagne and flutes were not in the room as earlier requested even though Aaron had assured me it would be. I called guest services to find out where everything was, and the response I received was a cavalier ""Oh yes we have it here. Would you like to come get it or would you like us to bring it up?""I have never been so upset and disappointed with a hotel stay as I was with this Double Tree. It was my wedding night, and this occasion cannot be recreated. My wife and i were both disappointed. I would never recommend anyone to stay here.I stayed here two months ago and had the best experience I ever had a hotel. The staff was polite and super friendly. We joked around about me  being from Chicago and how the cold didn't bother me much. The clerk behind the desk was really helpful and even gave me a pass for breakfast. Shhh don't tell anyone I'm not sure if she was suppose to do it. The girl at the information booth was helpful in finding the Carter house and doing some touristy stuff. Even the waiter at the breakfast buffet was awsome. The second morning he remembered me and asked if I wanted the same drink as the day before. It seems likes small gesture but it was huge customer service in my book.This hotel is in a great location, especially if you are in town for a football game at LP field. It is clean and the rooms are relatively spacious. This place is in need of an update.  Things are a little worn looking, but clean and maintained.   We ate downstairs since I was hungry when we arrived and the food was good. I had a cobb salad and it was fresh and good. Friends got the fried pickles and they were really good.This place sucked!!!! We had a group of 21 people staying in the hotel. The construction is going on but we didn't mind that the front door was unable to be used. Our room's tub would not drain. Taking a shower with water up to your ankles is just plain disgusting. We called for someone and he came pretty quickly. What didn't happen quickly is receiving toilet paper. We had to call FOUR TIMES before they came up. We plugged in the hair dryer and the iron and it blew a fuse. Is this a joke? Another room that was used (a suite) came back to their room to find their toilet had EXPLODED while they were gone. Unexcusable. They were offered to be moved UPSTAIRS to a regular room ( a down grade. No thanks).  The next day, our tub STILL didnt drain and we blew ANOTHER fuse, this time from only the iron.  When calling the front for a manager, he said he would call us back in 20 minutes. 40 minutes later, we went down to the desk to complain. He made us wait another 20 minutes to see him. It was an absolute joke. This is not a cheap hotel so all of these issues should not have happened. The only thing this place has going for them is location. It is a short walk to all the bars and restaurants.Location is excellent. Walking distance to everything downtown. Hotel is clean. Service is quick and pleasant. Bar is great downstairs. Bartenders make solid drinks. Food is actually pretty good. Get the chicken fingers. It is odd that I mention chicken fingers, but they were that good. Lacking a gym and pool and that kind of stuff though. Free breakfast buffet was pretty good. Overall, great stay, will be back.I had a mixed bag of experiences here. For starters I had booked a three night stay here through Expedia and specified Non Smoking as the option for my room. When I checked in I was given a room for smokers complete with ashtrays, yellow stained walls and the smell of nicotine throughout the room.  When I asked about that the clerk told me that Expedia sometimes accepts just any old room that is available. If so Expedia has some serious explaining to do...After my first night here I saw that I needed to add on another night to my stay. When I went down to the desk and spoke to the clerk he said that there were no vacancies for the extra day I needed to stay in Nashville. But he said that I was welcome to ask about vacancies on the morning of my check out. Not a good option seeing that I want to know before I check out if i can stay another day or not. Not too helpful (or smart) on his part! I then went up to my room and did a search on Expedia (yes the same Expedia that was claimed to have wrongly booked me a smokers room), Anyway there I found vacant rooms at this very hotel. Vacant rooms in every possible shape and size for the extra day I needed to stay here. I quickly proceeded to book one and went down to the lobby once again and spoke to another clerk who said that there were several vacancies for the day I needed to stay. He also said that he would speak to the other clerk who gave me faulty info.  The rooms were otherwise nice and clean, great breakfast buffe (although that cost extra and was not included in my booked package). Good inhouse restaurant with excellent entertainment the night I ate there. The location of the hotel is perfect if you plan to visit attractions in downtown Nashville. Short walking distance to everything there, but still with the advantage of not being right on the main strip with the loud  ambient noises you'd get there.I will consider coming back to stay here if I can get a guarantee of not getting a smokers room. Perhaps I'll book through the hotels own website next time and cut out the middle man (Expedia who most likely screwed up my reservation).Meh is the best description I have for my experience at this Doubletree Hotel.  The Superb:  The desk staff were very friendly.  The hot cookies were a nice touch.The Average:  Average bed, bedding, etc.The Horrid:  Slow drains, minimal air conditioning, and a toilet that bubbled and burped smells that were pretty awful.Would I stay here again?  Probably not, especially with the Sheraton within the same walking distance.We were here last week for a convention.Good location.Room was comfortable. Bed was great.It is centrally located in downtown.Easy walkable distance to Ryman Auditorium, the Second Ave. shops, and the Broadway honky tonks.Free Wifi.Free chocolate chip walnut cookies at checkin.Decent catering food items at reception party, breakfasts, lunches, breaks. and farewell dinner.I have sampled egg biscuits with cheese, bagels with cream cheese, blueberry muffin with strawberry jam, cheese and pecan danishes, orange juice, grapefruit juice, various fruit platters, granola bars, various Lays potato chips, oranges, banana, green apple, red apple, pineapple, grapes, coffee, tea, iced tea, Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper ,spinach puff, chicken puff, shrimp cocktail, crab mushroom puff, various cheese and crackers, M&amp;Ms ,raisins ,mixed nuts, various  energy bars ,roast beef sandwiches, chicken salad sandwiches, vegetable wraps, chicken medallions stuffed with spinach, pasta primavera, garlic bread, caesar salad, chicken kabobs, vegetable lasagna, mashed potato, various grilled summer vegetables, cheesecake, etc. As you can see, we were well fed.Elevators were OK if a little slow.They have a business center where you could print out your boarding passes.The only problems was loud fan, moldy ceiling, running toilet, and you have to find your own taxi because you could not find a porter.There is a taxi stand across the street.Maids never clean anymore.  I left the ""please change my sheets"" card on my bed and they weren't changed.  The carpet was not vacuumed.  The bathroom floor wasn't mopped.  Lazy...  Mediocre accommodations for the outrageous nightly rate we paid.  Stay somewhere else.Had to write this review about the great customer service. The team at the check in counter was helpful and kind. Beds were very comfy and the walk to the nightlife only 5 minutes, a shuttle was also available. Recommend to anyone looking to enjoy downtown...in fairness prices will fluctuate depending on the scheduled events so moderate and up is a variable.For the price I paid, I expected a lot more.  The first day we were in our room everything seemed okay, but we didn't spend much time in our room.  The second day, we toured the city all day and when we came back by 3:30pm-ish, our rooms weren't even clean yet.  By that time, we just wanted to rest and didn't want to be bothered.  The third day, the toilet in the bathroom leaked and water was all over the floor.  It took  a while for someone to come and fix it, but it didn't even seem like they completely fixed the issue, just put a patch that solved the leak, but the toilet had a hard time flushing for the rest of time we were there. The fourth day, we needed to get our car at night to get some White Castle and the Valet guy was no where to be found for a 10 minutes.I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 star because the front desk hooked us up with a bunch of warm, gooey, and delicious chocolate chip cookies every time we asked and there was a Starbucks in the lobby!Room is old and smelly. Service was mediocre. Restaurant has poor service except for breakfast and the older guy in the evening.  I'm so disappointed because I stay at the hilton brand hotels frequently. There was a cockroach in my room. Flat iron steak was nasty. Mushroom pasta was so oily. No bread or sugar with my tea. :( everyday I am continually disappointed.I stayed there for two nights last week and was not happy. The room was small and not very clean to begin with, then the bathroom was not cleaned at all during our stay. I complained to the front desk and they did ask if I needed more towels, but that was it. Overall the room cleanliness was unsatisfactory and not up to what I would consider to be Hilton standard. I have stayed in many Doubletrees and been very happy, so actually sought this one out. I would not recommend this hotel.","Nice room, nice staff, cookie at checkin. Comfortable bed, nice size room. Excellent amenities, great location, good rate, overall excellent place to stay in Nashville.Stayed here while attending a wedding in Nashville.  They have a good bar downstairs with live music, and a great bartender for breakfast beverage recommendations.  The rooms are nice and ours had a great view of downtown.  The bartender and the concierge were great helps for getting around downtown and meal recommendations.  We'll definitely stay here the next time we're in Nashville!Tried to check in early and was told that actually we couldn't check in until 4. Our paperwork clearly says check in is at 3 so was hoping we could get in earlier but the guy kept saying we've changed our check in time to 4 so it's fine if you come in at 3 but we are at capacity and you won't be able to check in before then. After a long flight I think at least someone willing to accommodate or try to check I. On options would have been nice. Annoying!Let me preface this by saying that I'm originally from the Nashville area, and that the city is sorely lacking in quality hotels. My husband and I were going to a charity event and went back and forth on whether we should stay at Hotel Indigo or the Doubletree (both a few blocks from the venue). We went with the Doubletree, even though it was pricier, as I've always been a fan of Hilton brands.From the moment we checked in until the moment we left, the service was terrible at best. None of the hotel employees knew anything about anything--when we checked in they gave us a breakfast voucher and told us if we wanted to use it for room service we could, but when we called later for room service, they laughed in our faces when we tried to redeem the voucher--and the rooms have seen better days. We had a corner executive king, and it was comfortable enough (and BIG), but the doorknobs were rusty, the bathroom was falling apart, and it seemed the hotel hadn't had any updates since the 1980s.When we stepped on one of the elevators with four other people, it slammed and stopped. I am terrified of getting stuck on an elevator, so I immediately got off as soon as the doors reopened. I was stuck waiting another 10 minutes for the next one to come. The elevators there are slooooow (and old).The neighborhood is OK during the week, but I had forgotten that EVERYTHING shuts down on the weekends. We arrived at 3pm and were looking for sandwiches; there were two Quiznos, two Subways and a bevy of other chains in the area. They all closed at noon. ON A SATURDAY. Weird, right? Even the Starbucks inside the hotel was shut.Our room was right near the elevator shaft, and it was so loud--there were people stumbling out of it drunk, yelling at all hours of the night, and we could hear everything through the thin walls. Pair that with the heating unit that hummed and kicked on and off all night long, and it wasn't a very restful night for either of us.But what was worse was the housekeeper busting in our room unannounced at 9am. Now, I spend half of the year living out of hotel rooms and I'm very accustomed to housekeeping trying to usher you to check out as early as possible, but this guy just threw open our door without so much as a knock. AT 9AM. Luckily, I was downstairs getting coffee, but my husband was standing there, fully nude, about to get into the shower. Not the kind of wake-up call you want, if you know what I mean. And then to make matters worse, the guy didn't apologize and was terribly rude to my husband, who wasn't all that jazzed in the first place about some other guy seeing his goods.The only good thing about this hotel was the warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in (a signature Doubletree amenity) and the complimentary breakfast.Overall, I would NOT pay the $206 to stay here again (that's what it came to for a night including the $26 parking fee). I would fork over a little extra cash and stay at the Hermitage or Hutton instead--or just go for one of the more budget brands like the Indigo.We had a fantastic stay at the downtown double tree. Stopped here on a Sunday night, the front desk attendant Kevin was amazing. Since they didn't seem to be very full he upgraded us to a suite on the 7th floor which had incredible city views. They have a complimentary shuttle which takes you around the downtown area. I did have trouble accessing their wifi with my Mac but the room had an Internet cable that worked just fine. The breakfast buffet included an omelette station. Everyone on the staff was friendly an helpful. Plus who can complain about free cookies??It's a nice place to stay and is pretty close to Broadway and all the fun! However, this trip over the weekend and our first experience at this hotel 2 years ago always have mini-mess-ups right when we get there that just frustrate me and are totally avoidable.But overall, we stay here b/c it's a pretty good place to stay. I just hate walking that God awful steep hill at night when you're blasted and just want to get home. Oy to the vey.The front desk staff is always courteous and helpful. PLUS, who can beat their warm cookies???Not worth the price we paid even at a discount. The room smelled like mildew and the carpet was wet for two days outside of the bathroom. The hotel staff was so unfriendly and not helpful. We decided to leave a day earlier than planned.We just returned from our stay for the CMA fest.  The staff was very pleasant, room was clean, and managers present.  I'm not sure if it's because the hotel was so full.  The bathroom was tiny and the shower head was very low.  I'm 5'5 and had to duck to rinse my hair.  The location was great for us and we enjoyed the comp. breakfast ( hilton honors program).   I would stay here again.Lastly would have liked to have wi-fi in the room.  It was only available in the lobby and ballroom.  :(Passing through Nashville we again relied on the iPhone to choose a convenient downtown hotel where we would be able to walk around and see the city and leave the car, which is what we prefer to do. Narrowing to the Doubletree and Courtyard, both on 4th about 2 blocks away from each other we opt'd for the Doubletree and were very pleased with the decision.The staff was all super friendly and the room was incredibly comfortable. The lounge with it's free wi-fi was a perfect place to chill after walking around the city and having dinner. They had a guitar player down there who was quite talented and it made for a nice night.The food and bar were both great and the omelet station in the morning was a nice addition. Of course there are the super-yummy warm Doubletree cookies at check-in :)! I also loved the Nutrogena products in the bathroom since I'm a fan of the foaming face wash.This is more about the on-site restaurant in this hotel. We went there to eat lunch buffet.  They used to have good selection of food, including made to order food, desert...  However, this time, it was really countable number of food are available for buffet.  One of the selection, Fried Chicken, was quite bad.  all grease dripping and were very soggy with no taste but the taste of oil. Some food were quite dry as though it as out for quite some time, even though lunch buffet just has started.  And no single desert to choose from except you pay extra from regular menu.  Empty, dirty plate was not cleared until we asked, drink was not refilled.  The restaurant was not really up to the name of Double Tree. Needless to say since it is in Double Tree, the price is not cheap either or should I say overcharged for the selection of food.Decent hotel. The managers were very good to my wife and I. It was our anniversary and unfortunately we were given a room with a double bed. I asked the manager for a king sized bed and she worked very hard and had a new room for me within three hours. The main problem with the hotel is they do not have a spa, which is huge for me when I travel. Other than that the location is great....three blocks from Music Row. Unfortunately, all the hotels in Nashville have valet parking due to the lack of parking space. $25 a day.I recently stayed in the doubletree, downtown nashville and here is my tried and true good/bad list.  Good.1.  Great location - right near all of the restaurants and strip of bars.  if you can stand to walk a few blocks, this is a fine hotel selection for you.2.  Staff is very responsive - you will never wait a moment too long for someone to ask if they can help with bags, cars, etc.  Bad.1.  The rooms are small - we're talking European small.  You can hardly close the door to the bathroom behind you.  This was not the ideal place to get ready for a wedding or special event.  2.  The television that I had in my room didn't work.  Not cool when you have a husband trying to watch a football game....staff came to mitigate the problem - but failed and we had to live with it.  All in all, if you aren't traveling for business, this is a fine place to shack up for a night of nashville fun.  I would recommend this to a friend.This is a nice hotel, very friendly staff.  My issue is that the valet service removed all the quarters from my vehicle and I had plenty in there.  I keep (kept) an unusually high amount of change in there because I park at street meters daily.I wrote the hotel an email with my concerns in early October and got no response so I have to assume they aren't interested in the overall satisfaction of their guests.Interior of the hotel is ordinary. Congestion is a problem at the entrance, and the path from outside to the desk (or anywhere else in the hotel) is inconvenient and confusing. Parking valets are disorganized and distracted, and either do not adequately watch the cars or are themselves pilfering cash from them. Hotel staff is otherwise friendly and helpful.I don't know whether there is any connection between the management of the hotel and the on-premises Starbucks, but I have been a Starbucks customer for 30 years and at this location was served the worst Frappuccino I have ever had.I will find a different hotel next time I spend the night in Nashville.i had the best stay here!  everyone was amazing.  when i checked in, i was greeted by a front desk woman, Lindsay who was so nice to me and very accommodating.  The lobby was spacious and they had a little gift shop, a bar, a starbucks and a restaurant there for your convenience.I decided to take a trip to Nashville all by myself, and as a woman alone, I was a little weary about public transportation and/or taxis, just because I was alone.  As it turns out, they offer a shuttle that will drive you to wherever you need to go.  The main strip is only a couple of block away, but in 108 degree weather, I wasn't planning to walk there.  The shuttle driver that was on shift was Maria and she was the warmest, nicest, person and I was so happy to meet her.  She dropped me off on Broadway, the busiest area, and I found myself hiding in the Grand Ole Opry souvenir store for far too long because of the amazing air conditioning.  Back on track... I very much enjoyed my stay at the Doubletree and would absolutely recommend it to anyone visiting the area!Check in was great, person at the front desk was nice and helpful and...frosty... We did not receive our much anticipated cookie at check in. Parking Valet was nice and courteous however we were almost broadsided by a valet barreling out of the parking garage while waiting to pull in. Room might as well have been at the budget inn as it was basic (but clean) and a little sloppy with wires dangling down around the TV, behind the desk and around the night stand. After getting out of the ankle deep, slow draining pool of water while showering in the tiny bathroom, we noticed that there was white dust everywhere, we looked up and realized from the bare spots on the ceiling that we were getting showered by the popcorn finish on the ceiling raining down.We booked this on our anniversary weekend because the Renaissance Nashville Hotel was full where we had stayed on our honeymoon for two-thirds the price and ten times the service and room.awesome location! within walking distance of downtown. great customer service! Josh was super helpful &amp; went above &amp; beyond his professional duties to help us out! thanks Josh!! ...breakfast not worth it though.Love cookies and staffI'm a lot like the other reviewers for the DT in the sense that I liked the property but  the area around the hotel left a bit to be desired. It's not as bad as most people on here said, but it's very sparse in terms of restaurants or places to eat. I had no problems walking back from the bars at 3am by myself and I'm built like a lawn dart. I'm not scaring any muggers off. The hotel is nice and the service I received was on par with the Hilton properties I usually stay at. The only nuisance I found was the mandatory valet service. It's a PITA when I have to swing back in for an hour and vallet my freaking car. What sense does that make? They do offer a shuttle service that runs within a 2 mile radius and the shuttle drivers are very nice and informative.  I also liked the Staubucks in the lobby and the bar in the down stairs. The hotel offers everything you'd need and it's right in the middle of downtown. I'll be back!We were here during the Country Music Awards.. it was very busy. The layout of this hotel is somewhat strange, it has a street level entrance that requires you to push your bags through a small door and into an elevator - after a long day of travel, this wasn't what I was looking for..as there are only so many elevators.  Guest reception was a breeze, the clerks were all very professional and helpful.  A nice place to stay, a little dated but nice.","['hotel', 'appears', 'nicer', 'ends', 'real', 'life', 'always', 'goes', 'price', 'right', 'quick', 'trip', 'walking', 'distance', 'bars', 'music',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/millennium-maxwell-house-hotel-nashville,Millennium Maxwell House Hotel,2.0,$$,157,"As a actor I am in Nashville at times filming and booked this suite over the telephone. The manager Valerie was outstanding. The room and furnishings were truly four star. Very clean. Roger and Lana at the front desk are more than helpful and go out of their way to make sure myself and other guests are very satisfied. When I required a limo service Valerie and Lana arranged that for me, The restaurant has very good food and the bar also was enjoyable. Very near bustling downtown. The shuttle when I did use it for the airport was ontime with a very friendly driver. They also have a ATM and a  business center located in the lobby with computers,printers and a fax that is open 24 hours.The fitness room downstairs is a very well equipped gym. Room service is fast.I truly believe they should recieve a four star rating.Thank You Millennium Maxwell House Hotel!!!Antonio LuccheseNew York CityIf I could rate something LESS than 1-star, I would. In fact, Yelp, can we think about negative ratings? Because my stay was (is) THAT bad. I got this hotel based on an Express Deal off Priceline - it claimed to be a 3-Star hotel located downtown. Neither of these statements are true. All the cabs, Ubers and Lyfts I have taken all agree that while saying this hotel downtown is technically true based on streets, it's a stretch to say that it IS downtown. The shuttle the hotel provides that goes downtown is the hotel's only saving grace. And even the shuttle is completely unreliable. The sign for the shuttle claims it arrives every half hour on the 14/45's. Upon arrival, the front desk tells me that it usually runs 15-20 mins off schedule... Which doesnt at all help anyone plan ahead. Good thing for $7Uber/Lyfts downtown. Worth the cost to save the headache of trying to predict shuttle times! I paid for a King room so imagine my surprise when I get to my room and see 2 full beds. When I called down to complain, there wasn't an apology but rather I was told there were no King rooms and I could switch rooms THE NEXT DAY. Finally, after enough ire, they told me I could get a room with a King later that night while I kept my things in the original room they'd given me in the meantime. And then there's the hotel itself. I don't know HOW this hotel gets away with calling itself a 3-star when it's barely a motel. The building, and all its rooms, are beyond dated, which makes everything from the walls to the floors look dirty and rundown. The beds are clean (after inspection) but walking on the carpets gave me the willies (while I usually take my shoes off inside hotel rooms, they stayed on here!). The sink, which is located outside the bathroom, was chipped and the faucet dripping when I arrived. The bathtub has a dip, which makes it feel as if I'm going to fall straight down into the room below at any moment, not to mention the rust around the drain. Most annoying of all is that the walls are PAPER THIN and the doors dont close unless you SLAM them shut, which means doors are slamming at all times of the day. It got SO bad that even though Id prepaid for the room on Priceline, when the opprotunity came up to share a room at another hotel with a friend who was passing through for a night, I jumped on the chance! It was nice to get a decents nights rest, and use a shower I didnt think would break at some point. I saw what this hotel charges regularly and was appalled. Even with the deal I got with Priceline, I feel like I got the raw end of the deal. Not only will I not recommend this to anyone, I will advocate AGAINST this property and will be writing to Priceline about my disappointment.** for the record, a member of their management team did reach out to apologize for this stay, and tried to rectify the situation, which is always greatly appreciated. The property is to be renovated in the summer, perhaps that will solve the remainder of the problems.This wasn't our first choice for a hotel but it was a busy weekend in Nashville and it left us very few options. I felt like the hotel was ok for the price. First impressions; the lobby was nice. The gal at the front desk wasn't overly friendly and advised that no rooms would be ready until after the 4 pm check in (we got there at 3). Fair enough; we dropped our bags off to head for other activities and got a call 10 minutes later our room was ready. Strange it wasn't ready 10 minutes before. The room was ok. The beds and pillows were adequate. I didn't realize they were full beds instead of queens so they were a bit tight for two people. The linens were white and clean, which is very important to me. The bathroom wasn't as clean as I would like, there was a water leak in the shower, but the water pressure was adequate. Sometimes I'm unimpressed with hotel showers but this one was ok. We spent some time at the hotel bar (Maxwells) Friday night, they had a good group for Karaoke. It was a good time. Saturday morning we had the breakfast buffet at Prailenes. It was $12 and was decent. Not the best; not the worst. The elevators were seriously lacking. One smelt of vomit and by Sunday morning, the vomit elevator was the only working elevator out of three. It took quite sometime to leave the floor, which was frustrating. All in all I felt like this hotel was average at best. It was one of the cheaper hotels in Nashville so I felt like I got what I paid for. If you pay more than $250 a night you're getting a rip off for this hotel. It really should be priced lower for the quality.First let me say we are only staying here because we have an event being held here, we would be at a different hotel if that want the case.  (No bellman or valet)So the room rate was suppose to be 129, with the group rate it's actually 159 because we are on the club floor, (club floor at a Sheraton means suite room with complimentary meals in their buffet) with a microwave and a refrigerator(which is hardly cold)  so I tried to say that this is a ridiculous price for a hotel that should be a one star rating based on the out dated condition of the room and facilities.  The door hinges are practically rusted through.  The edges of the carpet haven't been vacuumed in twenty years.  The carpet is dirty and had toothpaste on it.  There are bugs (lady bugs) crawling up the walls.  The door to the room is so thin you can hear everything out in the hallway including the slamming shut of every door down the hall. I tried to complain and the rude front desk minion told me I needed to complain when we first checked in!  I was like we were tired after traveling all day with little kids, and didn't want have to move out 10 pieces of luggage again. He tried to treat me like I was an idiot!  I was like listen to me very carefully we live in Las Vegas I have a complete understanding about the hospitality industry and this outdated, uncaring staff, clearly does not know how to treat their guests and their misrepresentation of the location is ridiculous.  It is in a rundown part of Nashville and really isn't in downtown.  It is also located next door to a women's mental asylum complete with cemetery (totally like American Horror Story).    Three days later and we still don't have a new comforter and the lady bugs are multiplying. Went to the front desk and again attempted to bring this problem to someone's attention.  Adrian asked me to send him the photo of the comforter and apologized and said it would be taken care of.  They gave us breakfast buffet comps (whoopity whoop....sarcasm).I usually don't do reviews but this hotel was so bad I have to say something. This hotel is so outdated. I received terrible service from the front desk when we were checking in and the manager after we complained about it. The air conditioning was not working in the building. To be honest you would think you would need it in February but it was really warm that day. It was 72 degrees and it seemed like 100 degrees in our room. The man who checked us in picked on my wife for filling out the reservation wrong and scolded her. Then when I confronted the manager about it he sided with the front desk and then he scold us. On top of all of that when I got up to our room we found bed bugs. Check back out got our money and went to another hotel. It will never happen again.We just checked in and already I'm sorry. My husband booked this hotel online, and where he booked it, he said the reviews were above average....I'd like to know from what decade they were from.  Certainly not this one, or the previous one for that matter.Nevertheless, he was caught in the same deal as many others were, a non refundable commitment.  They plan it this way, so when you actually get to do your due diligence, like on YELP, you would NEVER book this hotel.  The bathroom was not only moldy, but rusty as well.  One day we ran out of toilet paper.  The maid came in but didn't replace the cardboard roll that remained on the wall. She put the new roll on the back of the toilet!I never saw that...it made me think the maid was a man, not a woman.It's a good thing we only needed this hotel for sleeping, because surprisingly, the bed was comfortable.  However, the bed pillows were bought in Walmart for $2.50, I'll bet.  Don't look for ice, there was none.  Don't look for water in the soda machine at the end of the hall, it's not there.  Don't look for diet soda either, nada....WTF?I looked through the loose leaf showing pictures of the hotel, and it's lobby.  I had to look twice because the pictures in the book were not of the actual lobby.  Chippendale traditional chairs in the book....mismatched worn out, flattened down leather(?), in reality.  My advice for this hotel, besides burn it down and rebuild, at least renovate your bathrooms.  Anyone would gladly pay a few dollars more for a new bathroom.The hotel's low ratings and horrid reviews were quite off-putting, but I was staying here with a friend who had booked the room for a night. Although not extravagant, the hotel lobby was well-kept. The workers at the front desk were friendly and answered our questions regarding the free downtown shuttle. About 1x / 20-30 minutes, the shuttle goes to the Nashville Convention Center and then the airport, it seems. The front desk also gave us extra toiletries when we requested. The hallways and the elevators were fairly stuffy and needed a good airing out. The room itself was tidy and the sheets appeared to be clean. There were the usual little bottles of shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and body lotion. If you happen to need something else, it's likely that they have it in their gift shop on the 1st floor right outside the elevators. The shop has items ranging from typical souvenir items to over-the-counter drugs. Millennium Maxwell House Hotel may not be a 5-star hotel, but it was a decent place to stay at for a night while we explored Nashville.We stayed in this hotel because it was a ""secret deal"" on Hotwire. After finding out which hotel we had won, I was terrified by the bad reviews and tried (unsuccessfully) to find a way to cancel. Pretty much the whole city of Nashville was sold out, and I felt completely stuck. Here's the thing: the bad reviews are largely exaggerated.The fact is, this is an adequate hotel. Clean enough, nice enough. I think people have an issue with the place because it's basically a Holiday Inn Express (minus the free breakfast) posing as a much more expensive hotel. It's not a bad place, it's just not a good match for its price point.The young man who checked us in kept answering phone calls and only gave us 25% of his attention, but nobody dies from that.We had a quiet night's sleep, and we did not take advantage of the pool, gift shop, or the restaurant, so I can't comment on those. I had to pay $6.50 to use a computer for 2 minutes to print our Grand Ole Opry tickets, which is kind of gross for such a ""nice"" hotel.You'll be fine here. Just don't overpay. Try to get the best deal possible, and you won't hate it so much. No bed bugs. No mold. No dirty sheets. No big deal.Started reading Yelp's reviews when we arrived and were horrified about roach mentioned in the reviews.Our room turned out to be just fine, albeit not perfect. But for $150(including taxes) a night, you are close to the city center and free (tips will be nice) shuttle to city center, we thought it's not too bad of deal.Mac, the shuttle driver, was very helpful and friendly giving us some nice tips around town and we did not have to wait more than 10 minutes each way.The cleaning crew we ran into always greeted us. We did not saw any roach house in our room nor it's resident-great relief!! I hate bugs!We saw some people by the pool side relaxing, sunbathing, or reading--quite a soothing scene.Location is convenient -close to major freeways.Wow.  This place looked fancy at first, but that quickly went downhill.  As I approached the front desk, I was greeted with the most robotic greeting and zero smile and told ""let me have your ID and I will verify it"", which was then repeated to me as I looked through my purse to pull out my ID.  That seemed either rude or like she wasn't even paying attention, either way, weird for someone in hospitality.  Night and day difference from my stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Franklin last night, where I got a smile, pleasant greeting and an inquiry into how my travel went.The room itself is pretty awful.  I ended up booked here on my way back from a work trip, but I'd never stay here again.  It's literally falling apart, the guide references items that don't exist and has one info sheet dated 1995.  The guide tells me to lock the deadbolt in addition to the electronic lock, except my room doesn't have one.As soon as I turned the shower on, the tub started filling up despite the drain being open and the water blasted right through the curtain.  I took a quick, under 10min shower and the bathroom is now completely soaked.  My shade is busted so I guess I'll be changing in my soaking wet bathroom or hiding in the opposite corner.  I'd ask for another room except now that I've read the other reviews, I'm afraid it would be even worse.  Closet doesn't fully shut, dresser drawer is stuck partially out, and the rubber molding at the base of the wall by the door is falling off with grossness revealed behind it.Decent place with a friendly staff. I like the location and easy access to the freeway. Looks like it may need some upgrades or a remodel.Has to be one of the worst hotels I've stayed in. Run down and dirty. The walls are literally PAPER thin. They bizarrely put conference rooms in the middle of the hallway on guest floors. I've never seen that at a hotel. Typically the conference rooms are near the lobby on the main floor.  So now at 1:00am (as I'm writing this) there's currently a group of loud drunk people screaming and singing songs. Not sure 1) Why they have been allowed to stay until 1:00am without anyone enforcing the noise 2) Why are there even conference rooms in the middle of hotel guest rooms 3) IT IS 1:00 IN THE MORNING! WHY IS THIS GROUP EVEN IN A CONFERENCE ROOM BECAUSE THEY CLEARLY AREN'T DISCUSSING BUSINESS Overall horrible experience. Definitely wouldn't stay here again.We just wanted a clean affordable place to stay.  What we got was a very dated, shabby  room. The rug needed to be vacumed,the bathroom door and wallpaper were dirty. On our last day the shower knob for the tub fell off while my husband was showering.  The lobby had a terrible odor.  In a not so nice area of town. Oh and by the way it was not such a great price  either. We booked through hot wire and could not leave early or get a refund.  I have 1 positive, the staff was extremely nice.Its advertised as downtown Nashville, but lets be honest, youre about 7 miles out Maxwell House. The free shuttles running all day til 1030pm to downtown definitely makes up for that. The lobby had a grandma's closet kinda vibe.. No refrigerators in the rooms. No cold water in the showers. WiFi was slow. No continental breakfast. Maid service stopped in around 11:30am, asking them nicely to come back in an hour they never returned. In room coffee is provided, but there should be a sign that reads ""STOP: There's a Starbucks across the street.""Front Desk was very helpful when asking questions.Close to freeway, so if you dont want the service you expect in a hotel experience and want a clean getaway after you grab McDonalds or Arbys, then this place is top notch.Most of my experience was mild mediocre down to the last drop.The lobby is decent and the maids are sweet. That's about as far as I can go with positives. NO wifi in your room, very overpriced and the bathroom is both unsightly and tiny. If McDonald's and Arby's are what you are looking for, then this is the hotel for you. I would rather stay at a days inn and pay $40 a night. At least you'd have Internet and free breakfast.Also, a hotel under the millenium hotel brand should absolutely have a manager who scours the Internet for reviews and responds to both the positives and negatives and uses them to implement change for the better. Have yet to find one of these kind of responses.Very dissapointed with this stay! Bathroom is very clean and not spacious.We booked on Priceline for a 3-star hotel in Downtown Nashville. In reality on a 4-star hotel scale (whereas yelp is a 5-star scale) this is a 2.5 star tops and it's about 3 miles from downtown, definitely not walking distance. All in all I don't understand the 1 and 2 star yelp reviews I read. It's not a bad option if you don't mind driving.Pros1. Comfortable beds and bedding. Although try to get a king size for a couple. The regular beds are full size, a little too small for two people. We couldn't get a king size.2. Price at $110 per night with free parking is not a bad value for Nashville.3. On site restaurants and lounge.4. Shuttle - they have a shuttle downtown but we never took it, so don't know how convenient it is.5. Air conditioner - worked well and was quiet.6. Hotel staff - everyone was great from the front desk to housekeeping. Had no problems.7. Towels were nice and soft.Cons1. Smells - on entering the lobby, you encounter a light funky sewage smell, somewhat covered up by air freshener.2. No Refrigerator - $10 extra cost per day.3. Bathroom - not terrible, a little grungy, discolored caulk and tile grout.4. Location - nothing in walking distance. This is essentially a conference or overflow hotel.5. Door to hotel room was very beat up and we could hear them closing loudly. Wore ear plugs at night so no big deal.6. Pool - doesn't open until Memorial Day? What are we, in Chicago? Ha ha.7. Really, really, poor in room coffee, but there's a Starbucks down the road.Stay here, it's really fine, don't worry about the bad reviews unless you are looking for the Taj Mahal at $110 per night.This was the first time going to Nashville and my friends picked out the hotel.  I thought the price was steep but was overlooking that if the place was nice and close to attractions.  When we arrived on a Friday evening around 6pm there were no parking spaces remaining.  We drove around for 20 minutes to finally find one by the road.  When we walked in the lobby was nice.  We headed to the bar to meet up with friends and it was a nice place.  Food was ordered and received quickly and it tasted good.  When we got to the room I was not impressed with the size of beds, lights that didn't work, dirty bathroom.  When we took a shower you had to turn the knobs all the way over to cold for the luke warm water to work.  We visited our friends on the 9th floor and when we went to go down the elevator we waited for 20 minutes and ended up taking the stairs because the elevator didn't work.  I used the vending machine and it ate my $1.00.  I wanted a can of pop to drink when I left.  When I went to the front desk they told me I would have to go to the bar and get a drink there which wasn't a can.2 star hotel at five star prices. Front desk had lots of attitude which was very much unwarranted. There was mold in my bathroom, no shower curtain on check in and stains on both the floor and the chairs. I would never ever ever pay to stay there againGreat hotel, great price and great views of the city, the hotel was immaculate,  a little dated, but they make up for it with extras, like flavored water and goo goo clusters in the lobby.  There is also a free shuttle to downtown,  I would recommend.  Any issues this place has had have clearly been addressed.","Ridiculously overpriced and there are definitely inflated reviews on other sites. The worst problem was that the shower backed up and we ended up standing in a few feet of water. Couldn't get into wifi, the check in service was extremely slow, and they incorrectly charged $150 to our card. The whole place smelled like smoke, even the non smoking rooms, and the decor is at least 50 years old. We will never be staying here again. Feel like we were robbed.Stayed here for the 3rd time last week. Have to downgrade my review. First the positives. The beds were very comfortable and the towels were soft. The shuttle service was better than the last 2 times. But, this hotel is in dire need of a make over. We stayed on the 5th floor. There are scratches on the walls. The bathroom needs to be gutted and re-done. And, it basically is just dated and worn out. Will come back after renovations. And my sister was promised free internet in the Lobby. However, even after spending 20 minutes on the phone with tech support, she never got on. After complaining, she finally got one day of free internet ( it's usually $10/day!) Too bad, I really liked this hotel in the past.DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! This is my first time to review anything, ever. I signed up for Yelp to warn you! They are randomly charging the cards of their patrons very large amounts. I heard it at check in, wasn't concerned because my company had paid for my room. Sure enough my personal card was charged for almost $400 after they swore the card was only on file for potential incidental charges. Literally everyone I have spoke to at the hotel since has had the same experience, some people for as much as $800. On top of all that, the hotel is very dated. TVs have the worst reception ever, and they didn't service my room twice out of three nights. I travel for work, stay in hotels almost every night, this was hands down the worst experience ever. DONT STAY HERE!It was an alright hotel for a fair price. Room was clean, but the wifi is really slow. The TV was nice, but the walls are very thin. Didn't eat breakfast or use the airport or downtown shuttle they have but it's available. It was a place to stay that wasn't awful basically.Wifi is pretty much non existent, front desk staff is rude, housekeeping will knock on your do even if the do not disturb sign is displayed, trouble trying to get packages sent to the hotel.I was willing to let most things go until I was disturbed this morning in the middle of a nice dream with housekeeping beating on my door, I got out of bed and asked what the deal was since my dnd was displayed, oh sorry and off she walked, if your staff can't read what good are they, not impressed by anything other than the Speakman 5 shower head.TV picture is terrible and snowy2 months after leaving they start charging my card for random amounts, now fighting with credit card company and hotel, this place is a scamWe absolutely loved staying here. Loved the cocoons!!! Going to make some when we get home!!!! We will stay here next time!If they replaced the doors on the rooms in this hotel it would have gotten 5 star's from me...  The restaurant is very nice food was fabulous and extremely reasonable. they have a buffet they offered with lots of yummy items. Room service was speedy and food was fabulous! Cleaning staff is very friendly and accommodating. ...my daughter was feeling well so we usually got a late start. ..they were quiet and very good at their job. ..sheets were changed daily.When you walk into the hotel a moldy smell hits you. The room is dark nasty carpet and is old. You can hear everything because the was and floor must be paper thin. The bed is uncomfortable and it is really not a nice hotel.How can you f*ck up bacon?We stayed here because it was a recommended hotel for a local music festival. Boy was that a mistake! Instead of telling a story, let me lay out the pros and cons from our weekend stay. I'm sure others will have a better (or worse) experience than we did, but I promise you dear reader, I am not exaggerating or stretching the truth.Pros:1. The water pressure in the shower was phenomenal! I could feel the sweat and grime being blown from my skin.2. The a/c was ice cold. A nice escape from the humid Summer day.3. The shuttle was useful getting to and from our event.Cons:1. Either our sink or shower was causing the room to flood. Several feet of the rug in the room would become flooded, I mean sploosy soaked, whenever we would clean up. 2. When we told the front desk about the flooding, they sent maintenance by the room. He ripped up the carpet, blotted it with towels, and said they'd send a shop-vac up later and will dry the rest. Okay, so I guess the problem will continue.3. The front desk absolutely knew about the leak before putting us in this room. I asked what they were going to do to compensate us and I was told they could move us into a new room later that night. No money would be returned. No help, they were jerks.4. The towels were so cheap I ripped one cleaning my back. Two-handed, swiping back and forth, riiiiiip. I wasn't wiping very hard, either.5. They do not deliver anything to your room. If you want extra pillows or towels, you have to go get them from the front desk.6. There's no continental breakfast, which should be provided for how much I paid. The breakfast provided in their bar downstairs had wet eggs, hard oatmeal, and tasteless bacon. Seriously, tell me how do you f*ck up bacon? Floppy or crisp, it's delicious. This was the opposite.7. They had several hundred parking spots blocked off with a security guard. No explanation, but we had to park on the opposite side of the lot, which sucks when all you want to do is bring in your stuff.8. The toilet paper holder fell off the wall.9. The pool opens at 10am and closes at 8pm. Forget an early swim to wake up or a late night dip to relax before bed.10. Door and window hinges were rusty. Make sure you have your tetanus shot before visiting.11. Almost no power outlets available.I paid $135/night, this place MIGHT be worth $50/night. I would only recommend staying here if your conference is held in the building.In a word... Awful! When I called down to ask if someone could fix my leaky tub.  I was asked by the woman at the front desk ""and what would you like me to do about it"" the bathroom is gross and full of stains.   There are holes in the walls in the hallways.  Everything about this place maybe me feel itchy and un comfortable. No outlets. No internet. I wouldn't spend 20$ a night to stay here let alone the outrageous price that this crappy hotel chargesThis is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in.  Rooms are dirty and I mean dirty on top of old carpet and furniture.  I had to kill a bug in my room that was HUGE!  The phone was broken in the room I had to call the main phone from my cell to talk to the front desk.  They charged my card twice when I logged in.  While some of the staff are nice the entire team is incompetent and run a poor ship.  Unless you have to DO NOT stay here.Wish I could give it NO stars...that is what it deserves.  Terrible hotel - smells dirty with a bit of cheap spray deodorizer as an attempt to mask the smell.  This place is old, very tired, and NOT somewhere I want to stay.  We ended up NOT staying here the first time.  The room booked through Expedia was a KING Club Room.  We arrived at 5pm, was given a key to double bed room that smelled.  We go back to the front desk -- NO king rooms available.  Really? The parking lot is empty.  It's 5pm for pete's sake. The incompetent person at the front desk was very rude.  He didn't care that we left.  There was NO manager on duty (has not been one on duty each time we called with complaints). They would not refund our money, nor would Expedia.  So...to say that we are upset with both the Craphole Notel-Motel and Expedia is an understatement.So this place had some potential, but ended up being an epic disappointment for us.Let me start with the positive though...free shuttle to downtown, price was good, parking was free, and we were here with friends. I ate breakfast in the hotel one morning and it was pretty good. It was $10, but did include more than what you would get in most hotels.And now the frustrations. 1. Check-in took forever! They only had 2 people working and a line out the door. The process was not efficient.2. My group reserved 5 rooms for a conference. We reserved all King rooms but when checking in were all given rooms with 2 double beds. The people checking us in said they couldn't do anything about it because they were sold out.3. Everywhere you look in the hotel you see maintenance issues. From the carpet, to the walls, and in the bathrooms, the entire place needs some updating.4. Wifi...this is a joke! The fastest speed I ever got was .08 MB download.5. In our room the bathroom was the worst part. The shower did not drain well, likely because the water comes so fast. The hinges on the door were extremely rusty, and the bathmat that is permanently attached to the tub was starting to peel up.I wish this place were better...but, it wasn't.DISGUSTING HOTEL!! My fiance arrived at the hotel about a week before me. The day that he arrived, he walked into the room to find a roach on the chair. He killed the roach and switched rooms. When I arrived to the hotel, the first impression that I received was very dated. The hotel is outdated, it has a horrible smell, and it is not clean. When we walked into the room, there was a roach crawling up the wall (see picture). I even took a video of it, just in case no one believed me. I immediately went downstairs to have our room changed. I asked the front desk lady to put us in a more updated room, and she told me that the floor we were on (9th floor) were the nicest rooms (HUGE disappointment).  While we were packing our bags to switch rooms, I noticed a Roach Motel (it kills roaches) underneath the air conditioner. My fiance told me that he noticed a roach motel in his previous room as well.. So basically, the hotel knows that they have a hug pest problem, however they won't fix it. Instead they put these roach motels in the rooms, hoping it gets rid of the problem, and it absolutely does not. When we checked out of the hotel (the very next morning), I mentioned the roaches and roach motels to the front desk and she said that every hotel in Nashville has a huge roach problem.. That was interesting, because the Sheraton did not seem to have that same problem.In addition to uninvited pests, the food is horrible, and the service is even more mortifying. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!! We only paid $70 for our room, but I wouldn't have paid $10.I'm going to give this 4 stars, but barely.  In my opinion it wasn't as bad as people make it out to be.  Staying in an affordable hotel with a free shuttle to and from the airport and downtown was a huge perk.  That saved us probably $100 right there.  Also- the food is fantastic!  Hotel food, yes! Busy bar on Saturday night, albeit a variety of types.  I like people watching though.Staff is not friendly at all.  They are right about that.  Except the shuttle drivers- they are the only true hospitality experts in that establishment. Room was more like 3 stars.This seems like it should be a very nice hotel, and it could be were anyone paying attention to the details. The $9.95 a day in-room wifi is worthless. A speed test clocked it at 0.02 MB per second. When I complained at the front desk, I was told to come down to use the lobby wifi because it is much faster. This is just an example of the kind of poor management and disregard for guests at this hotel. Others: the sink plunger is broken and the shower handle is backwards, so cold is hot and hot cold. I can't get the ironing board out of my closet because the shelf was installed too close. Etcetera, etcetera. As others have said, the walls are thin and the doors between rooms not insulated. I can hear everything the people next door are doing and saying, even as I sit as far from the door as possible. Despite what the hotel claims, this is not close to downtown. It's a 15 minute shuttle ride through some really run down parts of Nashville. It's essentially out in the middle of nowhere.The hotel was not that great. The CONS1. The bathroom is super dirty and outdated2. The pool is on the smaller side3. No refrigerator4. The door to the hotel room doesn't always close causing a safety issue5. The carpet is very dirty 6. Lighting is not good in the room7. Barley any electrical outlets8. Unwanted BUGSPROS1.Great location- gas station is across the street 2. Free Shuttle bus 3. Free Parking4. Friendly Staff5. Free internet 6. Decent view of town - We were on the 7th floorHotel is clean and staff is friendly. Older needs some updating I would stay here againHorrible. Trash, Kleenex, standing water, hair, and other human debris filled the tub upon arrival. Asked for new room and was denied. I was told that a manager, engineer, and cleaning staff ""had to come immediately""; I was able to convince them to allow my wife and I to get dressed before this group came to my room. We dressed and left by 9:15AM. Upon our return arrival at noon (12:00), the only change was the removal of the Kleenex and the drain stopper. The human filth, standing water, hair etc remained. The most telling thing is that after all of these people ""had to"" get into our room immediately, there was no follow up. No call asking if everything else was alright (it wasn't), no call asking if the tub was ok (it wasn't), not call apologizing for taking our money and giving us filthy and unacceptable room. No further contact was made with either of us for the entirety of our 4 day stay.Further, the sink leaked all over the counter and floor, bugs (roaches?) were seen in sleeping area and bathroom, food trash was left around bed from previous ""guest"", and the air conditioner/heater was not working correctly. When I brought up these issues, woman at front desk (Keenu?) hung up on me mid-sentence. Also, someone in adjoining room attempted entry through shared door. As they had a top-to-bottom Happy Birthday sign allowed to be put on their door, I'm sure it was while they were drunk or otherwise impaired. That's even scarier. None of these issues met this hotel's requirement for assigning different room OR refunding the remainder of my charges so that I could find a cleaner, safer place to stay in the city.I decided that even though we were unable to shower at all in the hotel (and had to go to a family relation towards the end of our trip to use a shower), barely got any sleep, and were thoroughly disgusted at both the state of our room and the way that we were treated, it was a lesson learned that you need to trust online reviews. A quick search would have revealed the many, many horrible reviews of this place (in addition to the reviews that were obviously written by staff or a paid agency).ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT, after cleaning the room ourselves before checkout they have the gall to charge us an additional $155.89 (on 3 separate transactions) without explanation. And that is just so far, as these new charges are coming up hours apart. If these are legitimate charges (they are not) why would they not come in all as one? Also, as we left Saturday evening, they have charged us these bogus fees within 24 business hours, while we were forced to stay like squatters for 4 days. It's criminal that they're this fast with bogus charges, yet refuse to address the real safety concerns of their guests.I have photos that show some of this ridiculousness.We had a good experience here for the price (Priceline bid). Only an 8 minute shuttle or cab to downtown Nashville. The club king room ($20 upgrade per night and included a free breakfast for two) was nice and we had a view of the downtown skyline.","We used a website while on the road to find a place in Nashville that was close to the areas we wanted to see, and this popped up.  Had no idea it was tied to the coffee, but that was neat, and there was a small display by the bar, etc.The hotel itself is large and fairly modern.  When we arrived our online details were still up in the air, so the desk clerk sent us to the bar for free drinks.  Heck yeah!  I had a Hap and Harry's, a local beer that was great.  When we were finally ready to check in, the clerk offered us free coupons for breakfast but couldn't print them out. Sadly, though she left a note, the morning staff did not provide these so we ate elsewhere.The room was great.  Large, a comfy bed, and decent views.  We would definitely stay here again.Front desk staff are rude and discourteous. Phone in room didn't work, and they really did not care. Actually laughed when I asked for a small credit on the bill for the issue.....like having a working phone was a perk. Bathrooms are extremely dated and have moldy tile, and peeling wallpaper. Beds were amazing. Wait staff at the bar were great. Witnessed other guests complaining to the front desk staff about issues. All the while, the staff clearly could not have cared less. And my #1 PET PEEVE..... Charging for wi-fi. Come one people......buy a $50 router and let the guests use the Internet. Nothing says #cheaphotel like a $10 per day charge for wi-fi. Clearly shows their desperation to just stay afloat.Not terrible but nothing special. The hotel was hosting multiple loud groups including a professional darts convention which lent itself to very unique groups in every common area. Room was dark and facility in general is a bit out-of-date. They do provide a shuttle to downtown which is very convenient but the driver was bad-mouthing an airline crew that had a late arrival to a van full of other crews.Not the worst place I've stayed but certainly not rushing to return.Ok I have read a lot of these reviews and honestly you are complaining about a moderately priced hotel that is moderately appointed and about 5 min from downtown. My GF and I were just fine with this hotel. The lobby is great, check in was fine and the rooms are half decent I mean they won't blow your mind but what do you expect for 70 bucks!!!!! They kept the room clean, the place was quiet and everything worked. Biggest downfall of this place is the bathrooms. They need some help for sure and we didn't have hot water one morning. Like I said from super 8 prices the place is not bad. U don't have to pay to park either which is a huge rip off in downtown Nashville. So... Save your money for a nice meal and a few extra beers and stay here. It is close enough to downtown and nice enough to stay in!Warning warning warning. Not happy at all right now. Booked a king room and was given a smaller room. When we told them they said we booked wheelchair accessible and we don't need that so we have to wait till a king room is ready. Check in starts at 3 and it is almost 5. We can not cancel our reservation without loosening out money and now we get to sit and wait. I will NEVER come here again. Took us 11 hours to get here, I want to shower and get ready to go out and can't. Stay away from this place.Front desk staff are  the worst I have seen in a hotel of this size.  I would have canceled my reservation if I had the time.Workout facility is pathetic!  I have no idea where they found the equipment but I guarantee the newest piece of equipment is 15 years old.Never know what you are going to get from a Hotwire hotel but this was nice.  Free parking and free shuttles to and from downtown.  Beds were comfortable and I haven't had shower pressure this good since college.  I'd recommend this Hotel to someone looking to save money from staying downtown.To start off you get what you pay for and it's why I give this hotel 3 stars. To start we arrived at 3:30pm and the room wasn't ready, we waited 35min before our room was ready. That was a real turn off! Since we had driven 600 miles and wanted to relax. Fast forward to the room you get what you pay for, nothing fancy. Since I seen a lot of theft reviews I decided to not have my room service through out the week. We did have plenty of towels, the water pressure was great, but the bed SUCKED!! I will bring a bed top and pillows next time. A second turn off was the fact that you had to pay $10 for wifi and $10 per day to have a fridge or microwave In your room. Really wow, no thank you!One thing we appreciated was the shuttle ride. They took you to downtown and back and any other places within 5miles of the hotel which was a relief.  The drivers were very friendly and were always willing to give a good review on good spots.Showed up to check in and were told our Queen rooms that we booked in April were given away.  We were then told we were getting comped breakfast and free drinks. Got a voucher for A breakfast and A drink when we are here for 3 days.  Rooms were smelly and not together. Were hassled about paying a deposit of $50 per day for incidentals.  Shuttle service ends at 10:30 pm when lightlife is ALL night.Just the absolute worst. The sad thing is it doesn't have to be. The majority of the bad taste comes from the entire staff going out of their way to be rude. From the gift shop to the front desk. I could not begin to type every experience because it would require transcript of every encounter weather it was asking for the cab number, buying a water or calling to ask a question about wifi. When I checked in the concierge did not even look at me during the entire transaction. And for maid service they don't change your sheets? The blankets are ripped? I met a custodian named Evette that was very very nice. She was the shining star, I can't imagine the strength it takes for her to smile given the work environment.I am nice person that always smiles and known as a polite young adult. I am from the service industry and never ever encountered this bad of a collective staff.My stay at this hotel last week was to say the least, underwhelming.  It is an old and outdated hotel that needs a renovation DESPERATELY.  There is no FREE WiFi in the room ($10 per day PER DEVICE charge), and even if you pay for it, your connection will be tenuous at best.  Even the free lobby wifi disconnects constantly.  I was attending a group event and the food we were served at our meals was cold and tasteless.  When we took the shuttle downtown, we were told that pickup would be hourly on the 1/2 hour.  We waited over 45 minutes past pickup time and called the hotel desk twice asking where the shuttle was.  We were told it would be arriving in 5 minutes borh times we called.  By the time we gave up waiting and took a $14 taxi ride back to the hotel, there were 12 people waiting for the bus which only holds 11 people!  SPEND A FEW DOLLARS MORE FOR A HOTEL ROOM SOMEPLACE ELSE, PEOPLE.....you will be happy you did!!!I have never stayed at the Millennium Maxwell House Hotel - this review is strictly for the ballroom.  If you ever find yourself in the market for a party space, then this will be useful for you.  Otherwise, probably not.So our work Christmas party was here.  It is conveniently located close to the office and since our party is during work hours in the afternoon, that's what they wanted.  When you go into the lobby, there's not very good signage to show you where to go so we just wandered around lost until we happened to find it down a long hallway.  The room was big and the tables were set nicely.  The entire place just seemed a little dated....like it was a really grand, regal ballroom back in 1983 and now it just looks a little fusty.  The food was set up buffet style and was actually decent for hotel food.  Sound system was OK but I think it was actually the guy they hired to play saxophone.  Like Kenny G Christmas up in there!  I thought the staff did a decent job clearing off tables and getting beverages, nothing over the top bad or good.What's the bottom line?  If you need a big room and you don't care about the fact that it is totally dated, then you can have your party here.  If you want something more modern and classy, this probably is not going to be your thing.We stayed here one night on our way out West. The hotel itself is pretty and we got a nice room on the ninth floor with a great city view. We spent some time in the hotel bar and then retired for the night...    We were woken up sometime around 5:30 in the morning by loud voices and banging in the hallway. My husband stood up to go see what the commotion was and stepped into pooled water all over our hotel room. He asked them what he should do because we couldn't get back to sleep and nobody was answering the phone at the front desk. They told us to gather our things and go downstairs because they needed to work in our room as well.   We went down to the desk and stood around in our pajamas along with some other guests who had been forced out of their rooms by the flooding and men working. When we finally got to the front of the line, the woman at the desk had no answer for us so she said to just hold on. We waited for around an hour, and were finally told that there was not a room for us to move to. Eventually we decided that there was nothing more we could do, so I found a bathroom and changed out of my pajamas and we checked out so we could start our long drive, because at this point I was so upset that I probably couldn't have gotten back to sleep if I tried.   We told the woman at the front desk that we were going to check out and she simply said ""Okay."" No apology, no solution. So upset and exhausted, we grabbed our bags and left. Apparently this particular hotel doesn't put a lot of focus on customer service, after paying full price for the room and trying to contact them, We have gotten no response.  I understand that unforeseen things happen, but the fact that they have done nothing to make up for what happened is extremely disappointing.There was nothing special about this place.  On the other hand, it wasn't horrible either.  For some reason, they checked us into a handicapped room (neither of us are handicapped), but whatever.  The shuttle that takes you to the downtown area was nice and the most we had to wait was about 20 minutes.  It obviously would have been easier and faster to just stay somewhere downtown but we booked on Hotwire and this is what we got.  The room itself was okay.  Fairly clean and comfortable.  We actually ate at both Praline's and Maxwell's (the 2 restaurants in the hotel) and the service at both was atrocious.  The food was good which saved both experiences.  I probably would not stay here again but that is 90% due to the location.  Oh, the shuttle back to the hotel from downtown ends at 9:30 so you need to pay to cab it back if you stay out past then.  Lame.Sitch: So this was a 1 night stay for the purposes of doing some touristy stuff in Nashville, after a 3 hour drive down from KY.  Also, i've worked in a hotel so knowing the plight of the hotel worker, my opinion has changed over the years. The location is GREAT, right off the freeway, close to downtown but NO annoying city traffic, and has a huge lot with a roomy round-a-bout to drop of your stuff.  The lobby is large and throughout the first floor there's a LOT of neat history everywhere. Hinting at the fact that, yes, this place is older, BUT they've updated where it counts (for me). The front desk staff was a little vacant, but helpful and knowledgable. Room (we went with a Club Level 30% off deal (Expedia), comes with WIFI and a breakfast buffet - WORTH IT! )  Could tell it was older, the only thing not really updated was the bathroom, old tile from a 70's movie, but clean and got the job done. The CD player in the clock radio at the bedside was hilarious, almost went out to the truck and grabbed some CD's.   They had a nice big Flat Screen TV and a shelved mirror with hooks above the desk. Handy for someone I'm sure, if you ever find a use for those hooks, leave a comment please.  One real downer in the room was the fact that the comforter on the bed was more a thick bed sheet than anything else. Shuttles leaving every 15 minutes to the city are CLUTCH, very convenient. Overall, if you're looking for a nice, interesting place to crash for a night or two, this is your place.   if you need all the plush comforts and homey feel of a Westin, go stay in a Westin.Most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed at.  Lets start off with the housecleaning, they dont change your sheets, they do not vaccum your room and are completely rude when you ask them to do anything. Food here is horrible, room is scary, staff is rude, store in hotel the people that own it are rude!! The cream of the crop is when I got home from staying at the millenium I had a COCK ROACH in my suitcase! Disgusting dont ever stay here!!!!The room was nice. I'm not a fan, though, of rooms that have the toilet and bathtub in one room and the sink outside in the room. We didn't get to the bar during the time live music was available, but it was a nice bar, with reasonably-priced bevearges. The hotel restaurant was about average. The breakfast buffet was basic.Really 2 and half stars. Decent customer service. Had some major issues with wifi. Finally this morning they moved me to another room. 2nd room wasn't much better finally after having to get upset they changed me to a 3 rd room. Finally it worked. Hooray!! Once I got settled again things were a little better. Great view of the city. Across the street is a couple fast food joints and a gas station. Our airport pick up service was prompt but I did hear some people complain this afternoon about having to wait so long to go back to the airport. It's an older hotel but you can see they are trying to maintain it. It's not the worst hotel but not the best. Blackout curtains aren't the best. Room doors are loud whenever anyone in the hall shuts them and the grout in the shower looks like its time to be replaced or deep cleaned. Workout room had a little of everything.I arrived around 11PM on a Friday night. The staff was friendly and rowdy. The hotel bar was drowning in karaoke and beers, and in the hall I encountered bachelorette, birthday and bachelor parties! Nonetheless I slept well on my king size bed like a queen!**Shuttle: Convenient and complimentary. Takes you to the airport (extended hours) and to downtown from 10AM to 1030PM. It'll drop you off/pick you up at BROADWAY and 5th Ave N. at the corner of the World Famous Legends and kitty-corner to the Bridgestone Arena. Make sure to coordinate with the front desk a time for the shuttle drivers to pick you up. **It's on a first call basis.Room: Large, clean, simple. I lucked out with a beautiful view of the Nashville skyline.Decor: Definitely gives off a Nashville feel. It's themed with music inspired art at perhaps 1950-1980s. Gave an old time feel, which was different yet pleasant.Don't stay here if you need to get work done. The internet system is abysmal. The hotel facilities and staff are nice enough, but I lost 3 hours of my morning to dealing with the internet connection, which was never resolved. The internet connection is managed by technicians offsite - the best they could do ultimately was send a recommendation to investigate the situation further and send me a ticket claim number. It was so unbelievably frustrating - no one at the hotel could do anything about the situation. I can't recommend anyone stay here who travels for business, it's simply too unreliable.","Not impressed at all with this place.  I'd have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding the service staff...not very friendly/helpfull.  Bed's not very comfy and room's dirty and outdated.  Spend a few extra bucks and go elsewhere.Love Shannon P's review...""Sell this place off to Super 8"".The location in the city was great! It was in the middle of everything.. The rooms look OK until you take a closer look, underneath my bed had an empty grocery bag, gummy bears, gold fish crackers and a lot of dust. Their were no bed bug covers on the mattress which was strange and a little uneasy. I conveyed all these issues to the front desk... My concerns seemed to inconvenience them as they were trying to rush me off of the phone.. Needless to say, i do not recommend this  hotel property! And I will bypass this brand!Stayed here for 3 nights and left feeling disappointed and with an extremely sore back (not great when driving 8 hours back to Chicago).My negative experience started at the front desk when checking in. There were two women working, and neither wanted to be there. The woman who checked me in was cold, rude, and gave me attitude and started helping another person check in as I read over the agreement before signing it. I mean, excuse me for taking the time to read something before agreeing to it. Didn't realize those extra 30 seconds were such a big deal. Bottom line: if you can't be friendly and welcoming, don't be in the hotel industry.The hotel's lobby was fine. Relatively small, but at least somewhat nice looking. But as soon as you get past the lobby, you see that this hotel is old and dirty. Our room was really small, but that didn't matter too much. The bed, however, was a nightmare. It was old, uncomfortable, and left me with a sore back for a week after I checked out of the hotel. I can deal with a small room, a grainy tv, a dirty bathroom, a sink and shower with low water pressure, outdated decor, paper thin walls where you can hear every noise from other hotel patrons (all of these things were present in my hotel room), but not having at least a moderately comfortable bed is inexcusable for a hotel that charges $100+/night. Parking was also an interesting situation. This hotel has a HUGE parking lot, though on any given night, a majority of parking spots will be taken by people who are attending a party, conference, or some other event at the hotel. On the first night of my stay, two separate parties were happening at the hotel. We weren't able to find parking so we left the hotel property and drove around for hours until a spot became available. So be aware of that if you're driving or will have a car.I did not use the internet at the hotel because I read that it was $9/day for wireless and $5/hour for wired connection. That's ridiculous. Again, if you're charging $100+/night for an outdated hotel, at least give your guests free wifi.As for the pros, I liked being super close to downtown Nashville without paying the super high prices to stay downtown. I also saw that the hotel had a shuttle that went downtown, but since we had a car we didn't use it.Bottom line: the hotel is outdated, the beds are extremely uncomfortable, the rooms are overpriced, the staff is rude, and there's virtually nothing within walking distance of the hotel. After staying here, if I go back to Nashville, I'll be sure to pay the slightly higher price to stay downtown.I'm giving them 2 because we ordered room service and it was good and not cold and came around the time they said they would be there. I wish I could say the same for the rollaway we had to get because my boyfriend got the room thinking it was a 2 bed (because that's what the description said) and it wasn't. So we had to pay for a rollaway which took almost 2 hours and after a few phone calls to get. The hotel has potential if they hired a whole new staff. It lives up to it's bad review reputation and I'm sure will continue to.Well to start, I booked my room two weeks before my reservation date and I received a call the day before I left, saying that they did not have a room for me because they overbooked, but that they were going to move me to another hotel which was on the other side of town. Note: I had actually chosen this hotel because it was close to the venue where I was attending an event. They also said I would receive a full refund as well as a complementary stay at this other hotel. When I arrived at the other hotel, they proceeded to tell me that they had no reservation for me. So I went back out to my car and called the Millennium Maxwell House Hotel to clear up the confusion. Then I was put on hold for about 20 minutes before they told me that they did actually have a room for me. While I was on the phone, I asked if we could check-in early because we had been on the road for 17 hours. They said, and I quote, ""Your room is ready. Come on over."" When we arrived, I went to check-in and they still could not find my reservation. After about 15 minutes of searching, they finally found my reservation and told me that my room was not ready and that they would ""call me as soon as it was."" After sitting in the parking lot for over an hour and a half, I walked back in to check on the status of my room. Again, it took them about 15 minutes to find my reservation, but when they found it, they told me my room had been ready. Then I asked them about the rate because 1) the second hotel was going to be free and 2) it had been such a hassle between the extreme lack of communication. They told me that I would be charged the original full price because I ""ended up staying there after all."" So then after finally receiving my room key, we headed up to the room where the first thing we saw was the top right corner of the door covered in something that looked like black mold. We walked in and when we turned to close the door, we discovered that the only way to close the door was to slam it shut using your full body weight. As we went to set our bags down, we noticed a fist-sized hole in the wall and that one of the lamps had been broken and was showing exposed wires. We were very disappointed in the quality of the room, regardless of all these issues with the door, the lamp, and the wall. For a $400 room, it looked very cheap and small. I have actually stayed in nicer motels than this very expensive hotel. When I got back from my event that night, I asked the front desk if I could have a late checkout because we got in late and the staff member was very rude and did not seem to want to help. I can assure you that I will never again stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Note: All the words in quotation marks were actually said to me by the hotel staff.So the listing is noted as being a downtown hotel. Really it's a view of downtown. We asked the receptionist about it and she said ""Anything 5 miles from downtown is still considered downtown. So we hear about the shuttle but it only runs until 10:30 so we decide to drive ourselves around. Each of the three nights that we were there we would see people in the lobby and the elevators slamming drinks pregamming. Apparently this is the low class riff raff party hotel. There was even a club like atmosphere going on in the bar on Saturday night where locals show up, so we had to park about a 4 minute walk from the front door of our hotel. They could not provide a king bed although there were only two of us so we slept on a full. The hotel is so outdated and has only an outdoor pool. We could hear all of our neighbors talking in the rooms next to us and outside our room. Really killed the mood. The sink is outside of the bathroom so you have to get ready in the room under fluorescent lighting. There was rust all over the bathroom which was so small the door nearly hit the toilet when you open the door. The door didn't lock. The main door to the room also doesn't lock except for the side bar. The ac/heat was not temperature controlled so if we didn't get up out of bed we would end up sweating or freezing until the point of waking up to go shut it off. Housekeeping came by at like 8 am and kept coming by every hour until we left. They partially tidy up but I found it odd that they just threw a pile of toiletries on the corner of sink. For whatever reason, wi-fi was an extra charge as was the business center. Luckily where we went for a concert was able to accept the ticket on our phone. It was $5 min charge for the internet and the charges to print. Everything felt grungy and dilapidated. I would rather have stayed at motel 6 for half the price.I was flown into Nashville with my band to play a private event.  Everything was arranged and booked well in advance...3 rooms booked at the Millennium Maxwell House...one night.  We were shuttled to the hotel after the event at 12:30.  We were greeted with ""yeeeeah about those 3 rooms....we don't have those""  They did not honor the reservation.  After reading some other reviews I've seen we're not alone in this experience there.  They have even stiffed a bride and groom on their wedding night!!  The inept woman at the front desk then arranged for 3 rooms at the Opryland hotel on the other side of the city and said they would be paid for.  It's 1am by now...we have to be at the airport at 8am.  We stand around for a long time while nothing happens....she then comes out and tells me we'll have to pay for taxis to go to the other hotel.  I told her that would not happen.  The hotel should be responsible.  She then relents and calls a ""taxi"" service which was really just her girlfriend who had a minivan.  We waited about 20 more minutes for the ride. While waiting out front a bum approaches our band and starts asking for money...it wasn't that hard to notice he even had a gun in his back waist band.  I report it at the front desk...she says she'll call security.  Did they ever show?  NO   Our sax player just gave him $5 and then he just hung around while we waited.  The ""taxi"" shows up and we just piled in....7 guys, bags, guitar, bass, sax, trumpet....not enough seats.  Our drummer sat on the floor board.  Not enough seat belts.  Reminded me of when I was travelling in Nicaragua.  Pretty sure this hotel broke the law in lying to us about this ""taxi"" service.  Unmarked minivan...no meter...trash and clutter inside, a west African driver going 85 mph across the city.  We arrive at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel around 1:45.  The very professional staff there were taken aback by the BS we had just been through.  They asked if we had any paperwork for the rooms or vouchers for taxis or shuttles....Apparently the Maxwell House failed on that too.  The Opryland girl called Maxwell House herself and bullied them into providing us a shuttle to the airport in the morning.  This hotel is run by total scum.  Stay far, far away.  Maybe you'll get lucky and not get screwed over, but we'll never risk it there again.  Also, if you peruse some photos online....many people have posted pictures of grime and mold in the bathrooms, stray pubic hairs, and used soap bars laying out....so apparently the maids suck too.I feel like I'm sharing a room with both of the neighboring guests. The walls are paper thin! WiFi is so slow... Don't even bother. Housekeepers are super friendly and that is about the nicest thing I can comment on.Not impressed.  We booked this room for two nights while making a college visit to Vanderbilt for my daughter.  Right away I could tell while getting off the elevator to our room, the hotel is definitely outdated.  The room was somewhat small for what we are accustomed to. The bathroom is a sliver, with the sink being outside in the common area.  Not a good set up.We had some of the same issues that other yelpers have had. The middle of the night very very loud noises, fighting, screaming matches which felt like was right outside of our door.  I got up to see what was going on and felt the people screaming three or four rooms down but still felt like it was right next to me.  I did call the front desk like an old man, they wanted us to move rooms but I was not about to uproot the whole family with all of our luggage at 2 AM.They do have complimentary shuttle service downtown Nashville. But it is a bit cumbersome because you have to wait.  But still pretty cool so I gave it two stars for this reason.If you are looking for utility and not aesthetics, then this place could work for you. Very run down for the price. Odd smell in the lobby. There were issues with the elevators every day. An incredibly drunk individual tried to get into our room at 4am multiple times and when he realized he couldn't, took two steps down the hall and passed out right in the middle of the floor. I realize this could happen anywhere, however, when I, personally, forgot my room key in my room and went to the front desk to get a new key card, the receptionist NEVER EVEN ASKED FOR MY NAME OR ID. So that drunk man from the night before could have received a key card to the room he was trying to get into (MINE) at any time. He just had to stay sober enough to ask for the correct room number downstairs.ODH!!Old, Dirty and Haunted. Stay somewhere else. . . Anywhere else.Rooms are old , place is haunted, parking is plentiful but not covered and no valet and this hotel is in the hood. Do not get fooled. Restaurant food is also disgusting.Horrible attitude and shuttle service. I stayed here 4 nights and nothing but attitude from all staff members. You must call and pre arrange a shuttle I did that and waited 1.5 hrs and no shuttle. I toke another shuttle and made hotel pay for it. Also it is located far from downtown. Would not recommend this hotel.Disclaimer: I haven't been here yet... I've only dealt with the front desk people over the phone. My friends and I randomly decided to head to Nashville for a weekend next month. The Millennium Maxwell House looked nice, was priced well &amp; was (allegedly) haunted, which was cool. I am in charge of booking the hotel so I called them to get some information about the location. I am young, but I'm old school. I like to talk to an actual person and not ONLY rely on reviews. The first lady I spoke with picked up and sounded stressed, which is fine. I figured it was busy and didn't mind waiting a few minutes. But when she got back on the phone, I felt rushed with my questions, so I forgot to ask a couple of minor questions. They transferred me to reservations to ask about pricing and THAT guy was awesome. Super friendly, I wish he worked at the front desk, because he didn't rush me at ALL with my dumb questions (""is the hotel actually haunted??"", etc.). I called back again today because of some confusion on my bank statement about the charges. This time, a guy answered and I told him I had a question about my reservation for next month. There was odd silence and then he said, ""hold on"" and put me on hold... for 6.5 minutes. He got back on the phone and was was really short. I told him what was going on and he said that it looked like my reservations were still on and I asked him if he could think of a reason why I was having these weird credits from them on my account. his response was, ""I don't know, you're still on for these dates, is that everything?"" Not even in a rude tone, though. I said, ""umm yeah I guess so..."" and he said, ""Ok, bye"". But by the time he said by he was mid hanging up the phone, so I could barely hear him... I'm confused. Is this place ALWAYS busy, or what? I guess I'll find out next month! The reviews I read are great, so we're all excited, but MAN! Nothing I hate more than snooty front desk people...So I didn't experience the staff as my friend did all the payment and reservation.  Huge parking lot. HOtel lobby was super clean but had a strange aroma floating around. I'm not sure if it was mildew smell or sewer.  It seemed to fade as you made your way to the elevators.  The room was ok for two people. Not to big. Pretty basic. The beds were ok for the purpose they served. Passing out after a big night on the town. The bathroom was super small.   The pool area was nice and there was a bar that was accessible.  The pool could have been a little cleaner. There were a lot of leaves floating around.   You had to pay for WiFi in your room but not in the lobby-kinda stupid if you ask me.The shuttle driver was super nice and friendly.   Came back at 3 am and grabbed drinks from our room and found our friends on the patio that we had met earlier poolside and while waiting on the shuttle to recap our nights.  We were loud...and the staff didn't seem to mind. People in our patio party managed to climb the fence around the pool and get in and the staff didn't care what was going on outside.  I managed to make my way back to our room around 530 am and slept with the door open and I was still intact and we didn't get robbed.  All in all it served its purpose.  But there are better accomidations in Nashville.   The TN Titans happened to be in house and were welcome to signing autographs for people if they asked.Don't stay here. The lobby smelled bad, there were several issues with the elevator, the housekeeping walked into our room 2 days in a row early in the morning when we were still sleeping, our key wasn't working twice, and they ended up charging us extra for late checkout when it was entirely there fault that we were late (room key not working and elevator broken). Also they charge for coffee and wifi.... This place should go ahead and shut down because there are too many better hotels out there.Though the reviews were mixed, we took a chance and booked this hotel.  We called ahead of time (1:45pm) to ensure we would be able to make a reservation downtown at 3:30pm with check in at 3pm and the shuttle running every 15-20 mins and were pleasantly surprised to be told rooms were already available and on a first come first serve basis so we headed over and were checked in by 2:15pm and on the shuttle by 2:45pm. The staff was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. Our view of the downtown skyline from our 4th floor room was beautiful and the hotel itself was definitely worth the value in our book. We will definitely be staying here again!Stayed here for work since it was close to the location, but so not worth it. Should have stayed downtown. Employees were OK, but not overly friendly/helpful. Walls are paper thin, prepare to not get much sleep. They disabled wired internet access in rooms, and you have to pay for wireless. The free wireless in the lobby is slower than dialup if you can believe it.Couple good fast food style places to eat nearby (McDonalds, Jersey Mike's, Starbucks) but otherwise is completely away from all of the downtown Nashville activities. They do offer a free shuttle, but you have to compete with everyone else at the hotel, and there's no real order in terms of when they come, where you might be in line, etc.Room wasn't dirty, but wasn't modern/overly clean. Stay elsewhere.I was incredibly surprised by how rude the gentleman at the front desk was when checking me in. I attempted to ask a few questions about the hotel and area and he walked off. Absolutely no eye contact from anyone at the front desk. I took my grandson to the airport the next day and asked when the shuttle was leaving, the women at the front desk replied ""I have no idea I just got to back from lunch"" and offered no help. We waited 30 minutes and took a cab. I bought a few items in the gift shop and asked the clerk for one of the plastic spoons behind the counter and he said rudely NO that is for people that buy ice cream. wow.We went out for the day and came back at 5:30 and our room was still not cleaned. I tried logging in with the hotel wi-fi (charge) and got a error message guest not found.I called the front desk to ask for help and without reply connected me to a help desk in India.  After 20 long min I find out they spelled my last name wrong when checking in. The hotel could be so nice if not for incredibly rude staff.I have to admit, after booking on Priceline then reading the Yelp reviews, I panicked a little, but ultimately this was a solid OK effort in my opinion.  Not quite a ""fan"" yet, but no real complaints that aren't nitpicky.  Let's talk about them (since they seem popular here):The sheets are a little on the thin side, it's true.  As are the walls. Sound does travel and you can hear noises in the other rooms and the hallway.  Neither of these is the end of the world for me.  It was pretty quiet in the hotel, so noise wasn't an issue for us.  Duvets, and possibly the pillows, were made of down.The public spaces, particularly the upstairs hallways and elevators, are a little dated and show some wear.  One spot had clearly been patched but not yet painted by maintenance, as it still had blue tape on it.  It looked like it had been there awhile.  Again, not a huge issue.No free wi-fi in the rooms sucks.  Period.  Paying ten bucks is silly.  So what there's no coffee in the lobby--that's why they have a restaurant.  You have free coffee in your room.  What do you expect?  Not ever hotel offers a free breakfast, folks. The room was clean, with a few little things the vacuum missed but so what?  There was some wear on the furniture and the walls, but they were both relatively new and it was more like inattentiveness than just plain deferred maintenance.  A little attention to detail would help resolve this.  One of us took a shower and said, ""The shower leaked all over the floor,"" but really it was just the shower head was aimed funny and if you tweaked it a bit, it wouldn't get water on the floor.  There was no vent or fan.Despite their claims to the contrary, the hotel is not downtown.  It is near downtown, but not within walking distance.  Yes, they have a shuttle; yes, it stops running at 10:30 p.m.  Food options nearby are fast food.  The clerk gave us an extensive list of restaurants though and would have been able to guide us to those that deliver or shine.We were lucky to catch the bar right before they stopped serving food.  My reuben was actually quite good, and the fries were hot and fresh.  A friend got the fish tacos which she said were better than she expected for the location.  My partner didn't complain about his Philly steak, but our other dining companion said the BBQ sliders were ""gross, but I'll eat them.""  I did like the fried pickles they came with.  Our server was quick and friendly.The front desk staff were friendly and helpful at check-in and check-out, although in this day it is a bit dumb to make us manually check out at the front desk--I worked in a very similar hotel twenty years ago and we provided guests with their check-out bills overnight under their door.  We also had in-room check-out.  Twenty years ago.  So I don't think this hotel deserves the nasty reviews, personally.  It was fine for us, no real complaints.  Especially considering the price we paid.I was weary of staying here after booking on Hotwire, and then reading others' reviews. After my family's stay, I wonder what the other reviewers were so bent about.This hotel isn't the swankiest I've been to, and Hotwire's rating may be inflated, but overall it was comfortable, spacious, and the staff was friendly and professional.Yes, it isn't downtown and the pool hours are inconvenient, but I would stay here again.","My wife and I stayed at the Millennium Maxwell House this past weekend. Much like Mickey, I booked on Priceline and panicked a little when I read the Yelp Reviews, but I think the place is pretty decent. Sure, it's not the newest hotel in the city, but the rooms were clean, the linens were nice, and the staff was courteous. I know the beds are a little stiff, but I tend to prefer a firmer mattress anyway. What really made my review go from 3 stars to 4 stars was the staff. We had a severe weather outbreak Thursday morning at about 3am. Instead of letting us all deal with the weather in our rooms (there were multiple tornadoes in the region and wind gusts up to 100 mph) they evacuated everyone into the hotel lobby and into a interior hallway. What happened next was a great testament to how great the staff was. Charles, the head of security kept everyone up to date on the situation and tried to keep everyone as comfortable as possible. After the threat was over, they opened up elevators and helped the crowds get back to their rooms. My wife and I were looking for a soda machine, and the staff member that was working the front desk informed us that unfortunately, there wasn't one on the floor we were on. She disappeared into the back office and came back with two sodas for my wife and I...on the house!It was a small gesture, but it brought us both great comfort as it was an extremely uncomfortable ordeal for everyone involved. Even though it's not the newest or shiniest place out there, the staff made up for everything through their professionalism and courtesy. I'll definitely look at this hotel again if I""m going to Nashville, it's close to downtown and a fantastic price compared to things right on the strip.I stayed at the Millenium Maxwell House for 3 nights this past week while visiting some clients in Nashville.  Overall, an A-OK experience.The Great:+ Huge room.+ Friendly staff.+ Free shuttle with uber friendly drivers - be sure to tip them out!+ Clean - from the desk to the bed to the bathroom.The Average:o  $9.99 for 24 hours of Internet, meh.o  Typical check-in/check-out process.o  Average beds and linens.The Poor:- SLOW elevators.  I had to wait nearly 5 minutes for one to come up to the 9th floor.It's definitely an older hotel, and feels a bit worn, but in the homey kind of way.  It was a bit too far away from downtown for my taste, but for the price, I can't complain.  A solid 3-stars.Pros:Complimentary shuttle into downtown. Large parking lot and no need to pay for valet. MEPS lounge with lots of video game counsels and sofas, etc. (good for military)Cons:Absolutely horrible receptionist with an attitude. She asked if I had an ID so I handed her the first ID in my wallet. She then looked at me as if I was stupid and asked, ""Do you have a DRIVER'S LICENSE?"" ....If you needed a driver's license just ask for one. Usually a military ID works well as, a you know, ID....Her attitude was also just awful in general. The hotel is quite dirty. Now don't get me wrong, its not disgustingly dirty. It just seems to fall apart in the small details. The moment we parked, for example, we noticed a large blue tarp hanging from a tree limb. Homeless people, perhaps? The metal hinges on the door in our bathroom were rusting and the wall paper was coming off on the edges. The fitness center was also very old and not well maintained. Pay for internet. If it wasn't for the complimentary shuttle I would give this place one star on account of the crappy service at the front desk and just lack of appeal. The name sounds nice and fancy but the hotel really fails to impress.I booked this hotel on Hotwire for a recent visit to Nashville.  We were in Town for the Colts Titans Thursday night game.  Hotwire considers this hotel downtown however it's a 10 minute car ride from the main strip.  It was ok though since they had a free shuttle.  The hotel def shows it's age but it wasn't all that bad.  We were out in a handicap room for some reason but I didn't complain.  This hotel was cheaper than other hotels downtown.  I would recommend it only because they have the free shuttle.We won our hotel room on priceline. $65/night + tax. Not a bad deal for a last minute trip to NashVegas for some partying.The rooms were clean and comfortable. I wasn't crazy about the bathroom setup, but overall, the situation w/the hotel is pretty good.+ they offer r/t airport pick-up for free!+ they will shuttle you within 5 mi of the hotel for free!+ they have free on-site parking as I understand it... this is a deal in itself in Nashville+ staff members were fantastic; especially the shuttle drivers- not a 4 star hotel by a mile- didn't offer free internet- common areas needed a major overhaulI really, really don't know what everyone is complaining about.  I had a great time staying here.  The price was right, the staff was really friendly, it was a very convenient location, and it was a clean place to rest my head.  What else could you ask for??1. I never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a shuttle.2. the person that checked us in and out (Edward) was super nice3. they always brought us everything we needed (extra towels)4. free parking5. great price6. lots of Tennessee Titans players :)7. clean pool8. lots of mirrors for three girls to get ready at the same time (yes!)The only problem we had was on Sunday--we left the room around 12 and it wasn't cleaned after that.  But it wasn't that huge of a deal, we just called down for more towels.  Problem solved.I would definitely stay here again!One of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. First, we were told we could check in at 3 but the rooms were not ready until 4:30. Not sure what took so long since I could not tell that the rooms had been cleaned. Our room stank and was very dingy. The towels in the bathroom had brown spots on them, the bathroom itself was disgusting, and the linens looked (and smelled) like they had not been washed. The wifi was out during our entire stay, and when we complained about this we were ignored by the rude concierge. Seriously, I could not wait to check out, except when I did check out they overcharged us and I had to fight with them to charge us the already absurdly high rate I had booked ($159, which is ridiculous given that I've stayed in roadside motels nicer than this dive). I have never enjoyed staying at Millennium hotels, which usually need major renovations, but this place is atrocious, even for Millennium. Never again.Never really cared much for this hotel...the decor seems outdated, and the staff isn't that great. I always get so nervous riding on their elevators, because they seem old and shaky. However, my only good memory of this hotel is that I got engaged here. :)The only pros for this hotel was the location, decent price through Hotwire, and the complimentary shuttle. Everything else was kind of a nightmare. The bathroom was very dirty and had a clogged drain so I asked the to fix it, ended up having to ask them once again to fix it before they ever did. Even when they supposedly fixed it, I didn't notice much of a difference. Was charged a $50 fee out of the blue and had to go ask the front desk what is was for. Elevator door wouldn't open at one point, had to go up a floor and get on another elevator. Ordered a movie one night, I had fallen asleep but my boyfriend said that after a while the TV picture was all messed up and couldn't watch it anymore. My boyfriend and I also both had an allergic reaction to whatever they were using on the sheets or whatever kind of mold or dust that was in the room. Would definitely never stay here again.This place is not a bad hotel. I have no ideawhy the reviews are so bad. The rooms are clean and nice, the staff is very friendly and it's located in a good location. It's just not walking distance to downtown but it's a very short car ride there. This hotel isn't the ritz Carlton but it's comparable to Marriott. I would stay here again.My hunny and I decided to stay in downtown Nashville after a little too much fun at all of the cool downtown bars (we were 3 sheets to the wind, basically) ;)Being the ever so thrifty girl that I am... I whipped out my iPhone and headed for <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a> (my go to for all things travel booking related). I was able to procure an alleged 4 star hotel in ""downtown Nashville"" for just $35 bucks (on a Friday night, no less). I'd never heard of Millennium Maxwell House... so I yelped it (became a bit nervous), then google mapped it and realized it really isn't anywhere near downtown, it's off Rosa Parks... BOO, we can't walk! We took a cab (about $15 from 2nd &amp; Broadway) and arrived to discover a seemingly decent looking hotel... with a bar in full karaoke-swing (score). We checked in, tried to head to our room to freshen up but the elevator was broken, and it took us &amp; the now 10 or other guests who'd piled up, about 15 minutes to actually get a working elevator.... no good. Upon arriving in our room, it was pretty basic. Nothing fancy, no frills, but decent bedding, good sized and clean. The bathroom was impossibly tiny and the soundproofing between the hallway and the room was non-existent. None the less... we dropped off our bags and headed down to the bar. The bar is where the experience gets weird... really weird. It's a restaurant/bar and to our delight they had the oh so delicious Sam Adams Octoberfest, we were distracted however by the pretty good karaoke singer... and then horrified to realize that it was a 10 year old girl (see my pic). In a bar. On a Friday night. Not exactly ideal... but ok. I inquired about it and apparently kids are allowed in the bar because it's a hotel and the laws are different... I'd never heard of that. I thought that she must be with her parents in town and perhaps she's here to get a record deal (she was pretty good)... how cute, right? Well... not so much... she's a regular. A REGULAR! AT A BAR!!! It gets even better... so I went up, and I must say, I'm a pretty decent karaoke singer... I chose Miranda Lambert's Kerosene... I sing it.... people seem to enjoy it and low and behold this little snot tells the KJ that I'm singing her songs &amp; the KJ tells me I can't sing anymore Miranda Lambert! This place was like the twilight zone! The moral of my story is this... The Millennium Maxwell house is certainly a good value, if you book on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a> and get the same deal I got... but if you're wanting to actually stay near downtown... this hotel doesn't fit the bill. I recommend the Hilton Downtown Nashville (see my review) or really any of the other hotels that are actually in the mix and whatever you do... avoid this strange hotel bar, unless of course you're looking to be harassed by a wanna-be-diva 10 year old. I'm seriously still scratching my head.Booked this hotel on Hotwire listed as a 3 1/2 star hotel downtown! Wrong! Wrong! No way!  Sorry- call a spade a spade! This was no 3 or 3 1/2 star! it would be lucky to listed as a 2 star!2 miles from downtown, in a questionable area old and smelly should be listed as a 2 star! The hotel lobby smells like a  sewer EVERY time you enter the old outdated lobby - and the outdated and cheaply decorated rooms- with hair clogging the shower and NO working internet service (although promised in listing - and charged for per device!) Needless to say - it was dirty and not a great feeling coming home to at night- ( on the shuttle that is 15 minutes away from downtown - and you have to wait for along time for it to pick you up! ) we were forced to check out the very next morning as one more night would have totally ruined our stay in Nashville!!The staff becomes irate when you ask them if the hotel is haunted. 5/5For the price this was a great hotel.  Shouldn't be labeled as downtown and it shouldn't be at a 3.5 stars.  The staff was nice.  There is a free shuttle that will take you anywhere downtown for free.  The shuttle runs all day.  This hotel is definitely past its prime.  It has that old hotel smell.  We ate in the restaurant on site - considering there is nothing else around - was almost to the quality of bad fast food.  And then seeing the 87 Health Card Score scared me.  Would I recommend this hotel?  No.  Would I stay here again?  Maybe.  The main advantage of the hotel was the price:  paid $60 a night through Hotwire compared with other hotels in the area charging $180 a night.  But given the choice - and the funds - I would go stay somewhere else. Isn't this review decidedly undecided?The ENTIRE staff is really unhelpful.  Restaurant food is below average, lobby smells like a toilet.Stayed here during our trip to Nashville for the Roger Waters concert, the hotel isnt anything to write home over.  The beds are full size and the room doesnt even have a fridge in it.  The decor is a little dated, and you just dont get that ""feel""......you know, the one that you get when you walk into a hotel room and go ""WOW""....  If you have reason to be up the hill, then maybe the Maxwell House will work for you, but if youre gonna be downtown for a show or whatever, there are better places within walking distance.  Last year for the Rush concert, we stayed at the Hampton Inn.   We walked to and from the show with no issues.  The room was about the same I think, and much nicer.Absolutely the most overpriced hotel I've ever stayed. On top of that, there was a $9.95 charge for wireless for EACH device. With two children with multiple devices, this was just asking too much. In addition, the wireless was too slow to do much of anything. Would NOT recommend.Clean rooms, welcoming and knowledgeable staff and a Free shuttle to downtown! I have no idea why people would give such low stars.The service at the bar was slow - but when the restaurant is feeding the entire hotel, OK I get that.William and Sam were our shuttle drivers. They had the best ideas into where to make sure we visited.I picked up a few things for my niece and nephew at the gift shop and the staff there was also very nice and helpful.I would definitely consider staying here again.I was a little worried when I did Priceline's name your own price and got this hotel.  I had nothing to worry about though.  I stayed for 2 nights to attend a concert with some friends.  The hotel was clean and comfortable.  The staff was pleasant, and they allowed me to check in early.  No, it's not actually downtown, but the shuttle was very convenient, although I did have to wait 20+ minutes for it twice.  I slept great, although the beds weren't that great. There was no fitted sheet (WHICH I HATE), and the mattresses at Best Western Downtown (where my friends stayed) were much thicker and nicer.  All in all, it was a good hotel for a good price.More like a 2 star hotel than a 3 star hotel. Wifi costs an extra $9.90 in the rooms and the decor is dated and dingy. Not worth the discounted price. Splurge and spend the extra $20-$30 per night for better comfort","['actor', 'times', 'filming', 'booked', 'suite', 'telephone', 'manager', 'outstanding', 'room', 'furnishings', 'truly', 'four',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/union-station-hotel-autograph-collection-nashville,"Union Station Hotel, Autograph Collection",4.0,$$$,109,"The old Union  Station was converted to this gem of a hotel.The lobby is breathtaking. The wrought-iron railing and stain glass  rotunda is magnificent.  The staff is informative and friendly.  Charming facility. Convenient  to walk to Honky Tonk Row, Ryman, Convention Center etc.  No mini fridge  in the room,but at this price  you are not cooking or bringing back a doggie bag. Charming touch having coffee and a scone in the morning and tea and cookies in the afternoon  in the lobby. This facility  is for grownups. Yea!I stayed at Union Station in Nashville the week of the CMA awards. I was not impressed. The rooms were big and the lobby was pretty, but that is about the best i can say. My room only had a closet in the bathroom! There was PLENTY of space to have a closet in the bedroom. It was so odd, it had a shower curtain rod as a door and it was totally inconvenient for 2 of us to shower and dress when the closet was next to the shower! It was CMA week and the hotel was a ghost town, we went down to the restaurant and waited 10 minutes at the hostess station and nobody even showed up. The lobby was deserted and the atmosphere was not what i would expect for one of the biggest weeks of the year. It was definitely not worth the higher price. The service was ok, but not what i would expect based on the price. We decided to rent a car, so i called the front desk, assuming they would assist... they gave me a phone number and told me if that didn't work out to look on the internet. It was 5 blocks from downtown - close but for half the price you could literally stay within a stones throw to all the action town, in a room just as nice with more amenities in the hotel. I would not recommend staying here if you are interested in good service and the fun Nashville experience.Incredible views and perfectly preserved late Romanesque architecture in the interior of this hotel. The top of both spiral staircases are so breathtakingly beautiful. Go here if you stay in Nashville. The hotel prices start in the $275.00 per night and up range. Restaurant has stunning decor as well.Beautiful hotel.  Located within walking distance of a lot of things, but not right in the middle of things.  The rooms were beautifully appointed, tall ceilings. Since it's an hold converted building, things like closets are secondary but that was fine for us.   Our only complaint would be the HVAC in our room - it was SO loud.Beautiful hotel and the bartender Deborah makes the best Bloody Mary ever!  Go there and ask for Deborah.I wanted to love this beautiful, historic hotel...but it was a little lackluster. For starters, $32 for valet?! What? Why? The guys are nice and maybe since my car was parked right in front that was really just a convenience fee...but it seems excessively high. The lady at the front desk? A total doll. Sweetheart even. But then I got to my room...and I'm not a fan of bathroom humor so it literally pains me to even write this...but the toilet was running (like wouldn't stop) and there was a ginormous brown smear at the bottom. Needless to say I wanted to vomit and called the front desk immediately. Someone came up right away and he informed me that I should jiggle the handle to flush...well, I'm sorry, but it wasn't me...which brings me to the question who was it? The housekeeper? Or did they just not clean from the guest before? It was WEIRD and not something I expected from a hotel of this caliber. And now I'm gagging because I can't believe I am even writing this...I like to think I have class and now I'm wondering if I do because who writes a sentence like that?!!?!?Then I was getting dressed to prepare for my evening and turn on the TV...not working. I don't even have a TV in my house so it wasn't a big deal and I just turned on my itunes but they charge A LOT for these rooms...I shouldn't be having these issues.Stayed here for a work retreat. The hotel is an old train station and has been kept in tact for the most part with very high ceilings and stained glass. The room I stayed in had a sloping roof so I felt a little cramped (on the 7th floor) but many others said their rooms were spacious so maybe I just got a smaller once. They have a bar and restaurant that is very nice inside the hotel and there are many bars and restaurants in walking distance as well. I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was pretty great and the waiter even applied a voucher that he had to my breakfast so I ended up paying only like $4! I was pretty happy about that lol. I can't speak for price of the hotel room because my company covered that, but I am sure it's on the high end. Definitely worth considering staying here though or having a work retreat also.beautiful decor.  the lobby is a treat to see. Marriott  truly did a great  renovation.   wonderful stayOur stay at Union Station was mediocre. I didn't have any major complaints - the rooms were nice, the beds were comfortable, the service was hospitable, the location couldn't have been better, and the hotel lobby was gorgeous. BUT was it anything special? Not really. Was it worth the higher price? Probably not. Most of the rooms don't have a great view, since the first two floors are street level, and our room on floor 3 (of 5) was obstructed by the valet cover. And although the noise in the lobby didn't bother us, it was definitely noticeable.Also, not ALL the rooms have high ceilings. As a rewards member, I requested a high floor and the best they could do was a room the third floor. It was your typical hotel room.It's cool idea, but in reality, downtown Nashville has better hotel options.The lobby is truly the best part of this hotel. All the infrastructure you take for granted in a nice hotel is in bad shape. I write this review as a maintenance worker repairs the faucet on my shower. The irony is, they knew exactly what the problem was before entering the room. This makes me think it is a common issue. I am a huge fan of Marriott but this hotel reminds me of the old saying about putting lipstick on a pig.Deborah was the best bartender ever! She was personable and friendly! Made me an orange dream which I had never had and it was awesome!5-stars for the attentive, personable valet staff and the hostess in the restaurant who fetched me a bagel and cream cheese at 9:45pm and didn't charge me. 4 stars for location (close enough to downtown but removed enough to where it isn't rowdy on weekends), and 2 stars for the rooms. You would think that a AAA 4-diamond rated hotel would have better beds and pillows, but alas. They need to take a cue from even the Hampton Inn as to how to create a comfy bed. We could hear someone snoring in the room next to us! Hotel has been beautifully renovated in the main area, but overall, not worth the money. Especially for the really uncomfortable bed. I was disappointed.Paperthin walls and very small corridors. That means that with our hotelroom directly across (almost in) the elevator we we're confronted with a lot of noise. During all hours of the day. Not acceptable for this price. Together with the high prices for valetparking (almost 33 including tax) and the very expensive WIFI just a mediocre experience. The room itself (I think 615) was spacious and nicely decorated and maintained. The same goes for the bathroom. Only remarks here are that the bathroom has almost no space to put your stuff on and the bed is not very big. If you're both tall Europeans you might be dissapointed.And please excuse any spelling or grammar mistakes. English is not my first language. And if that isn't bad enough I have an Apple device that keeps trying to change English into 'proper Dutch'. Yes, you've guessed right, my first language.Very cool old train station converted to a hotel. Isis not stat just came to take pictures. The staff was so kind and helpful! If I were in Nashville again I'd opt to stay here. There was coffee and scones in the lobby. Beautiful hotelBeautiful, spacious, Autograph collection property. The lobby is gorgeous, clean, with plenty of seating. Check in was easy, the staff was accommodating and courteous. Thank you for the upgrade. The rooms are very nice and clean with tall ceilings and big windows. It's decorated with soft colors. The beds are comfortable and plenty of pillows. The bathrooms are a decent size, plenty of linens, and a great shower. They have a small workout space, but I still managed to get there. Cool bar and nice restaurant. Only little complaint you can hear some of the trains at night. Nothing outrageous...I would definitely stay at this property again. Priced very well too!Beautiful, historic building.  We went to sightsee historic train station turned hotel.   While we were there, a train was going by that was super long and carrying coal, and who knows what!  Fun to watch. The lobby is phenomenal.  We stopped in the bar for a few specialty drinks.  It was dark and loungy - just the right feel for this hotel.  I would like to stay here, but it is a fair walk from downtown, and I worry about the age of the hotel.  Sometimes historic hotels are a little musty. I would recommend looking at the reviews in detail.  Most of the 5 stars are from visitors commenting on the building and history.  Several (like Jennifer S) have better comments on staying at the hotel (like the train noise etc).This is a great hotel. While the re-do of Denver's Union Station is something Denver should be proud of; this version of a station-turned-hotel is spectacular. The rooms are spacious, the fixtures and setting are very nice and the staff is unbelievably helpful. The dining room is NOT your average hotel dining room, I had a great dinner here one night, and did not feel like I was missing out by not visiting one of the many great restaurants in town. The hotel is also right next to a great art museum, located in the old Post Office. Nashville has a lot going on, and this hotel represents!Okay, I have not stayed the night here but I have visited the building several times.  On Wednesday July 2nd, Tony, Noel and I went walking around the town of Nashville. My daughter is new to the area. So, we are taking her around the city to enjoy all the sites and sounds of this wonderful musical city. Now, myself..I am a history buff..Anything historical..anything old..I love old buildings and I want to hear and see all the sites looking for anything to feel a connection to it. I would love to have been here in its busy ""Hey Day""..This building is Great..The lovely interior and lovely decor of the inside of the building. I love to see and hear about all photos of the hotel and its past. if you ever get a chance to go to this lovely hotel you should go. You should walk around and enjoy all of the beautiful decor and history it has to offer. You don't have to be a history buff to enjoy and see the awesome decor.We stayed on Sept 25th - 28th. Check in was at 3 PM and we waited until almost 4:15 to get a room and we arrived there at noon. Like others have said. The suites were $550 a night and at best they were standard business class rooms you could get at any other hotel for $149 a night. When I reserve a suite I expect it to be a suite, not a standard Holiday Inn room with a sitting area! Our A/C did not work the last 2 nights! The hotel lobby is very nice, but that is where is stops. Beds, towels, linens were old and the TV's are advertised as 42"" and both were 32"". Some channels we could not get because of bad reception. The banisters, light switches and door knobs were all filthy and we did not want to touch them.Bottom line is, I think they owe us about $1,000 refund. Stay somewhere else and just stop in and take pictures of the lobby and move on to your next adventure. It's too bad, really. We planned this weekend for my wife and her twin sister's 40th birthday only to get ripped off by the accommodations. Ruined the whole trip!Top notch!  Luxury and character combined.  It's hard to tease out service over location, but honestly this place could have less than great service and I'd still probably love it because the building and history of it are so incredible.  Wait staff in the restaurant (Prime 108) are some of the best I've had.  The food was good but not great sadly (had dinner twice and breakfast once).  The hotel does have a little fitness center, which is put to shame by some of the elite workout areas in modern hotels, but it does have free weights and treadmills, a tv and it's clean!  Highs -- sooo much character, super romantic, down right coool.  great customer service.  gorgeous decor and rooms.  high quality toiletries provided.  free coffee and scones in the morning and a tasty little praline at night.  within walking distance of broadway and an art museum right next door! Lows -- with so many other places to eat nearby - try somewhere else.  Prime 108 is fine, but with the mark up in price I'm certain something better can be found for the same price point.","I love old trains and train stations. The exterior of the majestic Union Station Hotel stands strong. We gave ourselves a tour of the place.The lobby ceiling is so tall and beautiful, you can't help but look up and stare at it. The front desk holds the train schedule, which shows you which cities people traveled to from Nashville. Oh the adventures they must have had. I love the design of the building and the details. I'm glad we got to stop off and see another historical Nashville landmark.I have had such an irritating experience with the Union Station Hotel, that I am writing my first ever Yelp review to express my anger.  Simply, after paying for a ""King"" room at the Union Station Hotel my fiance and I were given a ""Full"" room instead.  Not a big deal, I called the front desk and was told that the difference in cost between the rooms would be credited back onto my card.  The irritating part is that now more than a month later the credit still hasn't happened.  I called at least 5 times, and was directed to the accounting lady.  After leaving messages, I was never called back.  On my final call I spoke to a manager who said it was all taken care of, but clearly it was not true.  I am giving up trying to get my refund out of pure frustration.Paid $500 A NIGHT (yes, that's FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT) for a room at this place on a busy weekend in downtown Nashville.  By comparison, I paid less for an oceanfront room at the Grand Hyatt Kawaii 15 months earlier.  Was it worth it?  Short answer:  No, not even a little bit.THE GOODThe lobby.  Unquestionably the main (only?) draw to this place.  It is truly amazing:  a fully restored 19th century rail station lobby.  Every bit as spectacular as The Piedmont in Memphis, minus the ducks of course.  They actually hosted a wedding ceremony and reception there while we were there which was amazing.Location.  The hotel is located halfway between the tourist attractions on Broadway and the newer development in The Gulch.  Easy 6 minute walk to either location from the hotel.Rooms.  Are spacious with nice 12-foot ceilings.  Well-lit by original full-height windows. We did get free Wi-Fi, but I think it's only because of my Marriott status.  Otherwise, I think it's $10 a day or so.THE BADCost.  $500 a night?!  Are you freaking kidding me?!Location.  It being a former train station, it is located immediately next to a still-very-active rail yard.  Which means surprisingly loud freight trains rumbling past your window roughly every hour or so.  I come from a place where this happens every night, so I found it rather soothing.  But if you're from the other 99.9% of the population, maybe think twice.Rooms.  For $500 a night, you will be treated to exactly 2 (TWO) bath towels.  Oh, and 0 (ZERO) bars of soap.  Rather, you'll luxuriate in a combo shampoo/conditioner/body wash combo bolted to the shower wall.  You know, the kind you had at the last $72/night Holiday Inn Express you got stuck in when your connecting flight got cancelled.  I was frankly embarrassed for the hotel for this.Staff.  To be fair, they're unfailingly friendly.  But for this price point, I expect a dedicated concierge, not a desk attendant pulling double duty.  And yet a desk attendant is what you get when it comes time for a reservation.  As best I can tell she has no more pull with local restaurants than you would by just calling yourself.  Shock:  they're not much use when push comes to shove.  And that's assuming they pick up within 27 rings when you call down to the desk.  Perhaps on a related note, the bar didn't have at least 1 of the wines listed on the menu.  First night I figured, Okay, maybe they're sold out.  Second night I realized No, they just don't care.Housekeeping.  We had the Do Not Disturb sign out when they came around the first time (ridiculously early IMHO), and they never bothered to check back.  Imagine our surprise when we returned at 4:30 PM to discover our room untouched by human hands.  (Including the dead roach in the bathroom, btw.)  Completely ridiculous for FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT.TIPSSpend 15 minutes (and $0) walking through the lobby, then head on down the street and book a room at the Hilton.  If push comes to shove, go to <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com&amp;s=44d0f65c061812fc3c6cbc6f354dcbfb2fc0024ed9c0f7a6fc9669a70e1b919f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">airbnb.com</a> and for $100 less book a 2-bedroom condo just off Broadway downtown.  Wish I'd done the same.I love the architecture and decor of this hotel and the beds are SOOOOO comfortable. I like the location and the staff was very helpful. The location was perfect for us and did I mention the beds?Here for a business meeting. The Conf was two days. Lots of charter at this place and lot of history. You could just set in the lobby and look around for a while. Lots to see. Its really a cool Hotel. Close to downtown, so you could walk if you like. Nashville is a lot of fun. This is a great place to stay if you want to be close. Good food from caterningSuper cool spot. Location is great- just a five minute walk to downtown Nashville (touristy area) but five mins the other way is the super cool Gulch area.Very clean. Gorgeous inside (old train station) beautiful high ceilings, super nice staff who are there to help with anything you need. Pricy.I truly appreciate the building's architecture and history but this place should have been turned into a museum and not a hotel.  I travel quite a bit and have stayed in a few of Marriott's Autograph collection hotels and this hotel did not meet the standards that I come to expect from a Marriott Autograph property.  My wife and I stayed in a king suite, a beautiful room but not suitable for a good nights sleep.  The interior wall faced the lobby so the lights from the lobby illuminated our room throughout the night.  Although there were shades, the light was impossible to keep out.  The exterior wall faced Broadway so without any white noise you heard sounds from this busy street all night long.  The bathroom looked like it was last updated in 1995 with a paisley print curtain for a bathroom door and a similar curtain for the shower door.  The room was equipped with no feather pillows, something I've come to expect with Autograph level hotels.  The bottom line is if you're planning a trip to Nashville and want to stay at a Marriott property, save your money and choose the Courtyard.The hotel is pretty much as beautiful as the pictures except for our room.  It wasn't large enough to have a queen or king bed and there was no closet.  I guess I expect too much being from New York.  It was very disappointing especially for the prices we paid.  The people working there however, were the best.  True Marriott Customer Service.  We were in town for the CMA's and the location was also perfect, close enough without having to listen the the craziness once we went back to the room.Union Station is the most exquisite hotel in Nashville. The decor is breathtaking and I haven't had a more pleasant experience as a hotel guest in Nashville, well--ever. The rooms are gorgeous with unbelievably high ceilings and the bed is basically the most comfortable thing I've ever slept on. The bathrooms are lovely and come loaded with luxurious bath products. The showers are incredible with amazing water pressure. When I stay here I never want to leave. The only thing I would change is the ease of connecting--and staying connected to the hotel's WIFI network.Not a bad hotel per say. It has a charming lobby, but you spend far more time in a room. The location is good for walking. But overall, this is a $30 parking, rooms with no view, cheap bed &amp; decor, thin wall hotel sitting next to 5 train tracks which run through the night (and we were on the opposite side of the hotel from the tracks). We travel a lot. I would say the hotel deserves a 3 star but because the price is so high, it gets a 2. Some pay upwards of $400 a night here. It should be going for $100 night for what it is.I recently stayed here for a business trip and loved the hotel. Built from the old rail station, the built appearance has the most grand and stunning lobby. Behind the front counter is a sign with the old train routes that used to run through there. The staff were extremely hospitable and made the visit very welcoming. I was very luck and had one of the rooms facing the lobby. With the massive ceilings and arcade type windows that over look the lobby, the room took my breath away when I walked in. The room was kept perfectly and the bed was extremely comfortable. I couldn't have asked for a better nights sleep (which i desperately needed from the cold I had come down with). Without out a doubt I would recommend this hotel and stay here again in the future.It's a historic building that they did a marvelous job renovating. Beautiful room with very high ceilings.  The lobby makes you feel like you stepped back in time,  and the decor reminds you of a time when trains were the way to travel.This is my favorite hotel in Nashville and I frequently travel to Nashville.It's a beautiful and historical building conveniently located close to downtown, midtown, and the Flying Saucer. Hospitality was on point--everyone from front desk to valet would make an effort to remember my name.The restaurant was mediocre, but who would eat there with so many great restaurants in such close proximity?5 Stars for the history and architecture, but 1 star for the train noise that woke me up at 3:30am and 4:45am as well as little insulation between rooms and the hallway.  I could hear my neighbor coughing and 2 separate people's entire phone conversations taking place in the hallway outside my door.  I really wanted to like this place more since it is so very charming, but couldn't get over the lack of sleep I experienced while staying here due to noise inside and out!The old train station converted into a beautiful hotel.  They did a great job preserving this historic place and keeping it's charm.  Rooms are very nice with very high ceilings which make the room feel even more spacious.  Lots of countertop space in the bathrooms.  Lots of coffee awaits you in the lobby each morning with delicious baby blueberry scones.  They also have coffee makers in your room for people like me who have to have coffee to even get to the coffee.  I really liked the bar.  Great specialty cocktails and a friendly staff.  Hotel is walking distance to the pedestrian bridge, Country Music Hall of Fame, right next to the Frisk and all the live music you came here to hear.My sister had to go to Nashville for some company training and she wanted me to tag-along. So i did since I didn't have to pay for anything. =PThis place is nice. Right when you walk in you automatically notice the beautiful decor and architecture.The people that worked the front desk were very pleasant and helpful. I had a nice conversation with one of the girls about how she went to Saint Marys college in the Bay Area (which is where i'm from). And they also faxed my homework for me to one of my instructors about 3 different times because i kept sending it to the wrong fax # (oops! hehe). That alone gets 5 stars!Now for the room. At first we were given a pretty big room. I loved it because of the size, but after a few minutes my sister and I started to smell a sewer-like smell. We call the front desk to let them know and they gave us a new room with no hesitation. The new room was smaller, but still nice. I will take away one star for the bathroom though. Although clean, the grout and tiling could have been done a bit better as well as the paint. Those factors sort of made it look like the bathroom was kind of dirty at first. There was also a man that would greet you as you walked in the hotel. He was the sweetest! Wore buttons and pins from all over the world on his vest and hat. Not sure if he's still there, but if he is try to start up a conversation with him. He's an interesting guy.Wow! Our room is wonderful. Cozy and spacious. Bathroom is big tub shower and great for two people. Desk clerk was great. Funny and so helpful. 7th floor is great !!!I stayed at the hotel for two nights October 3 &amp;4. I WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN.  Here are the problems-The entire staff is unfriendly and not helpful. MANAGEMENT what message are you sending? We walked into check in and not one person at the front desk smiled. The girl helping us was over it. The bartender with long hair could not have been ruder to us. The hostess at the restaurant acted like we we aliens.-THE ROOMS ARE BAD. My first room 710 I think, smelled like fried foods and has scuff marks all over the walls. I tried to turn the radio on, didn't work, and a bug ran across the bed. I then looked into the sheets and a long black hair was on them. I went down to the front desk and they said they could move me. I went back up to get my purse and bag and a woman from housekeeping was inside my room with my door closed. I came in and she was sitting at the desk with her iPhone and on the landline phone.. never seen that before.So they move to to another room, 208, WHICH SHOULD NEVER BE RENTED OUT! Its under the kitchen and right at the railroad tracks. So don't plan on sleeping. Unbelievable bad at any price. -the price.. well it is crazy how much they charge. The carpets thru out the hotel are filty, the rooms need serious help and the staff needs to friggin smile once in a while.Stayed here once and loved it. The rooms aren't the biggest but they are clean and nicely finished. Location is great, right in downtown and in close proximity to the Flying Saucer which is a huge bonus. You can make a short walk to the Broadway strip and the bridge stone is nearby. Valet service so you aren't scrounging for a spot. Have yet to be to their restaurant but definitely a great hotel experience.Gorgeous, and a great lobby to hang out in. I came in after checking out the art museum gift shop next door.  The building is an old train station depot and gives the grand hotel feel right when you step inside...stained glass windows, wood moldings, beautiful light fixtures, big fireplace, and giant clock overlooking the lobby.  The front desk has the old train schedule routes behind it, to keep the look and feel of the original train depot building.  After perusing the hotel gift shop (bought myself a chocolate guitar souvenir), I went up to the balcony level.  Along the stairwells and walls are great pop/deco art (kind of like the national park style) featuring places around Nashville.  There's also a steakhouse and bar on the lobby level that I didn't try, buy they looked really nice.  I love old style grand hotels like this one.","4 Stars  ~ for the wow factor alone.   But 2 Stars for the overall experience. The lobby is amazing and worth a quick walk through to admire the wonderful architecture. But a visit is enough. If you want a comfy, warm, bigger than a match box room ~ go elsewhere. The guest rooms are tiny, bare, and ~ in December ~ cold. My room was a cute cozy space that looked like a child's play room in the attic ~ dormer like windows and all. But it was teeny tiny. So much so it could only accommodate a full size bed. As for the  bathroom, it  was minuscule ~ pedestal sink, basic tub shower ~ that sort of thing. I cools touch from one wall to the other by extending my arms! I'm a big fan of historic buildings~ truly ~ and I love some hotels... The West Baden Resort in French Lick comes to mind. The other disappointment was the food. One word ""cafeteria"". Yep. Bland. Unimaginative.  Three days and the only edible thing was the crab soup.  The service is nice. We were hosting a meeting and Isaiah took care of our meals ~ nice. Accommodating. There was a lovely little woman who went to great strides to ensure I didn't get anything with onion (allergic). Last ~ the Internet connection is horrible!!!! Soooooo I'd say if you're only staying one night. You don't care about space and can get by in a mini bathroom this is a fab place!This is what Southern Hospitality is all about. From the moment I arrived by shuttle someone rushed over to open my door and greeted me. The outside of the building is only second to the inside. Stained glass ceilings, wood moldings, ornate light fixtures and an abundance of great furniture, and that is just the lobby. The public bathrooms are private and the cleanest I have encountered. Lunch was wonderful and catered for nearly eighty. The rooms are all breathtaking with stone work, arched windows and sunken rooms.I just loved the southern charm and cozy feel without any of the stuffiness. Love. Love. Love.my first floor room was between the train tracks on one side and the hotel's lovely ""L &amp; N"" dining hall (serving breakfast) on the other. also nestled below a section of staircase. if that isn't being stuck in the armpit of the hotel, I don't know what is. a real missed opportunity for a nice relaxing couple of days in Nashville.This is a beautiful historical property! Valet was great, check in was friendly and efficient, and my room was perfect. I travel a lot and this was the perfect location to walk to 'downtown' and soak up the history. Breakfast was good but I found the restaurant a bit foo foo for me :-) As others have said Flying Saucer next door is a plus.Hotel is beautiful and convenient to most of the areas one needs to see. close to many fine restaurants. the lobby has coffee and small pastries until 10 am and then iced tea, cucumber infused water and cookies at about 3pm. in the main lobby. the bar is very nice and the restaurant served a great dinner and breakfast. my only issue was that  one has to pay extra for internet service in the room.  for me, that means you lose a star. a nice experience overall.The hotel is a very cool space with lots of memorabilia from the old train station days.  The checkin staff was friendly, the valet was $!5 per day with unlimited in and out, and they were super efficient with the car and hailing taxis as needed.  Valet is open 24 hours which is nice when you have an early flight.The lobby is historical, with a groovy bar, plenty of seating.  Only complaint was that the Prime restaurant is expensive and not very cozy.The rooms were high ceilings, comfy beds, flat screen tv.  Nice but not large bathroom.  Only half a mile from the hot zone of Nashville, I'd stay here again.  The trains do blow their whistles pretty early in the AM, but we pretty much slept through it.This was our first time to the city of Nashville. We chose the Union Station on recommendation of our Travel Agent. The hotel was beautiful! The history architecture of the building was wonderful. From the moment you walked in you were greeted by the valet and bell staff. They were friendly and we laughed with them daily!!! The front staff was wonderful. The concierge recommended things to see and do and a great place for our anniversary dinner. The hotel is convenient to the tourist attractions, fine dining, and the bar scene.The food at the hotel was good. Our room was comfortable, spacious, and gorgeous! Top Notch!!!!Spectacular!!!  Beautiful Castle-like former Train Station transformed into a Hotel!Incredible Lobby! !! !!! Stunning is right!!!  The original Architecture and the new Decor is Awesome!  I have seen very few hotels this nice in person!  The lobby looks and feels like a great place for a meet or to relax on your own!  Two story's down from the Lobby are two addition floor of room which are above ground, though two floors below street level!Fantastic Furniture!  The Furniture in the Entrance to the Hotel and the Decor and Furniture in the Lobby is really cool!  Extremely Comfortable too!The Staff from the Doormen to the Front Desk are very friendly, personable and eager to share information about the Hotel and its former identity as a Train Station!I really like this hotel.  This is my second or third time here and every time has been great.  This last time we had a room on the fifth floor.  It was a corner suite.  This room had high ceilings and it was very clean.  Cleaning crew did a great job. The room was small tho.  The bed was super comfortable.  They have a pretty solid bar in the hotel with a decent wine selection.  Small store for snacks and beverages.  They also have Prime 108 for room service and a restaurant.  My only complaint was no fan in the bathroom.  Imagine---drinking all night and then eating some fast food.  Hit the can in the am and no fan.  It didnt bother me but the wife was not too happy.Oh, my ...this is a beautiful hotel with its cathedral and stained glass ceiling that screamed opulence and grandeur in all the four corners.  The hotel used to be a grand central station that has been converted into a hotel. The art deco-themed design has yellow as the dominant color with splashes of gold and orange.  I love this hotel and its beautiful design/decor. The lobby is huge with a massive fireplace on one end and a lot of comfortable seating areas. The front desk features a blackboard that shows train schedules which are probably similar to the time when the structure was still being used as a train station.The spiral, wooden stairs that leads to the upper floors is also a beauty and adds to the charm of the hotel.  The hotel rooms are located to the sides which leaves the middle of the hotel open from the lobby all the way up to the ceiling.  This creates an airy and open space that makes the lobby more majestic and grand. The open space provides visitors with an awesome view of the lobby from any of the upper floors.  The hallways are lined with intricate iron grills that provides a barrier between the hallway and the open space. The rooms are well-appointed and elegantly furnished. The outside of the building features a gray/off-white bricks and a watch tower which, for some reason, reminds me of a castle.I did not stay at this hotel, but the review is for the quality.A rehearsal dinner at the restaurant one night was exceptional. Food was great but the service was stellar. Attentive servers that truly honed their craft.Multiple experiences with the valet service were great. They were extremely gracious.The wedding ceremony and reception were held here and again the staff did an awesome job putting everything together. The whole design of the lobby and front desk area is phenomenal as well.We were here for 4 nights and stayed in a suite. We didn't utilize the living area just because there was NO tv in the living room $ the tele in the bedroom was super tiny and outdated. That's not important though.Nothing beats this beautiful lobby of this preserved train station. Absolutely gorgeous. Could not avoid the 4-6pm cheese offering in the lobby. Like really?Anyway it was a beautiful choice for a friends wedding reception &amp; as for the room... My bf and I did sex everywhere and in a banquet room. Haha. Ftw.This is an absolutely stunning hotel.I stayed on the 5th floor with its 18 foot tall ceilings.  The lobby is magnificent.  The am coffee service was great too.There's no pool, but still I would highly recommend especially for a fan of the days of American grandeur.This place looks cool online but in person it is PHENOMENAL. This place has presence! The building itself was opened Oct. 9, 1900 as a grand train station, construction beginning August of the prior year. Some of the more fascinating facts that I have read about this historical location is that Al Capone passed through here on his way to a Georgia penitentiary. As well as many Presidents and Celebrities. When seeing the structure in photographs, it takes on a strange resemblance to a church rather than a train station- and even more so in person. When train travel was on the decline, the station closed for about 10 years and eventually it was turned into a hotel in 1986. $11 million in renovations, a new boutique style and a rededication on Oct. 9th, 2007 brings you to what you see today. We stayed here for a night in the first week of January 2010. We arrived in Nashville sometime after dark, freezing cold and snowing. The valet warmly greeted us and had a bellhop help us with our bags. Walking into the lobby, looking up 5 stories or 65' at 128 stained glass windows(apparently it took 3-4 workers a month to clean,) barrel vaulted ceilings  and an enormous fireplace is more impressive then you can imagine. The place was silent! I swear it felt like we were the only ones in the building...so a little eery but truly amazing. The views of the exposed staircase is also pretty amazing(I attached a photo.) I didn't know at the time that the hotel is noted as a haunted place but if you dont get the vibe when you walk in, you dont believe in that sort of crap anyways. I totally believe in that crap. Our room was huge, great view of outside train tracks and the West side of Nashville. Very beautifully decorated room and especially nice bathroom. The large windows and extremely tall ceilings are the only evidence that you are in an older building while in your room. Everything else looked completely contemporary.Before venturing out, we got a few drinks at the bar downstairs. Really nice, great drinks and a must if you are staying here. When we got back to the hotel, we were pretty rip roaring drunk(I was secretly freaked out...the hotel is creepy regardless of it's pretty exterior.) I do remember sneaking out to have a cigarette- there was no one in the lobby or the hotel itself, again I felt like I was the only one there. I tried to find out where I could smoke but there was no one around so I smoked infront of the huge fireplace. No harm, no foul?We traveled to Memphis the next day, sad we only stayed here one night. While in Memphis, I found a book listing the Union Station hotel as a haunted place. The station was obviously very active during WWII and they say one spirit is that of a soldier waiting next to what used to be a track. The second is a woman who supposedly fell on the tracks, ran over and killed by a train. There is also a rumor that a woman killed herself in room 711, shooting herself with a revolver. This and the surrounding rooms are apparently where the most activity is. I have also heard that floors 5 and 6 are extremely active because this is where workers used to work and sleep? There was also a terrible collision in 1918 killing 101 people here. Sooooo...you be the judge! If you are in Nashville, I recommend coming here at least for a drink and to wander the halls if you can't stay here. If not for the beauty of the structure itself, then to get the creepy vibe I got.This is a most wonderful and charming hotel. Staff is more than gracious. Every aspect of our experience was just fantastic. Would recommend to any and everyone.On drive across the country, rolled into Nashville with no reservation and no plan. Looked online and found great rate at this historic location.Lobby is amazing, staff smart and friendly, vintage American charm throughout the building.Room was spacious and well appointed. Writing area, comfortable bed and a large bathroom.  Easy to walk to hip spots or the touristy downtown area.Consider the Union Station for sure when visiting Nashville.Stayed here in July 2012 for the Music City Brewer's Festival. Walked from hotel to the festival, not too bad of a walk. A little far from Broadway/Printer's Alley, but walkable if you're cheap enough to not pay for a cab. The lobby and common areas were awesome, very nice finishes and detail. The room was just ok, a normal hotel room. Bonus having the Flying Saucer pub attached!So incredibly beautiful.  Not sure what people are talking about when they say the rooms are small - ours was perfect with huge ceilings and enormous windows looking out over the city...  Can't say much about the food - we ordered room service once and it was fine.  Then again, I don't know who sits around in a hotel eating hotel food in downtown Nashville...  duh!  (to the one reviewer who commented that the food wasn't good - get out, woman!)  The art nouveau stylings of the building transform you to another time...  The service was fantastic.  Can't say enough - I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Nashville!Amazing hotel. Beautiful architectural details. Happy and attentive staff. We couldn't have been more pleased. We read a lot of reviews beforehand that complained about the train noise; but the hotel IS an old train station, and we found it to be part of the charm.The staff is absolutely wonderful. Restaurant and bar are great along with the service.This building should NOT be a hotel. Whoever decided to do this was a lunatic.I was put in an interior room on the ""lobby."" For starters, one entire wall of the room is windows that open onto the ""lobby"" or atrium, which used to be the interior of the train station. The windows go up two storeys. There are curtains for privacy. However, other than the room's light, that's the only light you're going to get in those interior rooms. So you can either completely expose yourself to everyone in the lobby at all times or shut your curtains. Also the hotel pipes awful saxophone easy listening all day and evening. As soon as I got into the room, I called and said it was loud in my room too, so they said they'd turn it down. I then asked then do they turn it off at night? I was told 10 pm. (It's now 11 pm and they are still playing it, FYI.) Anyway they did turn down the music, although I could still hear it, and then I noticed I could hear every single conversation in the lobby and every single glass clinked, plate dropped, etc. I finally asked to move rooms, and they were great about that.Then I got an exterior room, so I heard trains all the time. With horns. But I am sure glad I moved rooms because it's still better, and they had this 300-person reception in the lobby this evening. That would have been awful to deal with in the old room.Anyway given the other reviews I see here, there are even worse places on this building so I advise you not to stay here. (Staying again tonight--will see how it goes.)","As to not sound redundant about how the hotel is cooler than an igloo in its architectural grandeur, let's talk about the fact that this hotel is in my top 5 hotels ever and my fave in Nashvegas.The valet attendants were attentive and is worth the money since the cars are located so close to the entrance.  They also dashed to hold the door.  The front desk was cool especially when I was comped a night's parking worth $26.  Sweet. On Saturday night, there was a gent playing guitar that pleasantly echoed throughout the lobby.  Cheese, pecans, and crackers were served with infused beverages from 5 to 7.  We also were allowed to take said cheese into the bar.  Double sweet.The bar was really proper with an enormous wine cooler that was quite interesting with bartenders that were talkative when prompted.  The prices for the alcohol were pricey, but that was to be expected.So, here was the clencher for this hotel not to have received the fifth star.  For some of you, this may be silly; but for me, I am serious about my...ironing abilities.Yes, I am quite particular about having my clothes, my shirt at the very least, being pressed.  When you pack in a suitcase, you will have wrinkles.  That being said, the ironing board's pad did not fit and was so thin that it left crosshatch marks that a grill master would be envious.  I had to use a towel to prevent this.  While I am more than thrilled to stay here again, I must admit that hotels, especially high-end ones, need to invest in a very inexpensive amenity.The breakfast was great, and I received 20% for being an Elite Rewards member.  Triple Sweet.  I would rather end on a good note since I was so impressed with the property.Just spent two days staying at this Marriott property.  This is in the old Union Station which is truly a beautiful building that does live up to its' historic designation.   The lobby is grand and beautiful.... and having a drink at their lobby bar is where I would recommend ending your visit. Unfortunately the rooms do not live up to it's designation and definitely not the price charged.  Upon checking in the room looked OK, nice appointments, color and layout.  The first issue we had was we could not get the temperature of the room below 75 degrees. The second issue...the beds are double bed size.  This doesn't mean there are two beds, as in most Marriotts, it means it's just one double bed.  I can't remember the last time/ever staying in a hotel in a double bed.  I believe another name is a 'full' size bed.   Quite small for two people.  But that wasn't the worst part...what was terrible was that the bed was very old and completely caved in the middle.  My husband and I were sucked into the middle.  I love him but when the room is hot and you are trying to get a good nights sleep, it doesn't work.  The other issues were the very old sheets that were maybe 200 thread count at best, very rough, and pillows that were made of shredded sponge or pilled up stuffing.  I am currently a silver status member, just loosing my gold status this year, so I have stayed at MANY Marriott properties over the years.   I can say without a doubt this property does not measure up as far as their beds, bedding and sleeping experience to Marriott standards.We brought this issue up to Guest services and they were very pleasant and switched our room. It seems this is a common complaint of their beds because they were ready  with a board to place between the mattresses.   The second room did have good air conditioning so fortunately we had a good nights sleep our second night.I have never complained before about a hotel stay, but after staying at this location, spending over $600 for two nights, and having such a poor sleeping experience, I feel compelled to warn others to be aware and know this before staying.Review on the barIf someone asks for a house gin and tonic, it would be a kindness on your part to mention to them that well drinks start at $11. After buying a round for my party I received a very large bill for a bar I was only at due to relatives in town.It's a pretty hotel, I will give you that, but that bar - no.. that's more than I was paying in New York.Absolutely Useless Hotel.  Service is bad.  Rooms are unacceptable for price point.  Restaurant is boring.  Please don't stay here. Stayed here for a wedding Oct 4.  Will never stay here again.Hubby and I decided to spend the weekend in Nashville to celebrate our very first wedding anniversary.  I wanted to find the perfect hotel, someplace special, someplace that didn't feel like a hotel that I would stay in for work.  Union Station Hotel seemed to fit the bill.  The website made it look incredibly gorgeous and super sexy.You can see the hotel from several blocks away, and it is quite impressive.   It is a grand Victorian style building with amazing arches, stained glass and a soaring clock tower.  It completely stands out from the rest of the downtown Nashville skyline.  I was so excited!  We valet parked because we didn't see any other options for parking, and I must say the parking attendants that we encountered during our stay provided the best service of any of the hotel staff that we interacted with.  They were enthusiastic and friendly and helpful.  Everyone else we dealt with, from the font desk staff to the waiter at Prime 108, had absolutely no energy and seemed to have little desire to be there.  The lobby is beautiful.  As their website indicates, ""65-foot barrel-vaulted ceiling of 100-year-old, Tiffany-style stained glass, gold-leaf medallions, and rare bas-relief sculptures.""  If I had been staying somewhere else, it would be worth coming in just to take a look around.  Our room on the 5th floor, a king room, was disappointing.  It looks very different than on their website.  It didn't feel high end to me, it felt like a hotel I would stay in for work (fail).  Yes, it was clean and the bed was comfortable.  But for the price we paid, I expected more than clean and comfortable, ya know?  I was expecting a level of luxury and attention that was severely lacking form this hotel. There were no special touches in this room to surprise or delight you.  Our bathroom was a very poorly lit cramped space, and our closet was a curtained off corner of the bathroom.  The bedroom part of our room did have 20 ft. ceilings, but they didn't really do anything to take advantage of the height of the room.  The walls were pretty much blank.  The floor to ceiling windows were cool, but overlooked a busy street and the valet parking lot on the other side.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind spending top dollar for a special experience.  That's why I chose this hotel in the first place, over so many other options in Nashville.  But for $320 a night, valet and taxes included, I expected more from our stay.  For this hotel, you are paying for the historical significance of the building, and I wish I would have known that up front, I would have taken my business elsewhere.We chose this hotel for our small, intimate wedding in one of their main rooms off the lobby and it was everything we could have asked for and more!  The staff gave attention to every detail, the wait staff was excellent, we made several changes and the hotel was quick to accomodate them all.The hotel is gorgeous, but you know that already.  The rooms are NOT impeccable masterpieces... they are small, but impeccably furnished, and the minor wear and older finishes are there for a reason.  It's nearly 100 years old, they want that to show.  If you want modern perfection, go to the Opryland Hotel.  If you want a genteel nod to a more elegant age, then this is where you want to be.Food was top-notch as well.  We really can't say enough great things about it.  Thanks Angie and everyone else who made our wedding such an amazing success!This is my 4th Autograph Collection (formerly Kessler Group) hotel and it doesn't disappoint. With it being centrally located it allows for ease of access to the Nashville downtown area.Can't give enough accolades for this hotel. Amazing lobby. Great location, and the customer service was superior to any hotel I've stayed in during the past year. Don't expect spacious rooms in this boutique hotel, but they are adequately sized and very charming. We had several breakfasts and one dinner at the restaurant. The food was very good and moderately priced.This was a life-saver of a hotel. After having almost literally run away from the Holiday Inn up the road, this hotel was a saving grace, granting us ultra-early check-in for no extra charge (though, they do get you in one HUGE way * ).This historic location is very impressive and beautiful. We were only there two nights, and in the huge lobby for a fraction of that time, and yet I ran across two bride-to-be's getting a tour of the location. The restaurant is very nice as well, though like most hotel restaurants, pricey. However, here it was probably worth it. Since we were traveling with my 11 month old son, we required a king bed, tub and fridge. All accommodations were made prior to our arrival. The room was very large and very clean. However, we were given a funny room - when you walk into the hotel there is a large window above the front doors - that was our room window, only 1 floor right about the hotel entrance. Thankfully the hotel is not really much of a walk-in joint, so the noise level never became an issue. If you wanted to get here, you drove or took a cab, and I imagine that prevents a lot of lookie-loos. As nice as the place was, there were some faults. For one, it took 40 mins to get two extra bath towels. We discovered at the end of a long, hot, muggy day that were short towels in the room. It took two phone calls and visit to the front desk to get two extra towels. In the end, it was the manager that went a got them for me. Also, we phoned ahead for the bellhop to come when we were checking out. For me, 10 minutes is as long as I will wait for that service unless forewarned.  I moved the bags myself most of the way. Considering we were right above the front door, that took way too long.* They have a ridiculous charge for parking. CRAZY. $22 a night. They lost 1/2 a star right there. I know that hotels do it (though the Holiday Inn I had just come from did not), but it will always count against a hotel for me unless its located in a seriously crammed metro area. But Nashville? There is land... especially around this hotel. Not to mention that the valet staff were the least pleasant I'd dealt with on this 11 day vacation. This is a very nice hotel and we had a very nice stay. It was far from a a 5 star experience, but I'd consider coming back......Though there are a few other modern hotels nearby that I've read good things about that will likely earn my business first.What a gorgeous historical landmark, hotel, and event space... oh my!This restored railroad station (turn-of-the-century) is centrally and very conveniently located in the bustle of Downtown Nashville. Neighbors include The Frist and Cummins Station which is not too shabby. I was very impressed by the impeccable service that I received today when I attended a special event during the day from the staff that ranged from the valet to the concierge. The event was situated in the main lobby and adjoining lounge area but even with my limited access to the hotel, I was impressed by the beautiful Romanesque architecture.The Union Station Hotel is a stunna!I would definitely recommend hosting an event or suggest booking a room to out-of-towners. TIP: The flagship dining option onsite is Prime 108 and although I have not dined there as of yet, they had stellar representation (AKA tasty bites!) at today's Savor Nashville Chef Competition. I have it bookmarked on my hit list now.The decor in this place is so beautiful.  I wanted to take every chair home with me.  Love the architecture and the history behind this place.  The bar looked very nice as well.We had a great experience at this hotel. Jimmy was so helpful. The location is great for getting downtown. Rooms are nice and service was pleasant.We stayed here for our honeymoon (yes we went to Nashville for our honeymoon). The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and every person we came into contact with was super sweet and courteous. I even asked the valet what his favorite BBQ place was and he gave us an amazing recommendation! The location is good to go to the frist, the gulch, and about a five minute walk to the honky Tonks. Our few issues with the hotel were minor. We were given vouchers for the continental breakfast (for our marriott status) but it was only good for a plate of the same thing every day (not a buffet with multiple things to choose from). But, the breakfast did include muffins of the day, fresh fruit, and a yogurt parfait. Not too shabby. Also, in the bathroom (we were on the 5th floor) there is an air conditioning vent directly as you walk out of a hot shower or blowing on you while you're on the toilet. Not ideal, but not horrible. all in all, we were very pleased with this hotel.Great place! The worst part is their gym or lack thereof. Only thing from giving it 5 stars. Great service! Clean and beautiful.I was showing my hometown of Nashville to my boyfriend for the first time. I wanted to stay at a hotel, rather than with family for one night, a lovely, iconic place for us to come back to after a night on the town.I opted to book a room at this historic former train station since it is legendary, astoundingly grandiose and ridiculously gorgeous. And it was only about $30 more to stay here than at the Holiday Inn across the street.The rooms are breathtaking. Really, I am not overstating things. Our fifth floor room was huge and it overlooked the famed lobby. As in one of the walls was completely made of glass--only a heavy curtain separated you from the ornate walkway overlooking the gargantuan lobby. It's a terrific feature that makes you feel like the you are being watched--because you are--til you pull the curtain closed.The decor is modern and stylish, the bathrooms amenities plush, the service top-notch, complete with Southern charm. If you want to impress, this is your hotel. Not quite luxury, but a really classy, stunningly attractive hotel that is worth every penny.Some things: -No parking, you must pay to valet every day for $22. Kinda pricey and a bit of a pain, but the valet staff makes it as painless as possible.-Go to the Frist Art Museum next door.-Take home all the lotion, it's the bomb.-Spend more than one night there, a single evening was not enough for us.The lobby of this hotel is kind of marvelous.  Okay, it's just downright marvelous.  The photos do it no justice.  It is ginormous and grand and oozes class.  I wanted to shove one of those maroon lamps into my duffel bag when I was leaving.  It would have looked simply fabulous residing in its new home in my living room.I stayed here for a work-thing and was given a standard double bed room.  It exceeded my expectations.  The bathroom was adorable.  White subway tile, Tiffany blue walls and matching blue floral shower curtain.  It would have made Vern Yip proud.  The room itself was just as pleasant. The bed was divine.  As soon as I laid down in it, it reached out and hugged me.  It was oh so very difficult to get up in the morning- and forget about checking out, that pained me as well.  I had floor to ceiling windows in my room, which overlooked the christian book store.  I couldn't get over how high those ceilings were.  The only complaint I have is the same as everyone else- the parking.  Ridiculously pricey!  I was informed it is $24 per day to valet, where you can come and go as you please.  The other option was a lot behind the Flying Saucer that cost $15 per day or per exit/entrance- whichever happens first.  That could get a little high if you plan on driving around Nashville.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again, it was very clean and the staff was very accommodating.  I'll just have to start socking change away to pay for that parking ticket.  Ouch!LOVED our stay here!  Definitely wish we could have stayed another night.  As everyone else has said, the lobby is magnificent. It was especially pretty since it was decorated for Chirstmas as well. Each employee we came in contact with was very friendly.  Our room was on the 5th floor and it was beautifully decorated and the extremely high ceiling was a plus.  I can't even find a good enough adjective to describe how comfortable the bed was.  I did not want to get up!  The bar area was small but well appointed and busy the night we were there. We didn't have a chance to try the restaurant but I've heard it is excellent. Can't wait to stay here again!This is a beautiful hotel inside and out!The rooms are really cute, clean, and comfortable. The lobby is gorgeous and surprisingly fun to hang out and eat cheese in (they have a really cute drink and cheese plate table.)Very close to a lot of the attractions and a reasonable cab ride to the rest. Great hotel!I am not clever enough to come up with the amount of nice things that I would like to say about this place so I'll let the stars do the talkin'!I thought this place was gorgeous and well-decorated. But for having such an expansive space and open lobby, I was surprised at the size of the room.. it could barely fit a full-size bed. But the ceilings were enormously high and the bathroom was really nice, albeit with some stains in the tub.The hotel has a great location, although valet parking ($25 after taxes) is a little too much in my opinion. However, my boyfriend and I managed to get this hotel for $80 a night for a weekend on Priceline so we didn't complain too much. The concierge was also very nice and accommodated us with anything we needed. They immediately moved us to a room away from the train tracks when we asked.It's a great place to spend time with your significant other; very romantic!","Had my hopes up.  I got an executive king suite for my wife, my son and I with valet parking and was disappointed.  A little nook in the bathroom was our closet,  we were put in a handicap room when we are not!  The ceilings being 20 feet high was not a problem but the climate system could be freezing one instant and you'll be dripping sweat 10 minutes later with no change from your part.  The living room of the suite was nice with 2 chairs, a couch and a TV but no telephone, both were in the bedroom?The room was cleaned but the used glass was left there as was the ice container with water covered up and left there?!I'm nitpicking but when I pay $300 a night in Nashville, I believe it should be at a reasonably good hotel but the Union Station?  I'm not going back.  Ever.Loved my time at this hotel! The staff was amazing and so friendly! The only issue I had was the train noise!Hidden Gem!  This place has the power to hold so much magic.  Wether you are attending an event or just walking through the doors; prepare to take a trip back in time.Places like the Flying Saucer that are attached are also great venues to soak up some history while making new memories.I recently had family visit; including my cousin's 9 year old son.  He had recently seen a ""Program"" on Old Train Stations and to this 9 year old brain, there is NOTHING cooler.  Upon leaving the Station (after seeing a few unexpected Freight Trains come and go and exploring inside) he said, in a very meaningful tone ""This has been the best day of my life.""Its easy to forget about buildings we may pass everyday; keep in mind, the magic is there for the taking.  :)I suggest a trip inside!Let me be clear, I didn't stay at the hotel.  I only went to see the lobby and get a drink at the bar. The lobby is beautiful and I can only imagine what the hotel is like.  But, we were just here for a drink at the bar.  The decor in the hotel bar was southern gaudy.  I can't stand it.  Feathers, brocade, faux leather, hot pink...must I go on? $13-$15 martini, but pretty good.  Would never go back though.  It's not worth it and I would probably have an aneurysm.Great service in a charming setting. One of the most amazingly beautiful lobbies I have ever seen. Definitely worth a return trip to Nashville.Really liked the hotel.  It is a short walk to all the Honky-Tonks (6 blocks) the lobby and staff are fantastic the rooms are spacious and beds are great.  The only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars are the trains that go by all morning which makes it hard to sleep in after going out.  But it is an old train station so what do you expectI love this hotel. It's dynamic, amazing, historic and a true staple to the wonderful city of Nashville. Not only did I celebrate an amazing birthday here, but I also got engaged here!  This place will always hold an extra special place in my heart. Overall, it's a stunning hotel, great staff and the food at the hotel restaurant was delicious too!!One of the best decisions we made...staying here for one night while in Nashville.  Gorgeous! Excellent care by the staff.  Perfect location...short walk to music scene and across from an art center.  Fitness center is small.  The corner room stunning and had the most comfortable beds, tall ceilings, and updated pretty walk in shower.  Minus a star for lack of staffing during busy hours....yet I was impressed with the teamwork that helped fix the situation.  Wish the room had a tub....was so looking forward to soaking in a bath.  Overall one of my favorite hotel stays.Wow - What a phenomenal building. Restored very nicely as original architecture truly stands out in what was once the Union Station Nashville. Lobby will blow you away as once was the main terminal area highlighted by a stained glass ceiling. Rooms upstairs at one time were the railroad executive offices. High ceilings, gorgeous windows, and bedrooms are wonderfully appointed as the hotel transforms in a Marriott Autograph collection. Bar area is cozy, yet chic and the restaurant has a great reputation. Staff went out of their way to meet, greet, and make you feel right at home.I've wanted to stay here for quite a while and was thrilled when I got the opportunity!  The hotel is very low key, quiet, and is not all abuzz like many other hotels that I've stayed in - that's a plus.  However, there is a grand piano in the lobby that could be put to wonderful use!The staff at the hotel was kind and at our service for requests.  The rooms are spacious and appear to be clean.  However, the sheets and pillowcases  on one of our beds was very thin and smelled of old body odor (which can't be washed out due to the age of the fabric...).  I requested that they be completely changed out on the secobd day and my request was fulfilled.  There were two bottles of water in our room, and a nice ice bucket but no glasses to drink from.  The second day we were given only ONE bottle of water?)  There is a coffee pot in the room, but the paper cups were also not replaced on our second day there (the guests in the next room commented the same).  We were given three towels and three wash cloths.  No more.  Most hotels provide at least 4 of each.  There was only one robe in the closet for two people on both days.  Too bad honey... And last, the water in the shower can only be adjusted to scalding hot or cold - no in between.  This same situation was also confirmed by our friends in the room next door.I guess what I'm trying to say is this... If you want to stay in a place that's full of history with great architecture and a friendly staff, this is it.  However, if you are looking for a boutique hotel with all the little extra amenities at your fingertips - you'll be deeply disappointed in the Union Station Hotel.  You just won't find them there - the attention to details is non-existent!I had a strange experience there this past weekend...We stayed in room 509...I took a really long hot shower..steamed it up really good.  I got out and looked in the mirror, and it read I SEE YOU written there, it wasn't written in steam, you could tell it was written before it was steamed up...I wrote it off to being a housekeeper trying to mess with someone.  But then after leaving and telling a friend, they told that it's rumored there's ghost there... I looked it up and found out that the 5th floor is haunted.  So, I'm glad I found out after I left, I'm freaked out now about it..and I just wonder if anyone else scene it or was it just meant for me.. :(Other than that experience it was exceptional.So there's no question this is one of the most beautiful hotels in town. I must say I expected more WOW from the room. It was nice, but nothing to write home about. Regardless our stay here was quite pleasant and the staff was kind and courteous. I would still recommend it to anyone wanting a little piece of history mixed in to a comfy nights sleep.The staff are so very friendly, especially the bellhops. It is stunning to walk into the lobby! The acoustics are amazing...very quiet. We had a room with windows into the lobby &amp; to outside... It's by the interstate and we couldn't hear a thing...  Our room was very quiet. Breakfast was delicious... With coffee(they serve Starbucks) comes a basket of toast, mini muffins, &amp; mini scones. I ate the scones and the cranberry walnut was very delicious- ended up eating more than one. This is not an inexpensive place to stay... But we felt it was worth it.This is where me and my wife stayed the night we got married!  Beautiful place!  We stayed on the top floor in a King Suite.  Looking down the stairwell.  Looks like a maze!(Reminded me of ""The Shining"" haha. The room was unbelievable.  Arches over the bed,  Nice big flat screen.  Giant King size bed that sunk your body in. Super clean friendly place.  But still has the Old Depot look in the lobby and around the building.  Breakfast was excellent.  I'm not a breakfast kind of guy.  But it was definitly a gourmet breakfast.  I wish I lived in that building.  Great time.This hotel was one of the better hotel experiences I've encountered.  I will say however tipping here goes along way.  The valet is exceptional, quick, and proficient.  The checkin was quick and the bellmen were great.  The gentleman who brought our room service was the friendliest person of the stay.  He gave us suggestions on what to do that night after the awards and how to get there.  The room was spacious and the bathroom was over spacious.  The only complaint we had during our stay was the cleaning service came in twice the day of checkout before we were ready to leave.  Overall out of any of my hotel stays service here was by far the best.I live in Nashville and just took my boyfriend to the hotel for his 30th birthday. It was a perfect way to celebrate! Everything was great--from making the reservations to the valet to dinner at Prime 108 and finally the room. I loved the style of the room (and the comfortable bed!), the little sitting area, and the nice, clean bathroom. The only thing that was missing was a refrigerator (which we could have used for our leftovers and to keep cold the dessert I brought). The room service breakfast was delicious--we both had the berry pancakes with smoked sausage and would highly recommend it!The trains going by added a nice, unique touch (and they weren't too loud or disturbing) and the whole character of the place was just amazing. It was a wonderful place for our celebration and ""staycation.""I agree with most that the valet parking is ridiculous--$24/day! I parked in the ""unpatrolled"" lot for $15 which was fine, but a cheaper option would be nice!I've stayed here a few times after some raucous Christmas parties and it's very nice. Rooms are a nice size,beds comfortable, the location is neat and the lobby is really quite pretty. For those of you who don't know, this used to be the train station. It's a boutique hotel so it definitely feels small, intimate, and unique. It's definitely an options for out of town family that might want to experience some Nashville flavor. I think it's 3 star 4 diamond. Now, as for the rumors about some of this hotel being haunted. I have to say, I didn't find that to be true and I was definitely plenty drunk enough to tap in to my sixth sense.Stunning former rail station with soaring ceilings, stained glass, and lots of nice train-motif touches.  Comfortable and cozy hotel bar (but pricey).  We had a room on a lower floor, which was huge and atmospheric, with one of the original stone arches right outside the window.  The stone arch made it a bit dark in the room, but that was OK with us.  Beds were comfortable, bathrooms were very clean, large shower with floor-to-ceiling glass - no bathtub. Locationwise, it takes about a 10 minute walk to get to the main downtown bar/live music venue area.  Right across the street is the Frist Center for the Visual Arts - basically an old post office converted into a modern art museum.  Even if you don't like art museums, go in the lobby to check out the stunning art deco architecture.  Really lovely hotel - close to the action but not right in it.  If you like historic hotels and don't mind walking a bit, this is a great place to stay.Beautiful hotel, amazing lobby and very nice large rooms, complete with plasma tv, lots of pillows and comfy beds. WIFI available in room.Nice lounge bar in lobby, make sure to stop by for at least one drink, if you are lucky Shad will be working behind the bar!If I was a tourist coming to visit Nashville, I would opt to stay in the beautiful Union Station Hotel over many of the other nice hotels in the city.  It used to be a train station back in the late 1800's and all through the early and mid-1900's.   Years after the trains stopped running through, the Station was fully restored and officially opened as a hotel in the mid-80s.  A few years ago, it went through another renovation, and now has modern amenities such as wireless internet service.  The original architecture has been protected, and remains today--I just love walking into the massive lobby--it really does feel like something out of another time; there is nothing else in Nashville like this!Rumor has it, certain floors of the hotel are haunted, but out of the few friends I've had that have stayed there, none of them have have any ghostly experiences.  So, I would not let that deter you!  It would actually be kind of cool, I think!  Rooms can be on the pricier side, but probably not much more than the Hilton or similar--if you have a choice, please opt for Union Station!  You'll have a beautiful room in a nationally rated historic building, and it's in a great location--just minutes from downtown!","['old', 'union', 'station', 'converted', 'gem', 'hotel', 'lobby',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hutton-hotel-nashville,Hutton Hotel,4.5,$$$,198,"A great dog-friendly hotel. Courteous staff and good food via in room dining. My dog loved his welcome bag filed with treats, nearby park/vet info and a tennis ball. The front desk staff also offered us complimentary dog bowls and a dog bed during our stay, but our pooch much preferred snuggling in the comfortable human bed during the night.And Molton Brown toiletries? LOVE them!Overall, I enjoyed a relaxing, quiet stay with my husband and fur baby and it certainly won't be our last visit at the Hutton.This hotel was rather pricey but it was very close to where I needed to be and it was late.Indeed it was a very nice bouquet hotel with trendy furnishings and lovely staff.  I basically had no time to take advantage of any of the perks they had, as I basically crashed there late at night and left early in the morning (at the hotel for probably 9 hours total), but the 9 hours I did spend there were great. On one thing, the shower is one of those where it's glass on one side and the person in the bedroom can see the other showering.  I was alone so it wasn't a big deal, and I guess for couples it's probably a plus.  But if you are staying with your kid, or a friend, or some other family, I can see it getting weird.Honeymoon Stay with Complications...Unauthorized charges of $8.70. Two authorized, but excessive, overcharges: $13 for TWO bottled waters--we thought this was part of the honeymoon package. Plumping problems: Sewage smell. Cigarette smoke in room from stairwell. Was moved to another room and sewage/cigarette smell issues continued. AC issues. Floor coffee maker not working. Reported issues to front desk upon checkout--we were given an apology--Is this really sufficient based on our overall experience?I love boutique hotels and was excited to give the Hutton Hotel a shot during a recent trip to Nashville; my business brings me to the area often but I was not familiar with this property. The lobby was beautiful and tastefully decorated and we initially found the staff to be genuinely friendly and accommodating. Upon getting settled into our room, I noticed two pillows were dirty with something that looked like makeup and so we asked the housekeeper in the hall to replace them and she did so happily and promptly. Unfortunately, a few minutes later, my 12 year old daughter stepped on a long, dark metal screw that was camouflaged by the patterned carpet. She wasn't hurt, thankfully, but someone certainly could have been. The next morning, I brought the sharp screw down to the front desk and said I wanted to give them feedback re: our dirty pillows and the hazardous piece of metal my daughter stepped on. I wasn't angry or indignant and I wasn't expecting them to comp or discount our stay, I just needed them to genuinely care about our experience and was, unfortunately, disappointed with a very flat, perfunctory, ""Gosh, gee, sorry about that."" A response that prompts this ""average"" review for what would have otherwise been a higher rating. Would I stay there again? Probably. Will I seek it out on my next trip to Nashville? Probably not. Would I recommend it? Sure...but check your bedding for stains and the floor for loose screws.I know, I know, three stars looks bad, but I don't mean it that way: the Hutton was totally OK. But really, just, OK. You get what you pay for in terms of location and a certain level of veneer. But a lot of things about it are just a little bit hard. Navigating the maze from the parking garage into the lobby, for example. Having to sit down and go through the quaint bank-teller chat to check in. After a day of travel, I'm kinda not ready for the extra steps it takes to get into my room.The room and amenities seemed nice enough, but things that were supposed to be fancy were just kinda bothersome. Clear glass sink. Fancy! But immediately -- and ""clearly"" -- cloudy the first time you brush your teeth (garr). Fun square toilet (fancy!), but TP dispenser broken and hanging off of the wall (garr). Modern-styled and cozy-feeling rooms (fancy!), but kinda dark feeling, and thinnish walls (garr).It's a good-looking place, and in my 20s I think I'd feel like I'd really done well for myself to stay and maybe party here. It'd be great as a place to stay in a block of rooms for, say, a wedding group? But as a grumpy getting older lady, I think next time I'd opt for less pizzazz, and more attention to basic niceties, not unlike the Residence Inn directly next door. Lessons learned. Biased by the Hutton experience? It's hard to say, but, for the one night I was there, it was kind of my impression of Nashville all around. Shiny fanciness slathered over a dose of inconvenient garr, but at the end the swing, I land directly in the middle. It's OK.My expectations for this hotel were high, maybe that's why I was so disappointed. I loved the decor when I first walked into the lobby, but everything else...not so much. The staff here were not as friendly and helpful as I expected for a four star hotel. While my husband was checking in (this took far too long) I decided to ask the concierge for some local recommendations within walking distance that were kid friendly, she looked at me annoyed and asked ""well, what do you want to do?"" I obviously had a toddler with me and was hoping for some guidance. Luckily my daughter was bored and getting into stuff so I said I'd come back later. She didn't smile or say anything. Needless to say I didn't return. After getting in our room I was again disappointed. It seemed dirty. Hairs on the bathroom floor and in the shower, dust piled on the floor trim and lamp shades, dusty toilet paper dispenser (gross), crumbs and hair between the bed and nightstand. We asked for someone to come clean it, and the sent someone up, but the only thing she did was clean the shower. While she was cleaning we headed downstairs for some food. There was no one at the hostess stand so we sat ourselves since it was pretty much empty. We were there at least 5 minutes before anyone noticed. There was a lot of confusion with the waitstaff and hostess and some disrespectful conversations to each other in front of guests. On a good note the food was really good! (5 stars for the chef!)There were a few other issues that bothered me with this place, but my BIGGEST issue was nosey housekeepers. I took a photo of my luggage before leaving the room for the day, (I highly recommend doing this if you're staying at this hotel) and when I returned later that evening my belongings had been moved around in my bag. As far as I know nothing was missing. But this was the last straw for me. I was ready to get out of there.I am a picky traveler and find fault with most hostelries.  What made the Hutton Hotel stand out amongst the now prolific number of boutique hotels throughout the world is the amazing and well trained staff.  From the moment we drove up to the Hutton, every employee welcomed us with a smile and a hello.  It's a small thing, but so difficult to teach evidently.  There was such warmth and kindness generated from each staff member, that it was contagious.  I found myself smiling and saying hello to folks as I walked through the hotel.We opted for the king suite since we were traveling with our dog and I cannot comment on the regular rooms.  However, the suite was great, not huge, but well worth the expense.  The hotel was kind enough to supply a small refrigerator for our use, and the two room suite gave us ""room"" to breath.  The shower was fantastic and the bathroom large compared to the suite itself.  The towels were thick and plentiful.Room service arrived quickly, and the food was quite good as I watched my Packers lose to Arizona in overtime.  The bar at the Hutton was fun, poured great drinks and had a fantastic bartender named Josh.  The Hutton Hotel is not downtown, but you are just a few minutes from ""Music Row"" and ""The Gulch,"" our favorite neighborhood to drink and dine.  The Hutton Hotel is a gem for the city of Nashville.The Hutton is a small boutique hotel that's beautiful inside-out. The staff was prompt, professional, and of utmost hospitality. There are little pieces of art scattered around the main floor, as well as throughout the hallways and in each room. It makes for a clean and homey feel.One of the biggest disappointments I had with Nashville was the lack of environmental consciousness. A small part of me died each time someone threw a plastic container into the trash bin or someone using styrofoam, which was essentially every waking moment outside of the hotel. so as ridiculous as this may sound, I knew I chose the right place to stay when I saw that they use an electric vehicle (Tesla!) for their shuttle services. They'll take you anywhere within a 3-mile radius, free of charge -- and trust me, the only way around town is with a car.Another great feature is that you can press a button next to your door to refuse/request room service! None of that door hanger-nonsense!They make up your room twice a day, no request needed. The cleaning staff was superb at replenishing and my requests for extra towels and q-tips could not have been fulfilled any faster. The (incredibly amicable) manager even gave me the run-down on the numerous features of the room.Molton Brown=amazing! They didn't dry me out or leave a waxy residue in my hair (common with subpar hotel bath amenities).Wi-Fi and gym use are complimentary! This is the other big feature that sets itself apart from those crazy nickel-and-dining chain hotels. I didn't use the gym, but it was nice to know it was available anytime!Also: I'm not sure if this is a feature of the hotel or just the room I was in, but this was the first time I didn't wake up burning like an oven. I usually set the AC to 60 degrees and wake up in a sweat storm, but the Hutton limit is 62 degrees and the temperature was perfect from dusk til dawn!My only complaint is that the room was too darn comfortable! I spent the majority of my trip rolling around on their soft pillows and warm covers, which meant I didn't get as much exploring done as I had anticipated.Thank you for the most pleasant hotel experience ever, Hutton! 143!I have to say the hospitality here is far superior to neighboring hotels. Although the young valet had to be instructed on how to assist a woman with her bags, everything else has been amazing. The rooms fit my technology addiction for sure, the shower is incredible and being able to control the volume on the TV to listen to GMA is a big plus in my book(can't miss steals and deals)! Took a shuttle to a nearby restaurant so I didn't have to trek in my high heels and the driver was awesome. This is definitely worth the stay. Was greeted with a great glass of Pinot from Napa (and not the cheap stuff-trust me I know). The maintenance team even held the elevator for me so I could partake in the happy hour offering. Can you say wow! Customer service is king. If you have the chance to stay here I would totally recommend. Enjoy!Great hotel if you are staying in Nashville. Not a big hotel.  Service is great staff is very welcoming.We have stayed at the Hutton Hotel at least 10 times and have loved it every time.  The rooms are nice, clean and cold!  Love it!   The people that work there are always nice and friendly.  The bar is always fun and ever so interesting!  Great for locals and travelers.Don't now why this hotel is rated 4 1/2 stars. We booked a suite for 4, the sofa bed in the room was broken, they haden't even bothered to check it let alone prepare it for the night. We finally had to move rooms. It's advertised as a 'green hotel'. Indeed, it's so green that the bathrooms in both suits didn't even have any kind of heating. It was Freezing!!! And in the second suite there was still toothpaste on the wall from the guests before us. Staff was friendly though. But I would not stay there again.Love, love, love this place! This is my second time staying here. This hotel is clean, the staff is helpful and friendly and the rooms are a perfect size. I enjoyed the evening turndown service, on-demand movies and an EXCELLENT shower. Both trips I was traveling with very young children and we were all comfortable and well taken care of! We will not only be back, but will be recommending this place to friends!Stay where the B Lister's stay for the 2015 CMT Music Awards.Had a two night stay here for the CMT Music Awards courtesy of my cable company.Nice place. Clean sheets, beautiful glass bathroom sink and shower, temperature control worked in the room, Nespresso machine on every floor, fitness center has more than 10 machines available, free Tesla shuttle car service for a three mile radius on a first come first served basis, green key / light / electricity switch in the room.  I'm a fan.And after the award show, we hung out in the bar and observed Rumer Willis, Victor Espinoza, Norman Reedus, among other presenters at the show, either strolling through the bar or in the hotel lobby. Party like a B Lister at The Hutton Hotel Baby !!!!!!!!!!!!I want to start by saying how torn I am in writing this review.  I have certainly experienced 5 -star worthy service from the Hutton.  Unfortunately, however, I recently experienced less-than-stellar service when it mattered - for my wedding!!  (note that the event wasn't hosted here, but it was our ""home base"" for the weekend - we had 20+ rooms through a dedicated block, a hospitality suite, and hosted a brunch following the wedding).I'll start with the good: the amenities are top notch.  The rooms are beyond comfortable (OMG that bed - I wish I could sleep there every night!).  Some of the staff goes above and beyond the call of duty of what you would expect, even at a high end hotel.  The gym is nice enough, the concierge is helpful and the shuttle service is useful (and way cheaper than renting a car!).  The Hutton has always been wonderful about the ""little extras"" like chocolate strawberries &amp; prosecco or wine &amp; cheese for special occasions (though sometimes the timing is a little strange - not often something I want at 10 PM...)So the issues this time...  we had ""welcome"" bags for our out of town guests (and had coordinated this with the hotel ahead of time) that they failed to give to our guests upon check-in.  They didn't communicate with the cleaning staff about late check-outs that had been arranged with the hotel and, as a result, we lost almost of all of the items that had been in our hospitality suite (and got locked out of our room while all of our stuff was still in it).  Nothing super-awful, but enough to sour the experience and bring this down to a 3-star review.Again, for the most part, I think that the Hutton is great.  Unfortunately, they just didn't deliver all the way.Had a GREAT weekend stay! Weather was a bit unexpected, but the hotel staff was nothing but kind and helpful! Big shout out to Beth and James! Thank you for giving us your recommendations!! You all rock!!!I will first admit I'm a little harder to please when it comes to hotels in comparison to others, but with valid reasons- I worked corporate marketing for hotels years ago, so things I'd notice or be annoyed about the average Joe wouldn't. I clearly do some homework before booking and usually the hotel lives up to my high expectations. My husband and I came to Nashville for the 1st time and loved the idea of this swanky downtown hotel- great reviews, decent price point. I booked on Expedia and confirmed through the hotel for our king, higher floor, city view room ( I even had it in writing). When we checked in, we were given a 4th floor view of a parking garage. Not okay. I called and talked to a guest services rep who didn't seem to care. 10 minutes later we get w call saying they are sold out but could switch our room the next morning to a great room on the 15th floor with a city view (excellent I thought!) next morning rolls around and we pack up and head downtown- they moved our bags into the new room and when we cam back just needed a new key. We get the key and they say we are on the 14th floor (not to be a diva but they originally said 15th. It just shows how they work). The room did have a great view, but I was just annoyed with the promises that were made and not kept in general. We also had decided instead of hitting up another city that we were going to stay an extra night because were enjoying the Nashville music scene so much. I called the front desk and they wouldn't match the rate I had previously booked via Expedia or those in any other channels. From understanding the back end of hotels here that was a dumb move on their part because it cuts the middle man and the cut Expedia receives. They obviously aren't too knowledgeable here and their revenue manager should make sure they are aware of this- it's more money in the bank. I ended up booking via another source and they just added it to my stay. It's nothing to complain about but just was an extra step for me and less money for them.Now for the pros and cons:Pros:Good location to downtownThe best shower I've ever had in a hotelSwanky vibe / nice lobby Complimentary Internet and shuttle downtown ( if you can catch it)Room itself was decorated nicely Cons:Not impressed with staff / check in process. No personality or excitement Promises not kept (a biggie for me)One of the most uncomfortable beds I've slept inSquare toiletsThe first time staying at the Hutton and I must say it was absolutely amazing. Our plane arrived at 6:30 am and check in isn't until 3. We called to try and check in early but they were fully booked so had to wait until check out time. Once a room was available about 12pm they called us and allowed us to check in. They were very nice and accommodating. The nicest hotel staff we have ever come across. The room. Can I just tell you how gorgeous it is! The decor, the shower (best shower ever) and the glass sink and counter. Great lighting for makeup. The bed was so comfortable and turned down nightly! Loved the coffee station in the hallway. Very convenient and good! Kept stocked with delicious coffee. Located close to downtown. They shuttle service was nice to have. The only negative was the price for parking. $25 a night to park the car and the rental car only cost us $10 a day. And the elevators are slow! Those are my only two complaints. Other than that give this hotel a shot. It's worth the price. We will definitely stay there again!Wowza! That about sums it up. We had a great stay at the Hutton. I can't even explain the insanely good customer service here. This place knows what they are doing for sure. Check in was fast and easy. We even got a room early which was nice since we had been on the road all day. The bed was amazingly comfortable too. In town for a conference so we didn't spend much time at the hotel during the day. We did utilize the complimentary Tesla however into Nashville, awesome!!! They've thought of everything. Just when you think you may have forgotten something, ask Hutton, I'm sure they've got us covered. All of the little things are really a nice touch, like the espresso machines on each floor-love!The pictures don't do this place justice. We didn't want to leave. And you want to hear something especially awesome?! It's a pet friendly hotel! I couldn't believe what I was reading when I stumbled upon the literature in the room. Have a dog? A cat? Bring em'! The Hutton will even provide your pet with a bed, food and water dishes, a litter box and a scratching post (for your cat, of course). Isn't that awesome?! I thought so too. Great place, awesome stay, we will be back for sure!Great hotel. Not pricey yet really really nice. 300 a night this stay. 200 a night last stay. Our own fault. We waited to long to book for a conference. Shower is from ceiling like the rain. Nice and hot. Square toilets are interesting, I think I want one for my restaurant. Friendly staff. Valet parking great staff. Don't leave anything in your car just in case..... Maybe had something missing but I would forget my head if it was not attached. Overall ,,, this is a great place!","Couple minutes of driving or a ""running distance"" to the major Nashville sight: the Pantheon and few blocks from Music Row. Interesting and not very typical hotel with cozy spacious rooms, decorated with local artwork, portraits and CD's of music stars, featuring warm bathrobes and slippers. Unusual shower system, that is all automatic, including temperature settings. Espresso machine is located on the floor. Breakfast or dinner at their nice restaurant 1808 Grille downstairs. The service was a bit slow and awkward though. The gym is pretty tiny, just a couple of cardios, but there is an expresso bike if you're interested. If you're driving by Nashville and want to spend a night or two in a comfortable hotel room- that might be an option.Bummer. This weekends stay was a solid bummer and I'm pretty sure the staff at the Hutton has been replaced by the staff at the Holiday Inn. All of this is staff in the review but the location, amenities and ambience are still amazing and the best in Nashville in my opinion. But couple $200+ a night for a room and you better have a smile on your face. Alas, there were no smiles this weekend.Start with our bartender who was stumped by our drinks twice - negroni is not a genius thing to make for a place with a full bar. And frankly, I'd rather if you were stumped to ask me rather than a couple of the waitstaff. The bartender also refused to come over and take our order and solidly planted himself behind the bar making us come to the bar to order lunch. If you have tables around, you'd think someone would wait on them? He also opted to yell across the bar asking us if things were 'thumbs up'. Because he clearly use to work at Hooters or something where people like being yelled at mid sentence.Add in a decision to rent a movie for $4 on Amazon rather than shell out the $17 (?!) to watch the same using the movie function in the room and a that a kerfluffle with the front desk in the middle of the night and you're getting downgraded big time, Hutton. The front desk was generally unhelpful with everything, but it came to a head when we realize the 'eco setting' on our thermostat that was engaged when we arrived means that even when you set it to 67 degrees (the lowest it will let you), if you don't move in the room, like when you are sleeping, the motion sensor resets your rooms temp to 73 degrees. That is a miserable thing when you have to wake up sweating having no idea what's happening. I called the front desk at 11:30pm asking how I can adjust this setting without waking up my significant other and was placed on hold. The front desk staff got back on the phone and, I quote, said the engineer 'won't talk to you and insisted on coming up'.  He WON'T talk to me??I asked if this is a common thing that could be fixed quickly or do I need to wake the spousal unit up and get dressed for an engineer. The front desk guy genuinely sounded afraid of the engineer saying he didn't ask him. Growing increasingly hot and grumpy, I hang up with him and start google thermostats. Because why shouldn't I be the engineer for the Hutton?The answer is, hold the display button, tap the off/auto button then tap the up arrow. Release the display button and you move into VIP mode and can set and hold the temperature to anything. Because apparently they can't tell you this over the phone. Grrr....+1 Google -1 Hutton HotelGreat and clean hotel. The only thing I would suggest to improve this experience is to not charge so much or at all for self parking. When I'm paying $300 a night it would not be too much to ask for to park for free. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I just wish parking wasn't close to $25. I would recommend this hotel.We were in town for a conference which coincided with our 1 year wedding anniversary so we decided to stay at Hutton the night of our anniversary and I'm glad we did. We could have not picked a better place to stay at for our special night. They brought up a bottle of champaign to complete the celebration. That was a very nice gesture. Almost gave them 5 star but took one off because they allow pets. Modern furniture, clean bathrooms and hallways and helpful and polite staff. They have free shuttle to downtown on a first come first served basis.Very nice hotel in Downtown Nashville. Check-in is a touch different, there are two individual desks set up in the lobby with a couple of comfortable chairs to sit in as you conclude the check-in process. Personable and relaxing.The rooms are very clean and nicely appointed, comfortable beds with nice pillows; not thin at all, but very soft, moldable and mushy, my personal preference.There are plenty of outlets available for your electronics.Parking is either by valet, but there is a self-park option as well. Parking garage is connected to the hotel.Staff bends over backwards to accommodate any and all requests or issues.Nice restaurant, 1808 Grille, is also part of the hotel. I've eaten there and was extremely satisfied with the whole experience.My wife and I have stayed in a lot of hotels, but typically while traveling.  Last night we had a ""date night"" at the Hutton Hotel, which is only a few minutes from our home.  We got an overnight babysitter, checked into the hotel and had dinner reservations at 1808 Grille, the hotel restaurant.  The evening was absolutely wonderful.  Check-in was easy and painless.  Our room was modern, clean and had a magnificent view.  Dinner was excellent and the service was fantastic.  It was a very pleasant evening which we plan to repeat in the future.  I highly recommend this hotel.I recently had the delightful experience of staying at this hotel. I have very high standards and was skeptical, but found myself so well treated and in such a luxurious room that all skepticism soon dissipated.The beds are beyond comfortable and I have to say that the showers (rain shower style from the ceiling) were incredible (and fun!) the staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable - from housekeeping to the valet to the front desk - the epitome of gracious Southern hospitality.Try it out - worth every penny!!Great service.  Rooms have everything you need including slippers, ironing board, wifi, TVs, work desk.  I was upgraded to a suite due to my Expedia Gold status &amp; there were extra perks that came with that.  Unlike the Wynn where the Molton Brown products seem diluted; this hotel provides the best of the Molton Brown line as the bathroom amenities.  Great room service menu too.  Free shuttle service to Downtown Nashville.There are only a few nitpicky issues I had where I didn't give it a full 5 stars (ie couch slightly worn, temperature control shower was confusing)...but I'm high maintenance so....I really enjoyed my stay, and am probably leaning closer to a 4.5, but alas. Pros: The location is super easy walking distance to at least a few food options, and about midway between downtown. I was easily able to taste a little bit of Nashville at Hattie B's and The Row without having to venture far by myself. The hotel is nice, clean, and overall gives a feeling of luxury without being stuffy. Staff was friendly, and the turn down service provided a fairly decent truffle one night, plus a free water bottle. I'm also never one to turn down a rainwater shower head, and the products included were nice and not cheap feeling. The WiFi was easily the best free WiFi I've used at a hotel.Cons: There weren't too many, but the size of the room itself is fairly compact (although the bathroom is huge), and it's pretty dark. Great for sleeping in, not all that welcoming upon arrival. The sink looks nice, but it's not particularly functional as water splashes everywhere.I'd be more inclined to go up the full star if the per night price was what I snagged it for on Hotel Tonight. At regularly over $450/night it falls just a little short of that five stars.Delightful. This is what a hotel should be. Super soft beds, quiet rooms, decadent rain shower. Molton Brown products. Fantastic and friendly, down to earth service everywhere we went. We are local, but I took my pre teen daughters for an all girls celebration and they enjoyed the soft robes and chocolate truffles at the turn down service. The cheeseburgers in the bar were amazing. The mussels and service in the restaurant were quite enjoyable. In the morning, we worked out in the gym after sleeping in and missed breakfast hours. They graciously asked us what we'd like and fixed a breakfast fit for queens. Oh, and they drove us around in a Tesla, gratis.We have stayed at this hotel 3 times. Twice in the winter and once in this summer. All three times we have also had our 35 lb. dog. The hotel services are amazing, particularly for dog owners. They provide walks for your dogs (sometimes for a fee if a package isn't available), which allows you to explore Nashville without running back to the hotel every few hours. Every restaurant the staff has recommended is just amazing and the Tesla shuttle service is so great. The hotel is gorgeous and we are always placed on a floor for dogs and it is so clean. Every staff member goes above and beyond and is so nice and chatty, from the manager to the cleaning staff. You can tell the working culture is great, which makes your guest experience even better. We had an air conditioning issue in our room and the staff handled it so well. We are so happy and would highly recommend this hotel.What a beautiful hotel! The service was excellent and our room was beautiful and spacious. Also enjoyed having a reasonably priced minibar available. Dinner in the hotel restaurant 1808 Grille was excellent, as was breakfast. The bar was busy and the cocktails were good. Definitely would stay here again.4.5 stars. Clean, good service, well decorated, and within walking distance of lots of bars and restaurants.  The 1808 Grille had a good wine list (didn't try the food).  The gym was a typical hotel gym.   We had two TVs in our room, which was interesting but unnecessary.My husband and I stayed at the Hutton Hotel over Memorial Day weekend. Overall, we really liked staying here. It is about a mile from the chaos of downtown and closer to Vanderbilt. The check-in process was quick, but we arrived later at night (around 9pm on Thursday). When we checked in, the front desk gal wasn't the friendliest....maybe she was tired? finishing up her shift? One thing I didn't like was the ""upgraded"" room they tried to put us in. The gal at the front desk said ""we've upgraded you to a 'cardio king' room."" Since I had done extensive research on the types of rooms, I knew that meant we would have an obnoxious elliptical in our room. The cardio king room is basically just the king room, but with workout equipment. If I had been on a business trip, I would've chosen that, but we were on a leisure vacation and not interested. She tried selling it further by saying the room was ""a bit bigger""... ummm I would hope so since there is a huge elliptical taking up space in the room. I told the front desk gal we wanted the room I reserved and she said ""fine."" We were on the tenth floor, which wasn't quite high enough to see downtown, but still was a great floor. The elevators were never a problem and the noise that people mentioned in other reviews wasn't an issue for us (maybe because we were there on a weekend?). We did check out the 1808 Grille one afternoon for a quick snack and the staff were fantastic. The gentleman who waited on us was extremely attentive. Housekeeping was good with only one snafu-- we had requested a change of sheets because on of the pillows has a black grease-looking stain on it. When we came back after the day out, the sheets appeared to have been changed, but the stained pillowcase remained on the bed. That was disappointing and I would've expected more from the hotel.The deluxe king room was great. The rain shower was amazing and the Molton Brown bath products smelled amazing! The bed was very comfy and the complimentary wi-fi worked very well, which doesn't always happen at hotels, so that was great. The nightly turn down service was a lovely touch. It includes bottled water, chocolates and the forecast for the next day. Overall, it was a good place to stay. Would recommend it to people who want to be a bit outside downtown and not deal with the chaos and noise down there.This hotel takes care to pay attention to all of the details. It smells so good when you walk into the lobby. I liked the unique check in where you say at a desk with a staff member. Felt very laid back. They surprised us with a complementary bottle of champagne for our anniversary.We are just leaving the Hutton after an amazing first time trip to Nashville.The Hutton is pure perfection: fantastic service and amenities that should be in every hotel. For example, we didn't use a taxi much because we took advantage of their courtesy vehicle... A shiny red Tesla!! They are a cut above the rest and I'd give them 20 stars if I could!I have always enjoyed staying at the Hutton Hotel before. Great location, service, and amenities. Has typically been a little high-priced for not being downtown, since that is the real epicenter of activity (you can get cheaper rooms just as nice downtown), but the decor and amenities support it. My most recent trip however was very disappointing, and unfortunately it's completely beyond the control of the hotel.The Hutton Hotel, for so long, was THE BEST VIEW of downtown you could possibly get. Sadly, since the Spring Hill Marriott went up next door, that has largely changed. The west side of the building is still largely unobstructed, but the east side now has a fantastic view of the new hotel and parking garage, that is, if you choose to open your window blinds, which probably isn't a good idea unless you're cool with the occupants of the corresponding room at the Marriott seeing what you're up to. The worst part is, at least nine of the Hutton's twelve floors are obstructed by this handsome but inconveniently placed monstrosity.Would I stay again? Probably not. The lady checking us in initially did not give us a choice of rooms (1 bed or 2), and was not accommodating toward our request for a higher floor room, which started things off on a sour note. In the end, it ended up not mattering since everything on the east side except maybe the penthouse is all covered up. Great hotel and amenities, and a nice place to stay, but when half the guest rooms are subject to this kind of view in a city that is all about wowing you, it's just not worth that kind of money.I stayed here for a week while traveling to Nashville and had a great experience.  The staff was very nice... almost overly nice.  I just want to check into the hotel and go to my room but the guy checking me in asked about my day and told me about events going on in Nashville.  I would have appreciated that more if I wasn't so tired.The rooms are GORGEOUS.  I mean, you can't get much nicer of hotel than this.  But then again, with the price you pay, you better get a nice room.The location is okay - it's not downtown but being outside of town makes it easier to get in and out.  There are restaurants you can walk to, but you're on a busy street so it's a little bit of an awkward walk, but definitely doable.Hail! to the Hutton, valiantHail! to the hotel heroesHail! Hail! to NashvilleThe experience and best!Hail! to the Hutton, valiantHail! to the hotel heroesHail! Hail! to NashvilleLay your head and rest!As I sit down to recall my recent two night stay in Nashville, for some reason, the Michigan fight song comes to mind.  I am a Michigan alumni and while the Michigan fight song has nothing to do with Nashville or anywhere in the South for that matter, I do have fond memories of time spent at both places!The Hutton Hotel has a tagline on their website: ""boutique elegance in the heart of Nashville,"" which is a really great descriptor.  In addition, I'd say this hotel is classy, clean, fun, and five stars for sure!From the friendly staff (valet and front desk, housekeepers, etc...) and awesome amenities to the central location and more awesome amenities, I can tell that this is not the Hutton's first rodeo ;)Some stand-outs worth mentioning:-a decent sized fitness room-Nespresso machines on each floor-extremely comfortable beds and showers with both hot water and pressure-free wifi that works-turndown service complete with bottled water and locally produced chocolate-1808 Grille / room service - I had lunch upon arrival and it did not disappointAnd while I didn't get to take advantage of it, there is a complimentary wine hour daily!I only hope that I'll get to experience the Hutton again in the future!ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST hotel I have ever stayed in. I am a self-proclaimed hotel snob so it can be hard to please me but this hotel did it. I don't think I got a single ""no"" from anyone the entire time. The GREAT: The fragrance upon entering the hotel is welcoming and invigorating every time you enter. There is plenty of comfortable seating in the lobby and restaurant area. I loved the non traditional front desks. They reminded me of our Jamaica hotel...a more intimate experience. The hotel staff was EXTREMELY friendly, even walking past a staff member they greeted you. Southern hospitality at its finest. The 1808 Grille was OUTSTANDING. The staff was amazing, helpful and overachieving. The food was awesome!! Oh, and half-priced bar menu for happy hour?? Oh yes!! The ""Hotel Shuttle"" was a red Tesla that whisked my husband and I to Broadway St. downtown and picked us up when we were ready. There was an apple and cranberry drink available in the lobby daily, for consumption. I LOVE espresso and there is an espresso machine on every floor. The ice is also pre-bagged in the ice machines. The rooms are inviting, a nice size and very comfortable bedding. The amenities make you feel special with two robes, slippers, a large rain shower head with shower seating, an oversupply of toiletries and a class sink that is mesmerizing. The housekeepers were very serious about their jobs and cleaned the rooms in a timely fashion, leaving candy and bottled water. It was clear that this hotel thought of everything to help make its guests feel special. I LOVE special treatment!A couple of down sides were that 1) I was accidentally checked out of my room by an attendant who tried to say that I wasn't reserved for my last day. My reservation days were verified. I later got a call from the manager of the hotel who simply wanted to touch bases with me to ensure that I was satisfied. What a great touch of customer service! 2) Upon leaving I reviewed my bill and saw that someone had charged something to my room from the grille. This was not my purchase. The attendant took care of it right away and removed it. I'm glad I checked! However, I will never charge incidentals to my room again. These two incidents are the only reason they are not getting 5 stars from me.","Perfect location and a contemporary hotel. The staff is amazing. The concierge (Laura) actually had a bottle of wine left in my room because my boyfriend said it was my birthday. She went out of her way to accommodate us. Nice that they have a shuttle but reserve ahead of time. Complementary wine in the lobby from 5-6 M-T. They actually let us check in at 9:30am without any issue. Would definitely stay here again!pros: the free car service. if the destination is within a 3 mi radius they'll take you &amp; pick you up. it was convenient. The hotel staff were more than accommodating and polite. They were very nice all around. The cafe had solid offerings. I liked not having to go far for a good breakfast or drink. cons: the housekeeping staff would move my things around. I would keep things lined up and orderly, but apparently it wasn't to their liking. Every time I came back to the room things would be arranged differently. It was very annoying. Leave both the curtains open? Not anymore, now the shear one is closed. the shifting of items resulted in my losing of a piece of jewelry. If I have it neat, why not leave it?The rooms were super clean and spacious. you definitely get what you pay for in that aspect. The bathroom had a sliding door and the lock was broken so I felt like there wasn't much privacy. However, the staff is super attentive and helpful! The bar and restaurant was nice, a little overpriced in my opinion for the quality and the menu is very limited. Overall though it was a great experience and i would definitely stay there again.We've stayed at the Hutton several times and easily give it 5 stars. The best thing about the Hutton? The staff. Everyone at the hotel is friendly, engaging and courteous. They help deliver a welcoming guest experience. We also love the modern/contemporary design and the boutique hotel charm. Oh, and the fact that the hotel courtesy car is a Tesla just tops things off. We look forward to our next visit to Nashville and stay at the Hutton Hotel.I've been using this hotel for every Nashville business trip (even if the company is reimbursing 25 percent of the charge by choosing a non preferred hotel) because I like a few things in a place I stay:Attentive staffComfortable bedsAC that worksEasily accessible internetTimely room service before meetingsA mini bar because I get the munchiesA good gymA robe! I know I know .. That's why I said like and not need ..A restaurant with edible foodClean Non smokingElectronic everything including checkout and ebillsHutton has never disappointed. I've stayed easily 15 times. I had an issue once with an overcharge and getting a room I didnt book. They were completely committed and couldn't fix it. I sent an email and had a response from the manager in 24 hours taking responsibility and making things right.I'm back again and had a free upgrade to a suite, great service and when I checked into a room that had obviously been previously occupied by a smoker, I called down and Alyssa had new keys by the time I went to the lobby. (She offered to have a bellman bring them up but in the interest of time I went downstairs).The only thing I can suggest that they do is look a bit more at common areas and spots that are looking rundown or worn. Elevators, carpets etc. It gives the place a look undeserving of how great it is. Staff is exceptional, rooms are great, gym is great, people are helpful and I will continue to come here unless by some random act all of that changes! Highly recommend.A yelp! find. My family has traveled to Nashville many years in my pre-tween days in the 70s and 80s. We were going back this spring to visit family. Wanted to not only visit family, but to see the city. You know - as an adult? when you pay attention? So we looked for a place like the Anatole/Dallas, except not, because my work pays for that. Not this trip. I hooked up with the Hutton. The minute we stepped in, it was awesome. Service, service, service. Those employees are fantastic. Check-In, Rooms, restaurant, valet, concierge, and even that coffee shop, which I used once, awesome. waitasec. I didn't mention the rooms. Beautiful. Beds. Awesome. We'll be back.Stayed here one nite while visiting Nashville. The maid barged in at 8:30. Followed by constant hammering on some rooms being remodeled. And the final thing was as we were collecting our things to leave there where some very old looking French fries at the base of the bed, gross.There are two types of hotels; Places that provide a bed for you to sleep in while you miss your bed at home, and places that provide an experience and a bedroom you wish you could have at home. The Hutton is the latter. From the entrance to the lobby to the staff, I was already impressed before I got to my room. Then when I heard about the fact that this is a green hotel, I was even more thrilled. The lights in the room operate when you put your room key in a slot at the door. This is brilliant because it helps keep energy costs down for the hotel, but even better, you never lose your key because it's at the door! When you leave your room you simply take it with you. Genius. Other small but important features of this hotel: super, SUPER clean rooms. The linens, the carpets, the fixtures, everything is clean. I also loved the easy access to outlets for charging phones, laptops, Kindles, and whatever else you lug around the country in your bags that require charging. Room service was great, the turndown service included free bottled water and chocolates, the bathrooms offer separate shampoo and conditioner (thaaaank you!) and the soaps and products smell great. I hate the hassle of carrying liquids on a plane and avoid it at all costs. So it's great when a hotel provides above average quality soaps and lotions. I especially loved that the shampoos and soaps are in large permanent dispensers on the wall inside the shower. It looks nicer than the cheap little bottles and I didn't have to pester anyone for extra product after a few days because there was enough in the shower to last months! What else can I rave about?Oh! A full length mirror in the room, free WIFI, marble showers (with a little bench!), updated/modern fixtures, a full-size hairdryer in each room, a lighted make up mirror, bathrobes and slippers in the closet, tons of towels, blackout curtains and awesome pillows. It's like they've run hotels before or something! Every need of mine was totally met and I had a great stay.The only minor issue I had was the amount of noise in the hallways. I'm a light sleeper so I travel with earplugs. And good thing I did because there appeared to be a staff room at the end of the hall near my room on the top floor. 24/7 there was noise. Typically during the day it was loudest, but even at night past midnight and through till about 5am I still heard people chatting in the hallways, doors constantly closing, carts rolling back and forth, and more than twice, hotel employees talking to one another from across the hall. Not shouting angrily, but speaking loudly so as to project their voices so they could be heard by whoever they were speaking to. It was a bit frustrating to say the least. Especially because everything else here was so perfect. Definitely not the loudest hotel I've been to, but if you're a light sleeper I'd consider bringing some cheap earplugs. On a scale of 1-10 though, I'd say it was about a 6. Not so loud I felt like I had to make calls to complain, but loud enough that it woke me up a few times throughout my entire stay.  Bonus - celebrity sightings. I rode in an elevator with a reality star and country music legend!What a disappointing experience for such a cool, boutique hotel. There is major construction surrounding the place and no end in sight. Upon arrival, I asked the employee to put me in a quiet room. Needless to say, none exist. Don't even think about taking an afternoon nap, nor even dream about sleeping in on the weekend. While the ""agreement"" by the contractors state they won't work on weekends, their construction workers were busy little beavers at 6am on the dot on a Saturday. Imagine a constant jack-hammer sound.The disappointment came when dealing with the front desk staff. The attitude I got was passing the buck and the buck stops with the customer paying $300/night. They didn't show above and beyond care or willingness to help with my accommodations or unpleasant stay. Well, they did offer a free breakfast...my bloodshot eyes were not pleased. It wasn't until I asked for a manager (General Manager) above the manager I was talking to and a phone call that I made until they did the right thing. The first manager said, he could not contact the general manager because it was the weekend. That made no sense. However, once the General Manager got involved it immediately was corrected (thus, saving on stars). I feel sorry for the guy, there were many other guests after me with the same bloodshot, sleep deprived look and I'm sure he heard from all of them too.The hotel itself is lovely and in a convenient location minutes from downtown. They offer a shuttle within a 3 mile radius. Complimentary wine service starts nightly at 5pm. The rooms were well decorated and clean. I'd love to give this place another try once all construction is complete, but I don't see myself returning to Nashville.Friendly service and great hotel! Room was huge. There's a couch and television area and then a bedroom. Bathroom is huge and has a electric shower system where you can set the temperature of the water. And they have a pretty good hair dryer and make-up mirror, which is always a perk! There's a gym on the fourth floor. Pretty small, but they have a good assortment of cardio machines (elliptical, bike and treadmill), dumbbells and a couple weight machines. Wish there was more mirrors and space to lay down on mats. Overall, great place to stay if you're ever in Nashville!I'm going to start off this review with an exclamation: Hallelujah! I've found a hotel that *has it all*. I felt so privileged to be staying at this top-notch property and that's pretty remarkable, seeing as I typically have found some fault with just about any hotel I've stayed in.When thinking of how to describe the style of hotel, the words ""casual luxury"" comes to mind. It doesn't have the glitz &amp; glamah of the Four Seasons, nor is it tragically hip like the W Hotels (read: no glowing Buddhas in the room). Think: sophisticated, yet approachable. No bells &amp; whistles. No parading ducks. No fountains, nor waterfalls. No Buddhas glowing in your hotel room. No dance music in the lobby and no suits on the make in the hotel bar. It actually makes me think of how hotels might have been in the 1960s (though it does not have a consciously retro vibe or look). Classy!!!There's a complimentary wine hour. There's art that's not trying too hard. There's comfy couches and shiny wood floors (slight criticism that they need to avoid the orange oil as I almost took a spill a few times).Not for a minute do they skimp on the amenities you'd expect (bathrobes, killer bath products, amazing rain showers, sumptuous beds), and then some (turn down service with ice, chocolates and bottles of water) Espresso machines in the hallway are a nice touch seeing as I don't like drip coffee (there are drip machines in the room, if you so desire). I hit these up periodically throughout the day. The gym is a step above any hotel gym that I've used before, with complimentary bottles of water, headphones, green apples and towels for your convenience. I used it three times during my five days, which made it AOK for me to indulge in those damn fancy peanut butter cups and chocolate turtles the housekeeper left on my pillow every night. The staff, from front desk to concierge to valet is superb (and I might add, quite easy on the eyes. Hells yes, you can help me with my suitcase, kind sir!) I swear, I did not purposely leave my purse in the cab so that I could rely on the help of the valet to retrieve it for me... *bats eyes*... but I can't say I regretted it either.Hutton Hotel, I can't imagine how you could be better. I want to return to Nashville just so that I can stay here again.This is just a great hotel.  The staff goes above and beyond everyday.  I have scheduled a few meetings here and worked with Adam.  He did everything and more to accommodate our requests.  The location is great too as it is away from the noise and tourists of Broadway.    Lastly, the food and catering staff is fantastic, I worked with Whitney on food and beverage which was outstanding!I had high expectations given that this is one of the Leading Hotels chain and the reviews are high, but was really disappointed.  The service here was unacceptable for so many reasons.  On the first night, we called repeatedly to get linens for the bed and (after waiting for over 45 minutes) wound up going to the linen closet on our floor, hailing down a hotel employee, and getting them ourselves.  The next morning, we left to take the hotel shuttle to go downtown, and the hotel employee driving the shuttle was visibly intoxicated or high.  We reported this to the hotel staff, yet this same employee was still working the next day.  The glasses in the bathroom were not changed throughout our 4-day stay at the Hutton, even though they had toothpaste on the rims and clearly needed to be changed out.   This evening, we asked for turndown service while we were out for dinner, and returned to the hotel at 11:00 p.m. to find that the service never occurred.  We called to request a comforter for the bed, and the linen representative came without the comforter and only with sheets (which we did not request or need).  While the hotel has a card in the bathroom indicating that you have the option of hanging your towels (in which case you would use them again) or putting them on the floor (in which case you wanted new towels), we hung our towels only to find that the hung towels were removed from the bathroom and not replaced with new ones, so we were left without towels.  The pull out couch had springs coming through the mattress.  For a 4-star hotel, this place needs some major help.Would recommend to friends...would book again! Would of given 5 stars if it were not for the construction and wait time for shuttle... Other than that I enjoyed my stay!It's alright. The food was good but the service was downright horrible. It was at least 5 minutes after we sat before we had our drink orders taken. I asked for an aviation, a gin based cocktail dating back over 100 years, and was looked at by their incompetent bartender as if I asked for molten lava. This same disgruntled bartender suggested that he had worked all over the country for longer than I've been alive and never heard of it. Then later he made a joke about putting unicorn tears in my beer to make it better. I guess he thought the aviation was as real as a unicorn or something, idk. But it wasn't as professional as I had hoped and I doubt I'll go back. Those people should treat all their customers like they're important and not just the guys wearing suits.I have stayed at several hotels in and around Nashville and the Hutton hotel is by far the nicest. It is a fairly large hotel with a smaller boutique hotel look and feel. It is close enough to walk to all the downtown shopping and nightlife(about a 15 minute walk) yet far enough away that you do not have to contest will all the people and traffic of downtown. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly. Nightly turndown service with chocolates left on your pillow and slippers and a robe left bedside. They have a free courtesy van/shuttle as well as a new Tesla courtesy car. Rooms are a little small but very nice and the bathroom was big and the shower was HUGE. All of the staff that I had interactions with were friendly and helpful. The hotel restaurant and bar 1808 was nice as well. Very very nice hotel for $300 a night, I have spent far more at other hotels in Nashville and other cities for that matter and received far less.Great place to stay and have plenty of places within walking distance. Stayed in a King bed.  Bed was alittle hard which is why I didn't give 5 stars. Also didn't like how I had to leave my keycard in the slot to keep the lights on. Kept forgeting to grab it on the way out and had to get new ones. Great bar downstairs but a little over priced. Belvedere Martini was about $15. But they did have the nespresso coffee machine throughout the hallways which was nice because the coffee shop in the lobby was not great.I would stay here again just so I can walk over to Hot Chicken a block away.We stayed at the Hutton for the first time this year and we really enjoyed it. The service was impeccable and they were eager to help with anything we needed. They are pet friendly and there were dogs of all sizes staying with their owners. They also have a free shuttle to the downtown area and to other areas within a certain mile radius. The only con was the elevator situation. The elevators stop on almost every floor even if people weren't waiting for the elevator. That sometimes got frustrating. Overall, it was a great experience and we can't wait to go back!!Trendy but comfortable upscale hotel I really liked a short cab ride away from downtown Nashville. 4.5 starsBed: 4.5, shower: 4, service: 4.5, atmosphere: 5Cost to worth it rating: 4 (spendier at $285/night but lived up to it)Return worthiness: yesHighlights:- Artsy decor in the lobby with check in desk with seats instead of the big traditional desk you walk up to.- Room service: 24 hours and friendly and accommodating when my friend wasn't feeling so hot- Toiletries: Molten Brown was great- Shower: big rain one flowing from the ceiling with good pressure. Only con is if you're not washing your hair, you can't avoid getting it wet unless you wear a shower cap- Bed: very comfy- Daily elixir: in the lobby was cool- Local sweet treats: by our bed at night- Bathroom: modern and large- Little waters: free in our rooms - Light notification: system for do not disturb or service room to replace those plastic door hangers- Bar: long bar with some seating. Loved the snack mix that featured guitar shaped pretzels and was a bit spicyMidlights:- Car service: nice to have within 3 miles and nice driver, but only 1 so not often available Lowlights: - Construction on both sides - Had to cab downtown or take a longer walk so would be nicer if was right in the thick of things.Really liked the hotel and would consider staying there again, though the new Omni looks inviting...Hospitality at its best! The Hutton lives up to its AAA's Five Diamond hotel rating. To date, it's the best hotel experience that I've ever had in my life. It's worth every penny!From check-in to check-out, top notch service. I like the kind of boutique check-in experience that they offer - you sit down at a desk instead of the standard bank-teller-esque check-in transaction. The staff were very friendly, extremely helpful, super accommodating, and you feel like they are genuinely concerned about your satisfaction.The room was gorgeous. It's spacious and very modern in design. The room's entertainment system has speakers in the bathroom, so you can listen to music or the TV while showering or bathing. I mention this because the bathroom is huge and stocked with Molton Brown products. It's like a spa up in there! lol. But really, the room was luxurious and beautiful. The bed was extremely comfortable. Plus, this was the first hotel in which I've stayed where turn down service is offered; hotel staff leave these tasty, locally made chocolates on your pillow. For a week after my stay, I would turn down my bed at home and put mini Snickers on my bed. Alas, it was not the same experience.Each floor has a k cup expresso machine. The hotel's restaurant can stand on its own; it is a great restaurant in its own right (you know, some hotel restaurants are just an add on and not really places where you want to spend money to eat). The gym was just as beautiful as the room - with TVs built into the equipment, clean towels (not paper towels, real towels), and cold water bottles and apples. We parked our rental car in the deck, which is accessible through the building, but we also made use of the hotel's shuttle service downtown. Honestly, I will never forget my stay at Hutton Hotel. It was amazing and the stay there was a major highlight of my trip to Nashville.","I felt okay about this place on the whole.  I travel a lot and everyone seemed to recommend this place to me on my most recent trip to Nashville.  I guess it's a big music industry scenester place?Anyway, my stay was good.  The staff was very helpful and kind.  Free wine at happy hour is always a nice touch, too.  The place was clean.  The room service was a bit on the pricier side for what they were offering and the last night options were abismal -- I chose instead to order out/get delivery twice.I think I'll try something else next time I'm in the city.  I didn't love the location of this spot, and the rooms were a little small.My husband treated me with a trip to Nashville for a last minute, child free Spring Break. His travel agent suggested the Hutton Hotel, describing it (rightfully so) as modern and boutique. After valet took care of our luggage and car, we ascended the stairs to the lobby to check in. Complimentary wine was being served, which is always a nice touch!  Everyone was kind and helpful for our entire stay. (And the complimentary wine is served nightly around 5-6)The rooms were nice, with turndown service and 24 hour room service. Billy Joel had a concert while we were there (which was AWESOME!) and his band stayed there for a few days, though we didn't know this until checkout day. (It was even rumored that Billy stayed there in the penthouse, but the staff, ever-so-discrete, could not confirm) We would be hard-pressed NOT to stay at the Hutton next time around! It was a great, memorable week.  ***Oh!!! I almost forgot!!! It's pet friendly!Stayed here 2 nights in early December.  Very friendly staff. Beautiful room and comfy bar/restaurant setting. Close proximity to Vanderbilt and downtown. I'd stay here again.This is a dream of a hotel in downtown Nashville! We chose this place because it is within walking distance from Broadway and the rest of the strip. The staff is friendly and eager to help and best of all the shuttle is free of charge in a 3 mile radius and is none other than a bright red Tesla! It is pet friendly and also a 'green' hotel. Only thing I would skip is the restaurant downstairs. It got good reviews but I was not impressed.Welcome to The Hutton, the Unofficial Bachelor/ette Party Hotel of Nashville.At least that how it seemed. On our own mission of mayhem, we ran into large group after large group of folks also there to celebrate a friend's impending doom...nuptials. I meant nuptials. But I can't blame any of them for choosing the Hutton, because as far as I can tell, this is the best hotel in all of Nashville. All right, this might be the only hotel I've hit up in town,* but I have absolutely no complaints and I'm not sure how it could've been better.** Basically though, they've got everything I want:-Free, fast wireless. Without even the hassle of a username/password.-Clean, well-appointed rooms with outlets everywhere.-The most comfortable of beds.-A modern, gorgeous bathroom with every amenity.-A friendly, courteous staff that was on top of our every need, and didn't even stop the 3:30 am Natty Ice chugging contest that took place on the front steps.***Well, almost everything. They didn't let me extend my checkout time past noon. But I can't really blame them; I would've wanted us out as fast as possible too.____________*The filthy fleabags I slept in during college visits do not count as hotels. **Unless they could somehow find the hundreds of dollars that seem to have gone missing from my bank account at some point over the weekend.***Although, several people who shall remain nameless would've sincerely appreciated it the following morning if the contest HAD been stopped.I stayed here for a week and everyone was so sweet! I felt right at home. Everyone greeted me as I came in and out, was down at the bar/restaurant 1808 grill almost everyday, meeting with friends or just doing work on the computer. They made an effort to remember my name and take the time to remember what I drink or offer recommendations on food and drinks.  Cody VanOrden a bartender at 1808 even altered the ""signature"" specialty cocktail for me since I am on a low cal diet.  I told all my friends that met me here and even other hotel guests how much I loved it and called it the ""Cody Special"" by the end of my stay all the bartenders knew how to make it and guests were drinking it.  I recommend it!  Very refreshing!  Dennis Butler another bartender at 1808 in The Hutton hotel, made me always feel welcome.  Recommended new wines and and amazing food, and how I could switch some things out for the other to make it low cal as well.  Dennis also told me the places to go that weren't as ""touristy"" as most, so glad he did because I found all the hidden dive places that were amazing!  Crickett Gumper, alone the name is amazing, was my first friend here! She welcomed me into 1808 with open arms. Was so sweet and when I told her I was moving here, she gave me here number in case I needed any help with anything.  Such a charismatic sweet girl!  Josh Johnson at 1808 as well was very sweet as well and made my ""cody special"" when Cody wasn't here to make it. Josh also helped me when I was looking at apartments online on my iPad while having a beverage at 1808, telling me which Neighborhoods were decent and which to stay away from.  My stay at The Hutton, was the most pleasant and surpassed all my expectations.  I travel a lot and stay at 5 star hotels often in Santa Monica, San Diego and NY when I travel, Huntley, Lowes, Grand Hyatt, The Plaza in NY.  I was a bit skeptical about it only being a 4 star hotel and there is only one 5 star in Nashville.  The Hutton should be a 5 star from the valet to the welcoming employees and mangers, room service everything is amazing! Very polite and sweet people. I had an amazing stay here and made new friends that I booked my stay longer and also pre booked for when my friend comes to Nashville to help me move so we can just have a girls weekend.  Rooms are exquisite, the people are too sweet and genuine.  I would recommend The Hutton to anyone it's one of the most beautiful and well run hotels I've stayed in.  I will continue to stay here for a staycation or if I move out of Nashville and come back for a visit.  The hospitality here is amazing!! Especially at 1808 the bartenders are the best!!!Upon arriving at the hotel, the valet is extremely attentive and helpful, so is the bellboy. Check in is friendly and fast.The concierge is there to please and make sure you receive all the info needed.The room is pristine clean, spacious and comfortable.Bathroom is clean with Molton Brown goodies! Pleasant +!!!You Must have brunch at the Hutton! It's delicious! Eggs Benedict with home made corn bread, an absolute tasty dish.I would definitely stay here again!Not stellar. Uncomfortable mattress and pillows. Consistently WRONG information. From concierge (s). U useable toiletries. Hotel was not the highlight of an otherwise fun trip to Nashville.I was so impressed by the way the staff was SO polite!  Clean room and POSH!  Coming from Maryland was a pain and they let us check in way early.  Thanks Hutton!  Loved the shower and they comfy bed.  Slept like an angel.  Will be staying again!A five diamond experience in a four star hotel. The service is outstanding from the bellmrn to the front desk. The fixtures and decoration ate not only trendy but also luxurious. Oh and the bed...to die for.It's January. So. Clearly. Time. For. My. Annual.Hutton Hotel. Review It's quite the coincidence that my third review of the Hutton also falls in January like the previous two. However, what doesn't fall to fate is the consistently fabulous experience that I enjoy here. Whether I host a team of Yelp Community Managers for a week, host a non-profit fundraiser, or even hang out in 1808 Grille, everything is a class act here. I literally send a link to every friend or business acquaintance to the Hutton when they mention an upcoming trip and warn them that there is simply ""no other place"" to stay while they are in town. The complimentary daily one hour wine happy hour is the stuff dreams are made of and this is also a wonderful sanctuary for those who travel with pets too! A perfect example is even represented last night when the super friendly valet literally cleared off the ice from my rearview mirrors and dash when we experienced some sleet. Did I ask? Nope. Did this prevent him from offering me superior customer service? No way!I should also mention that the ""Events"" staff is spectacular. I have worked with Curti Hinton for a few years now and he is always on point, professional, and a please to work with. All around, if there was a way that I could afford to live here (hello Eloise), I would. (slow clap)Bravo Hutton. Bravo!Yelp365#12Without a doubt my favorite place to stay in Nashville. Great location, staff and rooms. Hard to top that combo.Amazing find--and I'm a Four Seasons girl. Got immediately upgraded to a suite without asking...I travel a lot and I've never had an easier check- in. Rainwater showers, modern up to date everything, courtesy van to take you around the area. Everyone is super nice and room service is fast! Get the French toast btw. Great hotel and staff, exceeded my picky expectations.Ugh...it pains me to give this place 4 stars for some isolated incidents because Hutton is truly a class act.-Great central location (quick access to all the city's hotspots)-Great valet service-Beautiful, modern decor -Great restaurant in the hotel -Rooms are very well-appointed with all the amenities you could possibly need-Friendly, helpful staff-Pet friendlyA few downsides: -The TV wasn't working--something wrong with the signal because it was cutting in and out; it was annoying when we wanted to catch up on morning news--but not enough of a bother to worry about it-Confusion at checkout; they had us down for another night--had we not checked out formally at the front desk--we could have gotten charged for an extra night-While we were checking out the, we saw some dog poop on the welcome rug and someone had pulled it aside without actually picking it up...so several people walked by and almost stepped in it--not the greatest last impression Those few downsides aren't enough to keep me away though. We'll be back again.I was a solo guest, unexpectedly to say the least and new to the area. The hotel staff was over the top friendly, and was extremely helpful. The accommodations were top notch! The hotel was clean, beautifully decorated and the in hotel restaurant had incredible food! I was sent complimentary champagne for my birthday, and made to feel right at home.This hotel made my stay in Nashville complete, if I am ever in the area again I will definitely be staying at the Hutton.Let's be clear: These people put two different kinds of chocolate on my bedside table. You bet your sweet bippy they're getting five stars. Let us also note:-- The beautiful decor-- The perfectly made up beds-- The wine hour (yessssssss)-- The wifi is lightning fast-- The casual chic restaurant-- I asked for toothpaste, razor and a brush, they were all there within moments-- The staff is happy and welcoming and awesomeAnd also the night watchman let us hang out on the steps and eat and drink in our pajama pants while my friend smoked her lungs away and we dealt with drunk idiots returning to the hotel... or trying to get in the hotel. That guy was awesome. We hung out with him more than our friends. If you get the chance, here's the spot to enjoy Nashvegs!Yelp Regional Week 2012: Nashville! This hotel gets it right every step of the way from arrival to departure, morning to night, and with an eye on reducing waste while not reducing amenities. I enjoyed it so much I plan to relive it step-by-step. If you don't like long reviews, move along. Upon arrival, you are greeted by helpful (and plentiful) valets - one guy was helping me out of the cab while another was getting my bags from the back. The check in experience is excellent as the customer service folks are seated at big desks in the lobby. You can put your bags down and have a seat while they get you all checked in. The beautiful lobby is focused on art, and much of it appears to be local. My favorite piece was the large steel horse - when viewed from the staircase above, you can tell that the piece next to him is actually a large trough with crystals made to represent water - very cool indeed.My room was beautiful and beautifully appointed with wonderful lighting, a large velvet wingback chair and an ample workstation with a fancy chair that was actually very comfortable. My favorite feature is the green lighting system, which I have seen in Europe but not in the states:  you must use your room key to activate the lights and A/C in your room. This serves two functions: you can't accidentally leave a light on, and you are less likely to forget your key. A free wine hour in the lobby serves dual purposes as well: guests are happier and generally more pleasant when some free booze is involved, and it keeps the lobby much livelier and more fun in the evening hours then it would be otherwise: a nice touch that more hotels should look into.The bed was large and highly conducive to wonderfully deep sleep. The room wasn't large, but I don't understand the need for a large room unless you plan to do some entertaining (or have a lot of gear for a convention or something) - for me this room was a perfect size. The bathroom was beautiful with Molton Brown products configured in a way that was designed to reduce waste. In addition to fluffy towels, a robe and slippers were a nice touch. Turn-down service is provided if you're interested, which I suggest since they deliver two complimentary bottles of water (and some sweetie treaties) at that time. A mini-bar and a few treats are stocked should a case of the munchies strike you.In the AM, you can make your own coffee in the room or step down the hall to a push-button espresso/cappuccino machine. (Hint: even if you don't make your coffee here, grab the real half-and-half and sugar to spruce up your in-room coffee. A button in your room lets you select privacy or tells the staff you are ready to have your room made up. Parking is a breeze, adjacent to the hotel - again you use your room key for in-and-out and charges go directly to your room.My housekeeper did all the normal things like making the bed and changing out towels, but she also organized my cosmetics, de-cluttered my dresser and on two separate occasions, folded all my clothes and placed them neatly inside my suitcase, a luxury I am certain I haven't enjoyed since my mother did it for me! She also left me a note thanking me for the tip. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels and I don't think I have ever received a personal thank you note. The two or three times I needed help from the staff, I received friendly, helpful, thorough assistance, and props to them for employing and training such a young staff with so much poise and follow through. I plan to come back to Nashville soon, and will fight for my right to party in such lovely digs.I think Joi B said it perfectly: ""I've found a hotel that has it all."" It's true.Friendly, affordable, trendy, easy check-in, comfortable rooms, great lighting in the restrooms for proper makeup application, cozy beds, amazing rain shower, the softest hotel towels, a complimentary wine hour in the lobby, espresso machines in the hallway, turn down service - yes, turndown services offering warm cookies, bottled water, tidying up of the rooms. They're pet-friendly, they have a giant steamer (upon request); I actually kept it in my room for the full five days. The entire staff was extremely accommodating - this entire staff deserves a hospitality reward: valet, house keeping, concierge, front deskThe only cons:This hotel is a freakin' ice box. Not bad when it's 99 degrees outside, but hanging out in the lobby for wine hour, in the restaurant for lunch or the conference rooms (the absolute worst of it), you're gonna freeze your nalgas off. I rec, I rec, I rec. I'll be back on my next trip to Nashy - which I hope is soon!!!I love hotels and have been lucky enough to stay in different ones in all of the continental 48.  Over the years, few have deserved five stars.  The Hutton definitely does.While checking in, I was blown away by how nice and professional the girl was at the desk.  I know, most receptionist are, but there was something different.  I was in jeans and a hoodie, yet she treated me like I was in some kind of fancy suit with a minion next to me.The room was immaculate and impressive.  It was very spacious and had all of the amenities.  Most impressive was the bathroom.  Glass counter and sink, volume controls for the TV, and a ""rain"" shower head made this the nicest bathroom I've ever done my hair in.I'll never stay anywhere else in Nashville... That's for sure.Now THIS is what a luxury hotel should strive to be like.As others point out, the amenities are plentiful and they just make good sense. For example - offering free wi-fi not just in the lobby but in every guest room. I can't tell you how often I pay an arm and a leg on wi-fi services that feel like AOL dial-up, circa 1996!Also, the complimentary courtesy car (available for trips within a 3-mile radius) is such a swell add-on. I used this service at least three times!But best of all, is the wine hour enjoyed in the lobby every day from 5-6pm. This is something I did not miss! The wine is actually really good and runs like water (free + plentiful) much to our group's delight.Of course, the hotel is beautiful from trim to fixtures to the stately but small, elegant rooms. Service is wonderfully southern, and the hotel's conscientious environmental efforts are commendable.Would I come back? In a Nashville heartbeat.","Loved our stay here. They really spoiled us when they found out (via a pre-checkin online survey) that we were coming to celebrate our anniversary. We received a complimentary upgrade to a suite and some delicious gourmet strawberries.While I would definitely stay here again I felt like there were some things that make this slightly less than 5-star worthy because when you start getting into these kind of prices you expect to have no complaints. Mine are minor and no reason to prevent me from coming back.PROS:-Staff is super friendly, professional and hospitable-they made us feel really special-Shower is Ah-mazing-waterfall shower head, digital temperature control, programmable settings for up to 6 different people-Complimentary shuttle within a 3 mile radius-helps you avoid finding and paying parking downtown.-Plenty of restaurants in walking distance-even for someone like me who doesn't do well with walking-They give you two pieces of local chocolates and two small bottles of water each night and they are delicious! This fat kid was in heaven!-Bed was surprisingly comfortable-there's only two hotels I've actually said that about-I actually liked that the air conditioner was loud for sleeping because I require a fan for sleeping for the noise.-Valet guys were great with eating suggestions and directions every time we went out. Even offered us an umbrella for our walk in case it started raining.-Great location, I think Midtown is my new favorite part of Nashville.-Large flat screen TV meant my husband didn't have much to complain about.CONS:-There's no pool, so any down time you have there isn't really much to do. I would have liked a pool while we were at the hotel resting in between outings.-There are no vending machines in the hotel, they expect you to purchase a beverage from the 1808 grille which for a couple like us who like to have a bottled drink to sip on it was a little disappointing. -I wouldn't count on a refrigerator in the room. It's a mini bar so it's stocked with high priced beverages leaving little room for your own drinks.-The air conditioner is loud for watching TV-Room was kind of small for the price- we were upgraded to a suite and when I walked in I thought ""my goodness how small is the regular room?""-There's construction going on on both sides of the hotel, while the noise wasn't a real issue they've destroyed the sidewalks so you have to walk in the road until the next blockVery cool hotel. Great vibe and quality. They have a great bar and restaurant called 1808 grill.  The rooms are cool, but small.We'd come back for sure.Love the Hutton Hotel. Great central location for Nashville. They have a van that can take you anywhere nearby. Complimentary wine in the afternoon. My room has an elliptical machine in it for an easy workout and everyone who works here are nice.I spend over 150 nights in hotels each year as a part of my job, so I get to experience different levels of service and accommodations.   The Hutton was a huge disappointment, especially after reading other reviews.  I was expecting something special and had a below average experience.  My room smelled of human urine and I woke-up to bulldozers outside my window.  It took me over 10 minutes to find a valet person to park my car and the hallway to my room was dirty.  Ouch!  I cannot recommend this hotel.Great hotel with lots of character. The staff is very nice and the rooms are nice as well. First hotel I've stayed where they have liquid hand soap, and it isn't just some random soap, it's Milton brown fancy soap. I would recommend it to anyone visiting NashvilleTerrific hotel. Gorgeous modern large rooms, stunning bathroom with centered shower head (good for couples). Evening turn down service where they set out the weather, water bottles, slippers, etc. Free shuttle that will take you within 3 mi of the hotel + cabs are $6 to downtown. Generally lovely and luxurious. Parking garage is a tad confusing, go up to the 3rd floor for self parking spots.I got O stars and two words for you BED BUGS! Yes indeed my husband &amp; our 10th anniversary goes down in martial history as the worst night of our lives! The valet was great he took my luxury SUV complimenting me endlessly on it.  That was great.  I think...NOT! I will get back to that later on.... First, we went to check in, had reservations!! &amp; there is no room available so they tried to give us the handicap room!  I'm like it's our 10th anniversary with all do respect that is not the sexy room I had in mind I'll just wait for my room.  Over an hour later we finally checked in.  Right away we notice the rooms were badly beaten up and there was a hole in the bathroom wall, the bed frame itself was all torn and ratty looking. I took pics! There was a giant glob of hair in the lightswitch by the bed that really took my husband over the edge and when he cut his finger on my cuticle tool on accident (when we unpacked) I called down for bandaids and after an hour waiting, my hubby who had wrapped his finger in tissue, just decided to go down and get them.  He said that while down there he ran into two hookers and that the bar was completely packed with people.  All coming and going outside the front door to smoke on the front steps with the valet guys!  What in the heck??? The next morning when I noticed my hubby scratching at his arm and I realized what it was I thought I was livid then! But, NO, to add insult to injury when they brought my supercharged range rover sport around I couldn't leave fast enough! Then to my surprise those valet guys must have pulled a Ferris Bueller on me!!!!!!!! All my radio stations/settings were changed, there was a small scratch on my black leather seat that was not there b4 and a empty water bottle that was not purchased by me in the back floor board rolling around!!!! They took my beauty for a joy ride!!!!  I know my car every inch!  I wish I would have noticed the millage when I got out the day b4! I will never valet my black beauty ever again and I will never try another ""new"" hotel in Nashville either! The Peabody in Memphis, The Hermitage in Nashville and the Four Seasons in NYC where I usually stay, also $300 a night, does not have a late night party bar scene but they also DONT have ratty rooms, hookers, and BED BUGS!!!!  Pictures don't lie.One of the best. High end service and accommodations at a very reasonable rate. This hotels equals or surpasses many $500+/night hotels. I wish there were more Huttons around.My daughter and I were passing through Nashville on a road trip and were only there for 1 night but we wanted to stay longer.  If my travel plans ever bring me back to Nashville, I will definitely stay here again.Very nice high end hotel in Nashville.  Modern decor, great service, and nice amenities make it a great place to stay.  Upon arrival, the hotel exterior looks sad and tired - like an old 60s office building.  But upon entering, there is a nice open modern lobby with a variety of low couches and seating arranged for people to mingle, wait, and relax.  Check in has two low desks.  Where you sit down and take a break while you check in.  Hotel rooms are nice.  Plush comfortable bedding.  iPhone compatible alarm clocks. Bathrooms have a wonderful rainshower head, nice terry lined robes, terry lined slippers, great Molton Brown toiletries, and a volume dial if you want to listen to your TV show while you're in the bathroom.  There's a mini bar and snack bar in the room with decent snacks and drinks. Turndown service was a very nice surprise.  You get a really nice locally produced chocolate candy and it's not always the same. There is a driver at the hotel who will take you anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel and also pick you up as well.  There can be quite a demand for this service especially morning and around dinner time. The surrounding area is just okay.  For a break from the hotel restaurant - you can go to Hattie's Hot Chicken and get a taste of Nashville hot fried chicken.Loved this place. Very modern boutique hotel on west end. Rooms are small but well appointed. Best part of our stay was the staff..super friendly and courteous . Free shuttle to downtown . Great location near several of the recommended restaurants including Hattie's Hot Chicken , Noshville eatery and Rotiers. Would definitely stay here again.POOR REVIEW! Unfortunately...- upon arrival, there was no direction as far as what to do with our bags and when they did finally take them they were left on a cart by the busy door unattended for a long period of time.  When I asked the (rude) receptionist what are they doing with our bags, she snapped they will be brought to your room (with a ""duh"" look on her face.)- the women (dark hair pulled back in a clip) behind the reception counter was not friendly at all and belittled my questions, also - it was stressed and restressed when I called and placed my reservation that the whole weekend was a surprise so please don't say anything about pricing or details at check in. That note was completely looked over and the receptionist said the price of each night and how long we were staying and when she handed me an envelope she said ""here is your spa receipt and other info you requested""!!! She apologized after I asked if there were any notes on the account and she saw the info I had specified and stressed prior to check-in! Too late however, the surprise was blown :( - After we got into our room we were not thrilled with what it looked like for the price (we live in Chicago and have no problem paying $300-$500 a night, but the rooms are always AMAZING!) we actually looked  into other hotels online once we saw our room at the HUTTON and experienced the unfriendly staff, however there was a football game in town (Ol' Miss vs. Vanderbilt) and hotels were booked! The sofa was a tweed that looked dirty and worn out, the chair legs were noticeably damaged, the bathroom didn't feel luxury with a standard bathtub and damaged tile, the moldings were chipped, etc. It all just felt very ""eh"" FAR from luxury more like a Holiday Inn which we honestly would have preferred. Honestly I felt like I wasted $1500.00 but we were in a bind with my boyfriends departure to Afghanistan, so we decided to just try and make the most of it, we had come all that way (that's not how we should have had to feel)- When we got to our room we waited 15min for any sign of our luggage then waited a little longer (we arrived at 4pm and had early dinner reservations so we needed our bags to get ready) I finally called and they were up 15min later.- After talking extensively with the very friendly concierge about how important it was during our stay to just RELAX, she recommended a spa not too far away for a 2hr couples massage - worst massage we've ever had. We felt like we were being punked, we have never stricken out so many times in a row before. It was another bummer and huge waste of money!-We generously tipped the valet guys twice, the baggage guy once (he was very friendly, things were just mixed up he said), the shuttle guy once (he was very friendly) and the room service server... we did make the most of it but it was not at all what we expected and really put a damper on our precious last days together. We are too nice and should have complained, but we didn't want to waste  anymore time being on negative things/ experiences.  The same lady who checked us in also checked us out, same attitude, we just gave her the cash and left.I had never heard of this hotel, so I did not know what to expect. The lobby is like a big living room, warm and modern interior.I was a little confused where we had to check in (no sign), but once we figured it out the check in process was fast and efficient.The rooms are a little small to be called suites, but the modern interior, cleanliness and comfort make up for that. Best part is the shower. Ultra modern technology from Kohler - love it.Service - I worked for Starwood Hotel and Resorts for 15 years and the service at this hotel surpasses that level. The housekeeping, restaurant staff, concierge, bellmen etc provide top notch and friendly service. Note to GM -Keep doing what you are doing! I will stay here again soon.Oh, how I wanted to love this hotel! The first downfall is that there is construction going on right beside the hotel. This means that my room was facing the construction site.  Imagine having worked on a report and presentation until the wee hours of the morning only to have the construction noises begin bright and early around 8 o'clock in the morning! Also, I ordered room service twice and the food was just okay.Housekeeping was probably the worst. Today, I was taking a nap and had my privacy light on when I kept hearing someone knocking on the door stating that they were from room service. ""Housekeeping!""  Ok, do you not see the light??? After they continued to persistently knock, I rolled out of bed and went to the door only to have her tell me that she was at the wrong door. GRRRR!!! Okay, back to sleep. About an hour later, room service came knocking on my door again. ""Housekeeping!"" Out of bed again! This time when I answered, they told me that they received a call for police somewhere on the floor. WTF... Really? Maybe I should have called the police on housekeeping for steadily interrupting my sleep.Later on, when the evening housekeeping staff came, I asked her to change my sheets, as I had spilled coffee on them earlier. I ran out to get food and came back expecting that the bed would be made. The bed was made... true. But the same coffee stain was on the sheets! As I gave her a considerable tip, I really expected that this would be done as she said it would. I found her in the hallway and asked if she changes sheets... She came back to the room and told me she did. When I asked her why the stain was still in the same place on the sheets, she told me that all the sheets come back stained from the laundry! Really??? Okay, get me out of here!Morning of departure: Rough night... little sleep... there was a party on the floor until very late. At least I can get some espresso at the coffee machine on the floor... Nope, the machine is down. I go to another floor and the housekeeping staff tells me the machine is down there too.  Sigh. I will check out early and make it to the airport to get coffee there. I should be able to check out using the state of the art, Eco-friendly checkout system and go... Nope, the system is ""temporarily unavailable"" so I have to go wait in the long line of inpatient guests waiting to check out. Never again!Nice, nice, nice! All the way around this is a great place to stay in Nashville. The rooms well-kept, clean, and comfortable. The service was as good as can be-- from the valets to the front desk to the bartenders, they are a great reflection of Southern hospitality. ... It's a little bit of hike to the main Broadway/downtown area, but still close enough to walk or an easy cab ride. But there are some nice finds nearby, like Hattie B's almost right across the street. ... All in all, would definitely recommend the Hutton.This place sure is purdy inside.  It's wood and interesting patterns, shapes, and textures in a lot of natural, earthy tones, coupled with some modern flair.  It's fancy but comfortable, which is a hard line to walk, at least I think so.  It kind of smells like Nordstrom.  We showed up without fancy luggage, looking tired out from touring the city and didn't get any weird Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman awkward shopping side-eyes from anyone.  I liked that.We had a lovely room with a big, soft bed, pretty furnishings, and a nice view of the city.  There are just so many features and touches.  I am kind of simple, in that I don't often stay at nice hotels, so I was in awe of the cool key card that also activates the lights, the fact that you can turn a knob in the bathroom and whatever is on the t.v. is piped into the bathroom, sound-wise.  There's a two-part flushing toilet, 1/2, which is largely due to the hotel being a 'green hotel'.  The shower was awesome and they use Molton Brown toiletries.  The robes are soft and the slippers are complimentary.  The mini bar is pretty nuts, expense-wise, but if you're in a pickle, they offer a good selection of treats, including wine and a corkscrew.  I read that they recycle, too.Soft pillows, nice flat screen t.v.'s, free espresso machine down the hallway.  It's $20 to park, which is steep.  But, overall, I feel it's a good value for such a nice room.They also offer a restaurant in the hotel, which we didn't try, but I read that they use local foods when possible.  Instead we brought a rotisserie chicken and hummus in from Whole Foods.  Holla.  It was a good night.First time at the Hutton Hotel and stayed June 27-29th.  Checking in was a breeze and they were able to get us in the room at 11 AM instead of the normal check in time (our plane arrived at 8).  Rooms were very clean and coming from Chicago, this hotel was on par with some of the top hotels I've stayed at.  The made our Anniversary an enjoyable experience and I plan on staying at the Hutton on future visits to Nashville.Wow what a cool place.  Some perks:-centrally located in Midtown-incredibly hip decor-accommodating and friendly staff-coffee bars on every floor-Moulton Brown bath products (woo woo fancy!)-glass-enclosed rainfall showers-super comfortable beds and sheets-free, easy to use WiFi-1808 Grille downstairs (one of the best restaurants in Nashville)-modern art horse statue in the lobby, how can it get any better?Really, check out this spot, it's pricey but very worth it!Top notch accommodations.  It meets my criteria for a great hotel:*  great bed, linens, and pillows*  awesome bathroom (super cool Kohler digital controls for waterfall shower) and toiletries*  great bar (1808 bartenders are fantastic)Highly recommended!I was blown away by the friendly staff and amenities. Highlights that made me smile: 1. Attention to detail by the staff. Example: one bellhop gets off the elevator with his cart and proceeds to the front desk. He sees us heading for the elevator and runs back to the elevator door to hold it open for us. Most people when on the move somewhere don't notice things like that and I was impressed. 2. Check-in was flawless. You get to sit down with your clerk at a desk like a client at a bank ready to open a loan. Felt like VIP status.3. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash all installed inside the shower in pump bottles for ease of use. Rainfall shower head and very roomy shower were also winners. The square toilet seat was big enough to make the husband happy while sitting ;) 4. Lights activate in the room with your key card; way to save energy guys!5. The bed mattress, linens and pillows were extra comfy. 6. Coffee room with Nespresso on ever floor is pretty awesome!7. The mini bar and drawer of goodies was unique with a romance kit, wine and wine opener. Never seen that before!8. Free WiFi!!!!!!9. 1808 Grille downstairs is high end and delicious complete with a bar and generous happy hour!AWESOME!!! My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel this past weekend and it was by far one of the best hotels I have visited. The customer service was good from the time we drove up. We had a couples massage in which he said was the best compared to the other places we've been for massages. Room service was timely and very friendly. I feel the price for the room was very reasonable. The wifi worked very well. I have stayed in other hotels and had problems with the wifi due to so many people being on the network, but not this place. The location couldn't be better. I would definitely recommend  this hotel to others.","['great', 'dog', 'friendly', 'hotel', 'courteous', 'staff', 'good', 'food', 'via', 'room', 'dining', 'dog', 'loved', 'welcome', 'bag', 'filed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/nashville-airport-marriott-nashville,Nashville Airport Marriott,3.5,$$,54,"I have been frequenting this hotel for almost two years. I do not always stay here when I travel to Nashville, but the majority of the time I do. If am not staying here, I am downtown at the Courtyard, or in the Gulch staying at the Fairfield. Now, the hotel rooms do have an outdated look, but the beds are comfortable, the restaurant is above average, and the service is impeccable. I quickly made friends with the one and only Hervie at the front desk and he is an awesome host. Even when he is not there to check me in, he has written me a note welcoming me to the hotel, and on occasion included a coupon for a free beer/wine. He always makes me feel special, and I would come back to this hotel over and over again just because of Hervie! I am a frequent traveler (business and personal) and am a Platinum Marriott Elite member.If you like to party like its 1999 this is your place. Rooms are the same orange brown they were my last visit early 2000!!I rarely review but we are all disappointed with Laquinta rooms @Marriott prices. PSGold Elite Over 50 nites Marriott this year. And a uppity front desk. Never again.Here for a conference.Meeting rooms for the conference were comfortable and appropriate size.Breakfast (fresh fruit and pastries), Lunch (Roasted Pork, Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans) and Afternoon Snack (Blackberry or Cherry dessert) were all good.Stayed at this hotel for my sorority convention. The staff from start to finish was so polite, friendly...just over all great. There was never a moment someone wasn't speaking or smiling. The hotel handled us with style and grace. I will say that the rooms gave me and my roommates sinus issues but otherwise the room was fine. Beds smaller than queen size. Free parking. Right near the airport, about 30 min from downtown Nashville.My biggest dislike was that there weren't many dining choices in the immediate area. Otherwise, this hotel was great.Nashville Airport Marriott offers a spacious and elegant accommodations for those who are travelling to the Nashville area.  Conveniently located within minutes of the International Airport, and a short drive or cab ride to a vibrant downtown full of music and entertainment, this location offers business and family travelers alike a convenient, clean, and comfortable place to stay in Nashville.I attended a confrence at  this location but have not stayed the night as I live in town.  This is a higher end hotel and is known in Nashville for hosting large confrences.  The look of the hotel as well as the feel is very mondern and pleasing to the eye.  There is a large parking lot, which is typically very full but there are always spots open further into the lot.  It is located in a good area as well, not shady at all and close to the airport.Excellent! Can't say enough good about the rooms. Have stay multiple times and always a great experience. The top floor, 18, has a magnificent view of the airport and the city. Corner rooms are by far the best. Love the decor and special touches. The restaurant is wonderful and very well priced. Definitely recommend.We had our Nashville Lynch family reunion at the Marriott this past weekend July 16-19th 2015. From the first day of meeting with Melissa, they never dropped the ball. The staff heard our vision and brought it to life in such a beautiful way. The rooms top notch, clean and luxurious. We were 150+ in attendance and not one complaint. I thank each and every person that works at the Marriott you all deserve a raise!!Meh rating due to fact that hallways noisy - you hear people walking and talking - and this is normal voice nothing inappropriate level. Definitely ask for room away from ice machine - they were going off every time I got off elevator !  Smooth service and modern.  As others pointed out, nice indoor/outdoor pool, work out area, sports bar. I appreciated the cool water by doorway - came in handy as temperatures soared during recent stay.Room facing pool side and occasionally heard planes though not too bad.  Not happy with fact that guests pay extra for basic internet - especially with high Room rate.Don't get me wrong - this is a really nice hotel.  I just expected more from a full scale marriot.Heavenly pillows on a very nice, comfy bed - slept wonderful! The place is very clean, beautiful lobby and pleasant staff.  I wish we had time for the pool, it looks fabulous also.Rooms are small but clean and the bed comfortable.  With the exception of a front desk clerk who was rude, (having a bad day perhaps?) everyone was quite friendly.   TV's in the rooms don't get as many channels as the restaurant televisions so we had to go back downstairs to catch the end of the baseball playoff game.I stay here every time I come to Nashville. Never had a problem. This time I woke up to bed bugs! !!!! Totally grossed out! !!! Is this the marriott or an inn somewhere? ?? The clerk completely apologized and told me since my rate was already discounted he could only give me 20 bucks off my room.  He also said to email him when I return and he will see what he can do. I will not be returning!  Bed bugs, rats, roaches are intolerable and to not comp my entire stay is a slap in the face. Marriott last a loyal customer today!***This is not the most up-to-date Marriott, but it is comfortable, offers a reasonable room rate and has some nice pluses like a sharp looking lobby and sports bar***Airport Marriotts are often not the most contemporary Marriotts and that is the case at this Marriott located just outside of the Nashville International Airport.  It does, however, feature an attractive lobby that looks onto their combo indoor-outdoor pool.  The sports bar Champions does not look like the Champions locations at other Marriott hotels.  This Champions showcases a striking and sleek lounge area with modern and upscale tables and chairs (a great dark look too that is Houston's-esque but much more spacious and comfortable).The rooms are okay.  They are comfortable, clean and well maintained, but they (like a lot of Marriotts) lack a contemporary touch.  The bathroom was well equipped with toiletries (even Q-tips, cotton balls and a shoeshine cloth), but it was a little tight. The bathtub featured an amazon rainfall showerhead, which I liked though I imagine some might think the water pressure is too low here.The fitness center is open 24 hours and offers a variety of exercise machines.  This Marriott also has a laundry room with washing machines, dryers and even a couple of arcade games including Ms. Pac-Man. The Concierge Lounge, available to Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members, provides food service on weekdays for breakfast; they also offer nightly appetizers and desserts Sunday night thru Thursday night.  And while most Marriott hotels open their Concierge Lounge for nightly service at 5:30 p.m., this Concierge Lounge opens a little earlier at 5:00 p.m.  They had a good variety of breakfast items in the Concierge Lounge including muffins, fruit Danishes, croissants that did not look good, breakfast breads, sliced fruit, hard boiled eggs, and an assortment of individual cereals (both healthy and sugary options).  The hot bar is where this Marriott really sets itself apart from other Marriott locations.  Most Marriott Concierge Lounges offer oatmeal, scrambled eggs and usually one breakfast meat (typically bacon or sausage).  This Concierge Lounge provided oatmeal and scrambled eggs as well as both bacon and sausage links.  They also offered a daily sandwich or wrap.  One day was a southern fried chicken breast biscuit sandwich while the next day offered a wrap of egg whites, mushrooms and cheese.Of the hot items, the breakfast meats clearly stood out. The bacon was a little bit thick and really meaty with a good chew as well as some crispiness.  The bacon was also not the overly fatty bacon that you often get with buffet bacon.  The sausage links were pretty good for buffet sausage links--fairly juicy and not dehydrated or frozen food-esque. The scrambled eggs were dry one day and a little too wet and bland the next day.  The sandwiches and wraps were not that good.  The fried chicken sandwich was particularly dry. Nightly appetizers were okay. Every night offered assorted cheese cubes, crudite and chips with salsa.  For hot items, not that crispy but meaty buffalo wings and coconut fried chicken (overwhelming coconut flavor) were offered one night.  The next night brought vodka sausage penne pasta and surprisingly decent chicken wrapped with bacon (tasty even if the big bite on the toothpick did not have much color).  Desserts included assorted cookies and pecan pie bars as well as alternating bars like lemon bars and brownies. The Concierge Lounge has a very small and crammed area for a lounge.  Most of the seating is for dining including two tops, a communal table and a counter with a view of the rural and green area around the Nashville International Airport. Service throughout the hotel was very good including a noticeably friendly front desk. Room rates are not too bad and unlike a lot of big city airports, it is a fairly short and quick drive to get to the downtown area. The Marriott Nashville Airport is a nice enough hotel even if you are in an unlively area (a Downtown Nashville stay would be more fun given that Downtown Nashville has a lot of energy with lots of live music venues).  This hotel is still a decent option for a comfortable, clean and not too expensive Nashville stay. Unlike most Marriotts, this Marriott offers complimentary parking.  It is easy finding an open space.I originally called this hotel and rates were 140. By the time I had it approved by my company I was told 219. Now this is horribly expensive for such a trashy area. Nashville is ugly, but what is worse is changing  prices as quickly as this place does.This was the hotel that my company decided to use for our recent business trip.  And I hope that this is the last time.  Basically the hotel is designed to empty your money from your wallet.Pros:The staff is very friendly to it's guest.  Most of the time you are greeted as soon as you walk into the door.Check in was fast and easy.Rooms were fairly clean, except for some mold on the shower curtain.Cons:The rooms are very noisy.  Every time a room door was shut, you could hear it slam.Like others mentioned, no free wifi.No free coffee in the lobby, only a Starbucks, which I detest.Signs telling to go green by not having the hotel wash the towels every day.Expensive hotel restaurant.And the big insult, a envelope by the TV so you can leave the maid a tip.This is a nice hotel to stay at if you have a car while staying in Nashville since it's about a 15 minute drive to downtown. However the amenities are very nice and the beds are comfortable so this is a good (and cheap) choice outside of city limits.As a side note, they must have a requirement to have a minimum of 3 door greeters at a time as every time we came back to the hotel, there were no less than 3 hellos exchanged (which is kind of adorable).The decor is nice and there is free parking....This is a Marriott; they do a good job of it. The rooms are a little small, but there were two beds and a desk AND a bathroom. What more can you ask!What sets them apart are the people. The staff was invariably friendly and seemed genuinely happy to assist with whatever was requested; whether 2:00pm or 2:00am. There isn't a lot close around; very long driveway with a Waffle House at the end. You will need transportation to get to food or entertainment. Free shuttle to the airport.Nice hotel and grounds are attractive. Really friendly staff, too. Shuttle, and more!If you just need somewhere to crash for the night, this place works.  Otherwise, there are a lot of nicer hotels where I would prefer to stay.","Horrible! Booked a queen bed given two doubles. Moved to a dungeon with a bed standing there from a scary movie. The room smelled like a hospital, I could hear the guy snoring next door which I recorded I wish I could upload and kids screaming at the pool at 8am. Moved to a better room the next day and talked to manager and would give is marriott rewards points equivalent to $300 for a room. We were given 5,000 points, which it takes 30,000 for one night, so lady lied to us. It only costs $140 for a room on the weekend, so were given a whole $23 equivalent in points. Do yourself a favor and go to the Hilton.Very nice room. The air conditioner was a little loud but the bed was pretty comfy.  The park and fly aspect of the hotel is the best. The shuttle had us at the airport in mere minutes. Very courteous and helpful driver. The shuttle runs regularly and made our travel so easy and even enjoyable.  I will be staying here again!Amost two years later I'm back in Nashville. The property is well maintained, staff are true professionals, and the internet connection still fast and stable. This is my go-to place for Nashville business travel.Nice hotel for a work visit or for a night.  The fitness center is loaded and the pool area looked nice as well. I usually stay at the Marriott near the college when I come to Nashville (twice a quarter) but figured I would try something new. I like this place better as it's easier to get around and the staff is way more friendly. The room at the other is nicer and newer but this place will do.This is an older Marriott property that is in decent shape but doesn't quite make it past 3 stars.The toiletries are the same brand you'd find in a Courtyard property vs. a Marriott hotel.One of the light-bulbs in my bathroom was burned out.Housekeeper did not leave hand towels.  Strange.The desk was small and the outlets in the desk lamp did not work.Small things, I know, but I expect a lot from Marriott.   I had a drink in the bar, it's one of the Champion's sports bar themed bars found in some Marriott's.  Lots of televisions, a decent beer list and the scotch selection was pretty good.  Bartenders and servers were very friendly.I'd stay here again to get the Marriott points and it's pretty conveniently located for business in the Nashville area.When I review a Marriott hotel, unfortunately I am only comparing it to other Marriott properties. It has been a long time since I have stayed at another brand and I spend well over 100 nights every year at Marriott's. This is a VERY GOOD Marriott. The rooms have been updated or refreshed not within the last few years (although they could update their TV's...a little small.) Service is EXCELLENT with the staff being very attentive and friendly. I was a little disappointed that the breakfast in the concierge lounge did not have bacon like almost every other Marriott. As far as location, if you don't have a car you are stuck with eating on the property but I am pretty sure that is the norm in Nashville if you want to stay at a nice hotel by the airport.Very impressed. What a beautiful hotel. And the new breakfast bar is excellent.  Large variety of food options. Hot and cold foods. Plus they serve mimosa's.Overall great hotel to stay. Not too far from downtown but the service and attention to detail is always noteworthy. Has a good in hotel restaurant worthy of visit. Bar has happy hour. Starbucks coffee is in lobby. Continue to check in here and enjoy my visit.I grew up in Nashville and remember when this hotel was built, so I was surprised to find it revitalized and such a positive experience. I won't comment on the specifics other than to say that I loved the room, the amenities, the Bath and Body Works toiletries, and the bed. The restaurant at this hotel rocks. Every dish I had was way above average for hotel food, and not unreasonably priced. The Starbucks coffee option was very affordable and not over priced like most hotels.But one big big complaint. The $14.95 charge for Internet is just silly. Almost every luxury hotel in America, and especially the budget hotels, have removed this charge. Why is this hotel lagging? I'm sorry, but free wireless in the lobby doesn't cut it. This is an hotel by an airport, and it attracts mostly people on business. Get rid of that fee. you're making people pay for something that has become so necessary and basic as a toilet and a bed. It's sooo 2000 to charge for it.Otherwise, a wonderful place, and I recommend it among the airport area options.All and all this is a decent place. The rooms are nice but nothing to celebrate. They are quite and the concierge lounge is better than most. For me they have a some what decent gym and an indoor outdoor pool which brings it to a 4 star over a 3.Typical Marriott airport property. Pretty much know what you are getting. Decor is somewhat outdated but acceptable. Pillows are way too small and tall. Loyal to Marriott or I would have searched elsewhere. Service at Champions Bar in lobby was great. Nachos were average.Had a great 2 night stay here. Staff was extra friendly, greeted us every time we encountered them. Not just front desk but all staff.  Rooms were clean, beds were great, and lunches provided at our conference were delicious. Only 4 stars though as the AC was almost non existent on night one, worked great on night two. The heat in the hallways was almost oppressive, I know it's Feb and cold outside but wow! Overall all excellent and would stay again and recommend to friends. Oh, add some USB ports for charging in the rooms!Will not stay here again. Website lists high speed internet, but they charge $15 for wifi. How much extra is room service? Regardless of any other features this is an insult that will probably steer me away from Marriott properties in the future.Just another Marriott by the airport, basic rooms. But the people who work here are outstanding--they all address you with an authentic ""hello,"" and the dapperly dressed, African American man even checked to make sure I wasn't missing the  shuttle as I sat with my luggage in the lobby. I wish I were a kid &amp; not there on business; the indoor/outdoor pool with the narrow connection looks fun!All in all a nice hotel. The one drawback was the restaurant was closed for a remodel until March.  They used a very plain banquet room in its absence.  I'll be back - after March!In a nutshell, great hotel, extremely clean. Free internet with Marriott Rewards. Adjacent to airport, but cannot hear any airport noise from hotel. Ten minute ride to downtown Nashville. Much cheaper than staying downtown. Well worth it. Will definitely return. Oh! forget the bar/restaurant off the lobby, 'Champions'....food absolutely horrible, undercooked.  Eat downtown lots of choices.My first time in a Marriott! It was a pretty good experience. Nothing to write home about, but for a good night's sleep during a long road trip? Gets the job done.The staff is super nice. We had to park far away because I had a big U-Haul truck, and someone actually came around to pick us up and drive us to the hotel! What a nice service. It was definitely appreciated after driving 14 hours! We'd asked for a single king, but the room they gave us was two twins/queens, so we had to get that sorted out. Nothing too bad. The room was clean, and it didn't smell. There was an ice machine close to our room, and the elevators go up/down quickly. Hallways were also clean, no smell. The food at the lounge was decent too. We had the Marriott burger and a Caesar salad. Burger was delicious (for hotel food), but the Caesar salad was mediocre. I think it was like $11 for the salad and at least another $10 for grilled chicken. IMO, it was DEFINITELY not $10+ worth of chicken. We also had breakfast at 2river Grille. I ordered the Salmon Hash, which was wayyyy too salty. My bf ordered the usual eggs/bacon/toast, and he had no problems. Like many other reviewers, I was disappointed in the $15 wifi charge!! Obviously, we did not use.Overall, it was a good stay. Everyone was kind and welcoming, and the hotel is fancy and clean. Oh, but to get the hotel you have to go up this really windy, hilly road. It was hard on the U-Haul and was kind of dangerous, ha!For an airport hotel, very nice.  Staff is friendly, hotel has all the bells and whistles you need (Starbucks inside, fitness center, pool, restaurant, etc), rooms are clean and comfortable, bed is comfortable, lots of nice pillows, bathroom is decent, killer showerhead and great water pressure, towels that aren't like sandpaper, good breakfast, nice flat screen LG in front of the bed to zone out to, and a carpet you can walk on without shoes with peace of mind.  Luckily, I have a corporate rate that includes wireless and breakfast...otherwise I would say that the $14.95 a day for wireless is highway robbery.  It is too commonplace to be charging that much for wireless these days.Nothing around here but it's an airport hotel, that is to be expected.  You'd probably want to stay IN Nashville if you want bars and restaurants...overall, a good value and a nice stay.The only downside to this hotel is that there are no restaurants/bars/fun within walking distance.  Which is particularly disheartening when you do not have a rental car.  My bad.But.... here comes the good stuff!Front Desk: awesome, smiling, courteous, quick.  no problems.  just what you want.Manager: visible, friendly without being creepy, good conversationalist when sharing the elevatorConcierge/Bell Hop: again, nothing but smiles and hellos. all genuine.  after flying all morning sincere smiles make it all better.Room: loved it. First of all if you've got Bath and Body Works Aromatherapy bathroom stuff... That's a A+ in my book.  Hairdryer was full size! Water pressure in the shower was right on for this long hair and the bathroom was spickinspanclean. The bed was uber comfortable with so many pillows, I wish i could of had a pillow fight. Desk with adjustable comfortable chair made my working time comfortable, lights were in the right places, windows had easy to use curtains, wake up call service was automated easy and accurate.  Definitely would stay here again.Restaurant: Since I was sans car I ate here and had their Crab Bisque and a small caesar salad.  It was fantastic.  the soup was soup-er creamy (you can call me a dork if you want). Service was prompt, courteous and happy. charge it to my room? why not. maybe eating at the hotel isn't such a bad gig.Conference Center: stellar. really. i've dealt with crap conference centers before.  Ladies bathrooms are high class and immaculate! Conference rooms have multiple set up options, good sound system, and staff more than willing to help move tables around.  Coffee was always hot and filled for attendees.  And that extra ""bubble room"" that you'd use for a wedding reception was perfect for our breakfast, lunch and dinner hors'd ouvres.  The cash bar-tenders did a fantastic job as well.We love this hotel.  Great place to stay when you have an early flight.  Shuttle runs on the hour and on the half hour.","Pretty decent airport.  Not too big with a good number of flights out.  They have redone the bathrooms and some of the terminals so it is looking nicer.  They just need to update the restaurants, the one's that are there now are pretty sub par.A nice airport to travel through but don't spend too much time here.  Not too much to do.About average for a Marriott ap property. Restaurants here were decent, nice bar area. Omelete was a little undercooked but the buffet overall was good.  I would stay here again as the rooms are comfortable and reasonably well appointed.  Good value for the money.This is a great place. Recenly remodeled with a very nice sports bar. The rooms are very clean and modern. The staff is wonderful!!!Internet - $16.95 a day if you want it in your room.  And the free internet in the lobby feels like dial-up.  Not impressed....  I'm here for 24 hours and I will not stay here again.I really liked this hotel. It's very close to the airport but you can't tell because it's designed in a way to block out lots of the airport noise.The lobby is pretty and modern, and the staff are very nice; I didn't notice anything bad about it. The rooms are nonsmoking so I'm not sure why another commenter said it smelled like cigarette smoke.The rooms kind of have a weird layout, but they're refurbished and pretty, and the housekeeping staff are very accommodating of your needs.Very nice pool, relaxing, with nice amenities. Downside: no free wi-fi! Even the less-than-great Holiday Inn in Knoxville had free wifi....For an airport hotel, this Marriott is fantastic. I have been to private events here as well as a hotel guest. Friendly front desk staff and the location is great. Not far from downtown and the hotel van will take you.I had no official intentions on staying, but my flight cancelled and they were the only local hotel that was available; blessing in disguise. Check in process was quick and painless. I made the reservation over the phone, shuttled over, and checked in and was in bed no more than 15 minutes after arriving! While it was pricey and out of budget, for the stay, it seemed fair. WiFi is paid, which could do without having to pay for. Bed and pillows were nice and comfy and the room was so dark it was easy to fall asleep. Four for five because it seemed a little ""nickel and dime"" like to not throw in breakfast or charge for WiFi.For an airport hotel (though not on-site at the airport), it's good.  Rooms are fine.  Decent sized gym.  Friendly employees.  Very good restaurant and a FANTASTIC morning breakfast including made-to-order omelettes.love this airport and all the music related decorVery nice hotel for company meetings.Hotel is pretty good.  The beds are super comfortable and the staff are really nice.  The maintenance guy was one of the nicest employees...he greeted me like we were friends and he was just walking down the hall.  Then I heard him talking to others in the hotel the same way.  I thought it was great.  I was there for a conference and I am not a fan of their banquet food...eggs were runny and the selection was not great (but it was a banquet breakfast buffet...so hey what can you expect).  They have four treadmills so there was not a wait to get on them in the morning which is a plus.First time at this Marriott.  Just what I expected, updated, fresh, comfortable bed.Issues were room smelled like smoke at check-in; checked outside deck which was loaded with empty beer cans and cigarette butts; hotel took $20 off my room for the 2 nights we were there;  Room was on ground floor, came back that night to find lady bugs all over the ceiling, hotel did nothing. Breakfast buffet was $14.95; Starbuck's in lobby for coffee which also made beverages expensive. Laundry room and workout room were excellent. Location was also a plusGood for a biz traveler working thier way through town. The lobby is gorgeous and the staff very attentive and pleasant. It is away from any restaurants or nightlife, so you will need to travel for those things. The bar area inside the hotel is tiny. I stopped by for my usual drink and dinner while sitting at the bar only to find no space anywhere. Disappointing, so I hoofed it back to my room and ordered room service. Breakfast buffet in the morning is very well done and the restaurant area is very large.....maybe take some restaurant space and convert it to bar space? The concierge lounge is large, on a high floor and had nice service.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-nashville-downtown-hotel-nashville,Sheraton Nashville Downtown Hotel,2.5,$$$,173,"Nice hotel in the downtown area. Not far from where the Titans play. Large lobby area and nicely decorated. There's a bar/restaurant right in the lobby. The food and service there was very good. The waitress was very attentive without being overbearing. Food was delicious, especially dessert. The rooms are nice and clean. Uniquely decorated with nice pictures on shelves above the bed. Nicely designed as far as convenient outlets and USB ports. Also a free bottle of water in the room.  Starbucks coffee as the complementary coffee the room. The desk in the room is nicely designed as well for work. Three outlets and two USB ports right on the desktop.The front door staff here were super polite and friendly and I was immediately greeted upon arriving for check in. Not too far from restaurants and bars as well.I would definitely say here again when I'm in the area.Not sure why the reviews are so bad. Does the hotel need a little improvement?  Yes...doesn't everyone?  I was here for a business meeting that occurred at the hotel.  Our flight came in at about 10am and check in was at 3.  They checked the group of us in at arrival time. I found the room very clean. The hotel itself was also very clean. Everyone I can in contact with was very nice.  From the front staff to the cleaning staff.  I wouldn't mind staying here again if I visit Nashville.I opted to stay at this property during my recent visit to see family in Nashville mostly due to recent experience with Sheraton hotels and being a Starwood Preferred member. The location fit our needs perfectly. A short Uber away from Broadway and other entertainment, close to the interstate if you're driving, and close enough to all parts of town. May not be ideal for walking long distances, especially during the winter. As others have mentioned, it is an up hill trek if you're walking back from the bars. The valet parking was a little pricey, but necessary due to the wife's knee injury.The interior was nice and looked as though it was recently renovated. It is obviously an older property, but clean and updated. Our room was large, clean, and had new-ish furniture and TV. Clean with no issues. No real view to speak of...mostly of the office building across the street. The only issue we had was due to the location of the room. We were on the 5th floor facing the open hall to the lobby. If you're staying on a weekend, chances are someone is going to come back to the hotel drunk and yelling at 3 am. Not ideal if you have a 5 am flight the next morning. The door had a fairly large space open under it, which allowed for a lot of the lobby noise to penetrate the room. If the door had been better soundproofed, our stay would have been great.The staff was very friendly and helpful, overall. The valets were great with my wife, who had recently hurt her knee and was moving pretty slowly. The bar/restaurant staff had some good recommendation and made a good drink. We arrived late, so ate our first meal at the bar. The burger was pretty good, much better than most hotel burgers I've had.I've stayed at this property about half a dozen times while working in Nashville, On this visit, the desk staff, Nicole in particular, went above and beyond. From check in to several requests I had, she was stellar, friendly, efficient and went out of her way to assist me, even to the point of having the housekeeping staff and general manager search for a computer cable I'd forgotten. The rest of the desk staff was also helpful and a pleasure to deal with. Will be commending them to the SPG. I would have given 4 stars, but the restaurant's breakfast service was again underwhelming in food selection and pricing, although the staff is consistently nice. Go to the corner market next door - they do a very nice breakfast very economically. The bar is like the restaurant, although the drink selection is quite good, the menu (restaurant not open for dinner) is limited, highly priced and unimpressive. Again, the saving grace is the staff, who are all very nice.I have stayed at this property for many years and have always enjoyed the charm and memories I made here. With the management and crew there now, I know this property will continue to be a favorite and a mainstay for Nashville.  I can't say enough about how wonderful this property is. Thanks you Doug!I'm a Starwood preferred member so that swayed my decision to stay here versus the numerous other hotels of Nashville. Uhm, I have no idea what I paid for besides having a bed to sleep in. Seriously, the Sheraton Grand in Sacramento is nicer than this. Oh yeah, and cheaper.I appreciate that they are going green so I could skip the cleaning of my room. I'm not a messy person so I was fine with that. The bar was decent and the people of Nashville are friendly so that's a perk. I was traveling alone for the Rock'n Roll Nashville (half) Marathon in April. I stayed for four days because I wanted to really get a feel for the city. The bar was solid. I had a difficult time getting someone to pick up when I tired to order room service. Minus a two stars for that because let's face it - I like to eat. It also took what felt like an eternity to get my food. A burger. Smh. The hotel staff is good at their job - thanks for being friendly. But really, I probably could have stayed elsewhere and been just fine.So disappointed! The rooms are beautiful and the amenities are great - wifi, free printing, Starbucks. HOWEVER on a Wednesday night there was loud partying taking place down in the lobby past 3AM and NO ONE FROM THE HOTEL WOULD ANSWER THE PHONE! Too bad. I come to Nashville for work monthly and sadly won't be staying here again despite the beautiful renovation. Clean up the drunkards and loud mouths in the lobby! Or at least have someone from guest services answer the phone and pretend to care about my legitimate concerns!!! Or maybe better doors? Something must change.I was worried about this place after booking on Travelocity and then reading Yelp reviews. Well, Yelp was right! Older hotel, very outdated. We didn't have any mold issues but my boyfriend and I were very disappointed. Let me be clear, this hotel is doable. It did not ruin our trip because we were out and about the whole hotel time; however, there are some things I wish I would have known prior to booking.First off, this hotel is ""downtown"" but it's in the business downtown area. Not where all of the bars and live music are. If you're here for a conference, it's a perfect location. If you're here to party and hear live music, it's quite a walk. It was a few more blocks away than where it claims to be and not only a few blocks but ALL UP HILL BACK TO THE HOTEL! Mind you, my bf and I are runners but sheesh!  Walking up a massive hill, block after block when you thought you booked a hotel in the center of it all is annoying.Another annoying factor, the SHADY price traps. Parking is upwards of $25 a day when parking across the street at the meters is free after 6pm. Another shady trap? $15 per day for wifi. What a joke.  Here's my favorite: as I was getting ready (taking my sweet time) my bf wondered downstairs to check out the breakfast and coffee in the lobby. Coffee was free, but the CUP was $2.50! Are you joking?Another tip: we stayed here 5 days/4 nights and each morning housekeeping showed up before 9am! Good Morning?  Mind you we were also adjusting from California time.This resulted in us denying any housekeeping services which was fine because we're not slobs but we kept running out of towels.  No biggie, I tried to call the front desk to ask for some, oh wait, NO DIAL TONE! This was also quite annoying when we had an eventful day and wanted to relax and order room service. Not! No dial tone, no food for us. We walk downstairs, they have no food to order but told us we could ""order a pizza or something from nearby.""  We ask for local suggestions, nope!  No suggestions for you either.  Really?  Thank god for google.If you are staying here with some friends and saving some cash this is a great hotel. But when your planning to stay at a nicer hotel to enjoy the amenities and want to be in the heart of what Nashville is known for, stay at the Hilton.This Sheraton is still going through renovation, so don't stay here if you don't like seeing an old hotel transform into something more modern. The posters who gave negative remarks for that are just ridiculous. The Sheraton even served champagne in the lobby to say ""sorry for the mess"" -- preferably they should lower the prices temporarily to show people what is in store. Been coming here for years and the staff are amazing and my room is clean and spacious with fun design.OK large hotel. Some issues. Very nice lobby bar and very friendly staff. Room was typical Sheraton, good bed, trpical shower, TV, desk, etc. We like the location--but it's a long walk to Broadway on a hot day. So, we wound up taking a cab or Uber a lot. Shuttle was nice when available. Our main issue is that even after the recent remodel, the A/C never got below 75. Hotels need to be able to get every room to 70 degrees in hot summer. Our rate was bit too high this trip, $340 a night, last year was $220. We've stayed here twice and will try the very nice looking Omni Hotel next time to be closer to the action on Broadway. I would only stay here again if the rate was much lower. Pros: - Location- Staff was friendly, especially front desk- Lobby Bar was fun and good serviceCons:- Not that close to Broadway music area, long walk if hot out- A/C was not working right in room- We needed to borrow a DVD player and they said they did not have any... but with conferences there--I think they do and just did not want to offer us one- Rate was high for what you getOK for Business, Friends, family, etc.This is a world class first rate hotel. Exceptional convenience,  service, and accommodations.  We'll worth the money! The bed was so comfortable. My favorite place to stay in Nashville.I really like the food they have, the bar lounge is really nice. They have a really good wine selection The movie selection is amazing, I mean there's things that are still playing at the theaters and the location is really nice because you can walk to all the fun on Broadway Street and you can also call a shuttle and they will go pick you up wherever you are.My fiance and I stayed in the Downtown Sheraton in Nashville, TN this weekend. The parking garage is a bit tight and the cost is about $30 per vehicle to self park. The hotel was undergoing some remodeling of the interior but it seemed to be concentrated around the main lobby area. The room was clean and the comfortable. I really liked the bathroom setup; the electrical outlet/light switch had a small nightlight in it and the option to have the bathroom lights as dim or fully lit. The shower had plenty of hot water and the breakfast buffet the next morning was much larger than I've had at other, more expensive hotels. The food tasted great! I'd stay there again, but I might park on the street somewhere.Bell boy- black gentlemen was really rood! He told us he had a shuttle and he'd be here in 10. It's been 45min. We asked again and he gave me a dirty look. Nice class bell boy!OK, I'm going to admit that price is one of the biggest factors that influences my ratings of hotels.  My husband and I didn't want to chance not finding a room at all in Nashville (based on our previous week's experience trying to find a hotel in the suburbs of this city) so we booked a night at this Sheraton the night before we arrived.  Since it was the night before, we clearly got a fantastic deal on a room that the hotel couldn't rent to anyone else (because of blocks or whatever) and really enjoyed our experience here.  But, let me say again: price is a big factor in my happiness about this place.On Kayak, we booked this place for $169.  That's amazing considering other reviewers paid WELL over $350/night and I just saw rooms on this hotel's website for the last weekend in June are going for $409/night (two queen beds).  WOAH what a steal we got.  The hotel itself has clearly been renovated recently and it shows.  The lobby is new, chic, modern, and has a lot of local touches like sheet music, pictures of country artists, etc. all around that make it feel like Nashville.  Hotel valet was about $25 night, which isn't bad and includes unlimited in/out once you pay.  The restaurant/bar is nice, new, modern and pretty full each evening which makes for good ambiance.  There's TVs, a full bar, full kitchen with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Rooms offer room service, too, which is a nice plus if you don't feel like going downstairs.  The second floor restaurant serves full meals in a nice, slightly classy setting (for dinner) and that's where the breakfast buffet is if that's your fancy.There's a small, weird pool and no spa, so skip that area if you're looking for a Jacuzzi.  It was a nice place to swim for a bit but it wasn't super nice or anything to look at so we went in for a dip and left pretty quickly.  The workout room next door was small but did the trick so that's available if you need it.  The rooms were really nice.  Our king room was clearly recently remodeled, a lot of quirky local touches like old-fashioned lamps, photos of Nashville and country album covers, and a pillow shaped like a cassette tape on a blue leather lounge chair.  The bed was incredibly comfortable and boasted at least 8 pillows (which I LOVE).  The dresser/desk was long and sleek, had a nice LCD flatscreen TV and HD TV channels (thanks for springing for that, Sheraton).  The bathroom was small but comfortable and had a lot of shampoo and lotion for your use.  Lots of towels, too.The hotel advertised paid wifi in the rooms but ours was free so AWESOME.  Another little thing that just really, really impresses me and makes me super happy.  Thanks for not charging me $12.95 a day for something that is a given in this new, modern age.I don't know if I would have been as happy as I was with this place if it had cost twice as much, but I was really impressed for how much we paid.  It's definitely worth $150-$200 a night, but it's not really in close proximity to all of the bars on Broadway or even the night spots in Midtown or East Nashville.  It's really only across from the Capitol Building, which is cool, but not much of a sight for more than an hour or two.  Two blocks away there's a Nashville B-Cycle (bike) rental location, so valet your car and go grab one of those bikes for 60 minutes and you can ride all over town and to the restaurants and bars you want to go to.I have to start out this review with a disclaimer, during my stay the hotel was in the middle of a massive renovation, however I was lucky enough to get one of the recently renovated rooms for my stay.When I first arrived I discovered that parking was 38.50/day, way overpriced especially considering the quality of the garage. It was tiny and also under renovation/repair. I personally think a more acceptable price would have been closer to $20/day however that is beside the point.When I first entered the hotel I noticed the bright white interior, in fact I almost felt like I entered a Miami boutique hotel. The new lobby is a very nice touch, complete with a gift shop and a sunken bar on the other side. Check in was easy and the staff was friendly. Once I received my key I headed to the elevators and discovered that the lobby was open to all 27 floors. During my trip to the 17th floor I noticed that the hallway balcony's overlooking the lobby seemed to be awaiting some additional surfacing as part of the renovation. They didn't look bad, just bare, I can only imagine how much better they will look when completed.Once I arrived at my room I noticed that the room itself continued the bright white theme from the downstairs lobby. The room was chic without being overly tacky. The subtle white with the local prints placed above the bed was a great touch and made for a very nice room. The bed itself was comfortable and the room was spacious. The bathroom was nice, yet not too big. Overall the stay here was a good one.Now what didn't I like about this hotel, the pillows were awful and the location wasn't the best. While the hotel is downtown it's on the far end and probably one of the hotels located the furthest from Broadway. And like I said earlier the garage seemed like it too could use some renovation work, especially for the price.Overall this will probably be a great hotel once the renovations are complete, however for those visiting Nashville for the Broadway bars I think there are other options that would be better suited. This would be  great hotel for the business traveler or someone wanting to be close to downtown, yet not right next door to the bars.Despite remodeling, this is 3.5 stars in my book. Common areas, including lobby and bar, are pretty tasteful. Rooms are good sized, clean, decor is adequate. Service is friendly, as everywhere in Nashville. Few things I didn't like: too noisy in the room, isolation can be better. A/C was noisy too. The value is dubious. For $220 plus all taxes and fees I expect more in Nashville.Had to call the Nashville police after front desk manager Robert Dooley would not help after United states army females where harassed by parking attendees, his response was they technically don't work for hotel. I feel our troops deserve more respect and should command a better response from individuals in power when there just visiting family on leave in this instance.This hotel was fine, but I thought it was overpriced.  At $775 (with all those taxes / misc charges that you can't avoid.... three of them) for a basic room for two nights, I was a little disappointed.The rooms looked cool.  Well appointed with art and decor.  Very chic.The staff at the front desk were friendly and knowledgeable.Our bed skirt had stains on it.  It wasn't clear who could use the shuttle and whether it was free.  It's not an ideal location to bustling Broadway in bad weather (ice and rain).  I wouldn't recommend it for a party group that plans on going out unless you want to take cabs to go party.Kind, courteous staff will go out of their way to make your stay memorable. The bar has great drinks, the beds are comfortable and the hotel is beautiful.","Second stay here. They're awesome.  DO take advantage of the free shuttle downtown. Unfortunately, they will not pick you up but they will drop you wherever within a 5 minute radius.  Bell desk and valet on point.  They called me Mam and I LOVED it!!  Our bill was all messed up but they promptly fixed it after I called in. It's been remodeled since I last stayed in 2013.  Great location and clean rooms. I'm a fan!Arrived at hotel prior to checkin time and room was already available.Nice comfortable room with all the ammenities.  The hotel is an easy 10 min walk to Broadway (or you can take the free hotel shuttle). All hallways open to the atrium so there is no echo of hallway noise. The lounge on the 1st floor was nice to retreat to after a day on Broadway. The breakfast buffet is a little pricey but was still good. My only complaint is that the windows are paper thin. We were on the 21st floor and can still hear street construction 3 blocks away. Prob more quiet than if we were at a hotel close to Broadway. Yes we would stay here again.After checking into this hotel for my second week, I feel as if this is an ala-carte experience at best.  Everything that I inquire about has an up-charge.  Lounge access, breakfast, parking, etc.  why am I even paying an exorbitant nightly rate if it doesn't include anything that I need?  I am a Lifetime Gold Starwood member, and this is probably the shoddiest customer service that I have experienced at an SPG hotel in many years of business travel.  I think that I will move my business down to the Hilton or Marriott where I will be appreciated for my loyalty.When I booked this hotel room I thought I was getting a fantastic deal on a great room in a convenient location in Nashville. Upon arrival I was informed that they can change my two bed to a king bed which is perfect, when I finally got to my room after a number of road bumps in the check-in process (that resulted in me feeling like I was not a desired guest and my bank putting a temporary block on my debit card), the room was not actually changed to a king. The room was adequately clean and the view was nice from the 12th floor. The beds were hard, for the price of the rooms I was expecting a much more luxurious bed to sleep in. There was random hair stuck to the top of the comforter but the rest of the bedding was clean. Out of all the USB outlets I could find in the room, only one of them worked. The coffee maker had two cups but only one pod of regular coffee and one of decaf, a double occupancy room should have two pods of each. There was a lack of information in the room regarding hotel amenities, the room service menu was the only information to be found. I was expecting a booklet with information including the restaurant/bar menu with hours and other typical hotel information.The room was paid in full in advance, and as expected at check-in they ask for a credit card to put on file for incidentals, they did not mention that they would be putting a $50 hold on funds. This may have been an oversight but I feel this is information you should be required to tell someone when asking for their credit card. They also failed to mention until checkout that $10 of the ""deposit"" would be kept for a hotel ""facility"" fee. For the price of the room, there should not be additional fees like this and everything should be included in the price of the room. I am sure the facility fee is mentioned in small print on the website but it should also be verbally communicated to customers at check-in as well.I am not impressed with the value I got for the price I paid, the service was lackluster. I feel like I would have gotten better service at a Motel 6. Would not book this hotel again.Totally renovated  the Sheraton is better than ever with a new contemporary look and feel.The service at the bar and restaurant is just as good as I remember and the staff are all very welcoming.A great deal on the weekends too and close to everything Nashville has to offer!I booked a double room in advance via the Sheraton website and paid in full at the time of the booking. I called ahead of time to check on a $25 club level upgrade they mentioned in the email, but apparently I was a day late and wasn't able to get the upgrade at that time. There was no mention of this on the booking receipt that I noticed --just said it was available.After what should have been an 8 hour drive, but turned into a 12 hour drive with multiple stops and an emergency room visit, we made it to Nashville. Upon arrival we were exhausted and ready to relax for a bit. Courtney happily (this girl must love her job...it shows!) checked us in in under 5 minutes. When I inquired about an upgraded room, she did so without any hesitation whatsoever. She also gave us a couple recommendations for BBQ. We ended up at Martin's BBQ Joint per her suggestion and it did not disappoint. We actually later saw her walking down the street leaving for the day, and although off duty, she smiled and waved to us. The first room I booked had a bathroom door that didn't lock, but otherwise was nice. It was clean, comfy and had a great view of the skyline from the 22nd floor! I say ""first"" room because we ended up in a second room, which was in no part due to the hotel itself.At 2:00 a.m. on our first evening, I couldn't sleep due to a loud friend that likes to talk when others like to sleep, and another whom couldn't control his snoring ;) I stumbled downstairs to the front desk and was greeted by Fred and Markeith. I want to first say that I put their names in my phone so I could write this review, because their service was so spot-on that it did not go unnoticed. I rattled off my story to them and we all had a few laughs and then they proceeded to fix a problem that wasn't theirs to HAVE to fix; but they did. These are the kind of people ALL service establishments need to hire, and keep, because it speaks directly to the establishment itself. You can encounter minor problems like a bathroom door that doesn't lock, or a parking garage that is too expensive etc. and not even bat an eye because of the people that work there and make you forget about it by how kind they are. I hope they read this, because I want to personally thank these two - again - for their kindness during a moment where it felt like, to me, that everything that could go wrong, was in fact going wrong.The second room had a bathroom door that was tough to close and no exhaust fan. No biggie, but wanted to throw it out there.The lobby and room decor were clean and modern. Not my style as it's so modern, however it was done well, regardless of my personal tastes.Parking is expensive. The hotel doesn't offer parking but there is a garage that they work with that offers it for about $32 a day with in and out privileges. The hotel doesn't discount it because they don't own the garage, however they can give you in and out access on your room keycard.The hotel is walking distance from Broadway. It's not around-the-corner-close, but you can walk there in 10-15 minutes and for me that was perfect. I didn't want to be in the heart of the District anyway, and preferred this location because it was quiet, but nearby. We saw a show last night at the new Ascend Amphitheater and walked back to the hotel afterwards; took about 25 minutes. If I'm ever in Nashville again, I will, without a doubt, stay here. You should too!This meets or exceeds all the expectations of a hotel in its class, and it is my first choice for hotels in Nashville. The Sheraton Nashville Downtown was renovated recently, and is located in a great area that is walkable to several nightlife areas (not to mention any downtown office). Rates are reasonable, and the lobby bar has some great local/regional selections for craft beer. I travel to Nashville weekly and stay here as often as the hotel has rooms available (it sells out quickly).CAN'T BE TRUSTED WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION. The hotel was nice, but they overcharged my credit card, which is an absolute stopper.   We left before the 11am departure, and received a bill with that time on it, which we paid in full. When we checked our credit card statement at the end of the month, we noticed they overcharged. I called several times, and was passed along with vague and inconsistent answers, and hung up on. I had to keep calling and asking for managers, and finally got a copy of the bill they were looking at.  It was for a 3:07pm check out and in addition to our original bill they added an item we did not get or authorize.  BEWAREHorrible experience: I booked the Sheraton for a nice holiday weekend away with my new husband. Knowing that we would not arrive until late, I called ahead to request a king bed. Unfortunately, when checking in, we were informed that zero king rooms were available, and all that was left were rooms with two doubles. I did not book a four star hotel for a vacation to sleep separately from my husband. Additionally, nothing else was offered as compensation, and much of the lobby was off limits and in poor condition due to some sort of construction, of which we were not notified at booking. Will not return.The hotel is updated &amp; modern.  Rooms are comfy &amp; posh, but the bathroom was shoddy (bathtub clogged, toilet seat was loose).  They are a dog-friendly hotel, but there is a $75 dog fee (yikes)!As I drove up to check in, the valet came up to assist me.  They notified me that only valet parking was available, so I paid the enormous fee for the privileged of leaving my car in their hands.  The atrium is open and you can look up and see all the rooms, kind of like an embassy suite.  My room was nicely decorated and I had a nice view of the state capitol.  Having no idea of where to wander in Nashville, the front desk offered me good advice to walk down to Broadway.  As far as big city hotels, I was happy with the quality and service of the place.  Location wise, I may have reserved a room nearer Broadway, but it wasn't too bad of a hike.  Also, a good hike is the sports arena and the Country Music Hall of Fame.I booked this hotel via a 3rd party site for two nights. It was rated a 4 star hotel. This hotel is a 3.5 star at the very best. Parking is $30 a day. If you are a 4.5 or 5 star hotel, this is normal. For a Sheraton, no thanks. I am a SPG member so I was very disappointed with my stay. The water pressure was incredibly weak and would randomly shut off for a couple of seconds at a time. The beds are comfy and the staff was very helpful.  I won't recommend this hotel and hopefully won't have to stay again.In spite of the mediocre rating, my wife and I decided to stay here when we visited Nashville for a 3 day weekend getaway. From the moment we arrived to the day we left, everything was excellent. The door men are Johnny on the spot, the hotel bar staff are straight up stellar, and the room was clean and well kept. 5 minute walk to Broadway bars, shuttle service if you're not in to walking although the shuttle is limited to about a 1.5 mile radius. The drinks at the bar are fantastic, and the food is on par with the price. We will definitely be looking to book here again on our next visit.I'm not surprised this hotel gets such terrible reviews. I had booked a trip for MDW and called the other day to confirm that they have fridges in the rooms, as I am a nursing mother. The response from the front desk was very curt: ""We don't have fridges in the room. We have a few available for medical reasons."" I said ""I am nursing and need to store milk for my infant so can I reserve one?"" Woman said ""You can ask for one when you check in...but there are no guarantees."" No guarantees? So if I were a diabetic with insulin, I wouldn't be guaranteed a fridge? Or does my breastfeeding not constitute a ""good"" reason to set aside a fridge. Either way, the policy makes no sense (both for me, or those with ""actual"" medical conditions) and the delivery was rude, inflexible and unaccommodating.We called again the next day to speak with a manager. The woman who answered rudely said ""well, I am the front of the house manager."" We explained the predicament to her and the response was the same - curt, snotty and unaccommodating. We cancelled our reservations, and made new one at The Homewood Suites - an equally well-located hotel WITH fridges in the rooms and a nice customer experience to boot.Not only was my experience ""bad"", but I left feeling discriminated against for being a nursing mom. I really hope, for the sake of the Starwood Hotels that Sheraton Nashville is not a reflection of their business practices and other establishments. They've certainly lost this customer.Remodeled, yes. Better, no. Heat blowing cold air. Parking garage ticket machine non functional. No clean sheets when asking to not be included in the green option. TV constantly turning off or resetting itself to channel 0. Shower blasting water at only one speed, dial broken. Room key constantly reset. Elevator canceling room selection in mid travel. Room semi-clean. Dirty glasses left from previous guest.They have a lot to work through.Good location but fees, fees, fees! Parking fee, valet fee, bell boy fee (and you have to use if you want a cart), facility fee.This hotel was superb! I stayed there in early November 2014 (during CMAs week) and had no complaints. The renovation has definitely done them well. Aesthetically the hotel looks crisp, clean &amp; modern. When I checked it, in was quick and easy. Throughout my stay the staff was friendly and aimed to please. I loved the bar in the lobby and the hotel's proximity to downtown. Theres not much more you can want in a hotel. I'd definitely stay there again.Beautifully remodeled hotel with stylish rooms and comfortable beds.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Great location.I travel a lot for both work and pleasure and have never had an experience as bad as this.I was in town the  previous week for a conference at the Opryland hotel and my wife came out to join me for what we hoped would be a relaxing weekend in Nashville. We booked the Club VIP experience which included access to the lounge on floor 24 as well as WiFi for $339/night.After checking into our room on floor 22, we quickly discovered a number of issues. Below are the problems encountered on our stay.1 - The WiFi code they provided didn't work. We called the front desk and they said it was a known issue and that we should just agree to the room charge of $15/day and that they'd later remove the fee2 - For lounge access, you are supposed to enter your key in a special slot and then press floor 24. However, the card reader in 3 of the 4 elevators was out of service so it was next to impossible to get to the lounge. I reported the issue on Saturday and it wasn't resolved as of the time we left on Tuesday, though they did acknowledge that they were aware of the issue. The front desk manager also said she would remove the VIP charge from my reservation though I'd still be free to use the lounge due to the inconvenience.3 - The ice machines on floors 20, 21 and 22 were all out of service. The front desk was kind enough to remind me that there was cold water available on floor 24 in the lounge, however as I previously mentioned the elevators were broken. 4 - The old school elevators, while charming, are very loud. I had a hard time sleeping as every few minutes you'd hear a loud grinding noise when the cables started pulling the cars.5 - The doors don't close on their own. This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine, however when you leave your room the doors close but don't latch. You have to remember to latch on your own or else you will leave your room unlocked.6 - Checkout went about like I feared. Not only did they have no record of the  VIP access refund, they also had charged me ~60 for Internet usage. After a lengthy debate with the woman at the front desk, they removed the fees however I was not successful in obtaining the partial refund that I was previously promised.Overall, a horrible experience. After spending some time in Nashville I can assure you that there are many superior choices, especially at 300+ per night.The bar staff was very friendly. They hooked it up with free vitamin water before going to bed. Gave us awesome food recommendations and best bars in the city.","This hotel is currently going through a renovation. I can tell you this place is fabulous! The decor has a touch of the rustic combined with a trendy contemporary flare. I am enjoying the crisp clean feel, with a touch of the traditional ""Nashville history"" paying tribute to the legends in the decor. Kudos to the decorating team that pulled off this collaboration of modern meets ""ole Nashville""My boyfriend and I stayed here. We got a decent deal for Sheraton on Priceline however Nashville in general seems to be extremely expensive where hotels are concerned. The room was beautiful and had a really nice view of the capital. The lobby bar as well as the lobby itself was lovely. Nicely decorated. We had quite a bit of a wait to get checked in because the way the line worked was very disorganized with people who just arrived being helped before people who'd been there awhile. I'm giving this place 4 stars due to check in delays and because for $200+ a night I expect the bathroom to be impeccably clean and it wasn't.Honestly - I never take the time to write reviews.  This stay several weeks ago was one of the best trips I've had and a lot had to do with how great the hotel and location was.  The staff - including Greg the manager was very accommodating in helping my friend and I with plans and means of getting to areas.  He have the best advice for what to do at certain times around the city.  Kristi the bartender  made all of our drinks- best tequila sunrise - bloody Mary's I've ever had.  The Sheraton nailed it for our experience as well as everyone that worked thereI recently stayed here again with my wife, and it appears as though the hotel is done or near done with their renovations.  We had a suite just off from the elevators, which was a concern until I closed the door...never heard any noise from the hallway or the elevators, which is what I had expected.The same compliments/gripes are still valid...prices for wine/bar drinks, good attitude of the staff etc. I didn't have a car this time around, so no valet, but everything went smoothly and we were happy.  This will be my go to hotel in the downtown Nashville area.I am a fan because I see potential.  Yes they are going through major renovations.  You will hear large drill sounds at 10:30 AM, You will not go through a beautiful lobby and there is no hotel bar...However, once the renovations are complete all you complainers will take back all those negative things you said.  I loved the decor in the rooms and the beds were rather comfortable.As others have said, the only positive to this hotel is the valets!  They were always quick, helpful and friendly. Really not sure why they are so much better than the other staff. An association I belong to booked this hotel. The meeting spaces were ok except the noise level coming from other rooms totally disrupted our meetings several times. The wait staff was poor to fair in their service. Food was fair. The doors to the conference rooms had big gaps under them and between them, which contributed to, if not caused the noise issues. We understand they recently completed a renovation. We thought they were not done. We even asked one of the employees who came up to our room to repair something that wasn't working, ""when are they going to finish"". He said they are done. Seriously, it is white on white on white. The only redeeming thing in the hotel is the wood stair case.  They obviously removed a finish from the concrete barriers to the open space in the center (holes clearly visible and they didn't even fill them in before painting.) The hotel appears to be trying to be trendy, but this is a big swing and a miss.  I cannot believe what the rates are for this hotel. I would say its about a $75-100 a night hotel. If you are paying more, you over paid.  I read someone on here paid $360 a night. I would have been livid.  On a scale of five stars (type of hotel), this hotel is a two star. Anyone stating this is a 4 star hotel has never stayed here or been inside!Our room had a funny smell that remained all week. Almost a mildewy smell (like a dirty mop), although we saw no signs of mildew on the walls. It made me think its in their vents and it was worse with the air running. The bath room floor and tub was filthy and had not been cleaned. It also wasn't cleaned the whole week we stayed!  Seriously the floor is maybe 5ft square, how hard is it to take a swiffer wet jet to it?The final straw for us was the cleaning, or lack of. For at least three of the days the maids didn't show up until after 5pm, when we were back in the room. At that point we told them never mind.  The last day they showed up at 9 am to clean!  Our one day to sleep in. Seriously are you trying to push your guests out???When I made a reservation, I booked a king bed. When we checked in he told us they only had two doubles.  That seemed odd for checking in Monday night (since most hotels aren't busy then and the conference started Wednesday!)  We found out that was a lie. A friend of mine who attended the conference booked two doubles and was given a king, and also told they only had kings.    I recommend going to another hotel!We stayed only one night but it was great! Things we liked: checked in quickly, swam in the big pool for a bit, ordered room service, which was very tasty!, room was pretty clean and AC was cold.  I enjoyed the wine, the food, the views from the 23rd floor, and the comfy beds!!I'd love to see a more formal communication for guest regarding hotel amenities, hours of operation for the on-site bars/restaurants, etc.  Parking could be more clear as you drive up also.  But, we had a great evening altogether.  Nicely renovated.I'm a huge starwood fan and always stay at their hotels. Sheraton did not disappoint. The lounge was fun and it has a pool table. The food and drinks were just ok, but we had fun. The room was nice, clean and roomy. We had a good view downtown and club access. Valet was only a few bucks more than self park so we went with valet. Just call 5 to 10 minutes before you head down and they will have your car waiting. I was very happy with my stay and the location was great. I recommend and will stay again if I'm back on Nashville.My husband and I stayed here last night while in town for a show. The hotel itself is attractive and clean - the construction mentioned in previous reviews is either over or on hold, we saw no sign of it. Our room was modernly decorated, clean and comfortable. We didn't make use of any extra amenities but the staff was friendly whenever we dealt with them. I took off a star because I wasn't at all impressed that they ask for $14.95 a day to use wifi, especially after we had to pay them $30 to park. These things should be included - this isn't a cheap motel.I decided to stay here because of a great stay a few yrs ago...epic fail this time...premium rates for royal inconveniences...glad u guys are renovating but guests shouldn't have to suffer the consequences...self park on the 7th flr of parking garage is more than valet and oh yeah...rear entrance is closed and no you can't take luggage cart around the corner of the building...great start to a one night stay...The price for the standard rooms weren't too bad. The price for the presidential suite was a lot higher than expected, but the room was worth it (due to the size of the group). The standard rooms were really nice too. The Sheraton is within walking distance to Broadway. Overall, the customer service was great and the rooms were very clean. If we wouldn't have had to wait a hour to get into our rooms, I'd of given the Sheraton 5 stars.I thought this hotel was really nice! I don't know what it looked like before the renovation but it's cute now. The rooms are nice the bed was super comfortable. I really liked the bar/restaurant too. The food was good, I was very impressed! My dad was a big fan of the veggie wrap and my favorite was the shrimp and grits. They lose a star because $15/day for wifi is just crazy and also because they didn't clean my parents' room one day (even though the do not disturb sign wasn't on the door) and they were a little cheap with replenishing towels.I will never stay here again. The hotel was dirty, the staff charged higher rates than were promised, and ""Facility charges"" were secretly added to the tune of $15/day. Stay away. Desk Staff is some of the worst in townI picked the Sheraton because it was close to downtown and I am a Starwood member Room- I was put on the 21st floor and had a great view of the city. The room is very modern and remindes me of the W hotels. The look and feel was modern chic with a lot of white accents. The room has a lounge chair and 2 queen beds which are hard as a rock. I now know what Fred and Barney from the Flinstones back must have felt like the next day after sleeping on a rock bed. They do not offer roll-a-way beds if you need an additional bed. The bathroom is a typical hotel bathroom with a shower/bathtub and single sink with a makeup mirror.  The bathroom is not big enough for 2 people to get ready at once. The room does not offer a mini fridge and like most Starwood hotels, they charge for internet per day. Hotel- As stated by others, this hotel has gone through a renovation. The lobby was decorated in modern chic with a touch of Christmas (it was the holidays when I went). The best part of the lobby is the ability to look up from the bottom floor and see all the way to the roof which is 26 stories high. You can also see the elevators going up to each floor and as you are in the elevators, you can look out them and see either the lobby or each floor as you are going up as they are made out of glass. It reminds me of a hotel elevator in Dubai.  The hotel does offer a spa, a pool and a lounge area that offers the game pool and a bar. Last, the hotel has the club lounge. The club lounge is on the 24th floor and has an amazing view of the city skyline and the river. The only negative about the club lounge is it doesn't offer complementary alcoholic drinks like other starwood hotels offer in their club loungeFYI- The hotel did have a restaurant on the top floor that rotated but it is currently closed. Transportation- The hotel has its own shuttle but I wasn't offered it. It turns out the bus was down while I was there. I did use a taxi that charged me $9 to get to downtown Broadway and 5th. Uber is also available but I did not utilize it. Service- I didn't have much interaction with the staff but I did have the valet hail me a cab. When I spoke to the concierge, he was friendly but didn't really help me with what I was looking for. Location- The hotel is located in downtown and across the street from the state capital building. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk to Broadway and 5th st. It is also walking distance to the Predator NHL stadium and the country music hall of fame. Next door to the hotel is a mini store where you can buy snacks and drinks. The hotel is in a business district, so on the weekends it is really quiet around the hotel. Overall- The hotel is stunning with its new remodel and the new decor. The things that I do not like about the hotel is the fact that they charge for wireless internet, the beds are hard and the fact that you have to pay extra to utilize the club lounge and the lounge does not offer complementary alcoholic beverages like other Starwood hotels do. Maybe that's the alcoholic in me talking, but hey, that's how I feel.  Overall, the hotel is nice and I do recommend staying here based off of price, location and cleanliness.I have looked forward to this review since I left Nashville.  In town for Yelp Spring Break and we originally were staying at a friends house.  That plan fell apart on Friday and was rushed to get a hotel.  Priceline gave us an express deal here for $111 per night.  With a free breakfast that would compete with some of the finest brunches.  We could not wait for day 2 to have it again.  The hotel was in major state of a reno completion that was supposed to be done right after we left.  The lobby was ridiculously small and when we showed they gave us Prosecco.  My wife's favorite.  That started it off right.  Then we went up to our room.  Fresh as a daisy on the 14th floor and our view was of the state capitol!  OMG, what a deal!  I think I would have given this place 5 star s at full price.  What a huge effort they made during our stay to make us not feel like the renovations were a displeasure for us.  Check in and out were fast.  Room was fantastic!  Food, delicious!.  Location, excellent!  What else can I say except see you next time in town!  The other reviews are really bad. Not sure if before renovation or during but I felt I needed to tell exactly what our experience was so that you could make a choice.  I spoke to many around the Yelp event and no one was able to compare to our deal or experience for hotel stays.  The renovation is just going to make this place even better when completed.  Supposedly this week but probably another week.What I like most about the hotel was the location. It was walkable to Broadway, yet was far enough that it didn't have all the noise outside. I ended up not using the Shuttle service, but it was good to have. Cabs were usually easy to get, thanks to the bell boys.The inside was fairly nice. Not exactly my style, but I could tell it was remodeled recently. The rooms were fairly big - I was part of a group and we got 3 rooms nect to each other that were connected, and it worked out well.Definitely don't book this hotel if you aren't 100% sure you are going to use it. I booked it well in advance for a birthday weekend in Nashville, because I noticed that a lot of hotels were already booked up three months out. I ended up canceling, because I didn't end up needing it, and even though I have a cancellation email and number, and even though Reservations has confirmed for me that the only stay they have on file was cancelled well in advance, and even though I got no emails reminding me of my upcoming stay (which I have been informed I should have gotten), I was charged $454 for a no-show fee. Billing has told me they have nothing in their files indicating I cancelled my stay (even though, as I said, Reservations told me I did), and therefore there is nothing they can do. Apparently there is only one person who can resolve this issue for me, Elliott Stamps, and he will not call me back. Now I have to cancel a Memorial Day trip to visit my family, because I don't have the funds in my account to pay for my rental car, due to the $454 no-show charge the Sheraton has basically stolen from me and refuses to take the time to reissue or even research to get to the bottom of the problem. It's been a really nice birthday present. I will for sure never stay in a Sheraton due to this experience, and I highly recommend others stay anywhere but here. The Hilton Doubletree in downtown Nashville has beautiful facilities and they were extremely easy to work with.Very very nice for the price my girlfriend got on Priceline. Nice pool not far from broadway the main strip. The hotel remodeling is finished the parking garage needs a make over.  The wifi price is just toooo too crazy. High Parking price ($38 for self) is expect Since your downtown. But overall very very nice hotel.     I would try to stay there again and not to far from White Castle.Very nice renovation.  Comparable to the W which we stay at often. Good location to Broadway. Very modern lobby and bar.  One of the top hotels Nashville.The most expensive hotel I've ever stayed at and extremely disappointed. I was not notified about any construction at the hotel prior to our stay. I would never charge anyone those prices when construction was taking place. Lines for elevators, outlets in room did not work (the first day), and couldn't grab breakfast because the accommodations were too small.  Outside the ""restaurant"" were picked over breakfast muffins on a table unkempt. We wanted to watch a hockey game and when asked if they had the tv station, they said maybe in a week or two. I understand that they were improving the look to the hotel, however the high price of our stay did not match the conditions we stayed in.  Positives: easy check in; easy parking; rooms were niceWe felt ripped off having to spend $390/night when the return from them was sub par by far. For that price, I would've thought a mini fridge would be in our room at least.","Stayed in April 2014. Seriously understaffed. Evacuated twice in one night. Could not get back into hotel after emergency services left and had to climb over rubble at emergency exit. No hotel staff on sight through the whole debacle. Not to mention the worst housekeeping I've ever seen in a hotel. Trash and dirty dishes were not even removed and it looked like our beds were made by a 3 year old. Room service was very slow and then they brought one fork, we had ordered two meals and two drinks so go figure. On the bright side the parking valet guys are great.We stayed here this past weekend on points and another room on cash.  We were very content with the hotel.    The lobby was very warm and open.  It is an atrium style hotel and had a great feel to it.  The lobby bar was fantastic.  We had great drinks there before going out on Friday night.  Have a great selection of booze on the menu.The rooms are adequately sized and the beds are very comfortable.  The bathrooms are nice as well.  It appears the entire hotel has been remodeled of recent as it has a very modern feel.  The hotel has a feel between a Westin and a W...not a traditional Sheraton.  However, if this is the way Sheratons are moving I am very content.  We did not use the lounge as times did not work out for us but would love to next time.The hotel has a large central atrium. Looks cool, BUT, can make for a painful night, especially if you're on the lower floors. There's a bar in the lobby and a dining area on the 2nd floor and the noise travels. There were some rowdy groups chatting away at midnight and by 7am breakfast was in full swing and the sound easily leeched through my 4th floor room. Basically, if you're a light sleeper, make sure they give you a room higher up.Otherwise, the front desk was very professional and helpful. My room was clean and what I expected from a Sheraton. They have in-room internet for $15/day, free wifi in the common lounge, along with a couple of computers/printers.$14 shuttle service (gray line) to BNA that runs every 15-30 minutes. Nearby eateries that are open 24 hours and deliver straight to your room.My partner and I stayed at the Sheraton in downtown Nashville for two nights as part of a large wedding party. Overall, I felt it was a average hotel with some issues, most notably, water pressure. To be honest, we are normally Hilton guests instead of Sheraton, so I don't exactly know how to rate this Sheraton against the rest of the Sheratons in the country. Through the credit card my partner has, we are gold automatically Gold rewards in their reward system. But at this hotel, that accounted for absolutely nothing except free Wi-Fi. (I don't know if that's normal? Wi-Fi isn't free!?) Anyways, the front desk service was negligible, and they forgot to give us our wedding booklet and package, even though we indicated we are part of the wedding party. They ultimately delivered it to our door when they realized the mistake, so that was nice.The hotel itself is huge, with upwards of 24 floors. We were on the 16th floor, which afforded us a nice view of downtown Nashville, even if downtown Nashville is not very pretty. The room was standard, but have a good layout with a two-person couch and table along with a desk. The bathroom was a mess. For whatever reason, I don't know if it's just my hotel room for the hotel in general, the water pressure is abysmal. That is to say, there was none.  The showers were weak, and...let's just say, you have to flusht he toilet upwards of 5 times to flush everything down.  Definitely not something that is acceptable.The main service was very poor.  They made the bed, but other than that, the room was not straightened or cleaned at all.  The location was good.  It's definitely within walking distance of the bars on Broadway and 2nd Avenue, but it's not one of the closest.  Ultimately, I think I would stay at a different hotel if I came to Nashville again. This hotel made me glad I am a Hilton guest.For as much as you pay per night I feel as though the parking should be included when you are staying at the hotel.  When I received my bill I was in complete shock they charged me 42.61 to park one night, Yes that's right one night.  When I called and asked about this they didn't seem to really care and could't even give me an answer as to why I was charged this ridiculous charge. It was 31.68 to park .93 tax and a 10.00 facility fee, what the heck is a facility fee I was already charged a 25.00 fee. Do your research because there are other hotels that do not try to charge you.  I thought this was sneaky and dishonest!!Shitty customer service.  Been waiting over three hours to check in.  Go down the road and stay at the Hyatt.  Worst Sheraton ever!!Not sure why all the negative reviews!  We were very impressed. We got this hotel on a Priceline express deal and we had a wonderful time! The hotel is beautifully decorated. The lobby bar has very good food for a hotel, and the staff is very friendly. The room was very clean as well. We have nothing bad to say about this hotel!I normally don't write reviews but our recent stay at the Sheraton Nashville was amazing.  It is newly renovated and the decor is fabulous. Our room was well-decorated and very comfortable. The lounge and Speakers Bistro had great service and great food, especially the breakfast buffet.  The staff were professional and responsive. Special recognition to Jeremy and Leslieann for their world class customer service, that made an amazing stay even better!Although the room was nice it doesn't make up for all the nickel and dimming they do 10.00 resort fee 10.00 facility fee 75.00 dollars a night for a mini fridge that was needed for medical use. 26.95 for the labor to put the fridge in the room even though they said they would waive the fee. 29.00 dollars for parking. I would not recommend this hotel to anyoneMy boyfriend &amp; I came to Nashville for an extended weekend. We stayed at this hotel because of its proximity to downtown. Our stay was wonderful. We were greeted by bell boys &amp; valet parking who were wonderful. Valet parking is a little bit extra per day (plus tips) but it is so worth it! The walk to Broadway was less than 10 minutes. If you're in town to explore the downtown area, this is definitely the place to stay. The staff were really nice as well. The rooms are newly renovated &amp; more modern. One downside is there is no hot tub in the pool area.. We really enjoyed our stay in Nashville &amp; would definitely stay at the Sheraton again.I love the location of this hotel. The rooms are beautiful and they are dog friendly which makes life so much easier!Being a longtime Starwood platinum customer, I expected to have the same experience that drew me to, and has kept me with, the brand.  We were in Nashville for the 49er's / Titans game, and I chose the location because it's walking distance from the stadium.ProsWalking distance to LP FieldWalking distance to Broadway Street, and a number of great restaurantsConsAir conditioning thermometer doesn't respond to settings, meanings it doesn't stop at 70 degrees setting, so the room gets hotter and hotter.The heating/cooling system is very, very loud.Tubs had obvious signs of rust.The worst part - SERVICE, or lack thereof.  The rooms appeared barely touched when they showed up!  On game day, we left about 10am to tailgate...etc.  After a long day out, we returned around 7pm, to learn no one had cleaned the room.  When I called down, the desk manager seemed less than concerned about resolution.  Her first response was, ""what can I do for you?"", rather than taking responsibility and offering solutions.  I requested a call from the hotel manager, which I have yet to receive.  No one offered an explanation regarding how such an oversight occurred, and I feel obligated to let future travelers know.Starwood, I was a huge proponent of you, but my last 3 visits in the past 2 months was vastly underwhelming, to say the least.  Think I'm going to go with my other hotel BFF (Hilton) for awhile.There were no king bed rooms ready upon check-in, so I settled for a two-doubles room. It smelled strongly of smoke, even I called the front desk to confirm that not only am I on a non-smoking floor, it's a non-smoking hotel.  Well...somebody's smoking, and it's going directly into my room.  The smell got stronger throughout my stay, and of course, I was busy working so I was already unpacked, and too tired when I got back to my room to do anything about it.  I woke up the next morning with a smoker's cough, a raspy voice, and a ravaged throat.  I also asked for a quiet room...it's away from the elevator, but it's also on a low floor next to the stairwell, so street noise is pretty loud.  My Starwood elite status does pretty much nothing here, other than provide free wifi, which didn't work with my work computer for some reason.  Useless.Ancient parking deck, mixes valet and self parkers, so that I'm going up round and round up multiple levels, in order to find a non-valet spot.Positives? I liked the clean, simple bath/sink vanity. Nice lobby and lounge-y bar area.  It's also within walking distance of the downtown area (Broadway).Stay here if you like:Smoke smell, outdated hotel decor, street noise, watching people walk to their rooms (open hallways viewed via atrium), heights (elevators w/ windows), Nashville.Do not stay here if you like: Working wifi, easy parking, updated hotels.Construction is on going as of 7-25-14. Their web site stated construction is done.  Our room had an odd musty odor. The trek from the $35 per nite plus tax was long and unpleasant. We had to lug our stuff up two flights of stairs. The noise in the lobby area was awful. The ac was struggling to cool the room. Even the ice machine on our floor was broken. To be fit the parking garage you must use your room key. You have to drive to the valet area and go to the lobby to check out. ( this process to about 20 minutes). Awful procedure and the bill was not correct...Ok hotel: close to LP Field and restaurants. However, did not clean room, even after calling the front desk.Evidently this hotel is under new ownership and management. I will say they are undergoing renovations right now and some of the changes are nice, but they were sawing and hammering in the lobby at 1:00 in the morning. I have stayed at this hotel at least 10 times for conferences before and always enjoyed my stay, but this time the staff did not have many of the rooms ready until about 9:00. There were some who did not have rooms at 11:00 pm. It seems the hotel is vastly understaffed as they were cleaning rooms at 10:00 pm. My suspicion is new ownership is trying to run this place on the cheap. On the bright side the valet guys were super nice.  What's sad is they do not disclose the information regarding the renovations on the hotel's website that I could find. Day 2 of our stay I talked to three different people regarding the lack of cleanliness in my room. I even checked immediately behind the housekeeping after she left the room. She had put two towels and a bar of soap in my room. The bed was not made, the hairs in my bathroom not belonging to me were still in the floor. The trash and food crumbs were still on the carpet from whoever the was in the room before me. The trash was not emptied as well. The only bright spot today is the banquet staff.Day 3 The room was finally cleaned thoroughly after asking 4 people the day before. The only complaint I would have had today is the housekeeper moved all of my stuff and placed it in the floor neatly, but still in the floor. My things were not in the way at all and were neatly laid over my suitcase sitting on the suitcase rack. Very strange.Day 4 checkout was the best part of the weekend. I will say parking fees are outrageous. $30.00 per day. I am not sure if our group will return here next year after this experience.Lucky to have stayed here after a major remodel.  The lobby is stunning with very modern furnishings.  The bar to the right as you enter is a bit subdued yet the design reminds me so much of the WiBar in New York.  The newly remodeled room is huge, again with modern furnishings with a very interesting accent chair in a wonderful shade of blue.  Even though I stayed only for one night, had the best sleep with the softest bed ever.  Will definitely stay here again when I'm back in the music city.The staff is very nice. The water pressure is HORRIBLE in shower &amp; toilet all 3 days we stayed. We wanted to take the shuttle many times but was never available even after waiting 10-15 minutes. The rooms are very dark. It is walking distance to Broadway.I stayed here for a conference with my husband and 13 month-old son. The rooms were okay but not up to my standards in cleanliness. With the little guy I'm on the floor playing with him and aware of just about everything especially from his level. Since I was there for a conference and all rooms were booked in downtown I had little options. The cost was high especially since it didn't include basics like wifi and breakfast. The elevators were painfully slow, we were in the 20th floor so it took awhile with only four elevators during rush hour. The water pressure and hot-water supply were unpredictable. The saving grace was the free shuttle and the attentive and knowledgeable bell staff.  Kudos to Omar and Derek. Thanks!The Sheraton downtown changed ownership a couple of years ago. Under the previous ownership and management, I always enjoyed my stay. The renovations that have been done are nice, but some changes were not for the better. I will say that last year the service was horrible as they were understaffed. The banquet staff was much improved this year as they had more people. The housekeeping has improved for that reason as well. The changes that were bad is the garage and parking. You are almost forced to use valet because half the garage is reserved for valet. You cannot pay cash for parking and the rate is $28 a day. Also the valet stand and checkin was moved to union street in front of the hotel create a lot of traffic congestion. This is especially true when large groups are arriving at the same time. . The prices have increased, but that is expected for a newly renovated hotel downtown. Nashville hotels have the highest occupancy rates in the country, expect to pay high prices downtown.","Friendly, clean hotel. We stayed here on Christmas Eve and were really happy with everything. Staff was fantastic and the lounge breakfast was great! Bed was very comfortable. They are remodeling and it will be interesting to see what it looks like next year. Thanks for aGreat stay!The worst Sheraton in the world - you are warned. ""Green Option"" what a scam. If you choose that you get ZERO  service . No cleaning - bed change - bathroom changes - or eve  taking out the trash  But if you say no to that - and expect full service -- they don't clean you room well , empty trash or add new supplies in the bathManager was sympathetic - admitted customers often cringed when hearing the G word. It's an old 30 year + property -- water system weak -- aging rooms. It needs to be leveled. How about this Green idea. Once demolished,  the Sheraton owners convert the land into a GREEN park?I find it hard to review hotels, because it all depends upon the room. My room was typical, clean enough but not pristine by any means.  It also overlooked the top floor of the parking garage and while the garage seemed empty, unbearably loud noises came from it between the hours of 1am and  3am. I am a good sleeper and I actually prefer some noise when I sleep, but this was way too much.I also had very little information in my room about the amenities in the hotel, nearby attractions, etc.  The only thing provided was a room service menu with two pages ripped out. I would have liked to have known where things were located, what was available outside the hotel, etc. The service was very sweet but sometimes confused. All and all, this hotel was fine but just not worth the money.Bought  ""4 star"" deal through Hotwire and received reservations at Sheraton. Hotwire would not give us our $ back as they misrepresented hotel. We got here today and were told the hotel was closed for renovations. Nobody even called to tell us! This is unacceptable. No fee comp anything, offer to place us elsewhere. They did verify our booking so that Hotwire could refund our $ immediately. The only reason they got a 2 instead of a 1 star is that the valet Chris was so nice helping us that he sort of saved face? What did I learn today? Never use Hotwire- they are liars and hard to deal with and NEVER stay at the Sheraton NSH again!Bar stopped serving drinks early so the workers could get out early. Unprofessional.I'm an SPG platinum member so I asked for a suite upgrade, instead they moved me to the same standard room but on a higher floor. I called and inquired about this and was told that this is an upgrade because it is on a higher floor....?  I think the front desk was peeing on my leg and telling me it was raining. I told them I want a suite and they said I would have to wait til 8pm for that.This hotel is a bit tired.   It's walking distance to the fun - so a great location.   It reminds me of every hotel I stayed at growing up and going on road trips with my parents.   The rooms face an inner indoor court yard that screams late 70's.   The rooms are ""OK"" ours had a leaky toilet.  The beds are comfy and the shower hot and strong.   If you don't need a lot of amenities - this place is perfect.I picked the Sheraton downtown for it being close to arena and they has shuttle service. Upon checking in I was informed of the 32 for valet. Totally ridiculous!  I then was told about 10 resort fee , which after reading reservations I see that was disclosed.  Anyway we went to the Charlie Daniels 40 th charity jam with my wife and  two sons. My 5 year olds fell asleep at concert and I had to take him back to room . I called the hotel and gave thenm my name and number and asked for shuttle to pick us up . 35 minutes later now show so I called again and they couldn't find the driver . 10 minutes later he called  saying he just got to hotel and he'd be right there I told him forget it I took a taxi. If you ever had a 5 year old sleeping in your arms for 45 minutes you'd be pissed also.  Staff never asked me how my stay was ! When you spend over 300 a night you expect much better service . I would not recommend this hotel !Based off some of the reviews, I was worried but we really liked ths hotel!  The lobby was cool and the front desk staff was great!  The view from our room was spectacular!  This hotel was clean, centrally located and we would definitely return when we go thru Nashville.I've stayed here each year for the last five years, attending an industry event at the hotel.  It's a great location, close to downtown with good views if you get a room high enough.  That's about the best thing about the hotel.  The staff is nice but their cleaning crew is chronically understaffed so expect to wait for a room to be available.  I sat in the bar for more than an hour and not one person came over to ask if I needed anything.  To make things easier at breakfast (again...understaffed), I chose the buffet - which was $14.  I know hotel buffets are overpriced but they could at least keep it stocked.The rooms are nicely sized but shabby.  The lighting fixture in the bathroom was rusted, the water in the tub (which was pitted and cracked) came out brownish, the soundproofing is non-existent and water pressure is really low.There are four elevators - clearly not enough for 25 floors, especially when one of them was stuck on the same floor for an entire day.  And the FEES!  OMG!  $24 per day for valet parking.  $15 per day for internet.  Really??  They waive this for Starwood members but, c'mon.  Even the lower budget hotels offer free internet these days!I'm actually considering NOT going to this event in future years, specifically because of this hotel. That speaks volumes!If I can give this place 0 stars I would but unfortunately it is not an option. I stayed here for a work event so I had no choice of hotels. When I checked in the staff at the front desk was great but when I walked into the room it was a different story. The room smelled moldy. There were scuff marks on the closet door and wall like someone kicked it. They can at least try to remove it. The carpet was peeling off and the ceiling tiles in the bathroom were stained and ripped. The bathroom towel had hair on it, which was NOT mine because I just walked in and noticed it. Also, as I walked through the room, I found blonde hair on my sock. I have black hair so that was definitely not mine.I ordered room service at 9:00pm and they told me 30 mins.  After 30 mins I called and they said it is on its way.  At 10:30pm I was getting frustrated because I was starving and needed to get up early for work.  I called around 10:45pm and they said I never called for an order!!!!   URGGGGHHHHHH.  They had to make my order even though I called and they said it was on its way.  Finally got my food at 11:00pm and it was NOT good.  I will never go back to this place again.This place is a total disaster. Don't do it. Stay somewhere else. Seriously. The best you can hope for is a subpar experience.This morning, the fire alarm went off shortly after midnight. By 1 am, the Nashville FD gave the all clear and guests shuffled back to their rooms. However, the alarm went off again approximately ten minutes later. The staff managed to turn the sirens off, but the strobe lights in the bedroom and bathroom continued to flash for several more hours.You know... those flashing lights that are a visual prompt to wake you up in the event that you are deaf, or the sound is disabled on the alarm system.By 3:30 am, I'd had enough. I booked a room at another hotel, packed my things, and went down to the front desk to checkout. I also asked the staffer at the front desk to comp my incidentals (i.e. parking) to make up for the considerable inconvenience of being deprived of sleep.The front desk staff advised me that he didn't have the authority to comp my incidentals for the fire alarm. I'd have to speak to his manager. Where was his manger? At home. Most likely asleep. The guests at this hotel should have been so lucky.I get that chaos is a part of life. And when it comes to a fire alarm, precaution is paramount. But, this property is dramatically understaffed and it showed in the lack of attention my room got from housekeeping to the coordination of the evacuation and the subsequent failure to disarm the fire alarm promptly. This property is undergoing a massive renovation and probably shouldn't be open to begin with.The leadership at this property, and Sheraton, should be ashamed. This is by far the worst hotel stay I've ever experienced in my life. I hope the folks who run this hotel never have to experience the fatigue, anxiety and discomfort on their own vacations that I and countless others weathered this morning.For the price, I feel like we should have paid $50 or so more and stepped it up a notch. Walking in, you would expect a little more from the hotel overall. The front desk, luggage storage and valet were all wonderful and helpful anytime I had questions or needed something. I also was asked to join their Starwood Club or whatever it is so I could get free internet - awesome. I had a tough time with housekeeping, though. The first issue was into my 2nd day. I got back to the hotel around 4:30 from a conference to find housekeeping had been there, but stripped my bed entirely but never came back to remake it. My heat was also cranked up to 80 - yuck. I always leave with it around 72. I called down and the front desk was great, Someone was there within 15 minutes to make my bed (I needed a nap!). One would think that the rooms would have been cleaned by that time of day. However, I did not get fresh towels, toiletries, etc. The only thing I really needed was the removed bath mat towel and fresh coffee makings. The 3rd day, which is my checkout day, housekeeping came knocking at 9:30. When I checked in on day 1, I was thrilled when they asked what time I would be leaving so housekeeping would not come knocking. We agreed on 12 and she specifically said  'so I can sleep in'. I was excited about this because no hotel has ever asked. Well, clearly, housekeeping did not get the memo as she knocked and tried my door. It was just plain annoying. All in all, I feel like their site leads you to believe you are getting something you are not. I was not at all impressed with the bathroom from the shower, pressure, products and linens. Substandard. The room was more of a 3 star, but I had tor write about my experience. Location was good. Easy walk to Broadway and good food. PS - Eat at Etch. Amazing.This hotel is terrible.  I checked in and they put me in a room that was infested with mold and mildew.  After going down to the front desk to get a room change they were very rude and made me prove to them the room was in fact a problem.  After waiting for 90 minutes and arguing with the night manager they finally gave me a new room, which was smaller and right by the elevator.  The manager asked that I not discuss this issue at the front desk because other customers could hear my problem.  Yes MOLD is a major problem.  We went back up to the room so I could fetch my belongings and there were two maintenance people putting the room under quarantine.  In fact they removed the room number plaque.  The hotel wouldn't do anything until I threatened to get American Express involved.  Aside from that, the bar and lobby are nice.  The rooms are small and dated, not a four star hotel by any stretch.  I stayed at this hotel because my business trip got extended and I had to check out of the Renaissance (no rooms available).  The Ren is a decent hotel with a great location and good service.The room was nice but there was a lot of construction going on in the lobby at the time of visit. Only one elevator was running. Hopefully when all the work is done it will be as nice as any other Sheraton that I've stayed in. I believe that price was paying for more than the location. I believe we were paying for the construction as well.Pros: Great front desk staff, other staff responsive to e-mail prior to stay, clean rooms, comfy bed.Cons: I know the location is good, but I expect a little more bang for my buck at a $200-$300 a night hotel. I didn't have to pay that much since I was there for a wedding, but I'm going to review this place based off of how much a stay would be under normal circumstances.Specific issues: $20+ a day parking (I used the street instead), WiFi not included in base price, slow draining tub, no shampoo in the room when we checked in (come on now, even a motel will have subpar shampoo waiting for you), no folio in the room that tells you about amenities/breakfast/etc, and the rack to hang clothes on was too low to the ground to accomodate a maxi skirt I was trying to steam. No major issues, but just little things that made my stay just average.During my stay, the property was bustling.  They seem to do lots of events (and perhaps, do them well, based on how busy it was).  This Sheraton is showing its age and didn't seem to get as much love from the bajillion dollar global Sheraton renovation a few years ago.  With that, everything is fine, just not amazing.  Clean, everything works, great Platinum recognition, helpful staff. One of the best fitness centers I've ever seen in a Sheraton!Centrally located and convenient to a lot.   I really appreciated the welcome gift in my room from management (none other than Jack Daniels).The rooms are better than most for a Sheraton, but the elevators are atrocious.  With 25 floors, the 4 of them should be enough.  But every time I stay here, at least two are out of operation.  Getting in and out of the room is such a chore that I swear this place off every time I come.  Apparently, I've yet to learn from my own experience.This hotel is fine but not great.  It's located a few blocks from the state capitol building, and a few blocks from the strip of downtown bars and restaurants in Nashville.  So it's got that going for it, although be ready to navigate panhandlers and homeless people hassling you between the hotel and the bars.  The hotel is a classic 1970's looking concrete structure.  I scored an upgraded top level room which was nice and had a good skyline view.  The room is appointed like every other Sheraton, which is usually above average but not impressive.  The lobby is utilitarian but gets the job done.  The staff was fine but not exceptional, even at the Preferred Guest Gold desk.  As far as value, if you want to stay downtown, this is the place.  Next time I pass through, I may just take a cheaper hotel to stay in the suburbs along the highway.Pros:Friendly, helpful and professional staff in all areas/every encounter.Seared ahi wraps in bar were delicious.Convenient location, short walk to all in downtown Nashville.Cons:The atrium-it just amplifies all sounds.  Even on the higher floors, the whirl of the elevators all night long will keep you up, even with ear plugs.  Same applies for any band playing in the bar.Parking: Yowza-self parking was $28.00 per day.  Park on the street, or the lot next door for much less.Dated/worn interior despite recent remodel.This Sheraton is right on par with others we've stayed at.+ Nice, helpful staff+ Beautiful lobby/atrium with glass elevators that let me peer at the rest of the floor like I am surveying my kingdom+ Great view from our 19th floor room+ Clean, nice room with typical Sheraton amenities+ Walking distance (or very cheap taxi if you don't like walking hills in 1,000 degree nashville summer weather...) to downtown sights - Ryman Auditorium, Broadway honky tonk scene, the river, etc.+ Swimming pool is open until midnight- The bed was not as comfortable as other Sheraton's have been - though it was by no means terrible.- Like all Sheraton's, you have to pay for internet.  I feel this is, in general, a cheap move by SPG considering how much money all of us fork out to stay at Sheraton's and Westin's.  To then be asked to pay an extra $10 for internet I can get free from Starbucks is a bit of a kick in the pants.  Yes, they have computers in the business center I can use, but that's hardly the same as using my laptop in my very nice room.","['nice', 'hotel', 'downtown', 'area', 'far', 'titans', 'play', 'large',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-nashville-downtown-nashville,Holiday Inn Express Nashville-Downtown,3.5,$$,54,"This facility is top notch. I walked in without a reservation asking for a room for the night on the spot. The concierge at the desk was welcoming and efficient. I was given my room keys, parking permit, and local map of the immediate area to find some dinner. The room was immaculate  and spacious.  Can't say enough good things. Would definitely stay again if I find myself in Nashville.Our stay at this hotel started off great but sadly didn't end on the same note. Our flight was early morning so we weren't expecting our room to be ready for several hours. We stopped at the hotel to drop off our bags and were pleasantly surprised when our room was available and we were able to check in at 10am!Our room was clean and had the necessities but the bathroom was in need for some updating. But it was definitely fine for what we needed. On our third day there we came back to our room from getting a coffee to find our power not working properly. The lights in the room wouldn't turn on and the outlets didn't work, however everything in the bathroom worked fine. We called the front desk and they sent maintenance to our room. The gentleman was unable to figure out the issue so the moved us to a new room. This new room was supposed to be an upgrade but it was definitely not. It was smaller, louder and had AC issues. It was located right by the elevator so it was extremely loud at night when people came back from their partying. Our AC didn't seem to work right and it was rather warm in the room. We totally wished we had our old room that last night because it was a crappy nights sleep.Breakfast is included in the stay here but don't expect anything fancy. I am gluten free and there weren't any options for me which stinks. My friend said the sausage gravy was decent but otherwise it's standard hotel breakfast.I'd say the location of this hotel is pretty convenient. You're about a 7-8 min walk to all the action downtown but be forewarned it is uphill the way back after a bit of drinking! I'd stay here again but I'd be sure to ask for a room away from the elevators!Obviously, it comes with free breakfast/wifi - rooms are clean - staff is friendly enough, typical Holiday Inn Express. If you're coming to Nashville and plan on partying it up on Broadway, this hotel is in a great location for that. It's within walking distance of bars, which is a huge plus for the party crowd. Unfortunately, because so many people choose to stay here when partying, the hotel can get pretty rowdy. When I stayed here, people were screaming and running throughout the hallways til the wee hours of the morning. I left the hotel exhausted and cranky, not wanting to return again.This is a nice, mid-level, hotel. It's not super fancy, but it works.The lobby area was very nice, accommodating and comfortable. There is even live music much of the time, which is very cool. They put out refreshments each afternoon and that's a nice touch.The rooms are nice and seem to have been renovated in the recent past.This property is in a decent area, but seems to be on the verge of the 'hood. Don't head the wrong direction when you go for a walk, especially after dark, and you'll be fine.I stayed here because it was close to where I had meetings for work. It's in downtown Nashville, but not the nice part of town. The room rate is much more expensive than it ever should be. My room was dirty and had that stale, musty smell to it. The service was great, but the location and rooms, give it a two star rating.We enjoyed our stay here! Right downtown within walking distance of the Broadway area (about a half mile, maybe?) the front desk lady was fabulous to us. Super attentive and kind. And, you can't beat 3D printing your pancakes in The morning. Clean rooms, comfy bed. Housekeeping didn't tidy up but at least replaced our towels. So that would be the one negative. Not like we're pigs or anything but it's nice to at least have the bed made. If this is on your short list of hotels to choose when coming to Nashville you won't be disappointed unless you're first-world picky.This hotel was the perfect location between downtown and other cool neighborhoods. I strongly urge you to check out some of the nearby neighborhoods (ie Westend, The Gulch, etc) lots of off the beaten path restaurants and bars. Lobby, kitchen/dining area, and rooms very clean.Hallways were a bit dingy, carpet needed replaced, and the walls could use new paint, these areas were very outdated.On the second day of our stay, the hallway smelled of throwup and a strong cleaner. Which is not surprising since there were quite a few drunk people stumbling back to their rooms the night before. They immediately cleaned up whatever mess was there, however the smell was very very powerful. They also put a large air purifier in the hall which helped. By the end of the day, the smell was almost gone, by the next day it was gone completely. There was friendly service/staff, but during peak cleaning hours, it was nearly impossible to get an elevator up or down from your room to lobby. The housekeeping big service carts taking all of them. Not very professional but I guess if they have no other elevator what can they do.The free breakfast was decent enough, but nothing to brag about. They had eggs, gravy biscuits, sausage, ham muffins, pastries, yougurt, fruit, juice, milk, coffee, cereal, pancakes, etc. Again this was okay for a day or two but if staying longer, I would suggest mixing in other places to eat.There is a shuttle service that provides drop offs (not sure about pickups) within 2 mi radius of hotel- We used it one day to have them drop us off at Vanderbilt University. It was only about a mile from the hotel, so we just walked home. Which was good because we found a good restaurant along the way. Housekeeping was great about cleaing the rooms, replacing amenities (towels,shampoos, lotions, etc). One day the toilet handle broke- we notified front desk on our way out and it was fixed by time we came back to room a couple hours later.You get free wi-fi in rooms (which seems to be a rarity anymore). There is also a computer service center free of use in the lobby. It was great for me as I was in a pinch and needed to print out some important documents I received unexpectedly for work. It also turned out great for us to print our boarding passes out before leaving the next day.Clean...spacious...close to attractions downtown. Shuttle service was awesome, I strongly recommend staying here when you're in Nashville.Decent hotel in a mid-area location. Free breakfast and free wi-fi is a plus. Room was clean, hotel seems a little out dated but people here are polite and accommodating of any extra needs. Fridge and microwave are very handy to have in the room for a several night stay. Lots of places to eat in Nashville and good to have a place to store leftovers. Recommend for a corporate trip.BUSTED UP HOTEL!!! This place is horrible!!! Not only are you booking a overpriced room, your are getting low maintenance amenities. This hotel is in dire need of a facelift and at the prices we paid, it should have been done a long time ago. The carpets were disgusting and the hallway looked like a cheap bates motel. Stay on the out skirts of the city where the rooms are nice.This is by far the best hotel ive stayed at and the people are the friendliest and most helpful ive met from a hotel staff. The cleaning lady did an amazing job making my room clean again. Next time i come back to nashville it will be this hotel:)Great place to stay in Downtown NashvilleRoom was clean and staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We called and said we were a head of schedule and asked if we could check in early (before 3pm) and they said yes! Usually places make you wait until 3. It was nice we were able to come in and unpack and relax, not have to find somewhere to wait.There's a free shuttle that will take you and pick you back up anywhere within 3 miles which was perfect. We used it several times to go to the bars on Broadway, Country Music Hall of Fame, The Gulch etc. All you have to do is text!!!  I loved that.They were very quick and showed up on time when we asked. No need for a taxi to get you to and from the hotel! (FYI Parking was $22 +tax  per day to stay in the Garage, but you do have in/out privileges)Love that all you have to do is text the front desk if you need anything. It was very convenient. Great breakfast in the morning, and snacks/live music on Friday/Saturday late afternoon. I'd definitely stay here again and recommend it to those staying in Nashville.This location seems very outdated and our room smelled very damp like there had been water damage. The hostess that checked us in was very friendly however the shuttle driver seemed like he couldn't be bothered to take us to a location within the covered perimeter even though he was just sitting around chatting with the hostesses at the counter. I am very disappointed in this Holiday Inn Express. I hope they remodel this location soon.My wife and I are on a road trip from Austin.. Rolled into Nashville and landed in a crappy hotel we booked online. Wife was not happy... She called over to holiday inn express and booked another room. When we showed up we had the pleasure of talking with Emilie (the manager). You couldn't ask for a nicer person to work with. She hooked us up.. And the smile on my wife's face was priceless...A thank you to Emilie for making our trip that much better!.. Highly recommend this hotel... And if you have a chance to meet Emilie, you won't be disappointed.Thanks again Emilie!The continental breakfast was fantastic! Excellent location to all major attractions. One small issue was that our floor smelled like cat pee at times, but the whole city smells like vomit, so this was relatively negligible.Worst experience.We had a very large bachelorette party staying at this Holiday Inn. We came back early after a short night out and found that one of our bridesmaids did not have her room key (the hotel had only given 2 working key cards for a room with 4 guests).  Nighttime front desk attendant, Daniel, had possibly the worst customer service I have ever experienced in any industry, in any country.  He refused to allow our keyless friend access to her room because her name was not officially listed on the hotel room. That is okay--we understand he hotel's security policy. But it was late at night, so several of us offered to wait with her in the lobby until the other roommates returned. The front desk guy (1) demanded to see our hotel keys to prove that we were guests, even though we had already told him our names and affiliation with the bridal party, but then he (2) KICKED US OUT OF THE LOBBY, where we were simply sitting quietly. He told us that we (paying hotel patrons) needed to go to our rooms or go outside, and that we were not allowed to sit in the lobby. Again, we were sitting quietly!  Their night cop also threatened to physically remove us from the premises if we didn't comply.Can't believe that IHG allows this type of employee to represent their brand.First of all, Valeri at the front desk was awesome.  There were three of us sharing a room and she said she'd give us a rollaway at no charge and let us check in about six hours early.  We also got late checkout with no problem and ran the poor shuttle driver ragged.  Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful.  This hotel definitely has the best free breakfast buffet.  Fresh fruit, oatmeal, sausage, ham, biscuits, gravy, cinnamon rolls, bagels, juice, yogurt, milk, cereal, bread, and a nifty machine that makes pancakes to order.The only downside was the room was a little dusty and we had one light that didn't work.  Other than that, no complaints.Jodi at the front desk was helpful and nice....close to attractions...toilet seats are a little out of date, but oddly comfortable?BAIT &amp; SWITCH!  FRAUD!  Made reservation on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholidayinn.com&amp;s=565862f09531dffa96f0ecef98d74327ce8f1e513e70167b6e1850c052f56d3f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">holidayinn.com</a>.  Got confirmation email and it was FIVE TIMES the amount that my reservation was.  Called hotel and was told basically ""we don't care"" and they would not honor the reservation amount made on their own website.  If you make a reservation, be sure and check your confirmation so they don't charge you 5 times more.Everything you expect from a Holiday Inn Express. I was recently in town for the St. Jude Country Music Marathon. The front desk staff was friendly during the check in/out process. The staff here even went above and beyond and made breakfast available way earlier than usual on the day of the race.","Great location.  Just down the hill to center of town. Rooms are older but clean and good size.  Was on 7th floor.  Front desk great in particular John.  Gift store is high price.  The free breakfast is mobbed especially for those late hung over people. Very impressed. Good job. Hoping to come backStay here for the great location (a couple blocks down to Broadview where all the bars are). Free breakfast is great and extensive too.Rooms are quite dated. The Holiday Inn Vanderbilt is 2 miles up the road but had a lot nicer interior and amenities.Don't stay at this establishment. We were here for a bachelorette weekend, came back later that night &amp; was kicked out on the streets (4 girls I may add) after 15 minutes of being back in our room, had paid for our stay for 3 nights, all because the room across from us was being loud. No warning, just told to get our bags &amp; leave the premises or get arrested. Thank god the cops were understanding or we would be homeless tonight. They took our side &amp; made sure we got a new hotel &amp; kept up with is. But I have never heard of this behavior or have experienced it &amp; no one should have to deal with this situation ever. When we tried to confront them about the situation, they treated us like we didn't have an opinion, because we were 4 girls - one of us is a lawyer &amp; they wouldn't listen to any reasoning before they kicked is out on the curb, at 4am. I would give zero stars if I could.Emilie was extremely helpful and friendly. She provided great customer service by allowing us to head up to our room extremely early and was very accolades tingWe booked here based on price alone but we were very impressed upon arrival. The location is ideal for downtown access. Nice clean hotel. Large lobby with office center, newspapers and fitness center. Best part: Free shuttle anywhere within two miles all day long. This was amazing since we visited while it was 30 degrees. Driver was friendly and even offered recommendations.Great place to stay, very centrally located and very close to the country western best music of this world.Staff super friendly and accommodating. Free breakfast is phenomenal with lots of great choices.Free shuttle within 2 miles comes very handy.Overall high raccomandedWoke us up at 9am to ""check who was still in the room"". Needless to say we were still in the room.This is a nice hotel in the heart of downtown Nashville. It's an older hotel but it looks like it's been redone lately. The rooms are nice as is the lobby area. Staff is super friendly with one exception.... We went down to the dining area around midnight looking for a plastic fork and ran into a security guard sitting in the dark talking on his phone. I told him I was just looking for a fork but the guy barked at us to get out. I think we startled him, but maybe he should be working instead of sitting in the dining room chatting? Jerk. Anyway, the location of this place is really nice. With walking distance of the broadway music scene and the museum is right across the street. We'll definitely stay here again. But we'll bring our own silverware.Stayed here from December 30, 2013 until January 3rd, 2014 - The hotel itself is ok. Nice lobby, convenient to downtown Nashville and whatnot.  The real problem I had was that the customer service was downright terrible.  I ended up getting sick for the first couple of nights so we didn't really have maid service come but when I finally felt better and left...they STILL never came.  I had to call 3 times over a 24 hour period JUST to get a fresh set of towels.  Why it took nearly 24 hours I will never understand.  It really soured me because really, if you can't send up towels quickly enough than what does that say about your employees.  On top of that, the hotel wasn't even that full while we were there so there's really no excuse for it.  Definitely wouldn't return.Side note - while the Wi-fi was free, which is cool...it was terribly slow.  So it was almost useless for most of the time.This hotel leaves much to be desired. After failed attempt at a much nicer hotel, this is what we were left with.  And expectations did not disagree. Upon getting our rooms (2), we realized that neither had even been cleaned!! When we returned to the desk, no one apologized or offered us any thing for our trouble. Our new rooms were located on a floor that reminded me of a horror film. The walls were sheet rock and ""notes"" had been written on them. The hallway smelled awful and was scary if not disgusting. Our only night here, we came in late from the concert/bars (the reason we were in Nashville). Not even being loud (4 people hanging out in our room) we had a ""manager"" come and lecture us on how to behave. We are 36-42 year olds. I was already irritated but that was ridiculous. I will never stay here again and would never recommend it to anyone staying in Nashville.The room was very nice! Lots of space, comfy beds, nice bathroom. No complaints about the room at all! I am docking a star for the rude staff. The people who worked in the lobby constantly glared at me and made me feel very uncomfortable.Location is a 4 or 5 becuase of convenience to all the bats on the strip. However they seem to jack the prices up way too high on the weekend and parking is extra at 22.00 a night. They do have a great continental breakfast. I would stay again if we all plan to drink since its in walking distance.This hotel is in a great location. We stayed there for a week for CMA fest. I only gave it three stars because our room was so hot and humid. We literally took like 3 showers a day and chose to hang out in the lobby where it was much cooler ( and there was good lemonade :) ) they couldn't give us a new room with a king bed so we sucked it up and had an industrial strength fan blowing on us at all times. The maintenance guys were really nice and even came to fix it the next day but it still wasn't blowing cold air. I asked other people how cold their air was and they said it wasn't good but it wasn't too bad so we just kept our mouth shut and took a lot of showers lol ... Also, I'm not a huge drinker but the ADA rooms are a fall risk for those in flip flops sober or otherwise... I tripped at least 4 times on the hill in the room and I wasn't drinking. It was a good trip overall just think the ac needs some tlc and check 214's humidity if you can... It was pretty soupy. Maybe that was due to all the showers we took...that's quite possible. There's nothing better than being in the heat all day and coming in to sleep in a nice cool room... The lobby felt great but our room just didn't cut it. That was the only thing that kept my rating lower.I just returned from Nashville for a girl's weekend and we were impressed with the customer service and the hotel. This was my first time in the great city of Nashville, but a friend of mine was there just this past summer and stayed at this very hotel and said that the hotel definitely had a face lift...the lobby is a beautiful, spacious area where you can easily wait for others in your party,  hang around for shuttle that they offer, or just people watch. One night they even had a hospitality table with delicious pulled pork sandwiches and fresh lemonade...and a cowboy who played and sang in the lobby. It was quite the welcome!The hotel isn't new so there will be inevitable issues with rooms, but any issue that one of my (18) girlfriends had was quickly and kindly taken care of. They are a professional and friendly staff and very accommodating. The pool is nice, but on the small side. But after hearing the stories of the summer before, the hotel decided to make the pool ""dry""...meaning no alcoholic beverages allowed. This made the pool area very relaxing, and anyone that was looking for a rowdy time only has to walk a few blocks down Broadway to hit up the awesome bars for entertainment and nightlife. And the icing on the cake: free breakfast that included a wide variety of hearty and light options. Overall we had a wonderful stay at this nice hotel (with a fantastic staff) and we really enjoyed what Nashville had to offer!Loud!  If you stay in any of the rooms facing broadway, don't expect to get any sleep.  The windows are thin and single pane.  Unless you can sleep to the sounds of people yelling, lots of honking, and Harley's all night, make sure you get a room on the backside of the hotel.  The lobby is nice and the rooms are pretty good.  The wifi however is useless and again some sleep would have been nice.Decent hotel.  No bar or restaurant.  You have to walk .3 miles or longer to most food places.  The breakfast was free but not too much on it.  Checking out at 0400 seemed like a good idea until the front desk informed me that the system was running the previous days data.  I thought you would do that at midnight until 0100.  Nashville is not in my top 100 places to stay but if you have to go, like I did this hotel will work.Don't expect much from this hotel. They have a free shuttle, but don't expect it to take you anywhere. After dropping guests off at a restaurant we were finishing dinner at, we thought we would hop on to return to the hotel. The driver yelled no thru the closed window. As we pleaded that we were guests, he refused to roll down his window or talk to us. Clearly that hotel needs to train its employees on customer service. When retuning to the hotel and complaining, the manager on duty listened to our complaint but didn't offer anything in return for the customer service failure. The next day we attempted to take the shuttle around 1pm. The shuttle driver was conveniently  on break until 5pm.  Apparently 4 hour breaks are required for the shuttle driver.This has a good location, and that is all this hotel has. The rooms are tired and thirsty for an upgrade. Next time in Nashville I will stay somewhere where the employees understand the basics of customer service. They aren't worth the rate they charge. At $300 a night you are paying for a good location and nothing more. Take your $$$ elsewhere to a full service location such as the Hotel Indigo or the Hilton.The location of the hotel is unbeatable. It's right on Broadway, so we ended up being able to enjoy downtown for 4 days without having to hail a cab at all. Location, unfortunately, is one of the few things this hotel has going for it.We checked in for a 4 day weekend after booking our hotel through Priceline. Despite booking a suite, we were given a double room instead, a downgrade. Rather than being apologetic or making sure we were satisfied customers, the front desk worker said, ""well that's what happens when you book through Priceline."" My husband works in hotels, I understand how it works. Being bumped happens, I get it. That doesn't mean you have to be rude or condescending. In our 4 day stay, housekeeping did not come to our room once. If we wanted towels, we had to go to the front desk and ask for more. I would be more understanding if we had asked not to be disturbed or had been occupying the room, but we were gone all day, each day we were there. Still no service. The parking lot is a complete mess of its own. The structure is so tiny and poorly laid out you have to be careful not to get caught in one of the areas that do not have an outlet (but of course there's no warning). The surface lot is tiny as well, and Saturday night there was absolutely no parking for us in any of the locations available for guests. Would I stay here again? Sure, if I could use my husband's hotel discount and there wasn't anywhere else to stay. Again, the location is unbeatable. The customer service of the hotel is pretty terrible and there are plenty of other hotels vying for my business.I stayed here for four nights on business and can say it was enjoyable. My room was clean, front desk staff were incredibly friendly and hospitable no matter the time of day, and the complimentary breakfast was wonderful! The shower was always hot, the room heated and cooled quickly (and not loudly, I might add), the gift shop is nice (but really expensive), and it's far enough away from music row for quiet, but close enough to walk if you don't mind a few blocks. The mattress on the bed was extremely firm, not allowing me to sleep well. I slept in a lesser hotel in Denver on my way home with a much softer mattress. Wish they had a complimentary shuttle to the airport (there shuttle will only take you in a two mile radius) but they told me of one that was $14 one way. Housekeeping was in a hurry for me to leave on my last day; started knocking on my door at 9 am and then again later in the morning (I was so annoyed, I forgot to see what time it was). Was nowhere near check-out time. But they did a decent job cleaning my room while I was there.NOT A SAFE HOTEL!! Two other girls and I stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago. Sunday evening we got home from dinner to find that our room door had been broken through and our room completely ransacked. Whoever broke in made out with a couple thousand dollars worth of our stuff. The hotel staff claimed they didn't hear or see anything. How do you not hear someone breaking through a huge, solid door?? It doesn't help that none of their hallways have surveillance cameras either. At first, they seemed cooperative and said they would do everything possible to help reimburse us and to catch whoever did this. After about a week or so, they tried telling us that not only were they not going to reimburse us for what was stolen, but they were going to charge us for our stay!! I think getting robbed should qualify us for at least a free weekend.","Mixed feelings. Good location and a free hot breakfast, but our room reeked of stale cigarette smoke that bothered my asthma. Because the hotel ran out of nonsmoking rooms due to the Rock and Roll Marathon, we were stuck. You could hear everything from outside the window to from outside the hallways.  Luckily, I had brought ear plugs.  Other guests on our floor were absolute hillbillies. They propped their doors open to more easily facilitate yelling across the hall to one another at 11pm at night. When my mom opened our door and said ""Shush,"" this grizzled 40 something woman yelled, ""I paid for my room just like you did, bitch!"" My mom yelled back, ""Then get back in it."" The next night bin Laden was killed, and at 3am, I awoke to banging in the hallway.  The next converstion I hear is:""Are you in there?""  ""Yeah.""""Skeeter, they killed bin Laden.  Shot 'em in the head.  I got $30 worth of McDonnald's.  WOOOOOOOOO!""Nuff' said.Being from the San Francisco Bay Area, we're used to walking. A lot.So, of course, on our first day in Nashville, we decided to walk West End Avenue from 33rd Ave as far as it will go in downtown. We got as far as 7th Ave. In addition to this walk, we also traipsed throughout the Vanderbilt campus and its environs. We realized that after 6 hours of nearly non-stop walking in one of the worst heat waves gripping the nation, we probably had enough.We didn't feel like hailing a cab.We stopped in here and asked the front desk to get one for us. I was embarrassed that we were essentially asking them to get us a cab to deliver us to another hotel (near the airport). But the reception desk gladly called one for us. We don't know if she knew that we weren't staying there. She even asked us to sit down inside their pleasantly air-conditioned lobby.We'll definitely recommend this place to friends.This is another one where I wish I would do 3.5 stars. I pretty much agree with Amanda B, it's very close to Broadway, easy to check in, and it does the job. It's hard to go from staying at the Opry to this, but hey, it worked out great! $18 for parking is absolutely crazy, but I guess you should expect that anywhere down in Nashville. If you are looking for a cheap, quick, decent hotel this would be your place!Best place to stay in Nashville for access to music venues and Ryman auditorium.  A quick 5 minute walk down the hill and you are there.  Courteous and knowledgeable staff.  Rooms clean.  Upper floors recently renovated so ask for one of them when making reservations.Great experience. The free breakfast was good and it's within walking distance of all the attractions. I left some property in my room and they were nice enough to mail it to me at home. Very accommodating. I'd definitely stay there again.Amazing staff. Manager Ashley is super helpful. Highly recommendThis hotel is a 3 block walk to the Broadway strip-SO CONVENIENT.  The hotel was clean, the people were friendly and the outdoor pool was GREAT!  They even had a free shuttle. We stayed in a suite which was more than enough room and everything seemed brand new.  We would definitely stay there again!Stayed here for NCAA tournament.  Hotel is definitely pricing but paying for the downtown location.  You could walk to downtown bars, restaurants, and arena but several long blocks away and coming back would be uphill.  They have a shuttle that will drop you off, but doesn't run between noon and 5:00 p.m.  You would think on a tournament weekend and games starting at 11:15 a.m. they would change it.  Room was average nothing special.GREAT for the price and the location. Dont expect too much though. But come on !Stayed here for a bachelorette party weekend which also seemed to be what every other hotel guest was there for as well. That being said, I would be aware the for the months of April, May and June this hotel likely is home to bachelor and bachelorette parties on the weekends. The hotel staff made efforts to find tow adjoining rooms for us - while we weren't able to get one we still were able to get rooms next to one another. The rooms have all been renovated - comfortable firm beds with various pillow options, lots of space to hang clothes and hangers, iron + ironing board, newer bathroom with lots of counter space, 3 big mirrors total (a plus for females) nearby ice machine. Our room's TV, although a decent flat screen, had a big red band in the center of the screen. Because we weren't in our room much other than to get ready and to sleep, it wasn't that big of a deal, but if you're staying here on business and trying to relax at night it would be annoying. The rooms could use more outlets! Was impossible for 4 people to be charging their cell phones at the same time let alone also blow drying and curling their hair. Our shower drain had some clogs and would back up while showering and take 5-10 minutes to drain which was kinda gross. The bathroom door handle was close to falling off and there was no bathroom fan which made it super hot in there. Other ""perks"" included were a continental breakfast (nothing special but works if you have a hangover) but the dining area reminded me of college dorms dining halls because of how packed it was on Saturday and Sunday mornings with 20-somethings (so beware). The hotel staff also grilled out hotdogs for us by the pool. While this hotel is one of the only ones in downtown Nashville with an outdoor pool, the pool area is very small and they only have about a dozen lounge chairs! Even though they say the pool doesn't open until 10am, I would get out there earlier to claim a chair if you're looking to enjoy the weather. The pool area can be a little reminiscent of a spring break years ago, but it never got rowdy or obnoxious - just crowded and people day drinking. Also the hotel is located within walking distance to all of downtown Nashville's attractions and is also within walking distance of the Gulch district. The hotel has a free shuttle service which can be hit or miss - it was convenient a couple of times and other times it was easier to just walk or flag down a cab. This is by no means a gorgeous or special hotel to stay at - it purely served as function for 12 Ohio girls having a bachelorette weekend. There are plenty of other hotels in the surrounding area if you're looking for some razzle dazzle.I visited Nashville for two nights with a few friends. The hotel was very close to the downtown/nightlife area on Broadway (about a ten minute walk). Check-in was pretty easy and the staff seemed very friendly.  The parking garage underground was a little small and hard to park in at times, but not a big deal.  $18/night for parking was a little much, but I think that's about normal.When I had reserved the room, I was told I could not get a microwave and fridge for the price I wanted. However, when we got to our room there was a microwave and fridge, so that was a nice surprise. The fridge, however, was not working so we called the front desk and they sent someone to fix it pretty quickly. The television did not have the clearest picture when we arrived, but the problem seemed to solve itself by that night.  After we got settled in we realized there were no towels in the room, so I had to call the front desk again to have them bring some up.  Also, the bathroom had no fan in it so whenever someone took a shower it became very hot and the mirror would be fogged from the steam for quite some time. This is a simple addition that makes all the difference!The only other problem I had with the room itself was the lack of outlets.  We only found two in the entire room and they were not in convenient locations. It was very difficult for four girls to get ready with hairdryers, curling irons, etc. Plus, trying to charge all of our phones and electronics was nearly impossible with only two outlets. I tried the breakfast one morning and it was decent for being free.  They had eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, plus various cereals and pastry items.  Altogether, we had a good stay at Holiday Inn Express. The location is ideal if you're planning to walk around downtown and go out on Broadway.  The price I paid was lower than all the other hotels I looked into.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Overall, I'd recommend staying here!Not sure who to blame - the hotel Manager or Priority Club.  To be fair: my Priority Club agent was very informative but his boss (if he really asked) was NOT.  Paula Oneal was of no help in getting me an exemption but maybe it's not her fault, it's Priority Club's ""policy"" to no longer ask for an exemption (which just means they don't do it anymore - but it wasn't impossible or an obscene request).  I was sent a gold embossed letter by Steven S. Sickel Senior VP of Multibrand and Relationship Marketing of InterContinental Hotels Group thanking me for being in their ""...top 1% of clientele across the globe."" I practically lived out of Holiday Inns for about 2 years - let's just guess say I spent upwards of $60,000 with them as a ruff guess.  I currently have over 180,000 priority points (left of who knows how many I accumulated before I starting cashing in on them) and was Platinum easy and almost Ambassador level (whatever that means and how I was not I'll never know) and now I need a hotel but the hotel ""has rooms for cash, but unfortunately for me not for rewards.""  Also, I paid what looks like a suite price for a double.  Again to be fair, it wasn't mentioned that this was a suite and I asked for ""a double.""  They had one night I could use the rewards but the 2nd night had to be cash ($240) to be exact. If I wasn't trying to stay at the same hotel as my family that is flying to town for a wedding and all staying in the same hotel, I would have used my points at another location - no big deal. BUT, I mentioned these things to the 5+ agents I spoke with over 2 days and was told sorry for ya.  If this is how someone in your top 1% of clientele WORLD WIDE is treated, I will gladly take all of my business elsewhere.  And I'm not a CEO paying for my staff's rooms, I personally stayed in the IHG hotels myself day in and day out across the south region.  Therefore, I think I deserve just a tad bit better treatment here.  I don't think I'm high and mighty, but what good is a letter of thanks for my EXTREME LOYALTY when it seems to be nothing more than a 10 cent piece of paper?  Is it the agents who took my very polite calls fault? No. Is it their managers' faults?  Who knows. Is it the hotel's fault? Not if she/he wasn't made aware of my circumstance.  It's a BS ""policy"" issue and whoever thought that would be a good idea without thinking about those of us who practically lived in their hotels ought to be held responsible.It seems that Priority Club cannot take care of their top customers, nor can IHG.  Hmmm, I stayed at Marriott one time and received a rewards club card for them, maybe they'll take better care of their loyal customers in the top 1% of their clientele.  I'm extremely dissatisfied as they are my points, I EARNED them, and now I cannot USE them.  Gee guys, thanks for nothin!(this is going on <a href=""http://Yelp.com"">Yelp.com</a> and anywhere else i can find to voice my opinion - sorry to the hotel itself, as it doesn't seem to be an issue with the hotel or mangers there, it is with Priority Club for being of no help)Easy to check in and the lobby is large. Coffee available all night and breakfast was better than the smaller Holiday Inn Express.The rooms were large and acceptable although old and the bed was a little hard but cant complain to much.The staff were very friendly and it was close to downtown in fact walking distance to all the nightlife and shopping.I would stay there againThe hotel was walking distance from so many attractions.  Lot's to do in Nashville and this was a great place to really relax. I stayed here with my family on vacation. The rooms were large-sized and very clean. Free breakfast is a plus and the front desk staff were very helpful in giving advice on places to go.  I will definitely comeback!

The service at the Vanderbilt Marriott is as good or better than any hotel I've stayed at.  The fitness room is excellent. The rooms are nice. The the big thing is that the staff are over the top nice and friendly. When in Nashville this is where I will stay.Good location. Friendly and responsive staff.Clean and comfortableGreat view of Vandy Stadium.  Close to downtownIt's a Marriott.Just expect that they'll gouge you.Ten bucks for wifi.Modern, updated hotel in a convenient location with pretty cool views of the Vanderbilt Stadium from your room...if only the UT vs. Vandy game was on while I was staying here!  The room was comfortable and the staff was very nice too!Lovey hotel with Ritz Carlton top shelf service, look and feel. You will enjoy the breathtaking views from your spacious, clean and comfortable room. The entire staff is readily accessible and caters to your every need immediately.   When traveling to Nashville don't miss the opportunity to stay at this gem of a Marriott. As a weekly traveler I can honestly say that this is the best property in the Marriott portfolio.I stayed at this hotel every week for 6 months while traveling to Nashville.  It's in a great location - you're across the street from a beautiful park, close to a lot of businesses and Vanderbilt, walking distance (or a short drive) from a lot of restaurants, but not right down town so it's a little easier to get in and out of the hotel.There's also a shuttle that will take you within a few files of the hotel until 11pm.The staff is extremely nice and welcoming.This is my first choice hotel when visiting the Nashville area.Nice enough place and friendly staff. The accommodations were absolutely perfect. Bed was big and comfy. Privacy was nice as well. However we were staying here for the rock n roll marathon and the staff was completely unaware of anything going on. They didn't know or have the shuttle running to the start line. Since they were listed on the marathon race site you would think they would have been prepared. We had to drive down there (2 miles) because they didn't know anything at the front desk. Breakfast times were out and ready until after we needed to be gone. Found this out later. It would have been nice if they were more prepared. Again I cannot complain about any of the accommodations as they were absolutely nice. Staff super friendly just uninformed about a major event in the city that any participants stayed at hotel. I'd stay here again if they have better race accommodations.Giving it two stars for the location.  In town for a concert behind hotel at Vanderbilt stadium.  Room was what you expect from Marriott.  The only issue was that the television did not work, but we were not in town to watch TV.  Let front desk know and they never responded to our issue.  My rating is like some of the other reviews.  Nightly rate of $359 for the room and $81 in local taxes.  $36.00 for valet parking.  Add in a couple of bar charges and my bill was close to $1100 for two nights.  This is the most I have spent for a Marriott outside of New York City at the Barclay Center Brooklyn Marriott.  I am a platinum member so I am familiar and used to the Marriott properties rates.  I know people can say you knew the rate going in, but with local tax and valet rate got high quickly.  I just feel that this hotel does not warrant these rates.This hotel has provided me with one of the best experiences of any hotel I have stay at in a long time. From the minute I walked in the door the staff has treated me with such kindness and respect, there are not enough words I can  say of how much gratitude I have for the staff here.  Everyone one was so extremely helpful and kind and always willing to help me no matter what and always with a smile. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone coming to Nashville!  It's the Bomb!!!We came here for the big convention and while our room was clean and comfortable, everything else was sub-par. We should've stayed at a Hampton (way better service). The convention had 70,000 people coming into town and the hotel only had one small shuttle that seats about 11-12. Half of the time the drivers either didn't answer their phones or turned them off entirely. The hotel gave the lame excuse of cell phone issues. Many people complained about this and nothing was done. Some of their guests missed the speeches because of the wait time.The breakfast buffet was absolutely a disaster and the hotel had the audacity to charge $25 for it. It was practically a basic continental breakfast. Nobody wanted to pay the outrageous price so everyone was trying to order from the kitchen. Our server informed us that it would take close to an hour to eat breakfast and we were pressed for time because of the convention.Bottom line...this hotel had years to prepare for what they knew would be a busy weekend and they were grossly inadequate, unprofessional and inconvenient. I would never return here again. It was a disaster to rely upon their services and judgement. The epitome of amateur hour.This vote was overpriced for the service I received . After staying here it is not a surprise it was the only hotel with available rooms on a holiday weekend. I was upcharged for everything from wifi to breakfast. The room was tiny. We were promised a king bed and pull out couch - but they were sold out - even though we made our reservation only an hour earlier ?  The entrance and valet are dangerous and confusing - we watched several people almost get hit by a valet driver. Save your money and go across the street to another hotel!This hotel has an IDEAL location, the shuttle was perfect, and we got a great deal on priceline.  The staff was SUPER friendly and helpful at all times.  This was my fourth trip to Nashville for pleasure, and second stay at this hotel.  I always choose this neighborhood for the location--close enough to the hubbub but in a fun, walkable neighborhood.  Again, the staff made us feel so welcome and attended to at all times--and you can't beat the Jenni's ice cream they have available for purchase in the sundries area; it was an addictive late night indulgence! From the Catbird Seat and Patterson House to Hog Heaven takeout at Springwater Supper Club, this neighborhood is a great place to hang out when you aren't in the mood for the Broadway scene.I stayed at this hotel for a week.  That was a long time for me.  Well I had a conference to attend and I just got back.  I was able to try some of their services.  The shuttle is convenient.  It is free just give them a tip if they drive you.  They can drive you within a 2 mile radius so basically downtown.  I only took the shuttle one time when I was by myself but the majority of times I took a taxi.  There were always cabs waiting outside of the hotel. Downtown is great to go to.  Lots of music and great food. My mom got to Nashville before I did so she was willing to wait for a nice room.  She did get a room with a view of the stadium.  There is always someone in the front or someone in the lobby that can help you.  If you have questions about where to eat then they will offer suggestions.  What I loved about this hotel is it's right across the street from the Parthenon replica.  I wanted to walk there more often but I couldn't wake up since I was on west coast time and we had the conference to attend in the morning.  THe evenings consisted of other site seeing opportunities that I had to take full advantage of.  Overall great experience in Nashville.  I hope to see Nashville again in the near future.I had a great experience here, although I can't speak to their parking situation ($30 for valet, I believe) or the quality of food at the restaurant, since I didn't eat there.I stayed here for 3 nights mid-April. The rooms were very spacious, clean, and comfortable, and one of our two double beds was brand new. Our room (628) offered a PERFECT view of the Vanderbilt football field so if you're in town for a game, you essentially could watch from the comfort of your room!The staff was super friendly, although I wish they would have mentioned the shuttle when we checked in (might have saved us some $ that first day). They offer a complimentary shuttle that goes anywhere in a 2-mile radius, so it's a quick and easy way to get downtown. All of the drivers were really nice, and of the 8-10 trips we took, there was only one time that was more than a 15-20min wait. (Most were around or much shorter than that.) The last run is at 11pm, so if you plan on making it a late night, you'll need to cab it back.Not sure if this is a thing they do often, but they had complimentary OJ &amp; champagne in the lobby to make your own mimosas one night. That was a nice little surprise.There's a Starbucks in the lobby which has free wifi, but you need to pay for it in the rooms. (For some reason, I was able to pick up the signal on my phone in our room, but my cousin wasn't able to on her tablet.)There are a few shops right next to the hotel - Barnes &amp; Noble, Bread Factory, a clothing boutique, and a PF Chang's, too - and lots of chain restaurants on that main drag of West End. Also a quick ride (or a leisurely 30min stroll) from Hillsboro Village, which has a few cute shops and restaurants.Next time I visit, I might stay somewhere a little closer to downtown for the sake of convenience, but if Vandy is your reason for visiting, this place is a great bet.Unimpressed, unimpressed, UN-impressed!   $300 a night and no complimentary breakfast??  $30 to park my car! Bed was uncomfortable, hotel is noisy and the room was mundane.   Go to the Hilton down the street, better service, better room, better price.Would have given this hotel more stars if the had not thrown a surprise parking fee at me. $21.89 for me to park MYSELF, not valet for ONE night. The person checking me in failed to inform me that I would be charged. I found out only when I saw it on my credit card statement. The hotel was otherwise nice and clean. No complimentary breakfast though. Crappy way to treat your customers in my opinion.We stayed here for 2 nights for a business trip with my company. I was very pleased with the location; about 15 minutes from the airport and 10 miles from downtown. They offer a free shuttle that takes you anywhere in Nashville within a 2 mile radius. That worked out great for us because we wanted to see and do alot! The shuttle service itself is worth 5 stars!The room was nice. It was simple but clean. Our window offered an amazing view of Centennial Park and the Parthenon. It was great to peak outside and watch families romp about. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby! 5 stars!Service was outstanding! Everyone was professional and helpful. We did not encounter a single person who wasn't pleasant. 5 stars!However, there wasn't free wifi which just seems wrong in this day and age. They wanted 10USD per day which was ridiculous. 3 stars!Food- Meh. I've experienced better. We had our holiday party in the ballroom, which was, btw, gorgeous. But the food wasn't very good. We also had Sunday brunch here which was pretty expensive for the goods that they served. I was very dissappointed.All in All, Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt University gets 4 stars! I would definitely recommend this hotel!This review is specifically for some of the staff who demonstrated excellent customer service. We had an especially great experience with Brody at the front desk, JD our shuttle driver, and Nick the bartender. They are all genuinely friendly and attentive. Thanks for the great service!Nice hotel. Very convenient to the University. Really nice that it is right next to a PF Chang's.  For the non-business traveler, there are hotels closer to the Nashville nightlife which are more interesting, more fun, have other guests who are tourists. If you are looking for a vacation hotel, this is definitely not your hotel.  For business it is definitely ""OK"".We have booked several groups here, some medium, some verging on large and the hotel staff has not been as accommodating as many other hotels where we do the same business traveler booking, including some less than a block away from this hotel. When our business group books here, I will stay here but in spite of my Marriott rewards, will not book business travel here when traveling by myself. Most other hotels I have stayed at in Nashville had some kind of nice little perk. This one has nothing but fee for this, fee for that, and higher room rates.I typically stay at a Marriott on business travel. This one is one of the lesser experiences in my travels. It is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, just that most other Marriott hotel experiences would encourage me to stay at a Marriott again while this one is a solid ""meh...""I'm really biased when it comes to hotels - my preferred brand is Starwood.  When traveling for work, I don't really get a choice and I have a budget to keep.I stayed at the Marriott at Vanderbilt University to attend a work conference.  The room was spacious and clean, but nothing that would make me feel like I do when I stay at the W or St. Regis... (yeah, I know...I'll shut up...).The staff is VERY friendly!The rooms could use some updating as they are looking really worn and out of date.  Price was reasonable for the location and they have a full bar and a pretty decent steak salad.","My company recently made the decision to strike a deal with Marriott, so now I have to stay at Marriotts whether I want to or not. So I may be a bit biased because I'm a Hilton girl. I miss my free internet, free bottles of water and even free breakfast depending on the Hilton. This Marriott wasn't giving anything away.  Self-parking was 22 bucks or valet for 24 bucks. Internet was 14 bucks.  Really? That's a bit preposterous.Ok, so I arrive at the Marriott and find out my Marriott number has not been associated with my reservation. This is not necessarily their fault as it could have been our travel agency, but the young lady checking me in couldn't look it up, which seemed a bit strange. She said she'd do it later, which she did. Also, during check-in, I found out they had decided to downgrade my room to a Double. Lovely. I'm tall and I need a Queen or King, but they gave me a Double because they gave away all the Kings, even though I had reserved a King. So that's what my company's partnership with Marriott gets us? Downgrades at their hotels? Grr. In all my years of traveling, the only hotels that have ever downgraded me or bumped me have been Marriotts. In fact, I have routinely gotten upgrades when staying at other chains. While I was checking in, there was another woman at the front desk complaining that Marriott had bumped her and she had to return to the Marriott, anyway, because she had to pick up packages that were shipped to her there. I felt terrible for her because I know that Marriott threw a major kink in her plans by giving her reservation to someone else. So as if I weren't grumpy enough about the prospect of sleeping with my feet hanging off the end of the bed, the beds in the room were just awful.  Hard and lumpy and bumpy. So after getting up at 5:00 a.m., I was still tossing and turning well past midnight because of the miserable bed.Otherwise the room was fine; standard hotel fare with nothing special. The facility was clean and overall seemed to be well-maintained, although there was some badly worn carpeting at the back entrance.Located in Nashville's West End, the hotel sits adjacent to Vanderbilt campus, across the street from Centennial Park. (I could see the Parthenon from the valet and Vanderbilt Stadium from my room!)All the staff were great. The front desk and valet folks exuded friendly customer service and were always ready to assist. This particular property also operates a complimentary shuttle that carries guests anywhere within a two mile radius.  One of the operators, Michael, was extremely helpful, recommending plenty of local restaurants with an exceptionally friendly demeanor. Hats off to the valet team. The lobby and cafe were very well designed, clean and aesthetically appealing. The rooms were okay but not the best. You could tell they've had wear and tear but the hotel does what it can to maintain a positive guest experience. Most importantly, it was pretty quiet throughout my stay. (Although, I have to mention it was a Monday and I was travelling on business. I can't imagine what the place is like during Vandy football games!) There is complimentary wi-fi in the room, provided you're a Marriott Rewards member. Guests who are not Rewards members are charged for internet, which can easily be charged to the room.There are plenty of restaurant choices - both chains and local fare - near the hotel, so you're definitely not limited in any way.  I didn't get a chance to see the workout room or the pool, but from what others have written, I wouldn't expect much. I did, however, see plenty of runners in the park and around campus. Overall, I'd definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends. There are a couple of other choices right around there (Holiday Inn, Lowe's, and a couple of others) but the Marriott proves an excellent value.Stay was okay for the price we paid.  Extras such as parking, breakfast etc were highly priced.Friendly staff but a little too chatty. Arrived at 10pm to one person behind the desk and a line of 8 ppl in front of meOne-day business meeting on the Vandy campus and we were booked at the Nashville Marriott.  Flew in Monday evening this week, checked out Tuesday, and this Marriott gave me a great first impression of the city.  I think hotels should really pay attention to that...the first time in any new city, most times one of  the first thing you're doing is checking into a hotel, and they can really make or break the visit for you.First, I have to say...I'm from Chicago and immediately, I loved the Southern hospitality.  We arrived in the rain, and from the moment the taxi pulled up, we were quickly and politely greeted, doors were opened, and bags were carried...I know this happens at most hotels, but it's just second nature here.  Same with front desk check-in.  We were personally walked to the elevator and they even pushed the buttons for us.  He showed us the restaurant/bar on the lower level where we could get coffee and breakfast in the morning and/or dinner that evening.  I could get used to this (well, not really, I'm a control freak, so this would make me edgy after a while).It's a very nice hotel in a great location.  Comparable to most Marriott's I've stayed in...just the right amount of 'upscale' to it but not too fancy.  We were right on the Vanderbilt campus and near Centennial park.  It was raining that evening, but we toured the campus and area in the car and drove by the Parthenon...amazing, btw!  It's within walking distance.  There are tons of shops along the same street too.My room was spacious and clean.  Furnishings were modern, nothing fancy. Extremely comfortable bed (no bed bugs...yes, I checked!), a flat-screen TV, ample closet and drawer space, huge bathroom, and the usual amenities (coffee maker, hairdryer, iron, etc.).  I loved the Bath &amp; Body works toiletries (aromatherapy line).   But the best part of my room was that it overlooked Vanderbilt Stadium.  Too bad there weren't any events going on that night.  I did peek out the window several times throughout the night, though, hoping to catch a glimpse of something going on in there.I slept well.  It was quiet and perfect since I was traveling on business.  This was my first time in Nashville, and when I come back (when, because this city is great!), I would definitely stay here again, whether it's for business or pleasure.  Next time, I might ask for a room with a view of the Parthenon.  Great hotel, perfect location.I have to start with the good: Well its a gorgeous Marriott in a hip little part of Nashville. Most of the people there were really nice. Especially the Valet. One of the key parts of this location is it's shuttle service to downtown. My sister and I went on a girls trip for my 30th birthday. We picked Nashville because we felt safer with it just being us two. Check in was a little hectic. We found out they over booked and even though we bought it the day prior we may not have a room. There was several people beside us being told they didn't have rooms either. All because of the ""tin can festival"" (Or because you over booked.... nothing makes your husband feel safer than knowing you are hundreds of miles from home and homeless in Nashville.)So let's get to the shuttle driver who absolutely ruined our evening and I'm so glad to be alive to be able to write this. Your probably thinking we just were stuck with a bad driver. It actually has nothing to do with his driving. Our shuttle driver was an older guy (in his 60s-70s) and we first got in with another group of males. The group of guys were giving us suggestions about good places to go. When the guys went to get out of the car they tipped him a $5 and got out. The driver slammed the van in gear saying ""cheap mother f****rs"" and he was irate. Then he started talking to us how he overheard that we were from Southern Missouri. He started talking about some girl he dated from Hayti, MO named Charlene and how he could still taste her to this day. I don't want to go into to many details on here because it makes me puke in the back of my mouth. Well my sister who was a little taller than I could see him looking at me licking his lips on a few occasions and when I got out of the van he leaned back to look up my dress. We were so glad to get out of the car when we did that I had him drop us off at the first bar at the strip. We literally felt like one of those people that was going to be raped and murdered any second. We talked to management about this when we got back. They acted concerned. Took our statement but we never heard back. On Saturday night we used priceline and it gave us this hotel again. We talked to the valet and the valet guy said this guy has been reported before but management never does anything. Needless to say we took a cab the rest of our trip. Honestly, the hotel is beautiful. I could see me staying here over and over besides this experience.The worst hotel experience of my life! This might have been circumstantial but the Marriott main of should be ashamed of the service that I received.Long story short, I shut the door behind me with my key inside.  Went to the front desk, and they told me it is not a problem.  However, the manager that night had an inactivated master key and told me that he could put me up in another room, but they could not let me in to retrieve my stuff until the next morning until maintenance returned to work.  After fighting them for the 3 hours they finally decided to call their ""engineer"". As soon as he showed up I was in my room in 4 seconds. Why wasn't he called to begin with? I will never know.   I asked the front desk what would they do if a baby was locked in the room? Their answer: ""probably"" call the police...They should really have a master key that works, that could have been a serious situation luckily for them it wasn't.After my horrific experience I was then greeted by a dick of a valet the next morning.  I gave him a modest tip of $5 dollars considering my experience, a 20 minute wait for the car, and the $26 dollars that I already was billed.  The valet had the nerve to inform that there was an ATM inside if I needed more money for a tip. All in all I do have a tip to offer, do not stay at this Marriott and expect the customer service that comes with the Marriott name.  If you pretend that this is a red roof inn you will it will exceed your expectations for the shitty service that you receive.  Finally, I called the Marriott main office and they said they could not do anything to compensate me for my terrible, experience because this particular Marriott is a franchise.The good -Great location in Nashville's West End.  Literally right up against the Vanderbilt University stadium...I wonder what a room goes for on game weekends?  I could see 3/4's of the field from the window in my room.Valet area is hectic but pretty efficient.  And they always say hello and open the door for you.Staff in various parts of the hotel were very friendly and several times I was asked how my stay was going, did I need anything, etc.  Nice touch.The bad - Seems to be a very busy hotel, lots of guests and lots of them seem to be in the mood to party and have fun.  I get it....it's Nash Vegas and all, but I got a little tired of all of the noise in the hallway on my floor.  I didn't complain to management, but did mention it to them when they asked how my stay had been so far.  They said ""sorry"" but didn't offer to do anything about it.  I was staying there for a business trip and needed to get a good night's sleep (I was there 4 nights) so I'd recommend this hotel as a place to stay if you are visiting Nashville for fun, but maybe not for a business trip.The pool is indoors.  Fitness room is very small for a hotel of this size.Overall, it's on the ""nice"" end of the Marriott scale and the location is very convenient.   You can walk to many shops &amp; restaurants in the West End and Broadway is a short cab ride away.Would be 5 stars but they charge $30 for valet parking. Everything else about the hotel is great!One of the best Marriotts I have visited.  Friendly staff, great food, and clean comfortable room.  Great location as well.  JChill little spot in Marriott.I had the pleasure of coming into Nashville for about 24 hours, and this is where my company put me up during my brief visit.The Superb:  Very helpful staff.  The rooms were large and clean with some incredibly comfortable beds.  Surprisingly good food available from the bar/room service.  Free shuttle to downtown!!The Norm:  Rather expensive drinks at the bar (even more than normal for a hotel bar).  The Horrid:  You have to pay for internet?!?!  WTF!?!I still can't get too excited about Marriott's in general, but this place was not that bad.Great staff that is very friendly and helpful.  I stay here about every three months.  The rooms are clean and comfortable and the rates are decent.  Vanderbilt is a beautiful campus and there is a nice big park right across the street.  There are good bar and food options up and down the road (West End) and you are only about 10 minutes from downtown via taxi.We wanted a hotel ""in"" the action, and apparently this is as close as Nashville gets. It's a fine hotel, pretty basic, and all of the staff members we encountered were quite friendly. They've got a little convenience store downstairs in case you forget anything and a fantastic shuttle that'll take you downtown or anywhere you need to go within a couple of miles. The driver was super friendly and I'd definitely recommend taking advantage of it, as the parking situation is not good.The garage is attached to the hotel, but you've got to walk outside to get between. And most of the spots in the lot are reserved for the sleep disorder clinic that happens to be located on the 5th floor of the hotel. Yes, sleep disorders. And yes, we were on the 6th floor and had a bed jumping competition. You can't tease kids at heart with that kind of thing.So, back to the parking garage. It's got a long weird creepy hallway, and good luck if you want to park there when there's a game at the stadium next door, as it looks like pretty much all of the spots are a no-go for the hotel at that point. And at $20/day, well, it's not cheap. They also charge for wireless: $10/day. And you can't have more than one device use it for your room, which is kind of silly. Definitely Priceline this spot: at full price this would be a 2-star.If you are looking to stay close to Downtown but not right in the noise .. stay here .... you are only about 5 minutes away from the Downtown area and right in front of the college campus at Vanderbuilt. It is real close and within walking distance to food and entertainment.STAFF: The staff was so friendly; the valet staff, the front desk staff, the bartenders etc ....ROOMS: The rooms were clean and layed out great, especially if you are sharing a room as I did. The two bed room was roomy and the bathroom was not up in your business. There was enough room to move, lay your bags out, iron your clothes, and still have a walk way. VIEW: I don't know what everyone elses view was but I had a view of The Parthenon!!!!! It was amazing! I got to take a peek at the beautifully lit Parthenon every night before bed!PRICE: The price I paid was on a Friends and Family rate so it was definitely reasonable. I am not sure what the going rate is with no discount, but it would really be worth it. Overall, a great hotel. Clean and friendly staff .. what more do you want.Stayed one night here on a road trip from Dallas to North Carolina. Good rooms, great service and extremely fast (and good!) in-room dining.One of the only Marriotts I've stayed at that got every single personal request right, down to the exact view of the Parthenon that I'd requested. It couldn't have been any better...""It's a hotel room."" My husband and I said. Then the surprise came when we opened the curtains to see a full on view of the Vanderbilt football stadium. Super cool. I was surprised when we pulled up that the valet service didn't budge. Being the only car under the port and they just watched me get the heavy bag out of the trunk. Ordered a venti latte at the Starbuck's within and got half foam and only a third of coffee. It's also hop, skip and a jump to anywhere in Nashville from here but plan for the traffic. They are eager to clean the rooms! Service staff came back twice within an hour early. But it was clean and the front desk staff were quick to service. I still say Marriott has the most comfortable beds.This place is really overpriced.  Be wary if you book using Priceline or <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>, etc.  You get no extras (like the comp breakfast, etc. despite these being listed in the guest book in your room) and you will pay a hefty $21 daily for parking.  The staff is hit and miss.  While one front desk woman was very helpful and courteous, another front desk man was brusk.  Because some people pay more, there are different levels of service and amenities, which left us feeling like steerage class on the Titanic.  The parking was a minor mess with three different employees telling us three different things.  The parking garage, which is the only available parking in the area, does not accept the card the desk presents to you as a guest, so you have to explain to the attendant what's going on each time you leave.  We actually had to argue with an attendant that we were hotel guests and already paying $21 a day.  When we presented her with the plastic card the front desk had given us, she said we were wrong and we had to pay.  It wasn't until we shut off the car and blocked the exit that she called the hotel.  Then, with no apology, she let us through.  No apology ever came from the desk either.  The room is nice, but I would not stay here again.  There are other places that are nicer.  It really paled compared to the Regency Legacy in Lexington where we stayed the day before arriving in Nashville.  Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.This isn't a bad hotel, and I paid $75/night for it (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a>) normally the hotel went for 159/night. My issues are whenever you go to a ""higher scale"" hotel you get ""up charged"" on EVERYTHING!  They charge 9.99/day for internet &amp; 14.99/person for a cheap breakfast.  Other hotels in the area (such as Drury Inn) give you free wifi - free breakfast - AND a free happy hour.  The Drury Inn is normally 85/night (not sure what you could get on priceline (maybe $50???)) but that is a far cry better than the Marriott. Not to forget mandatory valet parking at $22.00/day (free at Drury Inn).So for internet (9.99) + breakfast (14.99) + parking (22.00) equals an additional $46.98/day - something to strongly consider before booking here.  While I only got this hotel for $75/night, I would have felt RIPPED OFF if I had paid the $159.00/night!! Don't do it, save yourself and your company a lot of money!Pros: People are really nice -- all around.  Great workout room (scale is broke - we called and complained twice about it - with no response given to our complaints).The cherry on top of my Nashville trip! We had Christmas dinner at this hotel bistro and I had the best service I've had in a very long time as well as some of the best food. Despite being under staffed they made up for it in a number of ways like grabbing me a sweet vandy t shirt for finishing my huge steak and topping off our wines!!! A special shout out for Jordan for being extra hospitable! From now on ill be coming to THIS hotel for my Nashville stays! Blown away by such excellent service, more places should certainly take example.","This is a beautiful hotel in an area where there aren't a lot of great hotels to choose from.  Right on a main drag in Nashville, next to Vanderbilt and not far from Belmont University.  To a person, the staff was friendly and helpful, including the valets.  Which brings me to the downside of staying at this place.  Parking.  Because of the shortage of spots in the lot (which the hotel shares with a successful restaurant), the valet service is the main alternative.  Ultimately, we discovered we could self-park in the nearby garage, but that was more expensive than using the valet.  A little inconvenient if you need easy access to your car.I was surprised at how seriously overprices this hotel is given its close proximity to Vandy and that the rooms are actually going to set you back only 20% less than the Hutton or Loews which are FAR better.  They have some cute 'boutique' touches with upscale hall furniture, but the rooms and amenities are not impressive.  You'll be nickel and dimed for wifi, pushed out of your room by a very loud housekeeping staff.  Room air conditioning units are painfully/disruptively loud, the concierge service is pretty much phoning it in and rooms don't have basic upscale items like a sewing kit, bathrobe, make up mirror.  On the plus side, they have a small store in the lobby and an upscale bar.  Food is standard and overpriced, so I would walk the couple blocks to Stony River or across the street to PF Changs.  The best thing about this place is the location.  Parking is pricey - $25/day but you can negotiate somewhat.  There is nothing spa like about this location.  Pillows are uncomfortable and beds are nothing to rave about.  All in all, a disappointing experience.  If you're spending the money, go to the Hutton.  Food is better, service is awesome and beds are heaven.We stay at this Marriott several times a year while in Nashville.  The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable about the area.  The rooms are always clean and comfortable.  The bar area is perfect for socializing and we love the weekend breakfast buffet - especially the great prices if you're a Marriott Rewards member.A nearby hotel overbooked and gave away my prepaid room which kind of ruined my day but I ended up at the Marriott Vanderbilt and I'm so happy I did. The Marriott Vanderbilt offers service that rivals The Four Seasons Hotels which are really the gold standard in hospitality service. Every member of the staff at the Marriott Vanderbilt goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. When I checked in the desk staff really improved my day. I had an opportunity to eat at both restaurants here and the food was top notch as well as a good value. It seems like even the big brand hotels are struggling to provide mediocre service while the staff here are delivering exceptional service every day. I was happily surprised by this hotel and I suspect you will be too.I continue to be disappointed in the Marriott properties, except for Courtyard.  This hotel is overpriced and charges $10 per day for internet.  My room was a little banged up and dusty.  Room service is ridiculous and the portions are enough for 4 people including $9 for a bowl of oatmeal.  So much WASTE.   The best part about this hotel were the valet and bartenders.  The location is good, but I think we'll be staying somewhere else when we visit Nashville again.Great hotel.  Love the location, close to everything in Nashville.  Staff was great!  Love the beds.Was here for a conference and dinner. Everything was very nice, but it's ""old money"" nice. Meaning: if your wasteful, you must be rich. All guests were given the same 3 course meal. HUGE sized, very rare, medium quality steaks. But no option to take home any left overs. Easily thousands of pounds of beef was wasted in one evening. I guess it means your rich and important when homeless people are literally across the street and you can put a whole steak in the trash. Don't even get me started about the dessert. 10 cheese cakes per table. About 7 untouched per table, all in the trash. Seriously! The facilities are amazing, but I won't be back until they straighten up their wasteful act.This Marriott is great! The people are all very helpful and accomodating. I had to get a package shipped here during my stay, and they made sure it got to me safely. We stayed during the CMA Music Festival, and it was pretty crowded but we were able to get the shuttle almost anytime we wanted it. The shuttle drivers were all so helpful and kind. I will definately be back!I'm a frequent business traveler and this is a WONDERFUL hotel.  The staff are great.  It doesn't take too many regular stays before they learn your name and try to make you feel like home.  Its a great location for business travelers since I can stay here and always be going the opposite way of traffic.  It is close to great restraunts and they also have a convenient shuttle.I told myself I would write a review of this place when I got home. This review is for their customer service. I went there thinking it was the Courtyard and they were not very nice to me. They were actually pretty snooty about it. So I left.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/home-2-suites-by-hilton-nashville,Home 2 Suites by Hilton,4.5,$$,37,"Stay at this hotel!! Staff is awesome.Rooms are very very clean. Breakfast is ok..you can tell hotel staff  takes pride in their jobs and place of business.There is a shuttle and they try their best but some times you will have a 15 - 20 minute wait.Let's talk about SERVICE. A week prior to our arrival in Nashville, I called to inquire about leaving an ice cream cake in a freezer prior to check-in.  Chris at the front desk couldn't have been more helpful. Fast-forward a week and I had the chance to meet Chris in person when we checked in. He was equally nice in person and remembered the conversation though we didn't even use the freezer after all. Then we met Jessica, who wouldn't stop until she found me some hand lotion to soothe my aching hands from the nasty Nashville weather. And Nekaya, who offered to print our Ryman concert tickets from her personal email since the hotel computer wasn't playing nice with Adobe. OH! And, the desk staff who lent us their personal umbrellas since the rain just wouldn't quit?! Throw in awesome shuttle drivers who were ready and willing to take us within a 3-mile radius and you basically have a perfect stay. Did I mention the Belgian waffle maker at the complimentary continental breakfast? The waffles are shaped like Texas, but I didn't care. They were DELICIOUS.  AND the pool-size jacuzzi?!? It's a POOL-SIZE HOT TUB! My only thought might be that the walls are a tad on the thin side. Not a huge deal since most of the clientele are quieter business travelers, but I do wish housekeeping could've kept their conversations a little lower in the mornings.  I hate to even say that, but it's the only negative in an otherwise exceptionally positive experience.Thank you Home 2!I am so impressed by this place. Let me start with the staff. The staff is helpful and accomodating. They are always happy to see you! Jessica checked me in and remembered my name after I haven't seen her in 6 days. Thats impressive! The other staff will ask you how your day is going, and they always have a smile on their face. The room-a nice home away from home. It has all of the essentials you may need for your extended stay. The gym-the best gym I've seen in a hotel. You can do your laundry while you are working out, which is really cool. The workout room has an elliptical, two treadmills, a bike, a yoga ball, multiple weight medicine balls, dumb bells, a mat, and a multiple-workout machine. You can get a decent workout in this place...which is definitely different from most hotels/suites. The food-breakfast was great every morning! They have good coffee (that is hard to come by) and a semi-hot breakfast. It's a really cool idea really. So they have a bin with refrigerated, packaged omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, and scrambled eggs with mixed meats and/or veggies. They have a number on the top. They make it fail-proof because all you have to do is stick it in the microwave and press the number thats on the top of the wrapper. Then voila...you've got a delicious breakfast. They also have several selections of yogurt (including greek and regular), milk and cereal, hot oatmeal, and typical continental bagels, waffles, and OJ/juices. On the weekends, they even do biscuits and gravy. I stayed at this place for 8 days and will be staying here in the future year due to school requirements. I'm looking forward to it. These people treat you like family and the place just has a good vibe about it...plus it's within walking distance to several top-notch restaurants and Vanderbilt hospital and university. I couldn't ask for more!!I was very impressed with this Home 2 Suites. This is the best hotel I've been to in a long time and the funny thing is, it cost less than all the hotels I've been too recently and was the best looking. It has a very contemporary and modernized design and decor. I loved my room and the lobby area was nice also. For breakfast, they had prepackaged omelets. I was a little weary of them but they were actually really good! Only thing is, they did not list that they had pork in them and the pieces were so small that I did not realize it until i was down to the last bite, since I was working and eating at the same time (so I wasn't paying attention).The hotel offers free WiFi...YES!!! And set directly across the street from the building I was training in. Was only a 1 minute walk, super convenient! My only complaint is that I wish they had a bellboy because I was stuggling with my luggage! Had to make 2 trips to the car.I'm so glad the Marriott I was supposed to stay at was booked. I would definitely stay here again.Wow, I could not have been happier with my stay at this hotel. By far the accommodating group of professionals I have ever had the pleasure of meeting in a hotel. As soon as we arrived Betty greeted us with a smile and was very helpful changing our arrangements due to the snow storm arriving the following day. During our 5 day stay we got to know the whole crew Mary, Nekeya, Chris, Darryl, Janina and Denita. Even with power outages and 8 inches of snow this group was as nice and friendly as they could possibly be. It didn't matter if we needed cabs, shuttles, bar recomondations, tums or waffles this fantastic group made it happen. This is the only hotel I will ever stay in upon my return to Nashville. You guys rock!!!!The shining star of this hotel is the staff.  Every single person I came across, from the desk clerk to maintenance were fantastic.  Whether they were or not, each person seemed genuinely happy you were staying there and always greet you.  The cost for this location is very reasonable and the rooms are a great size.  It's within walking distance to several restaurant and the hotel has a shuttle with a 3 mile radius. I would stay here again.Very convenient hotel location if you are in downtown. Walking distance to a lot of restaurants. Has a hotel shuttle within 3 miles radius. They have free wifi which is awesome. The front desk staff is very accommodating and friendly. Would definitely stay here again if ever I go back and visit Nashville.What a fantastic little hotel! Aside from being a new Hilton property, the staff really make this place a great hotel to stay in. They are more than happy to go above and beyond - holding/receiving packages for free, loaning out yoga mats from their gym so you can head to a free yoga class, and always keeping a plentiful supply of green apples and Nutella at the front desk for you to snag throughout the day. The rooms were a bit not quite to my liking - the walls were a strange off white/yellow color, something you could find in an older hotel. The furniture and accessories feel a bit retro, but I don't know if that's all part of the design or if it was just me. If you are planning to park at the hotel, I would strongly suggest looking for street parking across from the hotel - otherwise you'll be hit with a $20/night (plus tax) charge at the end of your stay. That's a hefty bill for self parking. Do take advantage of the hotel courtesy shuttle - they'll drop you off and pick you up from downtown, Vanderbilt, wherever you need to go within reason. Be sure to tip your driver.ATTN: they charge you TWICE and THEN take the additional charge off a couple of days later. So if your room was $339.00 for the one night, they charge you $678.00 but they said they would take it off a couple of days later so you only pay the $339.00. They said the first charge is for the reservation and then afterward is the actual charge for the room. They shouldn't be doing this bc people need their money!! Some people can't afford to wait 3 business days to get that $339.00 back. Ridiculous. Other than that it's a fantastic place to stay. It's very expensive but nice.I was going to give 3 stars but they ended up rewarding me with Hilton points and ""making it right"" despite my frustrations so that made it better for me. However my shower was lukewarm at best every morning, and don't expect nice amenities in the room as this is very bare bones accommodations. Also the breakfast only lasts from 6-9am but I will say the offerings they had were pretty good (Greek yogurt,etc) the shuttle was dirty and smelled weird but I guess I can't complain because it was free right? Also if you need to fedex something be advised that they will send it out for you but unlike originally told they do not have the ability to help you pack your box. Overall this is by far my least favorite of the Hilton brands for me. I would much rather stay at a Hampton over a home2 in the future.I give this hotel 5 stars for their honesty.  I left a box of jewelry in the bathroom on the vanity that included my wedding ring, wedding bands,  two Silpada necklaces, and a pair of earrings.  I did not discover that I had left my jewelry for a period of 48 hours.  When I called to see if anyone had found my jewelry the manager of housekeeping said nothing was turned in, I panicked.  The next morning, the assistant manager of housekeeping, Wesley, called me to tell me he had ALL of my jewelry, thank you to Melissa who turned it in.  About the hotel,  like their healthy breakfast and unlimited apples &amp; Nuttela they provide  throughout the day.  The staff at check in is always super friendly.  They also have a complimentary shuttle that will take you downtown at night. The driver is also super friendly, Ryan.  We like the fact we can bring our dogs and they get a warm welcome!!!We checked in late due to our travel south being late.  The friendly staff was ready for us,including our four legged family.  Clean spacious room.  Taste breakfast with a new twist.  Easy check out.  Would stay again.I absolutely LOVE this hotel. The rooms feel like IKEA showroom apartments and there are a ton of features on property that are unique. - Rooms: perfectly laid out so they are cozy but include tons of counter space, a fridge, dishwasher, disposal, coffee maker, microwave, nice TV, plenty of outlets, shampoo and body wash dispensers in the bathroom, a sofabed, dishes, silverware...- Pool: it's actually a jetted, warmed indoor hot tub. - Included breakfast: oatmeal, breakfast sandwiches (premade that you heat up - but good) cereal, fruits, toast, muffins/bagels, waffles, juice/coffee/tea. There is a main community style table that sets a cheery tone and encourages interaction with other guests. - Gameroom: Xbox and board games. - Laundry: like a laundromat. - Fitness Center: Small but clean.- Grills you can use on the patio outside. - Free shuttle within 3 miles of the hotel. There's likely more I'm missing but these are the amenities we used. Another nice thing is that there is a to. To do in walking distance. As well as try the famous Hattie Bs Hot Chicken!  I would live here if I could :)Awesome stay!!!! My girl friend and i wanted to get away for two days so we decided to stay at this hotel and explore nashville. The staff were awesome and very nice, def will be back!Truly loved this hotel. Loved the room and even thou they didn't find us a room for the second night will stay there whenever we visit our family. Didn't give them 5 stars because the room door didn't clise and when we went out was left open (we thought someone came in) but ut was just the lock. Also tgere is no guest parking, you have to pay but the hotel is not downtown so that shouldnt be the case.Other than that loved itI cannot believe this hotel is highly rated. As a frequent traveler- visiting a hotel with high reviews - that is what I expected. Awful! Never again would I stay here or stay at another Home2suites - not a good acquisition Hilton! Gross clientele. It's obvious many staying here are living here (think extended stay rentals!) Do not like the European vibe/feel. Think IKEA in a hotel! The carpet is so dirty I cannot walk on it barefoot at all without my feet turning black. Bed was comfy. That's all the positive I can say. Do not stay here!Obsessed. That's all I can say. I LOVE this hotel and not even for major reasons. Let's start with how NICE the front desk staff is. Even with a line behind me they were taking the time to get to know you a little bit. Other hotels I have felt rushed or that I'm just another person paying. They allow pets which is awesome! I believe it's $60 a night but they knocked it down to $20 for us. (We had a small cat and a puppy)The room was super nice! Very simple but new, spacious and very clean. The shower has massive shampoo and soap dispensers. Very environmentally friendly - two flushing options on toilets, power saving light switches along with a master switch to make sure no lights are left on, recycling everywhere. The hotel is home to suites and they really did a great job of making it feel a little more like a home verse a hotel room. Breakfast is provided and they only really have one massive table and a few smaller. I loved this because everyone was sitting together and conversing about why they were in town. The beds. Ohhhhhh, the beds. Amazing! So comfortable - it feels like they use an updated, foam top bed. Their sheets are so soft and amazing that they actually sell them! The front desk said so many people were requesting where they got them that they starting providing a way to purchase them for your own home! This hotel is in a great location right in the middle of midtown. Parking at the hotel is an extra 20 a night. Overall - fantastic experience! Not only will I stay here again if I'm ever in Nashville but I'll look for H2S hotels during other vacations!Very clean hotel with excellent service and staff. Love to see the Hilton brand expanding. This is a very wise venture, and I look forward to seeing more of these. Very convenient to downtown/Broadway...easy shuttle service until midnight on the weekends...or a $10 cab ride. Excellent hotel!!Paying for parking in addition to the room was irritating. We stopped here to spend the night in Nashville on our way aback from visiting family over the holidays. (2000 mile trip round trip) we did not have a do ""not disturb""sign in our room to their defense, but after making such a long drive, all we wanted was to sleep in. The knocking from housecleaning began at around 9am. We were woken up a total of 6 times. Check out was at noon, the seventh knock came at five til 12 (after I had called the front desk to explain the situation.) Now we are driving back to Dallas irritated and tired. I don't think we'll be staying here next time we are passing through.Stayed her on a business trip and was very impressed with my stay.  Staff is super friendly (actually the nicest staff I have ever met).  This place has everything you want, microwave, dishes, cups, dishwasher, fridge, big tv, and internet.  Location is great as well, next to Music Row, and about a 10min walk to Vanderbilt.  And a 20 min walk to downtown.They also provide a free shuttle within 3 miles.They do provide a small breakfast with fruit, hard boiled eggs, and waflles.  (if you want go next door to the Hilton Garden Inn for a $12 breakfast buffet).Oh, and they do have a small (but nice) gym and self service laundry area.I didn't check out the pool, but I heard it was nice.","This was my first stay at the Home2 line by Hilton.  As I've stated before, I'm a Hilton girl all the way - the consistant quality of customer service, soft towels and sheets, modern decor never lets me down.  The staff at the Nashville Home2 was excellent - going above and beyond to provide us with tips and info on where to go on our short stop over.  I had asked the valet attendent a question and when I came back out, he had gotten a map and highlighted a suggested route with additional information of things to see in that same area.  The kitchen area in the room, although I did not need it on this trip, was fully stocked and would make for a great room for longer stays.We will be staying here the next time we are in Nashville.This place was wonderful.  We were very nervous because this was our first time in Nashville, but everything worked out wonderfully!Airport:There is no shuttle from the airport to the hotel.  However, it was extremely easy (practically in-your-face easy) to find the taxi stand after baggage claim.  The taxi driver knew exactly where our hotel was, and it was a flat rate from the hotel of $27, and about a 10 minute drive.Check-In:The customer service was unbelievable.  The desk clerk let us check in when we got there (and gave us the room keys - we were EXTREMELY early) and gave us very good tips on the city.  There is a great free breakfast every morning too!Hotel:Perfect.  In your room you get a small kitchen, which we used to eat-in one night, then a mini living room, and finally your bed!  The bed is a little small if you are used to a king, but it was very comfortable.  Free wifi is nice, and the restaurant in the hotel next door delivers.  You are also just steps away from the Gulch, which from what I understand is one of their names for a neighborhood.  There are a lot of nice restaurants to try out!Downtown:There is a free, yes, free, shuttle that runs from the hotel to anywhere downtown!  You just call the guy and he picks you up in minutes!  The guys who drove the shuttle were so nice and the shuttle was always clean.  For our first trip down there, the driver even gave us a tour!We could not have ask for a better hotel. I highly recommend staying here!  It was the best price with the best location. The room we very nice, clean, with anything thing you could need. The employees were very nice and helpful.Fantastic option.  NICE 1 bedroom apartment-type accommodations.  Very modern, very IKEA.  The kids loved it.  Local restaurants will deliver to the room.  You do have to pay for parking, but they'll do a free shuttle around the area.  VERY clean.  There was a mix up with the room when we got here, but they took care of it right away.  We will definitely stay here again.  VERY reaonable prices.You can bring your pets!  Even have a dog exercise area.  $75 for the entire stay.Good value, clean, studio apartment type rooms. Staff is SUPER friendly and courteous!My wife and I stayed here twice on a road trip through the south. Two nights when we arrived in Nashville and one night when we got back to Nashville 2 weeks later. They remembered us and even gave us the discounted rate I booked 2 weeks earlier.The place seems new and everything is clean and in good shape. The rooms we reserved had plenty of space, a kitchenette, a couch and the linens were actually softer and more comfortable than the ones I have at home. They have a gym and a pool. Wifi is free. Breakfast is included and they have a pretty good spread with fresh fruit, granola, breads, bagels (they have a toaster), waffles, yogurts, cereals, oatmeal, juices, etc. They allow dogs which is nice for people traveling with the whole family (dog included). I couldn't smell or hear any dog at any time.It's directly accross the street from The Cat Bird Seat and The Patterson House, two really cool places spots for people who care about quality food and drink.It was a comfortable stay and I'd go back if I'm back in Nashville again. I'm only giving 4 stars because they actually wanted to charge $20 a night for parking in their garage (a large garage). They weren't pushy about it or anything, receptionist even told me where to find street parking, but $20 a night is still ridiculous for paying guests.What a great place with friendly staff, comfortable beds, clean rooms and free breakfast. It's conveniently located to downtown Nashville and perfect for a weeks long, or overnight stay. Enjoy!Modern style motif with fun nashville flair. We got the handicap accessible room which doesn't have the pull out couch, but they offered cots.  Free continental breakfast, free wifi, free shuttle within 3 miles of the hotel. Clean, good price, easy check in, superb service, loved this place!Very good value! This is one of the cheaper options in Nashville, but yet is a great place to stay. The room was very clean, and the staff was really helpful and friendly. One complaint was when we got the rate for the room it did not say anything about parking (which was $20 a day), and there were LOADS of random taxes put on our bill which made the room about $50 more per night than we expected. I understand that parking in the city is always an issue, I just wish they would tell you upfront or include the parking in the rate of the hotel. Also, the continental breakfast is cool but EXTREMELY busy. We stayed on a weekend, and went downstairs for breakfast around 9am and there were so many people we were unable to find a seat, much less any food. After waiting for about 10-15 minutes for some clean plates and fresh food, we finally gave up on breakfast and headed back to our room. So my only real suggestion is take the ""free"" breakfast in stride. But overall the experience was good, and the quality was good for what we paid.The staff is wonderful &amp; the hotel is very clean and well managed! We had an amazing stay here!Property only has one suiteI gave them another star simply because the manager called me after my last stay and that goes a LONG way with me. I didn't ask for a call, but they called based on some feedback. WAY TO GO!I much prefer a full service hotel to this ""express version"" without a restaurant.   but they do have full service prices:  $3 for a bottle of Dasani water - and make sure you ask how much parking will cost you!  Expensive!   I call it a ""big room"", not a suite.   The cousin, Embassy, is a suite - Home2 is not.   A big shower curtain separating the little bed from the little couch doesn't make it a suite.And the pillows on the bed are like little kid pillows.   Very disappointing.  I guess the small pillows are supposed to make the bed look bigger.  The decorating is like a dorm room with bad Ikea imitation furnishing.  Another shower curtain over ""the closet"".   Ugly cheap blind with no curtain.  The plus side:  very friendly staff; wifi is include (as it should be); nice TV but doesn't line up well with the bed; This is my first impression,  I'll update with my post check-out review.Very comfortable, clean, friendly staff, easily accessible location. If you are staying in Nashville and want to avoid constantly eating out, this home style option is a great alternative. I especially liked the separate living, sleeping areas...very enjoyable and relaxed stay.We highly recommend the Home2Suites on Division st. In Nashville, TN. We stayed there almost three weeks and it felt just like a second home. The staff is very kind and helpful. They took good care of us. This particular hotel is comfortable, clean, and convenient. If you are heading to Nashville- you will want to stay here!!!I was unfamiliar with the Home 2 Suites line of Hiltons but stayed here recently. I'm really glad I did. I was traveling for work and was by myself but I think this would be a really good option for families. There was a full kitchen, a sitting area and a bed that you could close off with a curtain. All of the rooms have iHomes and other nice options that make it really comfortable. There's a free continental breakfast with healthy options - cereal, yogurt, etc. The staff was outstanding - they were all helpful, knowledgeable and extremely pleasant.New, modern, clean, and

http://www.yelp.com/biz/clarion-hotel-nashville-downtown-stadium-nashville,Clarion Hotel Nashville Downtown - Stadium,3.0,$$,40,"Stayed one night and I was super satisfied with the professionalism of the staff and the layout of our room. My wife and I will return.Cost: $116.00 single bed room.Room: Looks like it has been updated, I enjoyed the large bathroom on the second floor and knowing it's for handicapped guest.  Their bed was super comfortable!Free wifi!!!!!!!!! Super Plus...Enjoyed the bar and free breakfast!Whoever took the promo-pictures for this hotel deserves an award for special effects! This hotel is in a terrible neighborhood up against an elevated interstate an active train track and an industrial tow lot. Everything -- even the trash cans -- have been smashed/scratched/dented. The paper products are thinner than tissue. The floor in the room is filthy, and neither the sink or tub will drain. TV is fuzzy for no apparent reason. Bathroom smelled as if someone had just used it and the toilet would have been running all night had I not fixed it myself. I could go on-and-on... This may as well have been a $39/night roadside motel in a bad neighborhood. Pay the extra cash and go somewhere else. You'll be glad you did.UPDATE: Because I had such a bad experience I thought it best to contact Clarion directly. Instead of opening a dialogue with me about my stay I received a response from the manager who called my honest review an 'attack' on him and his staff. I guess now I know why this place is in such a sad state.Industrial Ghetto. Lipstick on a pig assessment by another user was Accurate. Old building. It smells. Like paint over mold maybe? Carpet glue? Has no bell service. Space feels crammed. Bad neighborhood. Traffic freeway noise. It IS Not downtown as Priceline says. Parking is poor. Security is high. Why? Again: Industrial Ghetto.We came late and had a late checkout. The front desk was friendly and helpful. The bed is very comfortable. The breakfast is ok, nothing special , although the blueberry waffle is delicious. The location is great, close to downtown , probably a good walking.Great decor in lobby and room. Clean room and well stocked with towels. Customer service outstanding and helpful. Favorite part was breakfast! Swimming pool heated and clean. Would definitely stay again!!!Stayed at the Clarion for 5 nights.  Overall excellent experience.   Very close to Titan Stadium and they have a shuttle that runs every 30 minutes to Downtown.   Drops you off literally on Broadway.  On more than one day, the shuttle drivers, Victor and his brother Raul even dropped us off closer to the actual place we were going!  They were great!!!!!  Make sure to tip these guys.  Coming home we usually took an Uber and it was about $4.50.  The hotel was very clean both inside and out.   Looks like the rooms have been updated within the last few years.   Bed was very comfortable but the boyfriend hated the small pillows.   The bathroom looked updated as well however, it looks like a few shortcuts were taken in that remodel.   Shower faucet looked like it was coming apart from the wall and there was actually a gap in he ceiling.  Water pressure wasn't the greatest either!The Clarion did have a morning breakfast buffet.  Don't expect anything too fabulous here but hey, it's ok and it's free!   Make your own waffles, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy (imagine that down South), and some diced potatoes.  They so had bagels, cereal, toast, yogurts, fruit and muffins as well as juice and coffee.  There was no problem parking and they even have a security guard after 10 PM.    We had no problem leaving the Harley there. The lobby was nicely decorated and a small bar with a grill with your basic burgers, quesadillas, sandwiches, etc with everything under $10 was also a bonus.   Free wifi and a free safe in the room.   Also had a fridge and microwave.   Big bonus for me were the amount of electrical plugs in the room including on each side of the bed.  Typically, I have a hard time finding enough to plug in all of our items. Only about 4 hangers in the closet so bring your own if you need more.  The gym was also very clean.   2 TVs, an elliptical, a couple of treadmills, a bike, weights, and a universal weight machine.  Towels and cold water were also in the room.   I loved that there were wipes in the fitness room as well for wiping down the equipment after use.  It does get very hot in there though and they really should a couple fans in there.  Staff were all very friendly.   If you don't mind being off the strip and saving money, this is the place!!This was a filthy hotel that had bugs. Our rooms had dirty socks and other people's nasty belongings on the floors. The walls were filthy and we did not have a wall mirror in our room. The breakfast is one of the worst things I have ever tasted. Do not stay at this hotel.This hotel has is old but definitely been renovated for the better! It was clean, modern, colorful, and inviting! The staff was wonderful, helpful, and fun.  I had a great experience with this hotel!I thought I'd seen it all when it came to dirty hotels, but this was a new level. Booked it at $172/night, I would've paid the extra $30 per night to escape the absolutely FILTHY bathrooms -human blood on the shower curtain?!?!!!- bathroom sink handle that was loose, the toilet that shifted on the floor every single time it was used (&amp; I'm a fit running mama!), the bathroom door wouldn't even close -terrible! The TV pic was super grainy and the bathroom had peeling wall paper, etc. I pulled out my travel Clorox wipes at 1st sight and proceeded to go over things since I couldn't cancel my reservation -the tub faucet, sink handles, light switches, &amp; countertops. They came back brown and grimy after a quick once over -enough for me to lose my appetite and regret not bringing a change of linens. The was always a 5-7 minute wait to get a hold of the front desk too b/c they only staffed it with 1 person most of the time -who was busy eating their lunch behind the counter: super professional for a $200/night hotel charge after taxes and fees. All in all, a regrettable stay.Clean, Nice, Affordable, Comfortable beds... Not much this place doesn't do, would come back.Great location, clean, friendly, and awesome free breakfast. Free amenities just incase you forgot something as well.  The hotel has a free shuttle that only takes 2 minutes to Broadway which is a great bonus. The staff were all super helpful and friendly. Tony at breakfast made my day brighter:) I will stay here again for sure!Pros:-EXCELLENT staff. Every single person was so friendly, sweet, and helpful to us. An extra shout out to  Tony (continental breakfast), Victor (shuttle driver), and Dorothy (front desk) for exceptional service.-free shuttle downtown. It runs every half hour, and it's very prompt. -comfortable beds-great selection for continental breakfast-clean rooms-reasonably pricedCons:-Not in a great neighborhood-could not adjust temperature in the room, and it was way too hot-they didn't have simple things such as band-aids at the front desk-rooms look a bit outdatedOverall, a pleasant experience. I would stay here again.I almost never review hotels on Yelp but I am doing so for this hotel as a public service. This is an infested Pig with Lipstick. Our rooms were dirty as in makeup smeared on walls, bugs on the bed, other people's socks and ponytail holders on the floor. Housekeeping is lacking and they are really loud banging around in the morning. Our key cards had to be rekeyed the third night because they screwed them up.  The whole place was basically new stuff shoddily installed and the whole place was just a disappointment. The breakfast was not good and I had low expectations going on since I often eat at the breakfast bars at their competitor's properties. Would not return here. Way over priced for the level of service and amenities provided. Above all a hotel should be clean. They failed.BEDBUGS!!!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!! We went out of our way to stay here because of a previous good experience. However, I now have over 100 bites covering my body and we found bedbugs all over the bed and crawling on me. We packed up immediately and called the manager. They comped our room but that still doesn't account for the fact that I'm miserable with all these bites, it ruined our vacation, and we had to throw a lot of our stuff away that couldn't be heat treated. Let alone all the stress and anxiety it has caused. A previous reviewer from 2 months ago also got them there so clearly they aren't doing what they need to do to get rid of the issue.Though less than 1/2 a mile from LP field and about a mile from downtown, the Clarion is in really industrial section so there is not much to see just walking around the hotel. Also if there is a game trying to get to the hotel is a nightmare, for some reason the Nashville police block about 80% of the roads in the area and hand direct all street light traffic, the worst! We loved the updated lobby and rooms. We had two queen beds with nice white cotton bedding. The only thing I didn't like about our room was that the bathroom light was connected to the fan, so if you wanted to see you had to have the super loud fan on. Though the fan is obnoxiously loud it sadly did little to take away the steam from the shower.They server a complementary hot breakfast which was ok, as expected. Make your own Belgian waffles, eggs, sausage, eggs, mini bagels and muffins, cereal, yogurt, coffee juice. Oh and terrible diced potatoes!There is a small bar, but its not open until later in the afternoon. The bartender said wine was like $12 which seemed a bit high for the atmosphere.They offer a shuttle until 8pm to downtown but be forewarned you have to sign up for it at the front desk. Raul the driver was nice enough to make a double trip when there were too many people.  Prices change based on demand, but at $440 for two nights it was a great deal for us.This place is terrible. Parking Lot is always full, even if you buy a room here you can not park. You would think this would be a good hotel to stay at while having fun downtown, but the people who work here do not like to have fun. This place is not a ""fun"" place.On the surface, this hotel appeared to have been recently renovated and generally clean. It's in a convenient location close to downtown and sightseeing area (just $7 cab ride from the bars). However, the staff was not very friendly and, more importantly, our bed was INFESTED WITH BED BUGS. I HAVE DOZENS OF NASTY RED AND ITCHY BITES ALL OVER MY ARMS, SHOULDERS, HANDS, &amp; NECK. Some of the bites are in the tell tail straight lines. I've never experienced something so revolting in my life! Do not stay at this hotel!!!!!Awesome hotel room was clean and nice staff was friendly and helpful breakfast was pretty good for what it is only complaint is the drinking cups at breakfast were the size of a double shot glass  otherwise I would deff stay here again.. We had no issue parking or with anything else I think some ppl expect great views and resort style service ... If you are this is not the hotel for you the view is of the interstate mostly and although the the staff is very friendly and helpful in any way u can imagine this is not a resort don't expect  them to act like it is you will be disappointed ... However if you are looking for a nice CLEAN , safe  not outrageously priced room near downtown Nashville that you don't have to worry about the dea kicking in a door 2 rooms down (yes this can deff happen at some of the other hotels near downtown ) then this is a great find ... Our room was perfectly fine for thatI stayed in the Clarion for two nights this month and overall I wasn't thrilled. Although the property is recently renovated, there are a lot of things they seemed to have missed. For example, for whatever reason, the paint around the trim of the elevator doors was severely chipped and needed a touch up, especially on the 4th floor. The elevator doors themselves were all dinged and scratched -- obviously old or poorly maintained. The hallways were dimly lit and looked like the carpet needed a good vacuum. I also noticed a small gap between the counter top and siding of the bathroom sink.My room appeared clean, but at the same time smelled moist, like there may have been mildew lingering somewhere unseen. However, the mattress and pillows were actually comfortable, and the flat screen television in the room was surprisingly large (bigger than 42"", I think). I didn't have any trouble with the cleaning service throughout my stay, but was missing a hairdryer in my room upon check in.The very few staff I encountered were relatively friendly or didn't acknowledge me at all (while passing in the hallway, which is fine), with the exception of the front desk attendant in the early morning. I left to go downtown for a work convention every morning at 7am and the individual I encountered was cordial to me (only because I was being overly nice to her in order to catch a cab -- the hotel's free shuttle starts running at 8am, by the way), but I overheard her make comments to another staff member about a guest that was being ""a jerk."" Also, the entrance outside of the hotel needs a really good power-washing and a smoker's stand for people to discard their used cigarettes. There were cigarette butts everywhere, and what appeared to be a beer bottle (on a Tuesday morning). Seriously, someone really needs to invest in that.There is absolutely nothing around this hotel to walk to besides the football stadium. So, long story short, the only way this hotel is worth the price (I paid $169 per night) is if you're going to see the Titans.Nice rooms. Comfortable beds and relatively new. Food was good at the bar in the lobby. Breakfast was fine. Walls are paper thin. Cleaning staff screams in the hallways all through the day. Can hear the highway and other noises at night. Close to the stadium and a convenient free shuttle to DT every 30mins.","Friendly staff; great customer service.  Extremely clean &amp; nice room and common areas.  Courtesy shuttle to downtown was a HUGE plus; only a 10 minute ride away.  Complimentary breakfast every morning had a good selection of food.  The only place I will stay if I visit Nashville again!Stayed at The Clarion Hotel Downtown Nashville Stadium for 4 nights with a group of 124 Miami Dolphins Fans. We all had a GREAT time. Everyone in the city was great and the crew at The Clarion were amazing. The Bar crew were friendly and Justin was a comedian that kept us laughing and drinks flowing. His family had a reunion that weekend so he only worked our first night but fear not Toni, Kelly and Lindsey were just as great the following nights. We closed the bar down each night and we all had a great time. The front desk was helpful and polite. Albert, De Andre and Jessica greeted us every time we came in and were helpful when our group had questions about the area. The shuttle busses to downtown made it easy to get around without renting a car and the drivers were great. I would recommend my friends and family staying here if they visit Nashville for any reason. THANK YOU!!!! Marc AngeloI was hesitant to write this review since I can't give 5 stars, but may as well.I stayed here for two nights last month and thought the property itself and the room were great.  The bathroom was fantastic.  Great shower pressure, nice and clean. Room nice and big and fresh looking.  Bed big and comfortable.  Couldn't have asked for more.  Easy ride by hotel shuttle to downtown and then quick cab ride back.  The pool was also fantastic, especially while listening to the downpour going on outside.Here is the one definite negative: front desk staff.  I don't think we were there during an unusually busy weekend or time of day, but I found the staff to be pretty uninterested in greeting guests or properly checking them in.  When I got my key and went up to the room, I found that the room was STILL OCCUPIED!  I went back down to the lobby to let the staff know and it was like no big deal, happens all the time.  They did give me a key to the room directly across the hall, which turned out to be fine, but I was worried someone would walk in on us at some point if keys are being coded and assigned so randomly.  Could have been a simple, one-time mistake but I didn't get that feeling and it clearly affected my experience.And the so-so: elevators.  These things looked and sounded rickety, like the rest of the hotel was refurbished around them and no one thought to consider a tune up.  It was fun chatting with people while waiting for the elevator to arrive though.All in all, I would stay here again but would probably look for something comparable to try out if I could.  Another reviewer has recently reported finding bed bugs, so for the record, while I did find multiple red welts on my arms and legs after I checked out, I did a bed check the first night specifically looking for bed bugs and didn't find any..Can't recommend this hotel enough- friendly staff, helpful room service and the best customer service! Dorothy- I just can't say enough about this extremely welcoming and accommodating woman. Especially after having the worst experience at the scummy hotel next door- the Knights Inn. This place is so nice and worth every dollar! Will definitely come back here!How should I begin .... I found a rather large roach in my first room . The second problem was the shuttle . I was attending a conference at the Omni ( should have stayed there ) . I spent hours waiting for the shuttle from clarion even though it's supposed to run on the 1/2 hour  . I called at one point 4 times and was told he was on his way . He in fact never showed . I was late for several events during my stay because of this . Third , the breakfast was nothing short of terrible . pLEASE don't stay here you will be very disappointed !!!!!!I was in Nashville this past weekend for the Cowboys/Titans game and this hotel was in the perfect location! 10 minutes from the airport, 5 minutes from downtown Nashville and walking distance from LP Field for the game.The room was very clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The bar in the lobby has good sports bar food. After the game on Sunday we decided to stay in the room and watch the rest of the NFL games and just order from the bar. Good chicken tenders, philly cheesesteak sliders and quesadillas. This hotel offers free parking for guests to which is a plus.The ONLY negative I would say is on Sunday morning we left for breakfast and to go to the game about 8:30am and did not return until after the game until 3:30pm. Our room had still NOT been cleaned by the maids. They were still on our floor(3rd floor) cleaning the rooms. So we went down to the bar for 20 min until she was done. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place. Especially if you are attending an event at LP Field or something in Downtown Nashville. Short walk and short ride.Great friendly service and the remodel looks great, I think they forgot to paint all of the doors to the guest rooms? The shuttle service was great and very convenient, Victor was the best driver!!I was really surprised at how great this hotel was!   Formerly the Days Inn, this place has undergone (and continues to undergo) an Extreme Makeover: Hotel Edition-type renovation. The lobby is modern, visually very cool and still comfortable. The rooms have been updated and restyled.  The construction crews seemed to hurry through some parts and did some sloppy work in the rooms with paint and tile, but it didn't take away from the stay. The beds were great and the pillows were perfectly soft!  The TV was large and got lots of channels. The bathroom was huge!  We didn't use the pool, but it's been upgraded too. Their free breakfast was nice, pretty standard but if its free, it's one less vacation expense, right?  The breakfast room is huge, and it looks like they're putting in a bar in the lobby. And the free shuttle downtown: amazing!! The AC was strong, and was one that could have the fan stay on even if it wasn't cooling, so it didn't wake me up going on and off all night.  And free wifi! What really made my stay special was the staff. I did not expect that level of service from this price point or in this neighborhood. From the moment we walked in - late at night minus my luggage as the airline lost it - they took care of us!  I asked for a quiet room after the stress of losing my luggage (and knowing I'm a light sleeper and my ear plugs were in the lost suitcase), and they put us away from everybody else and personally walked us to the room to make sure it was to our quiet-seeking standards.  It did get noisy one weekend evening when the hotel was full - the walls are thin, but they also have a security guard that will tell revelers to hush up.  The staff asked every night what we had been up to, complimented us when we got all dressed up for the Opry, said ""Good morning ladies!"" every morning and genuinely talked to us, giving recommendations and making sure we enjoyed their city.  Southern Hospitality at its finest! Easy on and off the freeway, convenient to the airport and perfectly situated for those that drove all over Nashville to take in the sites. There isn't much within waking distance though, so know that, but they offer free parking if you rent a car.  If I visit again, I'll stay here again for sure!The hotel was in a good location and a mile from downtown.   We had a family reunion and 29 of us stayed at this hotel.  The hotel was very clean.  They have one shuttle that holds 11 people at a time and that gets booked up very quickly.   Plan ahead if you have dinner plans and want to use their free shuttle service.   If you use Uber downtown it's only $4.00 so nothing to complain about.   Considering the hotel price with the free breakfast, free parking, swimming pool, free internet and free shuttle service you can't beat this location or hotel.    I would definitely stay here again!A nice stay, great price and close enough to downtown.Had a great stay here.Rooms were clean.  Beds were comfortable, I had a good nights sleep.  Hotel was apparently renovated, so it looks pretty new - although there were a few things that seemed to have missed the punch list, but not enough to ruin our stay.   Worst part was we didn't get housekeeping service - we had a do not disturb sign out but that was gone by 10am - but housekeeping didn't come back for a 2nd attempt.  Front desk did apologize and offered to send someone up immediately.   The lobby is nice and comfortable.  Plenty of seating to hang out with fellow travelers.  breakfast was nice - eggs/sausage/biscuits/gravy/waffle machine/cereals/breads/coffee/tea.     Quite tasty - I'm not sure what other reviewers were expecting.I can't speak to noise - our stay was quiet, but the hotel is down the street from a stadium, so if there is a big event there, I can see enthusiastic fans being rowdy.  I might check for stadium events if that is a concern - an event may get you a busy hotel and longer check in/out times.But the hotel's location is the gem here.  While downtown hotels are $400/night, the Clarion is less than half that but still close to the downtown area.   A half hour walk to Broadway, and I felt safe walking even at night.  a $7 cab ride if you'd prefer, and a hotel shuttle will also take you there.  Would definitely stay there again and save my money for a night on the town.I usually only write reviews for the good stuff, this is my first negative review. Stayed here on 8 August 2014, my buddy and I were driving across the country and we needed a place to stay, so we booked this hotel online. As I was lying in bed, I noticed some movement by my face. Turns out my bed had some fat bed bugs in it. I collected three in a cup, which only took a minute to find. I brought these down to the front desk demanding a refund and a new room. Honestly the guy at the desk didn't even seemed to surprised, like it had happened before. Just be warned. Now it's three in the morning, and I am very hesitant to sleep in the new room they gave me.Cute but in rough neighborhood. Security patrols hard. Limited handicapped spots and poorly placed. Have to cut your way through the smoke cloud to enter. Just disgusting!  Monday maid was a nice Hispanic lady who did a wonderful job. Lazy black maid today asked the girls to do half her work. I pay you to do this not to engage by grandchildren to do your job. Holes in ceiling where sprinkler lines are run that are unfinished. Low water pressure. Beds way too high. You need a step stool to enter. Very painful to try to get to and from when on an ecv or Wherlchair.  Yes I had a handicapped room. No flat floor shower. Had to fight over tub walls. Decor is unique and colorful. Could not use pool. Closed first night. Other nights you needed a special code and no one seemed to know it. Front desk always busy socializing with themselves. Breakfast in pretty setting but nothing special. Rubber eggs, potatoes, waffles, pastries, basic cereal, yogurt, juice, coffee, tea and biscuits w/ gravy. Some fresh cooked eggs or scrambled would have been nice. Looks great on the website but will most likely try a different hotel on the return trip.Driving through Nashville and were only there for one night. Didn't want to spend $200 on a hotel downtown. This hotel was about 5 minutes drive to downtown tourist area. Clean and great customer service. Free breakfast. Use to be a days inn which got confusing when we were first looking for it on a map, but it is now remodeled and currently still under construction on some parts of the hotel. Would stay again.This was a great find for us! We had a big van so the free parking was great. They provided a free shuttle to downtown which was really easy! It took about 5 minutes to drive in. The rooms were spacious &amp; clean. Breakfast was great too... Waffles, eggs, sausage, cereal, pastries!! Good value. We would stay here again.THIS PLACE IS AWFUL! I came to Nashville with my family and we stayed there, it was very nice inside. We went out and came back to the hotel and our whole bathroom was flooded!!! The dry wall had came down and leaked water everywhere! We had a suitcase in the bathroom that got completely soaked and ruined with drywall all over it! My brother went and told them and they didn't care at all. The police that was working there even agreed with us and he came and looked at it. He was on our side! We didn't get a new room...we stayed in the hotel with a flooded bathroom all night! We didn't get the room paid for or even any discount! They were extremely rude and obviously didn't care! Not one of the clarion staff members even came and looked at the room!  One of the staff members even suggested that we were all lying when we had pictures and a police offer for proof!! HORRIBLE customer service!!! When we were even letting the manger know, all the staff was so nosey they just stood there and listened but did nothing about the matter! They clearly don't care about their customers. It's nice inside but just remember it may fall apart on you and ruin your things..but don't expect them to care or even do anything to accommodate the situation! My family and I will never be back!Nice hotel for the money. Recently remodeled though old rough edges are showing through. Says it is downtown but not really, is about 1 mile from Broadway. They offer a free shuttle on the hour which is very nice, though you are on your own getting back late at night. I walked back one night but would not do it again, the last 2 blocks are long and in rough area - the $6 cab ride is well worth it! The staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are nice and comfortable and everything worked fine including the free internet. Nice free hot breakfast with potatoes, eggs and sausage along with muffins, yogurt and fruit. My only complaints are the $75 hold they place on your card for ""incidentals"", though you can't charge your dinner meal/bar tab to your room and the bar is only open until 10. I asked and the front desk about the hold and they said it was more of a security deposit for damage or for purchasing items from their market. I made it clear that if they are to do this then you must be able to charge your dinner to the room. All in all was a good stay and I recommend. Other than the $75 hold and the neighborhood this is a very fine hotel for the money.This was my first trip to Nashville and I want betty happy to find out that almost every hotel wad already full so we wouldn't be ankle to stay on the main strip. I was then pleasantly surprised by the clarion. They have shuttles running downtown every hour and when we did take a cab it was only 5 0r 6 dollars to each main spot. Our rooms are nice and clean and the front desk people were very helpful. Is worth it to pay for the cheap can rides instead of paying a few hundred extra to stay on the strip.Over Under Bar: First of all let me say I have stayed at this hotel before and it is much nicer now than it used to be. As far as the hotel experience it was really nice. My real trouble came when I went down stairs to the bar. We had a really nice experience with the regular bar staff. The girl, Marin, made me the best Bloody Mary I have ever had in my life. My wife had actually ordered it so when I went to ask the bartender to make me one like hers the bar manager, Dana,  interrupted me while I was asking for the drink and explained that the bartender was making the drink incorrectly and that she would make me a better one the ""right way"". First off, I was really irritated at being interrupted and secondly, whether or not she was making it right or wrong I loved the way it tasted and that is how I wanted it. She was so rude to the bartender and frankly was rude to me by interrupting me while I was telling her I wanted the drink the way the bartender made it. I might go back to the hotel but I always go to the bar so if they don't have a new manager then forget it.Love the hotel, loved the updates, right by LP field, Free shuttle and taxi ride with tip under $10! Great place to stay and great breakfest.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/alexis-inn-and-suites-nashville,Alexis Inn & Suites,4.0,$$,32,"Extremely well priced! Clean rooms, comfortable bed, soft linen, friendly staff, fair complementary breakfast. Shuttle to Broadway $10 round-trip. Would absolutely stay here again!This place is like a pearl in an oyster shell. It may have a tough looking exterior but inside is something really special. The staff is welcoming and very attentive. The rooms are clean and fresh. A great nights sleep made better with the deluxe continental breakfast. Given the choice of the surrounding options, I'd go Alexis over those other big names.Initially I thought the place to be decent, even with the swarm of ladybugs in my room. Employees were friendly and helpful. My second night, my significant other and I were in the heat of things when someone walked right in our room! I immediately went to the front desk and was told it didn't happen. Called the manager when I returned home only to be told it couldn't possibly have happened. Never in my life have I been so humiliated or let down by a company. I eventually figured out what I think happened - my s.o. never picked up the extra key I left for them at the front desk. Almost positive it was accidentally handed to someone checking in. Seriously - you couldn't check your cameras? There was one RIGHT outside my room. I'm horrified this is the way you treat customers! Outright dangerous.I would rate the customer service of the staff a 5, particularly Billie who was fantastic! I needed a safety pin and she went above and beyond to find one.  Our room was huge and extremely spacious. Now the down side, when I went to move the curtains I saw a huge beetle looking big, then found more all over the curtain and window.  It took over an hour for anyone to come and when the maintenance team came, they killed the bugs (big guts leftover) and sealed the window with foam.  Needless to say I couldn't sleep after that.Great deal! Have stayed here before, friendly staff. Nice hotel, equivalent to Marriott or Hyatt, in style and quality. Ignore the off brand name, great place.My fellow Yelpers failed me! This is not a 4 star hotel! I got this room for two nights on Hotwire $100 a night. Before I snatched it up, I researched it on here... these people must not get out much. Sorry, I'm just being honest. This is one of the worst unclean hotels I've ever stayed at. Yes, it has granite counter tops, that's the only modern thing here. Check in with Princess was a breeze. She suggested The shuttle and said it is $18 to downtown. It ended up being $25, but that wasn't her fault. The shuttle service is Driving Ms. Daisy. I feel the need to mention that I think that I witnessed the driver do a drug deal with us in the van! He said that he needed to make a pit stop because another passenger left their cigarettes in the van. He passed him the box of cigarettes and the dude gave him $20. Could've been just a nice tip... for bringing back a box of cigs. Dang, cigarettes must be outrageous nowadays! There are five floors and one slow elevator for all of the rooms and it was busy, even on a week day. I must be the only one who doesn't like this place. The pictures posted 6 years ago, same decor but now everything is worn, torn and outdated. The bed was comfortable and the only reason that I gave this place a second star. Oh, the breakfast. How could I almost forget to mention the free breakfast?! The lady tending to it snapped at me for leaving the lid off of the biscuits for my husband. She also told him that I should've put the lid on after it got my biscuit. Geeez lady, way to call me out. She should've been more worried about cleaning up crumbs and cereal on the tables and counter. The gravy seriously tasted like Spam. The lady at the table beside me watched me take a bite and said ""it tastes like Spam doesn't it"".After paying five cab/shuttle fares, I really don't think I saved any $$ by staying on the outskirt of downtown.After reading some of the previous reviews, and seeing previous pics I'm guessing they have updated the rooms since then, flat screens, clean white bedding, comfortable clean room. I would stay here again.The hotel signage needs to be adjusted. The ""e"" is not lighted in Alexis, which gives a shady first impression (i.e. Al xis Inn). Once inside, the lobby looked accommodating, albeit cheesy. But, everything was clean, which is what is most important. While attempting to open our room, our key was demagnetized, but a hotel employee was on the floor and sprang into action to let us in the room and shortly after our arrival, provided us with 2 newly magnetized cards. The inside of the roomy had a somewhat cheesy appearance as well, but it was all clean. I was impressed by the free toiletries, which included mouthwash, which you don't always get. The beds were soft, the room was quite, and the view was ok. The breakfast buffet was very tasty and included southern favorites such as biscuits and gravy.Overall, good hotel for a good clean night's stay.I stayed here one night when I was in town for business. The hotel is clean, the  bed is pretty comfortable and is a great deal for the money. It's about 10 minutes from the airport and 10 minutes from downtown. There's free breakfast in the morning which is always nice.This was not a good experience.  I felt extremely uncomfortable,  upon entering the elevator, and the feeling continued in the room. It smelled unpleasant,  and the carpet was so old it didn't appear clean. The sleeper sofa was ripped (2 nd room). When opened the mattress pad looked as if there were food closed inside throughout.  The maintenance brought several sheets to cover it, however they did not have any more pads. I would not recommend this hotel. The suite was large and the staff friendly. You can clearly see the owners are not investing in their business,  but riding it until the wheels fall off.  :(I enjoyed my stay here when my friend and I took a trip over the summer. $100 for the night and included free breakfast, Wi-Fi, and parking. The hotel was a little outdated, but very clean. Huge variety to pick from at breakfast in the morning and if you aren't feeling their breakfast, waffle house is right by it. The staff was friendly and helpful. If you are driving to Nashville, the location is ideal because it is only about 10 minutes from downtown and 10 minutes from the Grand Ole Opry in the other direction. It is much cheaper than staying downtown. I wanted to stay here for my next trip, but they were all booked! They do a great job!Not a bad hotel for the money, but for about 20 more dollars you can stay next door at the Marriott and earn points. Room was clean and beds were fine. Needs a paint job in the hallways. Staff were friendly.Friendly staff. Clean, quiet room. Free Wi-Fi and breakfast were nice. Some areas could use some fresh paint or cosmetic maintenance, but for an overnight business trip the accommodations were just fine. I booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and got a great price!It was only AFTER we booked our room here that I noticed Candice G.'s review -- had I known that, I would have skipped all the searching on another site with reviews (my bad)... Anyway, Candice was right about the water pressure, this was the polar opposite of the beach we stayed at in Ormond Beach, where the water came out in needle jets that must feel like getting a tattoo to folks with a sunburn. Here, the water comes out so slow you think twice about shampooing your hair, for fear you'll spend all day rinsing...But, other than that and the ""Are you kidding? Those aren't eggs!"" continental breakfast, this place ROCKS! Not far off the interstates and parkways, close to the airport (like at the end of a runway, I believe), and pretty clean for an older hotel, the Alexis has great prices. We paid just $65... And the room was HUGE. If you are going to Nashville with friends, you could easily put 3 friends in this room -- 8 if you are really GOOD friends!All amenities, like free WiFi, soap, shampoo and hair dryer are there as well... Plenty of free parking. Lots of bachelorette parties seemed to be starting off here, so there must be some kind of male stripper place nearby, I'm guessing. Right?In my world, you can spend whatever you want on a conference, no problem. But, if you set your conference expenses too high, your take-home pay is adjusted downward accordingly. Conferencing by myself, it is difficult to justify $150+/night downtown accommodations. Two of three conference trips to Nashville, I've ended up at Alexis. This time, it was a ""three nights for the price of two"" deal. So, for about half of what I would have paid downtown, I had a very nice king suite -- living room + kitchenette + bedroom + bathroom (see photos). If your conference starts around 8:00 AM, the real price you pay is fighting traffic, in my case from Elm Hill Pike to Murfreesboro Pike, which becomes Lafayette, to downtown, about 15 minutes each morning.  No complaints about the service or the room.  Friendly, efficient staff. Clean room with -- as others have noted -- five pillows on the bed. What am I gonna do with five pillows?Worst.WaterPressure.Ever. Seriously like taking a shower underneath an eye dropper. And don't even think about making #2 here-- That's a flush that ain't gonna happen, my friend. I gargle with more water than sits in that bowl and to top it off, the flush power is reminiscent of a moderate home aquarium filter. Just a bad H2O situation overall, I guess. Also, looking at the dank business photos in the listing makes me rethink my star rating in hindsight. I don't remember it being THAT scary looking. Buuut it was only like $60 a night so it's not like I can expect the Ritz, ya know? Positive things to note about this hotel:*Decently comfy beds*Free Wifi*LOTS of pillows*Vanity outside the restroom so I can ready without occupying the barely functioning loo for my guest*Right off the highway*Large+clean hotel entryway*Vanity mirror has nice shot of the bed (eh, eh? Ya get my drift?)*Free mouthwash*Close parking (hint- go for the sides of the building. Closer to the front door and no one thinks to park there)*QuietIf I'd paid a penny over $60 a night for room I might be singing a different tune- especially since the breakfast buffet (less the cake bread) was a major let down. But, for the <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> rate I think this place is A-OK. Also, it might not very close to anything cool or happenin' in Nashville but it is just across the street from one of the 83834763483 million Waffle Houses you passed driving into Nashville.This is a great hotel for the money! The staff is friendly and the bed is comfy. The hotel is clean and very close to the airport. We always have our out of town family stay here.Clean, nice hotel. I booked a night through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotel.com&amp;s=ca0318a6c5ca0df886d87a25575694b5522121f0584300bca238552cf615a0ab"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotel.com</a> (Use code LNGUYEN271 for $25 credit). Front staff was incredibly nice and upgraded our room to 2 full beds at no extra cost. I also received plenty of advice as to where to go for dinner and drinks. I would definitely come back.Nice clean hotel. Close to airport and extremely friendly staff. Highly recommend. The toiletries are amazing!! I mean seriously the soaps and lotion feel like silk!!! I was very pleasantly surprisedStayed here as an overnight stop on our way to Florida. The good:1. Easy check-in with friendly staff.2. Huge room for a really reasonable rate3. Actual queen beds so lots of room.4. Quiet (Had bachelor party near by and didn't hear them once)5. Easy access from and back to the interstates6. Staff was very helpful with recommending dinner7. Better than average complimentary breakfast (eggs, sausage, biscuits, sausage gravy and waffles along with the other usual continental fare).The bad:1. The pillows. While soft, they are ridiculously small. More like little cubes.2. The beds were a little hard. The Ugly:NoneOverall, the good outweighed the bad and I don't mind a hard bed as long as I don't have to sleep on it every night. The pillows I just kind of molded 2 into one. I didn't have the water pressure problems that others have described on here. If you can handle the 2 bad items, it's definitely worth the price.","If you book online it is cheaper, fyi.We stayed for just over $40/night.  That said, it was glorious.  The rooms were small but stocked with everything Jill S. said.  It was very clean and across the street from a Waffle House.Small issue - the front desk was nice when I called to get information about Nashville however Alexis Inn is not near downtown or the Grand Ole Opry - it is in between the two.  The desk made it sound like we could get to downtown for $7, but that isn't totally true.  You need to take a cab, the local cab is the same price as ""Driving Miss Daisy"".The other small issue - i like the fact that there is a free breakfast, however Alexis Inn has the most unhealthy choices you can have for a breakfast.  Small issue though because it is free.... but I feel it is important to note there is no fresh fruit, well fresh anything really, on the bar.For $40-ish it is more affordable than downtown (even with the cab ride) and clean.  Few small points to note - but if you know it going in, it is a pleasant experience.So here I am, having trekked halfway across the country on two different planes with a toddler in tow to a hotel I randomly picked on hotwire because a) it was close to the airport (aka cheap cab ride cuz I was in too late for the shuttle) and b) a good deal price wise....so I wasn't expecting much.Well whodathunk? From the MINUTE I walked in I was impressed. Not just because the lobby was nice, but because this wonderfully cheery sweet woman greeted me and my daughter like we practically lived there  - she knew I was coming, had my keys all ready...engaged my 4 year old in hilarious conversation...when we go to the room my daughter said ""she can be my grandma - I like her"" lol. Now let's talk about the room....spacious, two queen beds, a side kitchen area with a sink cabinets, fridge and microwave....the air was already set comfortably, the fridge was cold and ready...she even had the door opened a crack so I didn't have to bother with the key and all my luggage. southern hospitality...I tell ya...the beds are comfy...tons of pillows....I then, at 12 30 at night mind you (TN time, as I'm still on California time lol) remember I hadn't eaten yet...now where I come from, after 12 - GOOD FREAKIN LUCK finding food...soooo...I pop over to the front desk (where ""gramma"" comes out to admire my daughter's footie jammies lol) and ask her, expecting to hear ""nothing is open"" if something is....and (insert angels singing here) she hands me a menu to a local place that is open til 3 am!!!! (Milanos, but that is a whole other 5 start yelp to come) Oh and did I mention the toiletry tray has EVERYTHING???? shampoo, conditioner, lotion, mother wash and body wash...plus soaps and a shower cap...and free wifi!if they had the nickelodeon channel I'd probably move in...lolSeriously, I stay at a lot of hotels...I was impressed and recommend it highly!We LOVED this place! You just can't beat this place for $69.99 a night. My family stayed here for 10 days back in 2010. We were on a driving adventure that had taken us from Dallas to Sarasota, FL and were on our way up to Lake Michigan when we stopped in Nashville. At this point we'd be on the road a few months and needless to say had stayed in many economy hotels. With that said, we've also stayed at many non-economy hotels with room rates ranging from $125-$350/night for conferences and business trips. We were more than satisfied with this hotel for the price range. We paid $69.99/night for two queen beds and little kitchenette that had a mini fridge, microwave and a food prep area. Most of the ""hotels"" we've been in that were in this price range were motels. The lobby is a nice spacious area that they've obviously made an attempt to modernize. The staff is as friendly and as attentive as you would find in any high priced hotel. The beds were fantastic! The linens were trendy, beautiful and clean with lots of specialty pillows. I literally uncased the pillow to find out what it was and where I could buy it. Our room was very spacious. I see one guest commented on the room size being small. I'm not sure how you end up with a larger vs smaller room in this place. Maybe you can request a larger one? It is still the largest room we've had in any price range to date. The only bad thing I have to say about this place is regarding the breakfast and even then it's not that bad. As another reviewer stated, there really aren't any healthy choices on the breakfast bar. It is a hot breakfast that includes scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, fresh cooked waffles, various cereals and bagels with cream cheese. The eggs are clearly powdered and possibly microwaved. I added butter and salt to mine to make them palatable. The breakfast really wasn't that good but it was nice to have it included in the price for my family of three. Just eating breakfast could have easily added $30/day to our expenses so because of that our free breakfast was definitely better than paying to feed my family elsewhere.I'm a huge fan of breakfasts, especially free breakfasts.I like it when hotels have something, anything. Even if it's just a carb (muffin/donut/bagel/pastry) and a coffee.This place has buffet-sytle hot food (eggs, breakfast pattie, muffin, gravy), waffle maker where you pour batter yourself to make waffles, instant oatmeal packages, sliced breads and bagels for toasting, 4 kinds of cold cereal, coffee, water, and several types of fruit juice (orange, apple, cranberry). And if you're not a guest and want some of this, it's about $4.99. The room was nice. I like how high the bed is. They give lots of pillows. We didn't get a room with the kitchenette, but we didn't need it. Free wi-fi was spotty. I don't know if a neighbor was downloading a lot of data (*cough*porn*cough*). But if the surfing is slow, you may want to go downstairs to the lobby where the connection seems slightly faster.There is a gym. And actually if you don't like the tap water during the summer, fill up your water bottle from the cooler in the gym.The only negatives I have are from the bathroom in our room: The toilet did not flush very well. I think it works better if you hold down the lever; otherwise, flush a few times when you are done, or be ready to be mortified when the next person sees what didn't get flushed down. Also, the bath tub felt slimy on the floor of the tub. I don't know if it's from having soft water (?).No restaurants on site. I think there is a waffle place across the street. But there is a pretty decent free breakfast in the back lobby!!!Very small rooms, but seem to have been updated recently. Had no problems with the water pressure noted by others. Clean and comfortable enough.Friendly staff, clean spacious rooms, new updates, free buffet with hot breakfast items and all under $80.  Within a few miles of Nashville - good bargin and recommended.  Would stay here again on another trip.We decided to stay here because we drove by a walk-in rate sign while driving looking for a place to stay. We were extremly happy with the stay so much that when we were driving back from Memphis and decided to stay over another night we went back here. The room we stayed in had great beds and pillows, was clean and nice smelling when we got in and had a little kitchennette area with a fridge and sink. For the 69.00 a night we spent WELL WORTH it. Staff was super friendly and remembered us when we came back by 13 hours later....would recommend this to anyone in the Nasvhille area, only about a 10 minute drive to downtown.Nice clean hotel but the breakfast isn't that great. I would stay again.Inexpensive and clean. Staff are friendly. Free breakfast every morning.  Rooms are a bit outdated but as I said its inexpensive.Booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> so we got a two queen suite for $46 a night.  Side room with mini fridge, microwave, table for two.  Free Wifi.  Computer connection on the desk lamp was impossible to use unless you tilt the lamp backwards with a book.  Very large and clean room, definitely well worth the money.  I like having the bathroom facilities (toilet and tub) in a separate room from the dual sinks and large mirror.We stayed here on a trip to Nashville to go to the Grand Ole Opry--so this was the perfect location for us since it was located only a few minutes down the interstate. It also had everything we needed in a hotel--it was inexpensive ($70), quiet, comfortable bed, fridge in the room, free breakfast, fitness center, &amp; business center. Nothing fancy, but it was perfect for our quick stay. I'd stay here again.Very affordable, clean and friendly.  Nice work desk and free wifi.  The bed is huge and comfy, next time I fly out of Nashville I will be staying here again.",,,,"['extremely', 'well', 'priced', 'clean', 'rooms', 'comfortable', 'bed', 'soft', 'linen', 'friendly',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-preston-nashville,Hotel Preston,3.0,$$,165,"This is a cute boutique hotel, kinda quirky vibe but not in a bad way.  They gave our little doxie a gift bag of dog treats which she loved!  Nice touch.  The hotel has a bar and lounge, and an onsite restaraunt which provides room service.  Room with king sized bed was super sized, plenty of room.  Bathroom was modest, nicely decorated but in need of minor clean up on the ceiling....again, nothing bad, just unsightly in spots.Overall this was a pleasant experience, great deal!While The Preston may have been a nice, moderately priced hotel in the past, it has steadily descended onto a full-blown shithole. Sign outside is dilapidated. No water in a single vending machine in the whole hotel. No hot water in the rooms. Staff is useless, and I don't blame them. Their open contempt for the hotel is obvious. DO NOT STAY HERE. Shame on you, Priceline, for calling this a 4-star hotel. It's barely 2. Such a shameUpdate: there are bugs!Cool looking place.That's where the goodness ends.No hot water in the rooms, rude staff, terrible food.The maid staff didn't clean my room over the course of my 2 night stay.For 50.00 a night it would still not be acceptable.For well over a hundred it's a disaster.I really had mixed feeling toward my stay. My room was fine but I happened to find a ladybug in crawling around and the bathroom ceiling wasn't on properly so there was a hole to look at in the shower. Front desk service was friendly and technically the restaurant service was too but they were really slow. The menu was very limited and there was no drink menu but nice atmosphere. Good enough place but I personally thought it was very over priced.Beautiful hotel on the outskirts of Nashville, a mere $6 Uber ride to downtown.  Was visiting here and was able to get a room for 2 nights on Priceline on a bid for $85, which came out to $105 per night. Usually the rooms are about $150-$200 a night during this season (per <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>) so Big Win!The Hotel is very modern looking with a bar and restaurant that looked very popular and hip-ster worthy.  Happy Hour M-F from 5-7.  Check-in was a breeze, the front desk was really nice and the room was clean and modern.  The only gripe I had was the slow but free Internet, something that I've noticed other hotels are doing.  You can pay extra for faster speeds, but otherwise you get speeds of 500-700 kbps which is fine unless you need to download a large work project or movie. The rooms and vibe of the hotel remind me of Hard Rock Hotel Casino in Vegas, which is the theme I think they're going for.Also, it's located across the street from one of the most inexpensive gas stations I've seen, with Unleaded for $1.99 at this time (in comparison others throughout the region was $2.15-$2.20).  They offer free shuttle services to downtown Nashville so it's a good way to get there. Free parking too. Highly recommend!I stayed here for a couple nights. Like many previous reviewers have noted, the decor is, well, interesting. It's eclectic but also a little bit creepy. For some reason, it reminded me of a haunted house. I know some people may like the eclectic look but meh, I'm not a fan. The staff was very friendly and answered any questions we had. Walls were paper thin so we were able to hear everything that our neighbors were doing. It's very close to the airport so if you're traveling, it'll be a convenient hotel to stay at.Clean and comfortable. Convenient location to airport. The staff sets this place apart. Georgia, front desk, was delightful and very helpful. As was the van driver. Complimentary shuttle to local places. The hotel itself is eccentric and funky, which we like. Neat artwork. Beds are very comfortable. Minor thing about the room that could have earned it an extra star, like three of five burned out lightbulbs in the bathroom. They have a pillow menu and inclusive spiritual reading menu. If you are staying longer you can get a lava lamp for your room. This would not be a bad place for a longer stay. Taxi to downtown is $18 and there is not much to do around the hotel, just be aware of this when looking at this area.The rooms are nice, clean, and roomy. The staff is very friendly. Location is great (for me, at least - close to Opryland/Opry Mills, pretty close to the science center, also near the airport, not too far from downtown). Decor is funky and different, setting it apart from most other hotels which tend to look kind of generic and samey.Note: the rooms do not include a mini-fridge, but you can request one free of charge. As long as one is available, they'll bring one up to your room. Also, they're apparently working on updating their WiFi right now so anyone staying around now...if you're experiencing connectivity issues, that's probably why. It was a major annoyance for me the first hour or so of our arrival as I'm in grad school and while I came here for a weekend getaway, I sadly still have schoolwork and need WiFi for school. However, after calling the front desk and going down there once (loads of shout outs to Israel who was super friendly and helpful), they actually sent two tech guys up to the room to see why we could not connect our phones or laptops to the internet. They then set up a router right outside the room and made sure we could connect okay. So awesome.Another complaint I've seen on here is the hot water. It's there, but it takes a while for it to heat up, or at least that's how it was in my room. It's no big deal for me, that's how it is at my house, so I'm used to it. This time of year, I don't take ridiculously hot showers so as long as the water's warmer than tepid, I'm fine.Perhaps the one downside is the mattress. It's not awful or uncomfortable, it just could be more comfortable. I fully admit I'm really fussy when it comes to mattresses so I don't fault them much for this. The mattresses don't seem ridiculously old or anything, they're just not as soft as I prefer. The pillows though are awesome. Super soft, and they have a wide variety of pillows available, including body pillows.There is also a complimentary shuttle available which of course does not take you to downtown, but it does take you to Opryland. Given how crazy the parking is there, that's a huge plus for me. Opry Mills I don't mind, but the hotel is so sprawling...anyway, it's nice to be able to just rely on the shuttle. And the shuttle driver is super friendly, he also doubles as a bellhop. He luckily was right downstairs when we arrived and asked if we needed help with our luggage, he unpacked the car, put everything in our room, and even got ice for us. Super nice.All in all I'd definitely recommend this place and would stay here again the next time I'm in Nashville.Super nice, accommodating staff. I was on a road trip with my 75lb dog and they were so sweet to him. I was greeted with a bag of dog treats and a sign for my door notifying hotel guests and staff that I had a dog inside. They had me fill out an emergency contact sheet for the pet- incase  something happened-which I loved. I was able to find a great deal on Priceline. I had such a good experience here I decided to stay here again on my way back and will probably use this hotel for all my trips through Nashville. The rooms are spacious and the parking is secure. Thanks for a great experience!I have stayed here a few times over the past year. A very nice Hotel with some history. Always entertainment in the lounge. Chef Danny does a very good job turning out great food,  Take the time to talk to him, he will prepare something special for you.Not impressed with the hipster attempt. The property is old, and they slapped some paint and garish colors around and called it good. The beds are old, the walls are paper thin. There's not a thing about this hotel that we liked. The music could be heard on the 7th floor. If you have the option, look elsewhere. If you end up with it ok Priceline, like we did, sucks for you like it did for usHotel Preston was there for us via Priceline in a last minute crunch with two dogs on I-80. Note: Priceline or any other 3rd party booking site  will not disclose the pet fee. Learned this upon check in at a whopping $45 per pet. Sheesh!Check in was smooth, staff was friendly. Priceline booked us in a double double, but the gal at the desk was able to get us into a corner king. Woot woot! Request the same if you can. The extra space, especially if you have pets is totally worth it. Areas that could use a little help:Clean your carpetsDeodorize your roomsProvide more towelsReduce your damn pet fee unless you're gonna use it to actually clean your carpets. Shit is gross. Shoe worthy gross. Really more worthy of 3 stars if you consider that joke of a hotel bar, The Pink Slip. Laughable.I enjoyed the unique decor, big rooms, pillow menu and funky vibe of this hotel.However, both the front desk staff and restaurant were terrible experiences, among the worst I've had in a hotel.The front desk staff that greeted me were confused about corporate bookings.Breakfast took nearly 45 mins on more than one occasion.Steer clear of this place if you're on business, need fast service, or breakfast. Very disappointed.We weren't very impressed with our stay here. I saw a few complaints about the water and yes it was true after our first night. The water barely got warm. The main issue I had here was a bug infestation as soon as we got there. I told them at the front desk that there were bugs all over the ceiling and they never took care of it. The only positive I had was that the location of the hotel is pretty close to downtown.I loved Hotel Preston - great service, great prices, everything about the hotel was just lovely during our stay. It's not in the downtown area and there is actually nothing within walking distance, aside from the lounges &amp; restaurant in the hotel. The hotel is right off the highway though so my friend and I had no issues driving ourselves or taking Lyft, plus we saved about $100/night being away from downtown.+Not your standard hotel and I liked that. No lame hotel stock paintings, you have musical legends on your walls! Red cow-ish looking interior on the elevator. All the decor was not the norm giving this hotel a bit of personality.+The price is right, as mentioned above.+I miss Snuggles! Snuggles was our fish for 5 days and I loved him with all my heart! Other guests better be treating him right! Upon request, you can adopt a fish for your stay. You can also get a rubber duckie. As if those eccentric extras aren't enough, you can also get a lava lamp. +Great room service each day.+Friendly staff both when I called prior to our reservation and there in person.+Because it's in the middle of nowhere, don't expect a fancy view from your room.We ended up adding a day to our vacation and they had no issues making the change the day before we were extending.Hotel recommended while in Nashville, so long as you don't mind staying away from the main area.I ended up having Hotel Preston automatically picked for me when using Priceline.The Great:+ Wonderful staff.+ Fun/quirky design and amenities (think fish and lava lamps).+ On-site bar! The Average:o Linens and mattress were average. o Cleanliness was ""good enough"", but the room was definitely a bit worn.The Poor:- Terrible food options in the hotel (Look for specific reviews).For the price, and proximity to BNA, the value is quite high.Ok here we go. I couldn't get the Internet to work in the room. Called the front desk 3x and still couldn't get connected. Thy finally gave me a VIP password after an hour of this. I couldn't get connected to the business center computers. Had to talk to them about it. Limited to 15 minutes otherwise you have to pay money. You can print a few pages from the printer (5) and then you have to pay money for it. Hotel food menu is not very big and it's expensive for what you get. Nothing spectacular about the rooms but definitely not the worst. The staff was friendly to me. This place gets one star (0 if I could) because I spent an entire afternoon killing ladybugs and other bugs in my room. Absolutely disgusting. I'm an airline pilot and I spend half the year in hotel and this was ridiculous. Same thing in my other crews rooms. They get in through the poorly sealed dilapidated air conditioners on the room. They were like the plague and never ending. It's too bad I can't share a picture here of all the bugs but please let this serve as a warning.Let me preface this by saying that it is never easy to write a negative review.  Some probably think that its a piece of cake, but those of us who try to YELP honestly, well, its far from it.  It is even more difficult when you are in a city like Nashville where everybody is so nice.  That said, the Hotel Preston did not cut it.  Far from it.First the positives.... The room was great.  Our window overlooked the runway which for me was neat.  I got to have my morning coffee while watching planes take off and land and that's always fun.  The staff is very polite just like everybody else in Nashville.  That overall made for a positive experience.  But that's about where it ends..Now the negatives...1.  My girlfriend and I arrived after traveling all morning and decided to grab a shower before we headed downtown.  There were only two (2) large towels in the bathroom with the rest being hand towels and the hot water can barely be described as anything even remotely close to hot.  If it matters, and if anybody is curious we were on the 6th floor.Out of the four days that I showered, only on my third day did I step into a hot shower and on my last morning when I showered at 430am prior to leaving for the airport was the worst.  The shower was almost too cool to stand under.So we finished our showers on the first day and went downstairs to leave so I stopped at the desk and asked if they could send extra towels to our room.  The person working the desk asked us ""Well, can't I just give you the towels to take up?""  No.. obviously we're heading out the door.2.  Then there was the dining experience.  We decided on our second morning to have breakfast in the hotel.  We arrived to find that there were 5 tables occupied in a room of 30.  It took about 5 minutes (literally) to have somebody come and seat us, and then took another 10 minutes (again, literally) before anybody came over and even acknowledged our presence, all the time with a waiter and waitress walking past us since we were sitting near the kitchen.  The food wasn't bad, but wasn't worth the price.3.  Finally, the maid service.  We stayed in the room a little late and left at about 12:30 on our second day there.  I had a bad ankle for the trip so I wanted to rest up before hoofing it around downtown.  We flipped the sign on our door to indicate that the room was vacant and received no maid service that day so we were left with our half dried towels that we had acquired from the front desk the day before.  I was kind of frustrating.  I spoke with the front desk on our last day before leaving asking for service in our room and it was taken care of that day.Finally, and I had no dealings there, their lounge has a very unfortunate name: ""The Pink Slip.""  No, there are no poles but you might think there are with a name like that!It difficult to give this hotel 1 star just because the majority of their staff was so nice.  The experience was very lacking.  I'm planning on going back to Nashville in the next 6 months or so, and as of now we have scratched the Preston off of our list of possible places to stay.Stayed here for 3 nights and it was full of ups and downs.  Computer systems were down for down for 2 days and never got fixed.  Elevators were problem too and took days to fix.  The staff was good for the most part but then you get a rude bartender or waiter.  Average place at best.The elevator had some uhm... was it dyed animal fur on the walls maybe? And also there were things placed around that seemed to be something artsy, but also related to women's clothing, like bras made out of odd things. I dunno. Played chess in the lobby for a while, hung out at the bar and drank local beers, never did figure out if they have a pool or not. Someone also said your car stands a greater chance of being broken into if you park in the back by the high concrete walls. Oh also the rooms have ""spiritual menus""  where you can get the holy book for the religion you want. Tried to get scientology, buddhism, etc. but they were basically out of everything other than jesus because deep-south bible belt.","Funky hotel! This place is super-convenient to the airport (although beware! It is NOT on Briley Parkway, but on a side street called ""Envious."" Seriously.) with a free shuttle. The rooms are enormous. My corner room was seriously the size of a small house. Sadly, the space wasn't used as well as it could have been. A fridge and/or microwave would have made this perfect, especially since there's nothing within walking distance except a gas station.The staff was friendly and the bed was comfy. My only complaint is that the internet is painfully slow. At some times it completely drops out and that can beAs a whole the hotel is great, lots of cool little amenities that wouldn't make me want to stay there but when I did they were cool to have. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Almost too friendly. I was a very late arrival (2 Am) and early check out (8 Am). So I didn't need to know all the great things about the hotel, but they told me anyways, which was almost annoying when all I want to do is sleep.As a whole the place seemed nice. Rooms are average, looks like they took an older hotel and try to modernize it but some parts still look old.This hotel is somewhere between a Holiday Inn and The Renaissance. There are little things here and there that need work like chipped paint, better toiletries. But the decor is unique and a lot of interesting freebies like borrowing a pet fish.In reading some of the other reviews, I didn't have any problems like those that others have listed. My room was clean, no odor, water hot, friendly staff, etc. My only complaint is the noise. None of the doors have soft close latches. Anytime someone walks out of their room and BAM!, the door slams behind them. This is exceptionally annoying when people are coming and going in the middle of the night. Also, I stayed in room 218, which clearly must be located directly above where the live band plays. Sound carries right up through the floor- enough that I could distinguish what song they were playing. Did I call down to front desk to be moved? No- as this is my 4th night here and I'm long unpacked and settled in for the week- and it's 10pm and I'm in pajamas and ready for bed.I ended up at the Preston on a week where hotel rooms in the Nashville area were scarce with some kind of conference in town.Let's start with the positive:  hotel shuttle from the airport arrived on time, the hotel is very close to BNA and the hotel front desk, extremely friendly and helpful.Negative:  The most uncomfortable bed and I am talking about rock hard!   Room service:  I ordered a main dish, a drink and a piece of fruit, what came to my room was the main dish and a glass of water, but I was charged for my original order.  In addition, this hotel is not for business travelers, too few outlets...the hallways/room decor has a ""brothel"" feel to it.During the east coast blizzard of 2016, I was stranded and decided to stay at this so called hotel. I checked online and reserved a room for $100.00 for one night with Cheap <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>. Again this was during the blizzard which I could understand when the front desk told me their shuttle services was some how disabled in the snow on the highway, but when I arrived the one and only shuttle was parked in the parking lot. Strike one.... Speaking with the guest service specialist I was told all systems were down and that they were unable to give me a key to my room and since I reserved the room online I was unable to obtain a receipt from the hotel but from where I made the reservation. This is understandable because of the blizzard, but why didn't anyone tell me or inform me when the systems were up an hour later, no phone calls or a knock on my door. I had to make blind trip to the cafe and decided to ask the front desk if the systems were back up. Then and only then did someone give me a key to my room. Strike Two. The last and final issue was the room seemed clean but not at all I saw dead lady bugs on the window seal and on the floor next to the heater. The bathroom toilet dispenser was broken so the toilet paper was left on the floor and there was hair everywhere. Please move on to another hotel.....I had high hopes for Hotel Preston. In retrospect, it would seem the pictures and reviews on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a> are a little too generous. Even still, I considered giving this hotel 3-stars but ultimately, I decided the ""A-OK"" description tends to suggest I would stay here again, and I won't. First off, the PROS:I found the staff to be extremely friendly, attentive and quick to respond. The pricing was decent considering I've paid three times as much to stay downtown.Being able to order a pet fish from room service was quirky and fun.The CONS:That being said, there is no getting around the fact that despite this property having been redecorated well....it's still just a dated hotel with thin walls, adjoining rooms (hate this when not requested), and window units that lose their cool after running constantly (to cover up the sounds of afternoon delight happening next door.)Furthermore, as one reviewer suggested, Mapquest had me driving in large arching circles and despite writing out instructions, I got lost every single time because of the complex changing of highways. (The front desk was not able to give me any tips on a better route either.) One of the few times I decided to forget the directions and just follow the signs to downtown, I was then able to easily navigate myself to my intended destination. However, based on driving and location alone, I would not return. Their intentions are good and though I won't be back to this particular location, I'd be curious to see what this brand would do with a newer property.The hotel is nice! It's like a old hotel that has been updated with some quirky stuff. We love the decor and the room was very nice with a great view of the city but we could see the a/c unit and parking but the great thing its free so thats a point. It's nice that you need the room card to go up The reason Im giving it 3 stars it's the following:-We got there and the front desk guy looked at us like ""What? What you doing here?""-The charge for breakfast-Our a/c was soooooo noisy we couldn't sleep good-Kind of far from downtown were we have our family-Price is too high for what its isIt's ok but not awesomeVery accommodating. We were on a pleasure stay and were not disappointed. I've stayed at a LOT of hotels due to military service, both high and low end and this was a refreshing change.Hotel staff were accommodating and friendlyRoom service was prompt and delicious.Hotel bartenders were friendly and can make a drink even if they've never heard of it. Nice googling bartender :) +1Cleaning staff offered to come as late as 5pm to avoid disturbing us in the early morning hours as we recovered from Broadway street ;). Wifi was easy to connect to, just needed last name and room number. Beautifully decorated in an edgy 1920s feel. Only draw backs were no microwaves or fridge but we ate out every night and soaked up Nashville. Great stay!It's like the place is hungover and yet to recover. Poolside looks like The Afghanistan Hilton, the lobby shabby and less than Chic and the room dingy and tired. The Preston needs a cash infusion or a blood transfusion and STAT.The Preston hotel is worth the price ...the customer service and bedding in my room was great ...also it has a nice ambience ... however the bathroom was small but the room was very spacious ...overall a good experience.I stayed at Hotel Preston because they allowed dogs and were reasonably priced for a dog friendly hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at the room. The room was clean unlike other dog friendly hotels I stayed at, and they gave me a bag full of dog treats and a tennis ball. They also have a doggie room service menu. The restaurant and bar downstairs were also good. I would definitely stay here again when I'm driving through Nashville.This place is very cool! They have a lot of quirky details that made the stay memorable for our family. I loved the art throughout the hotel. My children loved the fact that you can request to borrow a pet during your stay...the kids also took advantage of the lava lamp and free board games.  The hotel was clean, beds were comfy, the staff was very pleasant, and a good value for the price.  It was also a short drive to the he center of Nashville. Our family would definitely stay here again.Described as a boutique hotel. Pictures online are deceiving. Very dark and run down rooms. Also near airport so you can hear the planes regularly. Not really anything close to get good food either. The lounge downstairs does have live music. Overall the rooms and atmosphere I thought we were getting was not the case.Super friendly and accommodating. Extra pet-friendly. Even for big dogs. Came in drunk and 3am and the person at the front desk offered me a late night menu . You will need a cab to get to the main strip with the bars and such- but staff is more than ready to help you with anything you need. Will definitely be staying here again .We checked into the hotel after midnight after getting their complimetary shuttle from the airport which was nearby.   My wife back to sit at the reception desk and it was very pleasant,  with the clerk asking her if we were hungry as to who was going to be for us to a food place nearby. Once we checked into our room we started a packing, but I noticed two large stink bugs above the bed. I called the guest services and he probably came up and took care of it, finding several more bugs in the room. Mahmoud the night clerk was very embarrassed and apologetic, promptly offered to get us another room which he did moving us to the 11th floor.  The rules identical with a better view and nicer beds lol. The only problem with our stay in the close proximity to the airport. My wife was woken up very early with the departing flights from Nashville International. So is airplane noise bothers you you may want to stay elsewhere. We have breakfast downstairs and thats on my other review.  Like the other reviews have stated, the service and hospitality here is very nice, very true about southern hospitality.I stayed at this boutique hotel and enjoyed my stay for the most part. The outside needs a facelift but the inside decor in the lobby, restaurant and bar was trendy, cool and vibrant. The restaurant food was delicious and I ate there everyday, the room service pizza did not taste good at all. They offered a shuttle service that we utilized to go to the mall and other places in the area and the shuttle guys were polite and courteous.Average for the price, rooms needed some updating not nor bad.  The Price was reasonable and they location was good for our plans we had while in town.   The staff was exceptionally nice from the moment we checked in until the minute we left.   I would stay again.I was really excited to stay in this hotel because it was a boutique and I like staying in different types of hotels. But I must say we had a really bad service from one particular person named Denny. When we landed we call for the shuttle and it came immediately which was fantastic but then we were told by Danny we would have to wait until later in the day to get a room when there was nobody in the hotel room. We totally understand the rules of checking but if there's nobody in the rooms I feel like it's fair to let us at least put her bag somewhere when we get in at 8 AM in the morning out of courtesy for staying at the hotel. Denny was very hesitant on this but once we actually arrive to the hotel we met Israel who is super helpful and let us check into a room right away. I will say the service at the bar was quite slow and it took us about 10 minutes to even get a waitress to come over to us with four people in the bar but over all the food was good. As far as alcohol goes they were out of every type of vodka except for one and did not have any limes which we found quite odd for a bar to be missing. I believe the turning point first day was this morning when the ice machine wasn't working and we asked Denny at the front desk to have some ice brought up because we didn't want to go from floor to floor in our pajamas. His response was there's ice on every even numbered floor and if you want it you need to go get it. I responded with is this a hotel?  I've never stayed in a hotel where I'm told that I need to go do something when their issues are broken. He was extremely rude and his customer service was the worst in the hotel industry I've ever seen and I have traveled for over 10 years staying in different hotels almost every week. I would suggest that the hotel trains Denny and better customer service as the customer should feel important when they're staying on their premises, and taking one minute out of your time to get ice when you're two ice machines are broken should not be a big issue.Well he left me a massage here as well a message in email to contact him called him ten times and guess what no answer. I can see why now the pageant system that im involved in moved their event next weekend. Heard everyone complained.","Cute place.  My 2 year old was given a pet fish for the night along with rubber duckies, dominoes and a lava lamp! The hotel itself was clean (for the most part) and staff was decent.  I wouldn't recommend the restaurant on site.  The waitress was nice but the food was overpriced and kinda blah.Great customer service. Beds are amazingly comfortable. Hotel is close to everything. Only down side is the rooms are a bit humid.This hotel's attempt to create a rock 'n roll boutique is a swing and a miss. As the guest, you definitely understand the theme they were going for but it fell short. Furthermore, the hotel is gross but more on that later. We arrived around 5:00 pm on Thursday evening, seemed well enough upon pulling into the parking lot. We walked into the hotel lobby and was hit with a smell that can only be described as old with hints of cigarette smoke. Which made me worry because this hotel advertises itself as a smoke free hotel. I digress. We check in and the lobby attendant informs us that there is a $35 hold a night. We've stayed in many cities and it's usually a $100 hold for the length of your stay. That's fine - we are not going to wreck the room. We take the elevator to our room and notice a red substance in the carpet - blood perhaps but we will never know. We just wore our shoes around the room. We walk into the bathroom and notice there isn't a fan. There is also ceiling tiles that one would put in their basement - they are absolutely water logged and threaten to collapse while using the facilities. I don't think I have ever showered faster than Thursday evening. Who knows what lays beyond those tiles. We leave the hotel room around 7:00 pm to eat dinner in downtown Nashville. When we return, there are hundred of ladybugs all over the ceiling - this is not an exaggeration. These are things I don't need to deal with on vacation. I go to the front desk and inform her that there are hundreds of lady bugs in my room. She replies that they are having issues with lady bugs and proceeds to call housekeeping to vacuum the room. She arrives about ten minutes later with her vacuum and asks my husband if he can vacuum the room because she is not able to reach all the bugs. Really? You want me to clean my own room. He ends up vacuuming. I proceed to call Orbitz to get me out of here. Unfortunately, all the hotels were booked in the area. So, we stayed the night. No joke, the absolute worst night's sleep I ever had. I kid you not, you can feel every spring in the mattress. Every time my husband moved, I woke up. I probably slept two hours and I was deathly afraid that a ladybug was going to find a home in my ears. Seriously, I would rather stay in American Horror Story: Hotel Cortez than this place. We checked out early and flew home. I could not stay there another night. Luckily, we didn't have to pay for the other three nights we booked. It's creepy and gross.I've never stayed at an independently owned and operated hotel before and you could tell that it is with the interesting subtleties which set it apart from your standard Holiday Inn or Courtyard by Marriott.It's at the three star level on Priceline.The red fur in the elevator makes you want to cozy up there and relax while you wait on your floor.  The room is nice and SPACIOUS and the internet is good.  Free wifi with customer support backup.  I had to call about getting my iMac connected and they manually forced my internet connection through.The pictures on the wall make you feel like you're at a Hard Rock Hotel cousin, specializing in country music.   There's no laundry facility but there are plenty in the area to choose from.  No microwave or fridge either but hey, if you're smart, you'll bring your own microwave and cooler. There's a considerable upgrade fee if you're looking to get a room on the top floor.It's nice to see three star hotels like this one that are pet friendly.  They're also considerate of the neighbors and isolate pets to the second floor.  There is most likely an additional fee for a pet. The doors are a little slammy but ear plug headphones at night with some ambient music on Pandora do the trick.  This hotel is probably concrete frame because although the walls between rooms are thin, I never hear any bumping or banging around in the adjoining rooms or upstairs/downstairs.There's often live music in the bar next to the lobby.  Guitarists love to come here and practice their music in room as well.  I did hear some music when I was in the bathroom but it was a pleasant sound.  I still kept my headphones on because I like my music even more.  :-)This is a great hotel to socialize in and meet new people.    I wish I had pictures to fully portray the feel of this hotel.  You can tell that the front desk staff care about their jobs immensely because the girl at the front seemed upset for me when there was no luggage cart available at check-out.I'd love to give it 5 stars but the noisy doors and lack of microwave/fridge made me think otherwise.If I could give 0 stars I would, I have stayed in better Holiday Inn Expresses. Hotel Preston (HP) has a lot of issues that at first glance you miss because the places is defiantly a little modern with a little edgy, with a touch of creepy... But all of that is just to hide the disgusting flaws! #1 make sure you get a room on an odd floor(if you must stay here) because evens have an ice machine and pop machine directly across from the room (possibly)  no barrier except your door#2 My shower heat never was really right and the shower made a horrible shareable noise and when your here for a week for work!#3&amp;4 The INTERNET First if you have an apple product forget it, there stuff is so antiquated that you have to be on the phone with the helpdesk for 15 minutes your first night, to get set up for Internet! Then the server shuts down if they get too many guess because it gets overloaded... And every night I was there it got overloaded!!! I travel all the time for business this never happens, completely on acceptable! If you're just passing through for the night this place is fine, but if you're traveling on business this is not the place for you, I would recommend going anywhere else!Found a deal on this hotel through the hotel tonight app. Ample free parking. Front desk was decent. Room was ok - cute and eclectic but the beds were not very comfortable. Shower had good water pressure. The location is close enough to get a $10 uber to downtown. Charlie at the hotel bar was friendly and helpful with suggestions. All in all a decent hotel for the price we paid.The lady at the front desk with the blonde hair was extremely rude she had no interest in pleasing her guests and you can tell she forced a smile and a fake attitude. If you dislike your job that much find another. Our first room smelt awful there was a wet mildew smell coming from the ac unit and the guests on that floor were very loud and disturbing not to mention our towels were still dirty when we had arrived!. The guests on our floor (5th) would constantly scream up and down the hallway and had trash (alcohol bottles, pizza boxes etc) all over the hallway floor. (You'd think management would handle this situation) In all honestly if wasn't for Israel (I believe that's his name) (the maintenance  guy) we would've canceled our reservation and went elsewhere. He went above and beyond to help us feel comfortable. The owners and or managers seriously need to rethink how they handle their hotel as it's going down the wrong road for being in such a big city.A nice hotel with a touch of modern renovation however it is still an older hotel with a slight face lift. Not a fan of the carpets or the cleanliness of ceiling and walls in bathroom/shower. Overall it was pleasant but still needs more than a slight faceliftImagine if 3 12-year boys (best friends) grew up and decided to run a hotel....that is Hotel Preston.  Picked for us by Priceline as a 3.5 (more of a 2.5), it is quirky and weird.  From the furry elevators to the boob lamp (think Christmas Story) to odd choice of pictures in the hallways, it was odd.  I also hated the connecting room doors.  The guy next to us decided to knock in the middle of the night.  Odd.But if you like whimsy, you'll love it.   The rooms were ""fine"" but very worn (holes in the cloth shower curtain).  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful so that is a plus.  And we did eat breakfast there and they made a perfect poached egg on my eggs Benedict.  (The hollandaise was broken if I were to critique it.)  It is perfect if you need to do stuff on that side of Nashville because you avoid a lot of the horrible traffic.  So if I needed a quick hotel in Nashville that was cheap, I'd come back.  If I were going to Nashville for a ""real"" vacation, I'd pass...especially a family trip.Just called to grab some details about the hotel and the rooms offered. Wait on hold for 15 minutes and someone came on the phone and I asked if he could explain the different between the executive room and the suite. He said ""a suite is a suite"". I said I am unfamiliar with what is considered a suite. He said ""you don't know what a suite is?"" I said ""no, sorry"" and he said ""sorry, I was just asking"" and HUNG UP THE PHONE!Definitely not going here. TERRIBLE customer service.This place is very average and a little corny. There was actual fur on the walls in the elevator. The bed was pretty comfy but the white pleather furniture in the room was very stiff. The pool was pretty nice and there was never too many people there, but was small. It was in a great location from the city. It was a short car ride away which is nice because it wasn't in the middle of the city. The restaurant was very good though. Overall, I feel there is nicer, but for the price this is pretty good.People were nice hotel overall is okay however the mattresses are horrible for a ""boutique"" hotel you would expect better quality! Spent four days there and my back is killing me because the mattress was hard as a rock.First, prepare for smokey rooms, hallways and elevators even though there are signs everywhere saying non-smoking. Your clothes will smell like smoke when you leave. Second, prepare for bad customer service. You'll be put on hold for everything for at least 10minutes. The rooms are dark and dingy, very humid and the AC is old. The bathroom had cracked tiles, old/gross grouting and the electrical socket was falling out of the wall. You can hear every door on your floor slam shut. The location is not good either, a solid 15min cab ride to anywhere. This hotel is by no means downtown. We called to complain and the manager on duty basically laughed at us and told us there's a two night minimum no matter what. The hotel and service were so bad that we actually left and paid the two night minimum on top of the cost of another hotel to salvage our Nashville experience. Overall, I would never recommend this hotel.The hotel decor is quirky and the staff are all really nice, but it's not in the best area. A little research will tell you that; however, it is very conveniently located close to both the airport and a gas station. The food served in the lounge and for room service are nothing to write home about, but my biggest complaint comes from the cleanliness of our room.     While it all looked okay on the surface, I couldn't help but smell urine somewhere around my bed and couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Low and behold it was ON my bed! My husband and I thought it was interesting that the housekeeping kept a flat white sheet over the duvet cover but didn't take it off until we were making our bed ourselves the day before we left. So gross, they were using the flat sheet to cover up a big, huge, smelly urine stain right on our comforter. It didn't even seem to have been washed or attempted to be removed! Needless to say we didn't use the duvet the last night and luckily it was warm enough for that. Pretty disappointed... Also the free wifi available is nice but it's so incredibly slow and they make you re-log in every 10 minutes.Solid 4 stars. I'm here right now, and this hotel is fine. It is an older hotel which was updated, but who cares? I'll start with the great: staff, all 3 I interacted with- and all front desk- thanks! My room is HUGE. I'm at the end of the hall, and it's an L-shaped room, couch, ginormous closet. Also greats: the complimentary fish or lava lamp (cute!) choice of pillow or religious text, delivered to your room is a cute amenity, though I didn't take advantage.The good: the walls are a little thin, the toilet makes a weird pulsing noise when refilling? Temporary. I got a decent deal on Priceline. (125)The bad: location. If you want to party on Broadway on Saturday night. I didn't want to drive, and it seemed far for a cab. The ugly: it straight took me a half hour to actually GET to this place. Your GPS won't be able to figure it out, and send you driving in circles. The hotel should also list it's ""envious"" road address, which I got after calling the hotel in frustration.. Also, 155 south= briley parkway. Grrrr. I suspect I was given this pimp room by the guy who helped me... I think he felt bad for me! Thanks.Long story longer, for a short term stay, this place is just fine. Thanks!Hotel Preston is a terrible place to stay. It is in a less than desirable section of town, and it has terrible staff. The front desk staff was more interested in their Internet browsing than they were in their customers. It seemed as though I was interrupting their life.The beds were extremely hard and the room had a strange odor, of which I could not identify. The bathroom smelled of urine (before it was used).We could not wait to get out of there any sooner. We left before 6:30 AM. Their website claims they are such a fantastic hotel, but it is wishful thinking or self delusion. I will not ever stay there again.I think I could have overlooked some of the hotel's outdated and tired building deficiencies if they had sought to serve their customers in a professional and courteous manner. I've never seen such rude service, and I spend more than 50% of my time in hotels.You never get a second chance to make a good first impression. And you rarely overcome poor customer service from the front desk.Discrimination at the bar? well it felt like that to me... but it happened to me last Friday. when i ordered a couple of glasses of wine for me and my wife and the bartender with a ring in the nose, asked me to pay  up front  2 seconds after ordering, huh?  I even didn't have the chance to taste it!!! we just arrived to see the Latin show there...and the bartender did the same to every Latin person...but not to the apparent american white people.  My question is, why have a Latin show and display such discrimination against Latin customers?Our overall stay was good. I was disappointed that there wasn't wifi in the rooms (even for a fee), the halls were VERY dark, the water was REALLY cold and then BOILING hot. We had issues with the room next door one out of five nights we stayed with the slamming of the door constantly but we called and they quieted down. There was a short brown haired lady at the bar that was  clueless. Other than her all the staff was pleasant and prompt. Price to stay was affordable.Horrible! Went for a ""girls weekend"" and booked on Expedia. The pictures looked great from their website. Got to the hotel and there was trash everywhere outside, nowhere to park, and people were smoking right outside the door. Got into the front desk and it looked dark and dirty. The elevator walls were disgusting and made me feel dirty. Went to the second level and the hallways were very smelly. Smelled like animal and nasty body odor. Went into our room and the room was very dark, the bed had stains on it, the toilet was not cleaned, the chair had a dark stain and a white stain, the window had finger prints everywhere. When asked for a refund the manager was not very pleasant and told us ""room service already cleaned it"". Finally after an hour of hassle he finally gave us a refund but we then had to talk to Expedia as well (not the hotels fault). Overall, not recommended, and the location was terrible! In the middle of no where.I'm from NYC...I've traveled for years and stayed in many many hotels and even a few motels.  In all my travels I've never had such a bad experience as I am currently having here. Where to start....the nauseatingly musty room that made my sinuses stuff up clearly had to be mold-- so I was moved to another room.  It took 3 rooms to find one that didn't stink.  After calling the front desk for a shuttle to the CVS to get Advil for the headache it gave me...they put me on hold and never picked back up -- so I had to call again only to be told they didn't know where the shuttle was. Ok....Tonight they booked a team of teenage tournament players and instead of blocking a group of rooms for them together -- scattered loud boisterous disrespectful terribly behaving teenagers throughout the hotel.  I have a dorm room with kids running all around banging doors, playing music, screaming through the halls.....and every time I call the front desk:  I cannot get anyone to do anything.  I was literally told they are paying guests and management  has to ""balance the needs of all the guests"".....as if any guest has a need --or a right -- to be loud and disrespectful.   I've called 10 times -- nothing is changing and its a nightmare.    Their only suggestion is to inconvenience me to move to another room yet again.  I made the mistake of transferring here from the Sheraton Music City, wanting a quaint smaller place to stay.  Omg. Mistake.  The Sheraton is huge had so many more rooms - but they took care of my every need and everything was spotless.  Not recommended at all Unless your low income and this is all you can afford.","I stayed here this past weekend to celebrate my mom's 60th birthday. From the time my parents checked in they were treated with such kindness and were extremely helpful. The hotel is definitely older and in need of renovations.  The decor is very unique including a furry wall in an elevator that clucks like a chicken. However the extra stars go to the great staff. One in particular, krystle, went above and beyond. She gave us various options of things to do, places to see, and recs to eat. If she wasn't sure, she looked it up. We forgot something or needed something, she obliged. What they lack in modern things, they make up for in hospitality. Thank you Krystle for making my mom's weekend wonderful. You are a special person. Thank you to all of the people here who were generally nice...and for the fun fish, lava lamp, and rubber duckies in the room. I'd come back.Stayed here during a short weekend visit to the Nashville area as they were dog friendly. Staff was friendly and eager to please. They treated us very kindly and loved Marco! Our room located on the dog friendly third floor was clean and comfortable but a bit dated. We both enjoyed the pink cowhide elevators, lol! We would stay here again.It's very rare for me to stay at a hotel that does not include breakfast but I really wanted to like Hotel Preston. Although nothing about my visit was bad I highly doubt I will be back. Based on the location and price point I got the impression Preston is competing with the Mariott and Hilton mid brand hotel and trying to stand out with quirky features. The staff is great, very helpful anytime I went to the front desk at night, check in lady was nice too as were the people who brought stuff to our room. The lobby is nice decorated but kind of sexy glam - fun here but not what I would want in my home. At night they have a security guard in the lobby and the elevator requires a room key - I felt very safe! The room upon arrival stood out for being spacious. The room was clean minus a small ""item"" floating in the toilet - easily flushable but make me wonder where else housekeeping might have skipped cleaning. The furnishings and decor look nice and are just like the web photos but upon in person inspection it's obvious they are not as high quality as photographed to look. Definitely a more modern look than your typical chain. However, the bed was most disappointing. The bedding was a standard comforter wrapped in a white duvet - not at all the plush down material the competitors offer. Mattress quality and comfort was on par with a red roof inn. Good service and cool couches can't make up for lacking in the basic reason I stay in a hotel - having a place to sleep. Nearby competitors offer better beds, breakfast and indoor pools at the price point. Unless rooms came down to $50 a night I just don't see myself coming back.Oh my holy mother of Pete!! This is not a four star hotel! I gave this hotel THREE chances, but let's start from the beginning shall we?! We drove 8 1/2 hours from Raleigh after our wedding to get to this ""four star"" hotel at 11:00PM.  (We called and let them know we were going to be late.) My husband checked in and right away I saw a stain on the right side bed. GROSS! We went downstairs and Shelby changed our room, but before we moved our bags, we inspected the room.  CLEARLY, the cleaning crew isn't really looking at the comforters, and we found a black marking on our sheets that couldn't really be explained but it looked like a foot print. Um, no...not sleeping in a bed with anything on the comforter.  Call me picky but the knowledge of someone else foot or whatever it was on my bed is not comforting. So AGAIN, we went downstairs a second time and Shelby tried to upgrade us into a corner king room. So, this room is not an upgrade!! It's a hallway of wasted space with the same size room we had before with one king bed. This ""UPGRADED"" room was the WORST one of them all. There were bugs, there was ANOTHER black marking on the bed, and crazy dusty drapes. I have NEVER seen my husband so mad. I know we are newly weds, but I have lived with him eight years...and he was PISSED!! We just wanted a CLEAN bed to sleep in.So, needless to say we just wanted our money back, but there was NO MANAGER on duty to do this. SERIOUSLY?! What four star hotel doesn't have a manager that can handle theses situation even available via phone?! My husband had to call the next morning from Holiday Inn (where we ended up staying) to find out that the manager who can handle the refund was not available until noon. In the meantime, Chaz or Jazz had me send in the pictures for proof of the refund. Proof?! Really?! I understand there are some shady people there, but THREE TIMES?! You think I would make up something like that up?! Thankfully, I was one step ahead of them and I took a picture in every single room we moved to. He called him two hours later to let him know that the money would refunded within two to five business days. The email of the pictures must have been enough to convince them we weren't lying, but no refund of the sort. My husband later called back and found out that since it was a third party we went through that we had to get it back from them. Way to let us know when he called us back to let us know our money would be refunded! This hotel was NOT up to par and even with our money back my husband is STILL so pissed when it comes up. And manager man, there is nothing you can do to change the fact that my husband and I tried to stay at your hotel the day after our wedding and didn't get the four star hotel experience. PERIOD!My wife and I stayed at Hotel Preston after visiting the Opryland Hotel.  We found the hotel to be clean and comfortable.  The staff was friendly and we enjoyed our stay.So this is the hotel that I won after bidding on priceline. We've stayed here before and didn't care to come back. Well the money was already spent so we went ahead and got our room. We always know that when we get to the front desk the clerk is going to stick us in a double bed room regardless if you ask for a king. They always come up with the excuse, ""oh I'm sorry we are out"" even though we got there at 3:30pm right after check in started. It's like they want to punish you for getting a good deal on priceline. Anyhow, we got a room on the 2nd floor of the hotel. The room was bigger than average. We have stayed in a lot of hotels all over the United States due to travelling as a military personnel. We were in Nashville for the night and didn't stay in the room that long. We went out to dinner and dancing. Got back to the room after 1am. The front desk clerk greeted us and asked if we were hungry. I asked if the restaurant was open. He said no but he has a flyer for somewhere we can order delivery food from, that he allows to come straight to the rooms. That was cool after a night of partying. We went to bed without ordering anything. Morning came and we were awaken by the guest next to us. You can literally hear everything going on in the room next to you. Walls are very thin. I don't know if we were next to the kitchen on the second floor but we can smell the breakfast from inside our room, which was weird. Other than the lobby, the hotel decor is dated. Stuff is fallen apart in the rooms, the tv needed to be replaced. I thought it was snowing while watching tv. Ridiculous! Bugs and rotted doors. Needless to say I would not walk into this place and book a room. Priceline picked it but I'll most likely choose a different location to bid on in order to avoid this hotel.I I would give this place 2 1/2 stars but it doesn't give the half star option so I went with three because overall our stay was okay. We checked in and when we got to our room they had given us two queens instead of a king(as requested) so after we got that straighten out we got to our room and the complimentary dog food and water bowls that were supposed to be in our room were not so I called the front desk and they said they would bring them up ASAP, we waited over an hour but had to leave for reservations and they never showed up. The entire hotel is outdated and has a smell that I can't put my finger on. We only paused 75.00 a night because of a deal online so we weren't disappointed but if we had paid the normal 150-180 we would have been very upset with the overall stay. Will not stay here again.After getting to town and finding that the reservations we had at Sheraton were no good because they were undergoing renovations we began looking for another Place to stay. The hotel is very funky friendly And the rooms kitschy cool - sort if a retro new wave thing happening that's neat. Beds are comfy and the price was easy on the back pocket if you don't want to be downtownIt was a quirky hotel. The service wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. My room did smell like urine and the smoke alarm went off when we turned the heater on. The lava lamp and ducks added a little sunshine to my not so impressive experience. If you get a better room, I'd say it's a fun stay. I'm not staying again because they didn't change our after a 2 night stay in a stinky room.Very interesting hotel absolutely loved the decor and unique room service options and very pet friendly but we were missing items after housekeeping paid a visit and nothing was done about it when we mentioned it to the front desk; kind of sadI'll make this brief. I'm here now trying to get some sleep before an early morning flight. However, sleep will not come due to all the NOISE here. It sounds like someone rolling a huge cart up and down the hallway and someone slamming doors. There is also some guy in the hall either yelling or talking super loud...not sure which just yet. This is quite possibly the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at in all of my travels. I booked through Expedia because I got a decent rate. Never again. I have stayed at the Hyatt Place near the airport which was way nicer and quieter. This place is off my list of future airport hotels.My parents stayed here last week and absolutely loved it. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The hotel made a mistake on one of their nights and booked them on the same floor as an entire frat. It was a very loud and obnoxious night for them. But the hotel was quick to admit their mistake the next day and immediately moved them to a new room. They were very happy with their stay and will definitely be using Hotel Preston in the future. Thank you!The first red flag were the shady folks outside this hotel smoking weed and cigs. Felt really trashy.  The hotel felt dirty and no class at all.  My phone and air conditioner in my room didn't work to boot. Will not come back!   Don't get me started on the coffee2 words...NEVER AGAIN!! The only reason I give 2 stars is because they have great staff. Other than that, looks (pictures) are VERY deceiving. My wife and I stayed here for 3 days and it was horrible. We just felt dirty staying there. Yes they have made some nice renovations and the overall look is pretty cool, but this place is grungy. There were a couple spots on the floor in my room that were wet, the bathroom door was rotted at the bottom with a fresh paint job, the complementary robes had stains on them...Need I say more?Was in Nashville for one night and booked the hotel through Groupon. The young woman at check-in was super nice and voluntarily wrote out a list of must-sees and best restaurants, even giving $ notations for price ranges. The hotel itself was nice and clean, after getting over the decor. We felt like we were in a 70s porno or something - very weird vibes. Overall, not a bad experience and only 15 minutes from downtown, so it was very convenient.Well my first experience  with this hotel was getting to wait for over an hour for the airport shuttle. I would not have waited so long if every time I called (4 times) they said the driver was 5 minutes away. Needless to say, I ended up getting in a cab finally. I then asked to speak to a Manager to pay for my cab ride. The manager instead gave me $30 voucher for food/drinks, which was very nice. But this hotel is just a mess. The food isn't that good &amp; there is not enough staff in the restaurant. The room decor is fine but outdated. I also had no hand towels in my room. All in all, it's a fine place to stay for business but NOT for tourists. Very inconvenient. You can't walk anywhere. You have to take cabs everywhere unless you rent a car. I didn't love it at allNot impressed, Hotel Preston. After driving literally for 13 hours straight to get here, I had hoped for a better experience than what I got. Upon first glance online, the hotel seemed chic and all about customer service. Upon arrival, not so much. Exterior of the hotel looks aged. Front desk staff, while friendly, was short and not very knowledgeable. Decor was modern in the front room and lobby, but not too impressive in the remainder of the hotel. Room was clean, but had a slight scent of smoke. Room decor was OK, some modern accents in an otherwise normal hotel room, and a cool headboard. Bathroom was clean and Aveda products were provided. Checkout was uneventful.Problems: hotel service menu is not very organized; presentation looked cheap and it seemed to have pages missing. Room service, while very fast, does not tell you clearly that a $3 delivery charge + 18% gratuity is added to your total, along with tax. The receipt is not itemized so you have to catch it immediately, otherwise you won't know why it cost so much without calling to ask (which I had to). So while my grilled chicken breast and side salad was sort of yummy, it was not worth $23.90 (originally $16) plus the generous tip I added on before realizing how the total was calculated.Details on food: half of chicken breast was tasty while the other half was super dry and hard. Side salad was great, served with a tomato/bacon dressing. Roll was hard on the outside and soft, but dry on the inside (how does that happen?!). Fries were plain and good.I would summarize this place to be a clean and safe place to stay for the night, but not anywhere to be excited about staying even though their website makes you think otherwise.Three stars = A-OK and that totally captures the Hotel Preston experience.  I had a friend come into town for a Gaylord Opryland based meeting and encouraged her to stay at Hotel Preston instead of the chaos that is Opryland. I had heard good hipster buzz on the Preston but have to say, I was underwhelmed. I knew they were going for the 'too hip to care' vibe but the low ceilings and really bad carpets weren't needed.  There are the cute 'pick your own pillows' and lava lamps and a nice bar.  In general, I would stay here if I had to be based around Opryland or the airport (with a car, of course). I'd be sure to score one of the many onlne deals to make this worth your while.This place was mediocre but that's what I get for paying $75 per night, I guess. The first room we checked into had stained sheets (gross); I called and got switched to a new room but the fact that they offered up stained sheets to begin with was a huge turn off. Unfortunately, I had prepaid and therefore was stuck there for two nights. There weren't any other big issues but I was surprised that the front desk staff didn't offer any kind of added response other than to allow me to switch rooms. Another turn off was that when I called up the front desk to ask for a bottle of water, I was told that I could either go to the vending machine (I didn't have small bills) or that I would have to wait until the restaurant opened.Some cool things, on the bright side, were that they delivered a fishy to our room upon request! :)Not a bad place but not worth the price. The hotel had funky and  gothic looking decor. The hallways to this hotel is outdated and it looked creepy. This hotel made me feel like I was on the ghost busters movie. I been to some really bad hotel stays here in Nashville, but this one is so far decent. My cabin was big and was comfortable but still a bit creepy . Everything looked clean and the bed linens were soft. The mattress was hard, my husband was very uncomfortable. The water pressure was great I didnt want to get out od the shower. The room was a bit stuffy but has gotten cold real fast as soon as we turned on air conditioner.  Don't order room service they charge 3.00 delivery fee and you have to pay a 15 percent graturaties on top of what ever you order. The menu is kind of  pricy,  honestly you are better off eating at a restaurant close by for the same price. This hotel is not far from downtown, it took us 15 minutes.","Got a great rate directly via their website. Smooth check in process they had out room ready a little bit earlier than check in time. We found the lobby clean but the elevator was a little stuffy.Our room was clean and a good size! Clean sheets, plenty of pillows. The TV service wasn't very good at all, but we were out of the room most of the day so that didn't really matter. Nice water pressure in the shower our only bathroom complaint was the door was in an odd spot so that it was hard for more than one person to be there at a time. Over all a very good experience and we would for sure go back!Best management hands down! Apon arrival hotel met the expectations mentioned online until we met Willis. He truly showed the meaning of southern hospitality and was very well dressed. We stayed all around the world in some of the best hotels but the staff here was one of a kind and always accommodating. If you want to know where to go at night talk to the night staff and if your looking for activities in the day ask the  day staff. Among the many great things about the hotel the best was Willis found an item of mine that I thought went missing, and took the time to wish us a safe trip home. All  around pleasant experience would definitely stay here again!!!Staying here for a conference, the hotel was very accommodating for the conference attendees. However, there are many issues with this hotel.First, it's close to the airport--and that's great. But there is a lot of noise from flying planes and there aren't a lot of restaurants nearby. It's a commute or taxi ride to the nearby restaurants. The hotel does have a friendly van service, but location is still key.The hotel's restaurant is /terrible/. I'll review that separately, but paired with the above comment about location--it stinks to stay here for multiple days. Don't eat in the hotel's poor restaurant.The rooms and hotel have been renovated and that's great. But the housekeeping staff doesn't do a great job at keeping things clean. My shower was full of mold and mildew, and the housekeeping staff didn't restock soap in my room, nor refill my toliet paper, nor refill the tissue dispenser (they did at least leave a box for me to replace).The towels were threadbare and falling part about 50% of the time.If you need to stay here for a night, that's fine. But, definitely don't view this as a destination in Nashville.My stay at Hotel Preston is about my fourth.  I originally stayed here a couple of years ago when using Priceline to find a hotel.  This visit was due to a company function being held at Hotel Preston, so it was convenient.  My room was clean and what I needed.  I did have a hard time finding a place near the bed to charge my telephone and laptop.  (It would be nice to have outlets that are easy to get to other than the desk lamp).  I had dinner at the restaurant.  I remembered that the food was good, and I was not disappointed.  I ordered the balsamic chicken which was amazing.  Service was wonderful...a very attentive staff.There is a lounge adjacent to the restaurant, so it gets loud once the band starts so if you are looking for a quiet dinner, eat before the band gets going.  I needed a corkscrew so I visited the front desk to borrow one and was directed to the bar.  The female bartender was not able to loan me a corkscrew and said I could either bring my bottle to the very busy bar, or to the restaurant which I was not interested in doing either.  I went back to the front desk and they were able to find one from the restaurant.  I felt as though the bartender just didn't want to bother with me. If I weren't a loyal diamond guest at another hotel chain due to my business travel, I would stay here again.  Again, my stay was due to business at the hotel however, I HIGHLY recommend this unique hotel and encourage anyone to try the restaurant.We just arrived and checked in with ease! The Hotel Preston was very very easy to get to from the interstate. The staff are extremely friendly and courteous. The hotel is clean and the property well kept. Our room is on the 10th floor and overlooks the pool. As soon as I grabbed the tv remote, I noticed a hand written note from the front desk manager welcoming us... a very nice touch! The room was nice and cool when we walked in and the room and bathroom are very clean and comfortable. Last week, I sent an e-mail to the GM  to ask him if the hotel had a mini fridge available for my wife to store breast milk for our infant son. (I read online that the rooms don't have mini fridges) Thank you Hotel Preston for having the fridge waiting for us in our room. This will be a huge help during our stay! I looked over the restaurant menu and the prices seem appropriate. I peeked into the restaurant and also the bar downstairs and they both looked very clean and inviting. Cons: the hallways are warm.... As long as I don't have to sleep in the hallway, I couldn't give a you know what!Great experience so far!I tried to change my reservation to one night later and pay for an upgrade. The hotel refused to move it. Also, they would not give any refund for cancellations and I paid up front. Overall, the customer service was very poor and unaccommodating. I won't stay here.Definitely NOT a 3.5 star hotel, but apparently <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> seems to think it is! A/C unit is #304 started smoking when I set to ""E/Save"", then they only have ice machines on every other floor but don't tell you that until you come all the way down to the lobby after walking the whole floor looking for it. On a more positive note, the 2nd floor smells like a strip club...that's the only reason they get the extra star in my rating!Just got back from a 3 day stay at the Hotel Preston, and I definitely enjoyed it! It's a very nice hotel, close to the airport, close to downtown, the rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable, staff friendly and helpful. I would give 5 stars if our room had a fridge and a fan in the bathroom to pull out the moisture while you're taking a shower, but that's alright, I still really enjoyed my stay, and I would definitely go back there again.We stayed at Hotel Preston for 3 nights. There are better areas to stay in Nashville, such as Downtown or the West End by Vanderbilt, but everything in those areas was booked. I see this hotel/location as more of an overflow place than a destination. Here's the good and bad for Hotel Preston:Good1) Bar Lounge on site had live music every night we were there.2) Free Parking3) Didn't notice any airport noise (they are right next to the airport)4) Front desk staff was friendly.Bad1)  Bathroom door was sticky, reported to staff but it wasn't cleaned properly. Maybe it is the paint finish on the door, but still gross.2) Price of $172 per night after taxes was pricey for the quality/location3) No Refrigerator4) Zoneline style AC was noisy5) Towels were like sandpaper6) In room coffee carafe was dirty, I reported and they gave me one that had a chunk of glass missing from it, reported that, and they gave me a stainless steel one.7) Room doors make a loud noise when they close, which is jarring at night, so I wore ear plugs.8) No King size beds available for us.9) Carpet in room had stains.10) Location is not close to attractions or restaurants. No shuttle to downtown, only the airport.All in all, not terrible, but more of an $80 per night place. A shuttle to downtown would have been a big plus.This hotel seems like a fish out of water. It has that rock &amp; roll vibe a la Hard Rock but it's in Texas and near an airport. Yay for free parking and internet wifi. I hate when so-called nice hotels gouge people for services that should be included in the room rate. I'm talking to you 4+ star hotels! Back from my tangent. I love the cute amenities! A free rubber ducky for your bath. Borrow a lava lamp to set the mood. Milk and cookies if you like but it's not free. Temporary fish pet when you need some company. Mines was named Charlie. He was quiet and laid back. Good listener too!The room decor is cool. The walls are a bit thin. I don't want to know what my neighbours are doing. The soaps are nice but nothing to write home about. Bathrobe was nice but don't steal it.The pillow menu was a nice comfy touch. Must be a new trend because I've seen in other hotels too. Now, the religion menu was a hoot! Seriously it covered 99% of world religion even Scientology! I didn't partake but it was entertaining. Charlie and I had a good laugh.One annoying thing (but maybe not for others) was the elevator, it requires your room key every time. I'm sure it for security sake but when it's late at night and you just want a soda....I liked what it had to offer and if I could I'd give it 3.5 stars. But it had annoyances that couldn't justify a 4 star rating. Would I come back? If Priceline gave me another good deal, sure.5 stars to Charlie fish!It's an older hotel that has been redone. It's rough around the edges in places. They will give you a rubber ducky and a fish companion while you are here. Overall not bad really. They need to pay attention to the little details and they would get a higher rating from me!Last  Wednesday, my family and I ate at the restaurant at Hotel Preston.  Chef Danny made an AMAZING meatloaf plus the meals that my family had.  We felt welcome and like family when we couldn't decide if we wanted to eat at the Pink Slip or the restaurant.  Well, we tried both places and while both of them were wonderful, it made it easier to have conversation in the restaurant.  I know I'll be back there again!This is the best place to stay in Nashville if you're traveling with pets.  We take our dog everywhere so my husband and I stay here whenever we are in Nashville.  We like it because not only is it pet-friendly but they really make that its ""thing.""  Whenever we come in with our dog, they give her a gift bag with a toy and various dog treats as well as a list of all the dog friendly restaurants and dog parks in Nashville.  Yeah, they don't have a breakfast but there's a great breakfast buffet a five minute drive away at Ellendales and we can bring our dog.  :)No steve it has not been worked out. Your staff is pretending it has been fixed but it has not.Discuss with them, they seem to have ALL of the answers.2 stars for Reza, the transport valet!  While the hotel is OK at best with the static in their ""HDTV,"" Barbara, the crappiest bartender ever, and having NO water for 2 hours when we checked in...Reza was the ONLY breath of fresh air after a four hour drive from race week at Bristol. Without water, there was no shower, no brushing of the teeth, no coffee, no peeing or washing of the hands. Add to that no fridge or no microwave? WTF did we pay for for ONE night?  Sadly, we missed out on Nashville for St. Patty's Day.....thanks, JERKS!  Wish I had my $315 back!I love the Hotel Preston,  and stay there every time I'm in Nashville. I don't know my way around the city,  but this seems like a prefect location,  five minutes from the Ryman, the same from Broadway and Church, and about fifteen minutes from Vanderbilt. The hotel has kind of a funky,  hipster vibe. (I hope youlike red!) There's fun art in the lobby,  great pictures in the hallways and in the rooms,  and more,  if you care to go looking for it. The rooms are very large and comfortable, though they lack mini-fridges and microwaves. Hey, you're in Nashville. Go out and have fun!   The staff is very friendly and they know where to point you to maximize your leisure time in Nashville. To cap everything off,  the hotel is shockingly affordable.  I highly recommend the Hotel Preston.We found a great deal on this hotel through Priceline on our recent stay in Nashville. I must say that the pros definitely outweighed the cons of some people's reviews for us. When I booked the room it actually booked two queen beds instead of a King that I thought it had said in the listing. When we got there and checked in I realized this and asked the front desk if it was possible to switch, I am almost 9 months pregnant and the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating in switching us to a King suite at no additional charge! The large, comfy bed definitely made a big difference in my comfort level. The room was clean, inviting, and comfortable. The pillow menu was a really cool addition. The only downside was the older wallpaper in the bathroom that was peeling and the drop ceiling in there had some water stains. However I did enjoy the rainforest shower head. As for the airport being close by, I did not find this an issues as planes stop flying in by 9pm and don't start flying out in the morning until around 8 so unless you sleep late and very lightly (the sound is muffled), you shouldn't have a problem.We will definitely stay there again, especially if we can get a great deal like before.My room wasnt anything special but it had what we needed. At first I was thinking the styling of the hotel was very artistic. I liked it. What sealed the deal was the hotels driver james. Not only did he take us wherever we wanted, but he gave us a tour and even took a picture of me and my son in front of the dukes of hazard car. Drove us to the opry mills mall and later picked us up. Great guy. Would definitely stay again. Also we got a lava lamp and beta fish in our room at no charge. Ask for them!Very ugly. Nothing like what the pictures made the hotel out to look like. There amenties were lava lamps and rubber duckies. Really?? My boyfriend and I are 30 something not 10.The bathroom looks good- until you walk in and see the  shower where tiles have mold on them and looks like it is in need of an emergency renovation. For $130 we didn't have a refrigerator in the room. Hotel was very rundown and walls were thin, got woke up at 2 am by some partying young adults. The one star is for the comfortable bed. Needless to say we will not be coming back.We found them on priceline and was able to have 2 beds/$62 a night. The trendy hotel has very friendly staff at the front desk who even offered my little dog a treat bag upon our arrival. There's a $45/ pet fee. Plenty of parking is available and it seems they offer a shuttle too. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and glad we discovered them on Priceline.","['cute', 'boutique', 'hotel', 'kinda', 'quirky', 'vibe', 'bad', 'way', 'gave', 'little', 'gift', 'bag', 'dog', 'treats',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-nashville-airport-nashville,Holiday Inn Nashville Airport,2.5,$$,61,"Nice hotel. Clean, nice amenities. Staff was friendly, drinks were good at the bar. We didn't eat at the restaurant. Good location.Few issues, which aren't major but were an annoyance. We stayed on the second floor with a balcony, also across from the workout room.  When the live music is playing, the balcony is great. Otherwise we had no use for it. The open area atrium lounge/restaurant created noise..both at night and in the morning. So that was a disturbance while we tried to sleep. The room had no alarm clock, or clock. There was no booklet in the room that shows the local info, room service options, etc, which has always been helpful when we stayed at other hotels.  Also lacked a Do Not Disturb sign..so we had to seek one out. Heard noise when people were working out..I assume it was from the weights. But that wasn't often.Would stay here again..just on a different floor away from the open air lounge.What a dump this place is. One pole with working parking lot lights should have been a tip off from the outside. I've never spent time in prison but after a night in a room here I felt like I had. Toss in the foul odor carpet glue or epoxy fumes and I was happy to have to leave for the airport extra early. I don't expect the Four Seasons but basic cleanliness, a lit parking lot, and air free of chemicals isn't too much to ask. The staff was friendly at leastThis was not a good experience.  The hotel staff was decent but the accommodations were sub par.  We had water leaking from our bathroom ceiling and the tub wouldn't drain.  Won't ever stay there again.The hotel has a nice lobby. Good live music in the bar but it smells of smoke pretty bad so I didn't stay long. The rooms were clean but in need of a renovation. The tv's are really really old.Exactly what you'd expect from a holiday inn...comfortable bed, clean hotel room, and great service. The only downside is that there is not hot tub, and no breakfast. Overall a very comfortable stay in NashvilleI have been traveling a TON for work.  This property is older but is under much needed renovations.  If that would bother you then move on.  I have never been awakened by noise or chatter.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  The daytime and early evening front desk professionals are truly appreciated. They have always been on point with suggestions and make checking in and out a great experience. The restaurant/lounge and possibly kitchen really needs more hands on deck.  It is very courteous but slow service.  You end up spending a whole lot more time in there than you want to.  The food is decent but not a standout.  It is priced normally.  I would say the property is more than likely well managed.  Like all things in life, there are the negatives as well.  A couple of middle aged to older overnight and very early morning males I have dealt with there were just plain rude.  Being treated like an inconvenience is not anywhere on my list of priorities.  And if people deal with the public then their attitude should be pleasant and helpful... not snotty and apathetic.  I don't think they represent the IHG brand well at all.  If they were my only points of reference to this property I would honestly stay with Marriott who is my other preferred brand.  I don't appreciate giving my business to a company that doesn't appreciate my choice to stay there and spend money there.  But as I have stated previously, my overall experiences have been good.I will be interested to see the property once all the renovations have been completed.  I am giving this property four stars instead of three because currently the rooms are priced extremely low due to the age of the property and current renovations.  (That's just my guess)  That is a huge plus when you manage an expense account.  The daytime and evening (sans the overnight) front desk professionals are top notch.  And the restaurant/lounge people are great.Staff was great.  Very friendly and accommodating to what we needed and if they could they would!  We were booked in a smoking room thinking we could handle it but Wow!  It was as if housekeeping had a cigarette lit as they were cleaning our room and it continued to stay at that strength throughout the night.  I could not sleep, had to cover my nose and mouth to use as a filter.  I wish I was exaggerating but I am not. The room was old too.  Stained tile in the bathroom - do not know how you can stain tile but it was!  Cigarette burns in the sheer curtain, darkened carpets in the room.  We asked if they had any non-smoking rooms available but they were completely booked that night but to come back in the morning.  Thank goodness we were able to move rooms but the smoke smell seeped into my clothes and hair already.  Our new room was MUCH better!  The rooms are older and it looked like they were about to update their hotel. It is close to the airport - about 5-10 minutes away. Couple of exits away from The Opry and about a $20-$25 cab ride to Broadway.Stayed here overnight on the way up to Louisville KY.  Renovations are still continuing, and I was assigned a room not too far from where the work was being done.  It was finished for the day at a decent time.  Despite the noise from the nearby highway, I did get a good nights sleep.  Complimentary parking and Wifi.  No microwave nor refrigerator.  Not someplace I would stay for a long time, but overnight is fine.  Good access to SR-155 Briley Parkway, both North- &amp; South-bound directions.  It is alright for a short stay and proximity to someplace close is important.  I would continue my search for another IHG property.SHAME ON YOU, HOLIDAY INN!!!! Hands-down, the grossest Holiday Inn I have ever stayed at (and I stay at HI or HIE nearly weekly for business travel). It looked decent on the exterior facade, and it was reasonably priced compared to other hotels located near downtown Nashville. Other than that, it was just a bad experience. Checking in at the front desk was an ordeal, I waited minimum 20 minutes.The noise level is horrible, and I did not even bother checking out the hotel restaurant. I will keep it short and sweet, and not wax too much on how awful the accommodations were. My first room was so bad (hairs on the toilet!) and the lights and clock did not even work, that I had to go back down to the desk, wait in line again, and request a new room.The second room was not much better, however the lights did work this time. The beds were horribly made, The cleaning staff must have been drunk or something when they made them. The carpets were so dirty and stained, seriously, they all needed to be ripped out, the rooms fumigated, and the interior completely repainted and re-carpeted. Again, please note the pictures I took of my room. Oh, and the stupid toilet would not even flush. You had to flush it, and hold it down, at least 2 to 3 times (and no, this is not due to some gastrointestinal issue on my part). Hrrrumph.The place was so bad, that suffice to say, I checked out two days earlier than I had originally scheduled. Just a disgusting place, after I left, I felt like I needed to take a boiling hot shower in disinfectant. I totally deserve quadruple or quintriplet rewards points for suffering a stay at this wretched death trap.First visit to Nashville and this hotel. The shuttle was waiting when I got to the airport and he was supper nice Had lunch in the atrium bar kinda weird set up the chicken strips were pretty good and the bartender was friendly and cheerful Had no hot water to take a shower i reported the problem and they sent a repair man while i was at dinner. He left a note to let the water run for 3-4 minutes to let heat up. So wasteful! I did let run for that long and it finally warmed up. The room was ice and the wifi worked great and the bed was comfyOn our was to Savanna stopped here for the night. The front desk staff was very nice. We took the shuttle van to town $10 each round trip. Could have parked cheaper. It worked out just fine. The ice machine outside our room was leaking looked like all day. There was a fan blowing to try to dry it up. At 10:00 they decide to use a industrial wet vac. I call the desk and she wants to argue with me saying that they just found out about it. The AC was very loud too. Bed was comfortable enough. Nashville is a great town this won't keep me from returning.I'm kind of surprised at the poor reviews this Holiday Inn gets. Our room was fine. No stains or grossness. Sure, the decor and building itself seem dated (90's-ish), but when I was there, they were in the process of renovating and updating. In my experience this hotel was clean and comfortable. Although the room did smell a little musty. I thought it was weird that our room didn't have a window to the outside. Instead it had a window (and balcony) that went to the lobby. Very odd and meant there was no natural light. I wouldn't stay at this hotel if I was wanting a luxurious getaway, but as a place to sleep and shower, it was good.A average hotel with gift shop and slightly modernized rooms.  Tall green room where breakfast is served.  Breakfast is a top off with three separate sections for $4.95 or whole buffet for $14.  If you're like us, you can't eat sausage or bacon without scrambled eggs (separated in buffet).  No grits.  Seems like they have good rates for conventions because something was going on Sunday afternoon and Monday morning.About 6 weeks after my initial stay at this Holiday Inn, my wife came along to do more house hunting. The location of the hotel was my primary deciding factor the first time around, and unfortunately for us I made the same decision for round two. The carpeting in our room was even more stained than the last time. In fact, the whole room felt old and murky. It was functional, but not pleasant.Our tub barely drained. By the time I finished drying myself, put on clothes, and brushed my teeth, only about half of the water had drained from my shower. I also experienced the same water temperature problems as during my prior stay. The bathroom comes complete with a heat lamp, which is great except I rented a hotel room not an Easy Bake Oven.When I stayed 6 weeks earlier, only 3 of 4 elevators were functional. This time, the same elevator was still busted (or at least busted again).The more I examine this place, the more certain I am that it's an old (really old) Intercontinental Hotel that they've rebranded as a Holiday Inn. That would make perfect sense since both hotel chains are owned by the same parent company. Despite its location, I wouldn't stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Awful, just awful.My family and I were in town for a show choir competition this past weekend. The lobby was VERY underwhelming. Even though construction is going on - it was not an inviting space to walk into. The two men behind the front desk were very helpful when we later asked for dinner recommendations. Our first room was OK - the hot water didn't work at all. It was one of the newly renovated rooms so it was not dingy, but it looks like they just sloppily finished remodeling the room. We had a mechanic come &amp; fix the room and much to our surprise... when we arrived back at our room later, the mechanics had LEFT THE DOOR OPEN ALL DAY. All of our belongings were still in the room and could have easily been stolen. After housekeeping came on the second day, I found footprints (that were not there when I left) on my pillowcases! We ended up staying an extra night due to the terrible ice storm but went to another local hotel for the entire day to lounge and spend the day and eat 3 meals. No good place to hang out at this hotel unless you stay in your room or go to the dingy lounge/bar that reminds me of a bad 80's movie.This hotel is still under construction, but besides a little rerouting of the lobby, this didn't seem to cause any issues and the new rooms look nice.Most of the desk staff were very kind. Except one. Mai-something? We used points to purchase the room for two nights and were told by reservations that we would have breakfast for $4 per person each morning. When explaining this at check-in, Mai told us that was impossible and that the people who worked in reservations were ""just stupid."" So no breakfast? Okay. Waffle House it is then.The room was freshly remodeled which was nice. The bathtub did not drain. It took about an hour to completely drain after a shower. The faucets were also backwards (ie hot meant cold and cold meant hot). Until we figured this all out, we had a few showers of standing in 8 inches of ice cold water. Fun. We called down to the desk after the first shower like this and they said someone would be ""right up."" Two days later, we had yet to see anyone.Finally did get the hotel breakfast on our last morning there, around 9:00am. The hot food was cold and standard. Depressing that we even paid anything for it. This would have been a free breakfast at any other hotel. The hotel gives you the opportunity to help save the environment by hanging a little card on the door that says not to change the linens. Apparently this actually means ""do not clean my room at all."" The beds were not remade, the trash not removed, the coffee cups not replaced, nothing. Also, that drainage problem in the bathtub noted above? Leaves majorly gross soap scum and piles of hair. Nasty. Never cleaned either.So all in all here, the hotel was incredibly average. Not great, not awful. Probably would choose a different hotel if I ever returned to Nashville.No bottled water available outside of room service hours. All the vending machines are empty and the front desk was not accommodating at all. The ""newly renovated"" rooms have extremely loud air conditioners, to the point of startling me awake every time it kicked on. I would never pay to stay here... Unfortunately I was stuck here on a work trip.Our stay at this Holiday Inn was so refreshing after a night in an Econo Lodge in Memphis!Here's the deal:  we drove from Chicago to Nashville and stayed in Nashville for 3 nights.  Since we had a car with us, we didn't want to pay the steep parking fees at downtown hotels.  Since we were trying to be reasonable with price, all of the downtown hotels were just too expensive.  So I got on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a>, bid on hotels, and got our 3 nights here for $55 (plus tax) per night.  I don't know what the price was if I didn't bid, but for $55 this was a DREAM.  And parking was free.The location is fantastic!  We didn't need to be downtown, all of our destinations in Nashville were a 10 minute drive or less.  The room was very clean and our towels were replaced as needed.  The beds were comfortable with multiple pillows.  The bathroom and decor was modern.  I felt totally comfortable staying in this hotel.  I would recommend it to my friends and family, or I would stay here again if in the area.My only complaint is there wasn't a fridge or microwave in the room, which would have been helpful for any dinner leftovers.  But truthfully, we didn't really need it.Stayed there Oct 2-5, 2014Frond Desk employees were nice and new, but didn't tell about us about room incidentals until after they put a hold on your card. The rate is $30 a night.. Smoking rooms is on the 5 floor should bring a candle, however the room wasn't to bad with smoke smell, but the hallway gave it away that you were in the smoking area.The gift shop way overpriced for everything.. Sunglasses $99, but you can buy them online for $20... Vitamin water was almost $4 which you can buy it for $1.59 in most gas station so stock up on your snacks and drinks.. Check out was a breeze bell boy will come to get your luggage.I am giving this hotel 3 starts because I was lied to by the reservation clerk I told him my flight gets in at 9 he said he would have a room booked for me by that time I get in to the front desk and they tell me I gotta wait until 12 but I was told 9 so I am tired from my flight sit wait on a room","Unlike a few other reviews, you are better off staying somewhere else for the time being. This is an old property that was and is in desperate need of renovation. Yes they are working on it and it is a mess. I didn't check reviews before reserving here on a road trip, looked fine on the outside. Not so on the inside. The staff was very friendly and shuttle driver will take you anywhere. The 10th floor hot water took forever!  Room ok, just old and dated.  Just plain dirty in hallways, elevators, you name it. This is not a $175 per night place. Maybe half of that would be appropriate until it is fixed up.This hotel is a little out dated but they are doing construction. Had a WONDERFUL experience with the staff. They were very nice and accommodating on short notice. Cornelius had wine and complimentary food send to my food because it was my birthday. He went out of his way to accommodate us and to make sure our stay was pleasurable. They gave us an excellent rate on the room and I could not be more pleased! The staff and excellent customer service more than makes up for the outdated rooms. Thank you to the staff and I will definitely be back to see the updates!!!Seems unclean and  very unpleasant,  I have stayed there twice and both times they had been doing renovation work and had the water turned off.  When I went to turn on my faucet it was spraying out grey black water.  The visits were 2 moths apart &amp; the  hallways were  dirty, not vaccumed.  the room they put me in seemed  like the bed was made in a hurry and unkempt.  The first time I was there the staff at the desk wasn't friendly at all.  They told me that the Shuttle driver didn't have time to take me  anywhere.  When I told them my sink was plugged up in my room, they said the maintenance guy had alot on his list and would get to it when he could........Mainly this Holiday Inn seemed dirty.Awful. Bed bugs, horrible front desk, thin walls... the list could go on. DO NOT STAY HERE!They didnt have the king bed we reserved. The first room we checked into smelled like smoke. Tgis place is disgusting, unkept and gross. I searched yhe entire rest of the area for another hotel room but because of the convention we're here for everything is booked.the toilet runs randomly. This place is gross! DONT STAY HEREBed was comfy but this hotel needs a remodel or tear down. Room did not look all.that clean. There was ejaculate on the head board. Gross!We used Hotwire to book our hotel- using the four star hotel filter. While we're disappointed Hotwire selected this hotel (not a four star hotel), we understand rooms were tight since it was CMA's this past week. The room faces an interior courtyard that hosts the pool and the breakfast dining area. It was impossible to sleeping through the noise of children yelling while swimming and families talking loudly. The noise started early, around 6-7 am. One morning we were awoken at 8:45 am by knocking at our door for housecleaning. I've never been waken up that early for housecleaning. If you can avoid staying here, you're better off somewhere quieter.This was my first time using you Global Airport Parking in Nashville and at this location, but not using this type of service. I was very happy with the ease of G.A.P.'s website and the entire Holiday Inn(BNA) Check In+ Out processes.This trip, I arrived during a severe thunderstorm + had left my dome light on.  After 9 days, of course the battery was dead, but within 25 minutes the problem was solved. I WOULD SUGGEST that the Shuttle Driver actually waits for the customer to start their vehicles before driving off...that would been nicer and saved me 20 minutes of walking and waiting in 89 degree weather.  Sadly, I had given the chap a $5.00 tip BEFORE I remembered to ask to have him wait (and he was driving off when I discovered the problem).  I think, that this time, the hotel is not use to the system and have yet to enlighten their drivers.  Work in progress but very glad they are here &amp; will use again.Long term parking at Airport was $11 a day.  A cab from airport to office building on Elm Park a few blocks away $38.00.  9 days using this (with taxes &amp; tips) $42.50.  Priceless!Where to start with this hotel.  Only reason it gets one star is the fact that we were able to get a room during CMA Fest weekend. Room - Always great staying in a hotel that has black mold in the bathroom.  That stuff is toxic and yet it was there both on the ceiling and the floor.  Toilet was old and crusty.  Was scared to sit on it.  Lovely!Maid Staff - Got woken up at 8am not by a knock on a door rather than a loud conversation coming from outside our room by the maid staff.  I guess having the ""Quiet Sign"" on the door doesn't work from the outside. Lobby -  What is the point of not being able to smoke in the hotel when the designated smoking area is 4 ft from the front door.  At least move it to the right 50 ft and save the healthy guest.Pool Area - Takes you back to the 70s...Really lame area to eat food and catch up on work.Bar - Senior Citizens and not much moreParking - Lots of parking and free.  Definitely a plus!Most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in!! The bed was hard, you could feel the springs, and it was uneven as well. The pillows they give you are a joke, they were literally the size of half a pillow. The air conditioner barely worked, to keep the room cool we had to shut it off and then turn it back on several times to ""restart"" the cold air. The room was clean enough and the staff was friendly, but I would never recommend anyone staying here for the simple fact of how uncomfortable it was to sleep here!I stayed here as the conference I was attending was at the Gaylord Opryland resort. This hotel was 60% less than the Gaylord and about 4 miles away. The hotel provided my transport to and from the Convention Center and the Opry Mills Mall which is walking distance to the Convention Center. The transportation by the hotel saved me about $150 in rental car needs.The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the housekeeping was a bit inconsistent. The bath mat was taken but not replaced one day, and the hand towels were a different number each day. The last day an extra roll of TP was not put in the bathroom.If you want bed bugs and slow Internet you come to the right place. I'm in a business where I travel with a team. We've had 3 room changes because of bed bugs and good luck trying to stream anything in your room. I would rather walk to the Waffle House than eat at the restaurant downstairs. My first review ever and I usually don't care but this one pissed me off.Was extremely satisfied with the hotel when I stayed here.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  The room was clean and the beds were soft and comfy.The only problem I had was that the ice machine on my floor didn't work so I had to go to another floor.  And there was a convention or something in town the weekend I stayed so the elevators were crazy full.The indoor pool and hot tub are WONDERFUL!  They are clean and feel great after a very long day of walking.Not sure about the wifi.  I never really tried to use it but I would suggest if you need Internet that bad you should just buy a wireless hot spot connector.I would recommend to anyone.It is clearly older and well used. The gift shop charges ridiculous prices for things like tums. There are better options out there.I had a wonderful experience staying here. Booked my room directly from their website, it was actually cheaper that way plus I got free breakfast for only $9 more. I chose this hotel because of the free shuttle and in house restaurant and bar. I wanted to make sure I had everything in the hotel. I took advantage of the free shuttle services from the airport, to/from the mall and even to/from restaurants for dinner. I called ahead of time and they didn't promise my room to be ready early, which was fine because they stored my luggage. After lunch at their restaurant, I was able to get my room at 1pm, much to my surprise. I took the shuttle to the mall right after.The room was nice and big. I booked a king bed nonsmoking room. The bathroom was good size, plus the room had a desk and an extra armchair with ottoman, which I thought was a nice touch. I felt the furniture was not outdated and quite comfortable with plenty of room.Everyone here was sweet, amazing customer service, the shuttle guy knew me by name by the end of the day! Had a few good drinks at the bar and a band was playing too.  for breakfast they gave me a $20 voucher at their  restaurant so when my dad picked me up in the morning, we were able to have a good breakfast for free. The man making the buttery omelets in the morning was really funny too!! And thats my only comment: everything has a lot of butter in it, which is probably just how Tennessee is.I will definitely be back here next time I fly into Nashville.My wife and I stayed at the holiday inn in Nashville as part of our honeymoon. As a perk of staying there we were allowed to use their side lot for our car while we were in miami and the bahamas. However due to a badly maintained sidewalk my wife tripped on a cracked area that had lifted up and badly skinned her knee and suffered from some pretty severe road burn. They had no staff trained competently in first aid and it took them several minutes to find their first aid kit. The manager who helped us didn't apply pads or bandages correctly and failed to tape it properly. The bandages were nearly falling off and rather than tape them she put tape directly on the wound. My wife nearly passed out from the pain and their incompetence made it worse. Needless to say we wont be staying there again.Nice hotel but very incompetent staff.  Prepaid hotel and they still charged my card when I checked inFacility is primitive POS. Hallways reek of stale smoke, tube TVs (currently being replaced with flat screen), virtually nowhere in the room to conveniently plug in PC and iPhone for use/charging, no desk chair.Staff very good, amenities OK. Free Internet slow as molasses.You get what you pay for. I didn't like this Holiday Inn. Although she was in training, the staff member who was checking us in kept answering the phone AND LOOKING UP stuff which took her forever. We were cold and tired; don't make the patrons in front of you wait. The rooms are shabby, like they were never glorious and just got worse through the years. I bet there are better hotels nearby for the same price.DISGUSTING!!!!! And DISGUSTED!!!! I can't believe we stayed here even one night. Had to interrupt front desk girl from her cigarette break for service. She may have been drunk!!!! Bugs in the room. Gave us a smoking room and wouldn't switch when they were told we were non smokers. Filthy floors in room. Lastly an unexplained odor beyond the smell of stale cigarettes. If I could this would get NO stars!!!!","Over the five days I was there my wifi connection speed was consistently .05 Mbps down. That's useless.Also, there was no hot water to speak of between about 6 and 8 AM. Overall, the whole place is just terribly outdated.i was given a smoking room. i didnt even know it was legal to smoke in hotels anymore. here for work and went out all night to escape the smell, tomorrow should be an exciting day. room is dirty and quite the group of people on my floor.only reason im giving a 2 is because the front desk staff apologized for the smoking room.. i'll be happy if i get 2-3 hours a sleep with this smell.  rooms are not nice and hote is outdated. Hope ownership reads reviews and considers going non-smoking and updates.. i would never suggest this hotel.When I checked in I asked for a room with a good wifi signal and was told that they've been having problems with it lately ! I travel for work and my companies website "" times out "" if not in use . The wifi was so weak &amp; slow I was unable to work - which does not reflect too highly on me ! This is an older hotel and is badly in need of an update/remodel . The room had a funky smell to it that reminded me of that old musty smell of my grandparents house when I would visit as a child ! With numerous other hotels in Nashville I'll put this one on the "" not if I can help it "" list !Another thing ; I'm a priority club member and the picture they have on the website is that of a Holiday Inn express and the hotel is actually an old Holi-dome tower . Very miss leading ! I'm also putting NO for wifi since it was not usable !Hotel is extremely outdated. Barely any outlets in the wall. Outdated furniture. Bed is the only thing which looks like it has been updated in the past 20 years. The pillows are fluffed to look like down pillows but they are just standard pillows. The business center does not have a printer, which we really needed, so you have to email the front desk attendant and they have to print off the document for you. We had to wait in line for a half hour at the front desk just to have a document printed because there was only one attendant and there was a line.  Awful experience.  I made my reservation through Priceline, and when I went to check-in, the hotel stated that Priceline had overbooked them and the only room they had left was a hyda-bed (a couch which pulls out into a bed) room. They actually considered this an option for a room. Not to mention, a parlor room is a room that connects to another customer's room. They treated me like none of this was their problem and I was Priceline's customer and if I didn't like their hotel room options, I needed to contact Priceline. This was at 11:30 PM at night, I had been driving all day, and it was not like I had a lot of options at that point. I ended staying in a hotel room that they were not supposed to rent out (so I didn't have to sleep on a hyda-bed with my traveling partner) They were not supposed to rent it because the carpets had recently been shampooed, so the floors were wet and the room had a smell. Not to mention the bathroom had not been completely cleaned, there was debris on the bathroom counter and hair in the bathtub. Stayed 2 nights and I thought the bathroom would be cleaned on the second night but the same dirt and things were still present.No one wants to take ownership for the problem. Holiday Inn is stating I am not their customer, I am Priceline's customer, and it's their problem. Meanwhile, Priceline is stating Holiday Inn is not willing to process any type of refund; therefore, Priceline won't process any type of refund. It feels like a big game; meanwhile, the customer loses.The hotel facilities are ok especially for the price. The service was quite poor. The staff seemed like we were an inconvenience even though we had 10 rooms and stayed 2 nights. Won't stay here again.The hotel room was itself 3 stars worthy. However Walter their omelet chef was what grabbed the extra star from me. He is a Nashville attraction without a doubt.Came here for a work conference and had a bad feeling when I checked in and they didn't know anything about our conference. Front desk staff were nice and helpful checking us in and getting us to a great dinner place, not the hotel restaurant either. Rooms were ok. Internet is complete crap. They call it Internet lite!  I call it cheap and worthless. No perks! I am missing the Hilton for sure.I would have given them 0 stars if I could. Bathroom door looked like someone had recently put a hole in it and they did a sloppy job of covering up.For the money there's better places to stay in Nashville.  Smoking allowed in the hotel.  Poor Wi-Fi.  Bathtub fills up when you shower.  Bathroom towels have seen better days.  Service is slow in the restaurant with a very limited menu.In writing this review, I will preface the goods with this disclaimer:When you stay at a Holiday Inn, you must understand that you are staying at a very old hotel that has not been renovated in any substantial way.  Hilton and Marriott have ""budget"" options, like Hampton and Courtyard, but the actual Hiltons and Marriotts are super-nice.  H.I. Express are nice; as a matter of fact, they are much nicer than the original Holiday Inns.So, my room is exactly what I expected.  It had a bit of a fart smell upon entrance, but it either went away or I got used to it.The pillows on the bed were tiny; they were the same size as the throw pillows a a couch:  square, not rectangular.  This was not the most comfortable pillow config.Being a Gold Priority Club member, they gave me a choice of two free drink coupons or two free breakfast coupons.  I took the free breakfasts, which is a buffet.  They have a guy making omelettes, and he is a TRIP!  Very nice, personable, and funny, and a darn good omelette chef.The pool at this place is AWESOME.  It's a huge trapezoid and there are two hot tubs in the same area, all indoors.  It's the largest hotel pool I've ever seen.So, room is OK, A/C worked well, bathroom functioned OK, good shower, great breakfast, two bars and a restaurant, excellent pool.  I'd stay here again, for the price.I was VERY happy with my choice to stay here on this past weekend quick trip to Nashville.  The beds were comfortable, the shower rocked and the staff was great with any minor requests that I had.  The indoor pool and spa were great but the location was ehh....right in the lobby, just kinda freaked me out a tad.  Got a great rate and a nice AAA discount too which made things that much more better!Overall, great choice, and a quick 10 minute drive to downtown Nashville.Stayed here for 6 nights attending a conference at the Gaylor Opryland Hotel. Staff here at the Holiday Inn was very accommodating and professional and God bless 'em for having to put up with cranky guests, they really took a beating from one of them! The only cons for me, weak wi-fi and guests slamming doors in the middle of the night (which the hotel itself has no control over). I would definitely stay here again, rooms were clean and comfortable and the hotel is pretty central to a lot of things.Was here for a conference and the rooms were small and not very nice. Provided lunch was ok. I think there are better hotels around this area.After reading reviews before my stay I have concluded that the freeway noise level is minimal, check-in was friendly, and the room had enough amenities in comparison to other hotel chains. No qualms about my overnight stay at this facility. I only give this hotel 3 stars because it's basic, Internet is not free, and I have been to nicer hotels with friendlier service and more amenities.This place is strange.  I bought one night through the secret hotel section of Travelocity.  I got a great deal on the room.  I went to check in while I waited for my honey to fly into Nashville.  It was close to the airport and a waffle house, so it fit the bill.  I went up to my room to find that the room was connected to the next room by a door.  The door was fully unlocked and the light was on to my bathroom.  When I locked the double door, the guy next door kept yelling...who's there.  How wierd!  Did he think he got two rooms for the price of one?  The pillows are small, square lumpy things.  The hotel was filled with drunk people making a scene.  Love drama in the parking lot.  Drunks smoking right in front of the main entrance.  I would never pay full price for this place.My family and I are members of the Holiday Inn rewards program, and I've gotta say, this was not my favorite hotel. The breakfast wasn't free even though it cost the same to stay there as any other Holiday Inn. Although I was impressed by the sheer size of the building itself, I was not pleased with the amenities (bathroom, accessibility etc...).It was an OLD tower, not the newer building my travel company showed. Also checked some other sites and they had the wrong picture too. Decided to stay here when I had to beat the weather and make sure I was in town the night before I was to fly home. Thought I would save my company some money and not stay in my normal chain. NEVER AGAIN!!.Here are my observations...I was not feeling so well when I arrived. I got a NON-Smoking room. I walked in detected a faint hint of smoke. I was in pain and did not feel like dragging my bags back to the elevator and down to the lobby to get a different room and then drag them back up. Plus I had wanted to drop my rental car off and that required two trips. So I did the one-night-unpack. Walked in the bathroom and BAM!! It smelled like someone had locked themselves in the bathroom and smoked a carton of cigarettes. It was not fresh, but an old smoky smell. It has been there awhile.The room itself also had the faint smell of unsanitary an retirement home. Bad enough to notice and pinpoint the smell.Carpets grossed me out. I left my shoes on the entire time.""It is only one night"" I kept telling myself...One night.Ordered room service. It was OK and they delivered quickly. Wi-fi was OK, for most of what I needed it to do...check my email.They charged me $2.50 to use my Corporate American Express. I have never had to pay a HOTEL to use the Amex card.Positives?The staff was friendly.They had three coffee condiment packs instead of one.Never again, there are toooo many other hotels close to the airport to select.I got to stay here when I went to Nashville to attend my cousin's medical school graduation. Holiday Inn Select is a standard Holiday Inn which boasts comfy pillows, clean rooms, a well stocked gift shop and ample parking in front. Their location makes them an ideal spot if you are coming into town to visit Opryland. I would've given this location 4stars if not for two things. First off they claim they DO NOT accept debt cards at check-in, however, they took my Mom's debt card and treated it the same as cash at check-in(no backup credit card required). I do not doubt that this was because my Mom is a 60yrs old woman who walked in with her cane. Obviously they were guilty of stereotyping on who would have money on their debt card. Secondly their restaurant is leaves so much to be desired. They only have one vegetarian entree, which wasn't bad, but no one wants to eat the same thing all weekend. Their breakfast menu was just as horrible, the eggs from the buffet were a rubbery mess. Ive had way better FREE HOT breakfast at Embassy Suites. If you want to eat all of your meals out of the hotel and didnt intend on using your debt card this place is a sound bet for a weekend get away.Room smelled , they wanted me to pay for breakfast and the tv didn't work half the time.  I wouldn't recommend this HI to any oneVery nice. I usually stay at HI Express but this HI Select was closer to a conference I attended. The room was very quiet - one of my pet peeves in a hotel. The breakfast buffet was pretty costly but the food was very good. I really enjoyed my stay, the room was big and clean, and the staff was very attentive to my few concerns. Eat breakfast somewhere else and I think you'll be very satisfied.","My wife and I arrived at the Opryland Holiday Inn Hotel the night of 7 October 2010.  This was a day earlier than we had originally planned, but the hotel was able to accommodate us.  However, I was informed on checking in that I had three (3) rooms reserved [in actuality I had two (2) as one was for my sister and her friend].  I cancelled out the  ""extra "" room.  The next day Dan Neff, myself and my sister all had problems connecting to the hotel's wireless networks.  I spoke to the Sales and Catering representative of the hotel with whom Mr. Neff had negotiated our reunion stay and she gave me the telephone number of the hotel's IT contractor.  I also spoke to this woman about needing some help in connecting my computer (and its external hard drive) to the hotel's PA (amplifier) system inasmuch as I had been tasked to provide music for our banquet dinner.  She gave me the number of the hotel's AV contractor and arrangements were made for he and I to meet at 4:00 PM on 10 October to set up the connection which was to be wireless from my computer to the amplifier with my equipment and that I only needed help in setting up a table (and chair) and plugging the wireless receiver into the amplifier.  Now back to the IT contractor.  After negotiating a lengthy voice-mail process I was told (by a recording) to leave a message and they would get back to me.  I never (to this day) heard back.  There were 3 or 4 wireless networks available according to my computer and one of them specifically had the word ""Guest"" in its nomenclature.  After trying to connect to this network it simply evaporated into the ether (I never saw that particular network listed again).  After two (2) more unsuccessful attempts to connect to 2 other networks I finally succeeded.  Upon connecting I was informed that the connection was valid for 24 hours only.  You (me or anyone) must re-establish a connection every 24 hours.  My sister was upset with me as when she checked in on 8 October she was told that I had not yet arrived and was given a room on the 9th floor (my wife and I were in Room 1318 and I had left a message at the desk for my sister as well as having requested months ago that our rooms be close together)  When my sister informed me of the situation I checked at the front desk and found out that instead of the erroneous 3 rooms I had supposedly booked and for which I had cancelled out the extra one (which I had never booked in the first place) the night before I now had reservations for 4 rooms.  The ""extra"" 2 rooms were cancelled out and the hotel did move my sister to the 13th floor.Also on 8 October an Executive Committee meeting was scheduled for 1000 AM for which I had been requested to provide a voice-activated recorder.  Having no place locally to purchase batteries for the recorder, except the hotel gift shop,  and with 1000 AM minutes away I purchased two (2) ""AA"" batteries in the gift shop for $12.00.  I gave the saleswoman a $20 bill and received back a $5 bill and three $1 bills, but no receipt.  I found out a day later from another reunion member that he had purchased the same batteries for $3.99 in the same gift shop (also without benefit of a receipt).On the night of 10 October 2010, AFPCA had its banquet dinner.  I met the hotel AV contractor at 4:00 PM and (despite the fact that I had earlier requested the hotel staff to set up a small table and chair for me they simply did not do so) together we set up the table and chair I needed for my computer and external hard drive.  After we put a table and chair in place I unpacked my laptop and the external drive and laid the AC adapter cords on the table.  The AV contractor picked up the AC adapter cord for my computer (19 volts) and connected it to my external hard drive (a 12 volt system).  The hard drive never functioned at all after that (I had been using the system in my room and had to turn everything off to bring it downstairs to the banquet).  I had approximately 60,000 songs on this hard drive and am now striving to see if I can recover them.  The hard drive had two capacitors which were blown and the repair facility originally hoped that the computer board on the drive was still intact.  It wasn't.  They then hoped that the drive motor was intact and that they could use the board from another hard drive to get my files transferred.  The board and the hard drive motor are also both blown and my remaining hope is that I can find someone who will be able to transfer my music files to another hard drive. The hard drive as such is toast.  I am still working to transfer my music files to another hard drive. In fairness, the AV contractor was probably only supposed to be with me for a very few minutes (5 minutes should have sufficed to plug in the wireless receiver to the hotel's amplifier (and in fact this system worked flawlessly albeit without real purpose as I had no music to utilize the system).",,"['nice', 'hotel', 'clean', 'nice', 'amenities', 'staff', 'friendly', 'drinks', 'good', 'bar',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-inn-downtown-nashville-vanderbilt-nashville,Comfort Inn Downtown Nashville-Vanderbilt,2.5,$$,71,"My sister and I stayed at the Comfort Inn when visiting Nashville.  For the price and location- this is the best bet.  I landed early in the AM and the front desk allowed me to check in at 10:30 am for no extra charge which was great because I was exhausted from the early flight and it was pouring out.The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable- more comfortable than some higher end hotels that I've stayed in recently.  The free breakfast in the morning was more than we expected with a chef making custom omelettes- we ate there every morning!  There was also complimentary coffee and water bottles in the lobby, a small fitness center with cardio machines and free weights and a laundry room.The hotel is right across the street from a strip of trendy bars and restaurants and only a $5 uber ride away from downtown.  This is definitely a great place to crash if you have a bachelor/bachelorette party or a girls weekend.  There were a lot of groups of young people who were loud late at night so if you are looking for R&amp;R this isn't the place for you.  If I ever go back to the Music City, I will gladly stay here again!My friend and I were passing through Nashville and wanted to make the most of our 12 hours in the city.  This hotel popped up as the most affordable, central to where we would like to explore.For a 2 queen bedroom, we paid $115 including tax.  The room was very clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. There are a few bars / restaurants right across the street, which was very convienent for two hungry travelers.We wanted to walk and soak up the city, so we decided to walk down to Broadway. It was about 15-20 minutes. On our way back, we took an uber, which was less than $5.In the morning we wanted to check out the complimentary breakfast on the third floor. It was a separate, open clean room and a pretty decent selection of breakfast items. Eggs, sausage, grits, biscuits, cereal, waffles, muffins, hard boiled eggs, orange juice, and coffee.Overall, this is a great location and great hotel to stay at if you want to explore Nashville!Do NOT book here on weekends. There were kids skateboarding up and down the cement walkway by the rooms at 4 am! And when we told the front desk, they said it was their weekend clientele so basically, we have to live with it. Positive note, breakfast is very decent, but there isn't much else to say about this place. Location is why we stayed there. If there were other affordable options nearby, we definitely would never stay here again.Totally loved it! Very affordable and clean. It was nice! Great location. Definitely do it!Good price &amp; good location. We decided to drive down a day early to try to avoid the bad weather &amp; they were very accommodating. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Sadly, most were closed due to the 6 inches of snow. We still walked around anyway. The breakfast isn't anything grand... Walk across the street to Just Love for excellent coffee. And the menu looked amazing, but due to weather (stuupid snow) they were light staffed and only serving coffee. But the room was great... Nice size &amp; clean!My husband and I came to Nashville for our anniversary and wanted to stay closer to downtown without huge cost! This was the perfect spot. 10-15 minute Uber ride to 2nd Ave (for all the bars/clubs). Just down the street is Danny McGinnis, which is an AMAZING irish pub with fantastic food! It is one of many bars on this strip. A little further around the corner is The Patterson House - old style bar with the best drinks I've ever had! Cannot beat this location!As far as the hotel goes, check in was easy. Front desk staff was very nice and accomodating. We arrived ahead of schedule, about 2 hours before check in technically began, and Paula (I think) was happy to get us in ahead of time. The hotel as a whole is clean and well kept. The pool area is nice and clean. Wish we had had time to take a dip!The room is a typical king room. Clean and nicely sized. Flat screen tv and mini fridge and microwave in room. Coffee pot too, but we never make in room cofee. Shower &amp; toilet room is a little cramped. If you are a large person, this could be difficult! Shower has great pressure for a hotel, but the temperature was a little tricky to regulate. We were very happy with the space and cleanliness! Carpets were clean, my white socks stayed white &amp; hubby's bare feet stayed clean. Air conditioner was great too, cooled so efficiently we had to turn it back some before bed! We did have to push the closed curtains toward the window to allow the air to work (common sense move to me though so non issue) Even had a full ironing board and iron in room which came in handy when my hubby's dress shirt didn't travel as well as hoped!The included continental breakfast was much better than expected. Nice spread of breads, muffins, and bagels. Hot items were biscuits and gravy, meats, and eggs. Waffle makers were there. Fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal. Milk, tea, coffee, orange &amp; apple juice. Everything we ate was good... not high end, but good! If you want amazing breakfast, a 10 minute walk will take you to Biscuit Love...holy cow wow - but pricy!The only negatives I can think of was the noise from some rowdy neighbors. They quieted down after about 10 minutes though. Had a little ""service"" noise on Monday morning early (7:30 early), I think maybe a delivery truck or garbage truck. These were really just minor. Only reason I heard the neighbors was I had gotten up to use the restroom, and the only reason I heard the truck was I happened to be up already. I don't think the noise would have woken me out of sleep on its own.Some of the other reviews seemed very critical, but I cannot see why. I know this is a Comfort Inn and not Marriot, so I adjust my expectations to a degree. Everything we needed was here though, the staff was superb, and the room was clean and comfortable. We were extremely satisfied with our stay here and we will most definitely come back whenever we come back to Nashville and need downtown access! Thanks for making our stay so very comfortable!This hotel was in a GREAT location for the price! We were less than a mile from lots of bars and restaurants in the Gulch and Vanderbilt University area. We were able to walk quite easily to lots of cool places, including Third Man Records and two different hot chicken establishments. It was literally right off the freeway, so that was easy to get in and out.The room itself was okay. It was definitely dated, but it was clean enough. We didn't have any towels in our room, but it wasn't a big deal to ask for some. The bed was comfortable, and I liked that we had a mini fridge. People were kind of loud late at night - slamming doors and talking loudly in the corridor, but there isn't much that can be done about that. The pool looked pretty clean. Free continental breakfast with a make-your-own waffle bar! They had those reconstituted egg pucks and sausage, but mostly a lot of carbs. I've definitely had worse though, so I was happy to save money on eating out.I had looked at the Marriott down the street, as it has a rooftop bar and swanky-looking rooms, but after taxes and fees it was almost $100 more than this hotel! Ultimately, I am happy with this choice and would totally stay here again if in the area. Also, parking was included!Great value and proximity to bars and restaurants.  Rooms were clean and had a free breakfast.Stayed here for a long weekend in Nashville. It was convenient enough (close to downtown) and had a lot of nice restaurants and bars close to it. If you want to sleep in, don't stay here. The walls are paper thin, you hear the cars in the parking lot constantly, and garbage collection is at 7 am Monday mornings. The staff was very friendly, great complimentary breakfast, and very comfortable bed. I wish I had known the rooms exited to a parking lot, the safety frightened us a tad. We only paid $103 a night so you cannot beat the deal. Wish I would have known this is a motel, I would have selected an actual hotel in actual downtown Nashville.Our stay here was horribly expensive because an NRA convention was in town at the same time as a wedding, Negatives:bad wifioutdoor access to rooms like a motel, wedding block rate couldn't stay for just one night, they didn't have some of the expected ""complimentary toiletries,"" they gave us two double beds instead of the king we paid for,the desk workers didn't speak english well and wouldn't give us a receipt to check out.  it wasted at least an hour of our time on a wedding weekend.i started off critical, but the further down the list I went, I realized I was unhappy with our motel.  Don't pay more than $75 per night to stay here.I was nervous to book this location because there were some poor reviews, but I have been pleasantly surprised with my stay at Comfort Inn!  It's location in Nashville and the price that I paid for a room are incomparable.  It is only a $5 Uber ride from downtown, and there are several great bars and restaurants right down the street.  Our room is comfortable, clean and well maintained.  I can't attest to the breakfast because I haven't woken up early enough to try it.  Ultimately, this hotel provided me with exactly what I needed during my stay in Nashville- a comfy place to sleep and a short distance to downtown.  Personally, I would rather spend my money exploring all that Nashville has to offer!  Would definitely recommend to anyone who has a similar mentality!Stayed here for spring break and had a good experience. We had a room on the 3rd floor, which was nice had two queen beds, decent TV channel selection and access to a pool. The bathroom was a little small, but it was clean and the water pressure was super strong. The breakfast room was better than I expected. They had all of the typical fixings, eggs, sausage, a self serve waffle maker and all sorts of things. My only complaint was that there were some stains on our first set of towels but not on any other ones we received. all in all we were satisfied with our stay. Customer service was great and they were super friendly and willing to help.We were looking for a place downtown that wasn't going to cost us a kidney.  Great location, clean rooms.  Not the largest in the world, but it did the trick.  Within walking distance of everything we needed downtown.  Worked out pretty well.  Didn't have a lot of interaction with the staff, but check in/out was quick and courteous.  I'll go back if I'm ever in Nashville again.Great location. Good breakfast. Comfy beds. Roaches. If it weren't for that if recommend it otherwise.I booked this property based on the price in the area and it being close to Bridgestone Arena.  I arrived early and couldn't check in early (around 11 am) because they said no rooms were cleaned and ready.  Fair enough, check in isn't until 3 anyway.  Got back around 1:15 pm and checked in.  The lobby area had a rather strange odor to it and the decor was strangely ""dated"" and old.Got into my room and it was BLAZING hot in there.  I turned on the air, but it didn't do much for the ventilation of the room as the curtains continued to block then vents.  It was incredibly humid and sticky in the room.  Like the lobby, the decor was strangely ""dated"" and old.  The bed was not comfortable at all.  You could tell there were multiple spots on the walls that had been spackled and repainted over.  The curtains were stained.  The TV only worked on a few of the channels advised.  Bathroom and shower area were TINY.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and I probably wouldn't stay here again until they made some serious upgrades.Good Location.  Best price for downtown area.  The Rooms are, well, so so.  Im from jersey.  So we are used to the old run down Jersey Shore hotels.  Well, these are the same.  If you are looking for luxury. Then you might want to find another place to stay.   For us it was ok.  We went out every night.  So we were not in the room that much.   Just to sleep,shower and poop. Room had a fridge good for leftovers from dinner just in case.  Bathrooms are tiny.  Just a note, The Bathroom sink is outside the bathroom door.They have a free just above continental breakfast.  Processed eggs. Sausage and biscuits. You can make your own waffle. That was pretty good.  Juice, cereal, fruit. It was ok.  Staff was nice.  Pool was clean.   Overall its ok.  There is a Marriott near by if you want nice.  It's about a $125 more a night.   To each there own.For $109 a night, I can't really complain. This place is dated, but clean and has an okay bathroom. Plus, it has parking and is in a good location within walking distance (or short uber) to downtown. The first room they put us in stank like stale smoke and was super noisy, but they were really good when we asked to move. Only down side is the extremely unreliable WiFi, it must disconnect every two minutes which is insanely frustrating when you are overseas and are reliant on WiFi for a lot. Make sure you ask for a room away from the main road, otherwise it will be really loud.Picked this hotel based on price, availability over a holiday and proximity to the Beaman Toyota service department, as my car decided to have issues while on a road trip vacation. Pros:- Great location and conveniently located next to food and gas etc. - Quick and easy access to the freeway.- Clean enough, minus the filthy carpets. - Decent continental breakfast. Got the job done and cut down on our eating out bill. - Larger mini fridge, cable, wifi and a microwave.- If you have rolly polly sleepers, like we do, you can easily move chairs up against one side of the bed to avoid falling out of bed. - An outdoor pool- Free parking (also, see under Cons).Cons:- Disgustingly dirty carpets. Kiddo had black feet minutes after getting a shower scrub. Bring flip flops to wear around to avoid black feet. -The walls had questionable stains on them but I didn't let my mind go there. - Shower gets clogged a little but hardly a    big issue. - Not enough hooks to hang towels.- Slow wi-fi. - No closets just a medium sized wardrobe. - Taking the elevator is like walking on the sun, I imagine.... Hot! It was 30 seconds of death. Next time, I will just throw my bags over the balcony or sit on them and ride them down the stairs.- Not sure what the smoking laws/ regulations are in Nashville or The Comfort Inn, but I saw someone sitting in the doorway of their room smoking. There was also a lot of smoking in stairwells and walkways. ""Why you gotta be so rude?""- Holy hell! Not a single person parked within the lines at night. Jacked up all the other parking. Try to get a room facing the pool. If not, you'll be stuck with the freeway or construction side. All in all... Good place to stay.Horrendous. I flew out from NJ with my bf for a wedding. We booked this hotel based on location, price, and good reviews. We checked in and I was impressed from the exterior appearance and the lobby. Well we get our cards to check into the room and as I'm wheeling my bag across the parking lot I see three large cockroaches just hanging out. This was a dead give away that they are everywhere. Roaches usually don't come out and definitely not in groups. So we go to look for our room and it's a ground floor. I called the front desk and told them I was concerned bc I saw roaches and refused to sleep on the the ground floor. He seemed shocked and moved us to the top floor.The room was moist and smelly. It smelled like cigarette smoke was just embedded in the walls and carpet or a pet odor. It got worse when the air conditioner was running. I mentioned it to my bf once and let it go. We were both exhausted. I went to take a shower and grabbed a towel. I started drying off and noticed the towel was dirty. It has light gray/brown smears all over it. Ok, fine. I grabbed another towel. Then as I was getting off the toilet I noticed a large and wide blood smear across the front of the toilet, where my legs could have essentially touched.  I was disgusted. So that was more than 3 strikes. I sucked it up bc we were only stayed there for one night. I did check the mattress and bedding for bed bugs. Luckily I found none. And I also searched high and low for roaches. I kept my bags securely closed and on the table. I would never stay there again. Breakfast for free was awesome but after seeing the condition of the building there no doubt in my mind that the food may have been cooked in a roach infested kitchen. Don't stay here. I don't know what rooms deserved 4 or 5 stars. Must be the wrong comfort in.This is a generous two star rating. The rooms were pretty small and ours was facing a construction site that must have started up work before 7am.The shower clogged up within a few minutes. The outside doors were just painted, I think to cover up all of the footprint marks from people trying to kick them down when they found out where the person was who owed them money. The elevator smelled like a cheap whore's perfume. For the record, we all kind of liked that part.Lastly, there was no HBO.Just kidding. I didn't use the TV. I have no idea.","I chose this hotel because of the location, availability and the price. My friends and I made a road trip out of a conference we were attending last week. We stayed at the Comfort Inn before moving on to the hotel our conference was at. We were looking for something close to downtown that was cheap. The rooms were not overly nice, but they were clean and functional. The staff was kind and helpful, and even provided us with a roll away bed. The location is great and you can easily walk to downtown, if it is warm! Being from Florida, we walked half way and then had to call a cab - we were freezing! The motel's continental breakfast was better than I had expected it to be.I had a terrible experience with this hotel. I booked a room, for one night, for business travel. On the day I was supposed to arrive, a large ice storm hit Nashville and EVERY flight into and out of the city was canceled. I immediately contacted the hotel to let them know I would not be able to make it for my stay. They claimed that it was past the cancellation deadline so they could not cancel my reservation.I called the hotel 14 times in the next 2-3 weeks. Each time, I was told that the manager was busy, but would call me back right away. I did not, and have still not received a call from the management of the hotel.I was charged for the room, that I did not use, on a day when nobody was able to reach the city of Nashville. I'll never book a reservation with a Choice hotel again. It's not worth the risk.This place is a dump. The only reason I stayed here was because it was close to a bunch of bars and it was the cheapest. Avoid this crap hole. staff may be friendly, but that quickly is shadowed by the smell of cheap chain smoking hookers once you open the hotel room door.Stayed here during the Bonnaroo weekend!What a gem! When everything was almost 200 bux a night we found this gem for almost 75 dollars cheaper. For a room and a bed to stay in, I think this was a great deal.The concierge was polite and was very helpful. Although the rooms need a little love, for what it's worth...it's good enough (no bed bugs). Television was working, bed was made and the washroom was a little run down but clean enough for a cheap hotel.The breakfast was basic. Bread, juice, sausage and waffles. Nothing extravagant but bonus nonetheless. There was also a pool and the location was a couple minutes from downtown. With bars and restaurant up front.If I am ever in Nashville, this will be my go to restaurant no doubt about it.Rooms extremely small, not very clean - could see toothpaste spatters on the mirror and woodwork around the sink, bathrooms so ridiculously cramped that some in our party chose not to bathe at all.  Claustrophobics beware!!! Continental breakfast was inconveniently located, but once found it was a nice room.  The waffles were good, but not the biscuits, gravy or sausage.  No shuttle service to downtown Nashville or anything else.  Crappy wifi connection.  Stay somewhere else unless you're really desperate.Where do I start...Upon check-in, my husband and I were informed that we would be charged an additional $25 to park a second car in their lot. We booked the room on the Internet on discount but the room was still expensive.  However, the pictures made the hotel look 'worth it'. Myself, my husband, our twin teenagers and our two cats literally crammed into a room with two queen beds. There was barely room to walk anywhere in the room. The shower area was awful in that I could not open or close the door when the bath mat was on the floor, I could not dry off outside of the shower because there was not enough room to stand while the shower curtain was closed. We arrived back to the room late after exploring the city only to discover disgusting linens on the beds. Stained towels, sheets, and pillows. An added bonus was the amount of extra hair that was left on the bed and pillows for us. The only reason I did not sleep in my car was because I did not want to upset my husband and kids. The AC unit sounded like gale force winds blowing and whistling all night long. We paid lots of money for the worst hotel experience possible. On the bright side... They had free breakfast and the pool didn't look bad.If I could give it 0 stars I would. There is no way this is even a 3 star hotel, unless there's a completely different hotel on the other side of this property... This is a cheap motel: nothing more.First inconvenience was a receptionist who barely spoke English. Secondly we were hit with a $25 parking fee. Note: this is a Tuesday. No conventions in Nashville, and there's ample parking. We were told the first car was free. However, when I mentioned we booked with a AAA, they dropped the price of the second car down to $10, but then ADDED $10 for the first car. So, still have to shell out $20/day just to park in their mostly-empty lot.The room itself: tiny, very old. Dirty bathroom, chips, cracks, and stains on almost every piece of furniture. Another commenter noted their furniture looked like it was purchased at a garage sale- this is SO TRUE! They have all seen far better days- very beaten up, and barely functional.I've never been to a more run down hotel, and I have never been treated as awfully as the front desk staff. Absolutely avoid!This hotel was a big disappointment. Good location, but not up to par. I signed up for yelp just so I could give it a review. Note that I did not use any of the amenities like the gym or pool so this is specifically about the rooms. The room we started in was a handicapped room that faced the interstate (we are not handicapped). Besides a lot of noise from traffic, the room looked like it was never cleaned. The towels were old and had spots on them even though they were hanging up like they had been replaced. The sheets weren't much better so we asked for a new room. The second room was much better but still not perfect. The towels looked old (at least not used this time) but this bathroom had been renovated. It seems that the king size sheets don't fit on their king size beds so that makes it look like their beds aren't fully made. There was a spot of lipstick on one of the pillow cases which we just threw on the floor and ignored. Unless you are looking for dirty laundry and a cold shower, I would not recommend this place!And adding to this after the fact: check out is not til noon and the maid just walked into our room before 11 without even knocking. Our dog almost ran outside. Add stupid staff to the list.we had a very nice stay at the comfort inn until the last morning of our stay we discovered bugs, look a lot like bed bugs from google images. Front desk staff was very kind in offering to move us to another room &amp; pay for our clothes to be laundered, but we were too grossed out &amp; starting to get itchy, we just wanted to leave to go to the airport early.  Front desk staff requested us to send him the pictures we took of the bugs &amp; looked at our bites on our arms and legs so that he could communicate with his manager &amp; a pest control company that we on their way to the hotel; he also promised to call us regarding the results from the pest control company, in which he did several hours later.  We took precautions that you would take with bed bugs per our research and have completely decontaminated our belongings prior to taking them into our houses, steam cleaned our luggage, frozen our unwashable belongings &amp; sent other items to be dry cleaned with chemicals; it has taken hours upon hours, making an end to our wonderful trip a nightmare. In the front desk staff's voicemail he said that he pest control guy believes that the bugs are ""bat"" bugs not bed bugs, but a similar species that feed off of bat blood not human blood (A. why are they in our bed and not by where bats are, B. why do we have bites everywhere on our bodies). 24hours later management called us stating that they are sending another pest control person the next day &amp; that they have gone in the room and have seen no signs of bugs.  Maybe if they had come with us to our room the first day we discovered them they would be there(and not trusted that we are honest people and completely horrified by what we had discovered upon waking up), or maybe cleaning staff has already gone in the room to clean.  Per this conversation, they offered assistance with medical treatment, in which I told him we are currently treating our itchy bites with over the counter anti itch cream, he then offered a free stay at the hotel, in which I told him that I will never be staying at their hotel again &amp; then he offered a reimbursement for our stay (we stayed 3 nights).  The next day we received an email stating that they were only going to reimburse our most expensive night &amp; also offered a 20% discount on a future 2 night stay (what part did he not understand when I said that I will never stay at their hotel again).  At first I was frustrated with the lack of communication and now I'm just angry (and getting itchier.)  I then called him back to request a full refund of our 3 night stay in which he replied that he could not honor, so I called their corporate offices.  Choice Hotels International also has horrible customer service as well &amp; claims that they can only encourage the hotel manager to rectify the situation as Comfort Inn is a franchise.  We then later received a second email from the comfort inn management stating "" I can confirm that there are NO visible signs of any existing bed bug infestation in the room that you stayed in. These bugs definitely seem to be travelling &amp; I would like to know where did you stay prior to arriving here/ and or travelled. I have also heard about these things travelling in greyhounds and airplanes with people and their clothing. As per pest control guy, looking at the size of bugs in the picture, it would be impossible not to notice them even 1 night.""  He is now suggesting that we potentially brought the bugs with us from our travels or our homes (offensive) &amp; I asked him to clarify what he meant by greyhounds (he meant the dogs, none of us own greyhounds or dogs for that matter.) He is now saying that there are no bugs but that the first front desk staff &amp; pest control person did find bugs (""bat"" bugs) the day we left.  He is now also suggesting that the pictures of the bugs we took couldn't possibly be bed bugs because you aren't able to see them with the human eye (that's crap and the camera was completely zoomed in, in one of the pictures we didn't even realize that there was a second smaller bug in the top left corner when we took it, so true the bugs are really tiny but you can still see them which is how we discovered them.)  After all of this back &amp; forth for days, I've been very disappointed in the way this hotel management has handled things, I have become itchier and the bites have gotten bigger and have confirmed with my doctor that these are in fact bed bug bites.  I forgot to mentioned that during both my calls with the ""manager"" he continued to cut me off and speak over me, so clearly he did not listen to anything I said and then when I asked him to not cut me off, he said that I had been cutting him off.  There's a phrase in the business world called ""the customer is always right"" &amp; clearly the management here has not been educated with that business mindset. I am 100% disgusted &amp; embarrassed for this hotel &amp; also Choice Hotels International that they would allow this behavior from a hotel manager. (see pictures)Comfortable beds and clean rooms! Very good rates for the location. Close to some great little bars to go to at night that have good drink specials! Also a few minutes from downtown and right by the highway.This place is the WORST!!! Went for a bachelorette party - we found cockroaches, bed bugs, and all sorts of disgust. Hotel claimed they had exterminator come and it wasn't bed bugs but everyone woke up with the bites all over them. They lied to us about the exterminator report and we are now in a war about getting a refund back. I do NOT recommend this hotel even to the filthy animals of the world. Worst hotel and even worse managementI would NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN. I wouldn't even call this a hotel, because it is actually a motel. The doors are outside. From my window, I could see the barbed wire fence that blocked us from the highway.Check-in was actually the best part of my night long stay. The front desk staff was very polite, giving us our key and parking pass. We went to our room expecting it to be clean... well it wasn't. The cleaning man told us ""10 minutes"", our room was ready 25 min later, after I saw the cleaning staff sneeze on the pillows they left for us.Our room was sub-par. The bed was not comfortable, the tv had minimal channels, and the bathroom was disgusting. Shower and floor were dirty. The toilet was in the room with the shower/tub and there was no room to even open the door. I could hear every person walk by on the outside and I could hear cars passing all night long. Overall, the only good part was the location. I would spend the extra money to be in a hotel that is clean and I actually feel safe in.....This hotel is a good location, but it is not well taken care of. Our towels and linens were yellowed and didn't look clean. I didn't like like the style of this hotel with the rooms going directly outside because the noise level all night is ridiculously loud.  Not one of the ice machines worked throughout our stay. The rooms have huge furniture (desks, cabinet, and tv stand) the walkway between those and the beds are about a foot. The rooms are incredibly over crowded.  Also the seal on the fridge in the room was broken and when we got into the room the ice from the freezer was melted and made the floor wet, also since the seal was broke nothing stayed cold. When the front desk was contacted they couldn't of cared less, there was nothing they would do. I would stay elsewhere next time, this place is too expensive for what you get.Bed bugs.There, I said it.You can complain about construction, tiny rooms, thin walls, broken elevators, and inconsiderate staff all you want, but when it comes down to brass tacks, my room had bed bugs. I got a refund from Priceline, but it was still hell, and it was not conducive to relaxing my daughter the night before her cardiac procedure at Vanderbilt, and it was horrid trying to find a new hotel to stay in on such short notice.Avoid at all costs.Probably the worst hotel (motel?) I've ever stayed at. Even though it is branded a 'Comfort Inn,' it is far below the quality of any Comfort Inn I've previously stayed at. So where do I begin? Have you ever walked into a room and immediately knew it wasn't safe to touch anything? If I would've had one of those fancy CSI blue lights, I'm sure the entire room would have glowed blue. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C83cLB8VgYWuNBLR4CQ?select=Fhg2rzJFX26LSPjA_TDFAw#u7v_IaeEjWb2jEw6OMwjiQ"">yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C...</a>There were cigarette burns in the mustard yellow bedspread. Layers of dust on the dented base of the standing lamp. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C83cLB8VgYWuNBLR4CQ?userid=LCZSBQCIss8Aw3AXcdFSow#lk4zskRpyU_CSC7p8PxJAg"">yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C...</a>   All 3 lampshades were different. The plastic drapes didn't close all the way but luckily a previous guest had left a bobby pin attached to a drape so I was able to close the curtains for privacy.  <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C83cLB8VgYWuNBLR4CQ?userid=LCZSBQCIss8Aw3AXcdFSow#SvfJ6qVdLv6uH88OEcGD0g"">yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C...</a>The furniture looked like it was purchased at a garage sale.  <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C83cLB8VgYWuNBLR4CQ?userid=LCZSBQCIss8Aw3AXcdFSow#wjqxzlpBv9J1GcG4dPVqFQ"">yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C...</a> I saw the housekeeper and there wasn't a broom or mop on her trolley.  There were grey stains on the tile in the bathroom.  I'm sure the carpet and tile hadn't been cleaned in quite some time.  By the way, the housekeeper changed the TV channel from the Olympic station I had been watching to channel 15 for old black and white movies - that's probably why she didn't have time to clean!Did I mention that for a mere $80 I could have purchased the bedspread with cigarette burns?  That would have made an interesting souvenir!  <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C83cLB8VgYWuNBLR4CQ?userid=LCZSBQCIss8Aw3AXcdFSow#Fhg2rzJFX26LSPjA_TDFAw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/HI8C...</a>I wore shoes and socks the whole time I was in this hotel room.  I slept with all my clothes on and it was 100 degrees outside with high humidity.  I just felt dirty being in this room.  Yuck!There is a music club right across the street that plays music till quite late.  Wednesday night was a Rap type band with heavy bass till midnight and Thursday night the band was more Rock-n-Roll, but played until after 2:00 a.m.  And the noisy bar crowd didn't dissipate until 3:00 a.m.  So don't plan on getting any rest while you're here.  I wouldn't have minded some good Jazz or R&amp;B...  The pool looked nice but I didn't swim in it since this was a busy business trip.  And I also opted out of the daily complimentary breakfast just because I was creeped out by how dirty the kitchen could be!  I will be visiting Nashville again but I will make sure I do not stay here.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.  Unless I hated them.  LOLI specifically got a yelp account just to write a bad review for this motel, because IT IS THAT BAD! To start with the room has a dirty feel. I actually wore my flip flops in the shower and when walking around the room. The pillows smelled terrible and the comforter had a cigarette burn in it. To top it off there were flies and gnats sharing the room with us! Considering that the room wasn't clean we opted to not eat the continental breakfast either.There was essentially no room to walk around in the room either. The bathroom was about the size of a travel trailer's bathroom-it was a struggle just to change in it. The beds were really close together and close to the walls making nearly impossible to move. Finally, when it came time to check out the receptionist at the front desk actually stamped our credit card! This is totally illegal and they can basically reproduce the credit card, so needless to say we will have to cancel it. Comfort Inn should be ashamed that this poor excuse for a hotel is part of their chain.Well, the Comfort Inn on Demonbreun in Nashville is a dump. But it is an expensive dump which can fool you into thinking you purchased something of value. Just when I was almost ok with it, we went to breakfast. The eggs were some kind of prefabricated disks.  Thought you couldn't ruin scrambled eggs.  And that dish of mystery chunks to go on the biscuits shall go unpraised.  Saggy bed, fixtures falling off toilet and shower.  Unreliable wifi. Dirty carpet. Like that. We are leaving and staying near the airport!!DISGUSTING!!!! Keep driving, dirty, toilet ran, sink clogged, full of fruit flies.  Loud screaming neighbors, smoked in the room.  Said they had wifi but it wouldn't work unless you are in the lobby.  Called the front desk said someone would be down to help never showed.  Just an awful nights sleep more like a half way house.  Skip it!Worst hotel and customer service. Besides it being disgusting the front desk person named, sonny, told me to ""fuck off."" When I tried to get another room. A terrible experience. Totally miserable while I was there.It's nothing fancy, but very competitively priced, offering free breakfast (biscuits, eggs, sausage, etc), outdoor pool, and a safe walk to Broadway Street. I stayed here for a girls' weekend in October, and for another one in June. Some reviews say the service was horrible, but I didn't experience that at all. Staff was very friendly, and even upgraded our two rooms to suites with jacuzzi tub, pullout couch, and a lot more room for girly primping time. I definitely recommend this Comfort Inn to anyone looking for an above average, standard hotel experience.","This was one of THE WORST hotels we've EVER stayed in.  The construction on the lobby is SO BAD you have no idea where to go.  No signs, no directions or arrows as to where the hell the front lobby is.  The check in staff was rude and I can't believe we paid $ 187.00 FRIGGON dollars for that piece of crap room!  I think we got seriously taken for a ride.  I asked for a military discount and she assured me that it was the lowest price, ONLY to find out when we checked out the next morning, she didn't and the front desk guy gave us a 10 dollar discount.The room had an overall dirty feel to it.  Crappy microwave, fridge was barely cold, bathroom was dirty and best of all, it's in the WORST part of town.  Really enjoyed the homeless and lowlifes hanging out in the parking lot.  My kids were scared and got more so when the police cars starting arriving along w/ the fire trucks at 11:30 at night.Next morning, we couldn't leave fast enough but had to get our ""free"" breakfast.  I'm sure it tasted great when it was cooked 3 days before.  As it was, we got leftover, rubbery biscuits w/ gravy that looked like dog food and the rest wasn't much better.  This place was so low class from the customer service, to the food, to the rooms, to the building in general.  Was so bad it's scarred us from EVER going to another Comfort Inn ANYWHERE.  We deserve a refund at the very least ""survival"" pay for staying there.I cannot understand this place getting any good reviews.  It was just so horrible.................STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!  O and the photo's online or on this site?  Doesn't look ANYTHING like what you actually get!Great price and location with a great staff! I needed a hotel that was affordable near downtown for an event and this has been a great find! It was also a bonus to find out there was breakfast included in my stay (and not just a continental breakfast). I also didn't realize there was a great pool until I got there.  But the best part are the employees. Everyone is so friendly and super helpful. I had numerous boxes delivered to the hotel for an event and they have helped me pack up my car!  And there is a row of cute restaurants right across the street in case the 10 min walk to the other areas is too far.I have a long history with this hotel, and most of it has been very positive. When I lived in Nashville, this is where I put up family and other visitors. I didn't even look anywhere else. Great rates, location, pretty nice rooms and good people. I no longer live in Music City, and I made the decision to stay here while in town with a friend for some recording we were doing at a studio nearby. That was a mistake that nearly ruined the whole weekend. I don't have time to get into great detail, but I'll tell you that my poor experience began a month before arriving when I originally made the reservation. The problem: The price. This is not a $140/night hotel. It's not a $100/night hotel. It never has been, and it certainly hasn't been noticeably updated in the 10 years I've been a customer. They may have painted a few fiddles on the exteriors, but this price point is laughable, friends. My guest, a first-timer to Nashville, had a room with the room number scrawled onto it in Sharpie. And that number wasn't even correct. It's *that* kind of place. The kind of place where you go to turn on their admittedly nice big wall-mounted TVs and the remote doesn't work. And the handle of the fixture in the shower clangs loudly into the bottom of the tub the first time you go to use it.But the main reason for my terrible experience at this hotel is that it's currently (in winter of 2013) basically sitting on top of a construction site. This was not mentioned when booking (at $140/night!), and was mentioned only in passing as we checked in after dark when things had quieted down. Both me and my guest assumed the ""construction"" the front desk person hinted at (she was comically blaming it on a random guy just hanging out by the desk) was the plywood entryway we navigated to get to her from the lot. We thought they were just re-doing the front facade of the hotel.What ACTUALLY was happening, was they were building an enormous structure right next door. So close, the area used to be the spillover parking lot for the hotel. Just yards away. And this wasn't light construction -- this was explosives and 4-wheeled jackhammers. Below-ground foundation work.Well, at least you've got till 8 or 9am until those trucks show up, right? Wrong. The Reverse-beeping convoys roll in a'rumblin' around 6 o'clock. They don't get at it for real till 8 (when earthquake-like detonations that rock all of the Music Row/Mid Town area also resume), but chances are you won't get back to sleep between 6-8. And there's really no chance at all of sleeping after 8.What does this translate into? Well, for me and my guest that meant by the end of our 4-night stay, we were pretty much zombies. We worked in the recording studio till late, and wouldn't get to sleep till 2 or 3 -- meaning we got 3, maybe 4 hours of sleep a night. As we waited at the gate at BNA for our flight home, my guest turned to me and said, ""I feel like I've been in Vegas two days too long."" I knew what he meant because I felt exactly the same, and I don't even drink anymore. It was all thanks to the Comfort Inn on Demonbreun. Where sleep is as elusive as that # 1 Country hit.You get what you pay for at this hotel. Actually, you might get a bit more than you pay for. This is one of the cheapest hotels in downtown Nashville. We paid less than half the price for this hotel as we would have paid for a room near the honky tonks and the Country Music Hall of Fame. With that in mind, we were pretty happy with what we got here. The rooms are small, but clean. The bathrooms are really tiny, but again, clean. There's free breakfast every morning, which includes coffee and tea, bagels, eggs, muffins, waffles, cereal, fruit, and more. There's also free coffee and bottles of water in the lobby. The room was quite hot, however, and the AC units had been turned off and there was no way to adjust the temperature. It was like a sauna in the room - hot and humid, especially after using the shower. Someone posted a picture of the pillows, which is pretty funny because my friends and I laughed about them, too. They're little square things, and the hotel doesn't have many extras, because when we asked for more one night, they didn't have any. Parking is free in the hotel's lot, and cabs come frequently. It's a short walk to some bars and restaurants, or you can take a cab to the ones a bit farther away. The hotel is located right between the West End, where Vanderbilt is, and downtown, where the honky tonks and many of the sights are. The hotel is currently undergoing renovations, however, and it's really loud. They were even working bright and early Sunday morning, which wasn't pleasant. The management was nice enough to give us a discount for the inconvenience, though. Don't come here expecting a luxury experience, but you'll get a good bang-for-your-buck.I stayed here through one of those mystery deals on Priceline. It was under construction when I stayed, but they seemed to be assigning rooms that were as far away as possible from the noise. Maybe they've changed things around since some of the other reviewers stayed here, because I had no issues with the cleanliness of my room or the staff. Everyone was pleasant; the staff would offer a ""good morning"" in passing and were respectful of my stuff when they came through.The breakfast they offer is decent, if not better than other hotels I've gone to. Granted it's no IHOP, but it's free, so it's more than adequate for that. At the end of the day, I came to Nashville to see the city, not stay in my hotel. This hotel will do just fine if you have the same mindset.I would recommend staying here.  The location is great.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  They keep the place immaculate.  Breakfast nook is fully stocked.  If you are looking for fancy, you are in the wrong place, but if you are looking for a good value, great price, with a wonderful location where you can walk to town, this is it!This hotel was abysmal; the premises are in disrepair, and the rooms are filthy, as our bathroom reeked of urine.  There was also a burn mark on the comforter in our non-smoking room.  It was freezing cold outside and our heater did not work.  Although the individual who made our reservation informed me that the hotel offers federal government employees a discounted rate, they would not honor the discount for me, so we paid $240 for one night for the horrendous accommodations.  To add insult to injury, when we went to check out, a car was parked illegally behind our car, almost blocking us into our parking space and obstructing the sidewalk, such that we could barely get our luggage to the car and pull out of our parking space.  Upon reporting this to the front desk, they did not seem to care at all.  I would not recommend staying at this hotel under any circumstances.This is my first review ever because I feel compelled to warn as many people as possible.Be sure to check the mattresses!!!  Overheard a conversation while checking out with a guest and management about finding bed bugs in their room.  Most people feel pretty comfortable and are aware of the basic quality of Comfort Inns.  This hotel definitely has more of a Motel 6 feel.  Not like any Comfort Inn I've ever stayed in.  Extremely tiny bathrooms.  Rooms are very old and outdated and just feel incredibly dirty.  Cigarette burns in the comforters.  Construction going on all around.  Front desk and management not professional at all.  Way over-priced.  You are paying solely for the location which is in walking distance to many places downtown.Don't stay here.  I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it any less.We booked to stay here through Hotwire and the staff made it clear on arrival they weren't happy that we weren't paying the full-whack.The room was cold and it smelt of cigarettes although it was a non-smoking room.  The towels also smelt of mould.My partner accidentally left his jacket in the wardrobe and I rang that afternoon to let them know.  The lady was rude and unhelpful saying nothing had been handed in so I asked her to check with staff.  I called back later and she said she didn't know who had cleaned the room.  From the time we were there we had only seen 3 members of staff and they were all family.  The manager was only slightly more helpful but told me his staff had probably stolen the jacket as it was no longer there and no one else had stayed in the room.  So that was that.  Not even an apology.I also asked to use their free internet which was in reception.  The lady on the desk grunted and nodded to the computer which I took as a yes.  After about 5 minutes she asked me to get off the computer as someone else wanted to use it.  This turned out to be a young man came out from behind the desk, presumably another relative.Spend your money elsewhere.Good: Location is great. Very close to downtown and plenty of good restaurants and bars. Beds are comfy and just the right amount of firm. Nice big TVs. Fridge, microwave, coffee pot, iron and board all in the roomBad: Continental breakfast is terrible, though I guess its what you'd expect at a cheap hotel. Coffee is undrinkable. The ""fitness center"" is a tiny, unmarked room three pieces of cheap and completely broken exercise gear. Treadmill didn't work at all, Elliptical felt like it was going to tip over the moment I stood on it, and the weight machine's pulleys and cables were so wobbly and sticky it added an extra 30lbs or so of drag, and created an unsafe herky-jerky motion when trying to do any exercises. They allow people visiting the nearby bars and restaurants park in their parking lot on weekends, so good luck finding a parking spot near your room on a Friday or Saturday night. Wi-Fi is free, but unbelievably slow.  Overall: Stay here for the location. Leave for everything else.We had a wonderful two day stay at this Comfort Inn. We got an amazing deal on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> and I'm glad we ended up there. Our room was nice, clean and comfortable, there was an outdoor pool, and they provided us with a crib at no charge. Its located about a half mile from Vanderbuilt and a mile from Music Row.The breakfast merits its own paragraph. This extensive spread is far different from the typical donut/stale coffee duo of most complementary breakfasts. They have a make-your-own waffle station, biscuits and gravy, cereal, oatmeal, coffee, hot cocoa, yogurt, pastries, bagels, oatmeal... Pretty much every option that you'd want. Awesome!When you stay here, don't expect a luxury stay, but expect an amazing value, with great service and all the amenities that you need. I highly reccommend.Worst customer service ever - multiple problems, no follow-up and never once did I hear the words ""I'm sorry"". Toilet didn't flush properly when we checked in. No big deal, I politely informed the front desk as we were leaving for dinner &amp; they said it would be fixed within a few hours.Next morning, it was obvious the problem hadn't been fixed. As we left the hotel for the day's activities, I informed the front desk for the second time that the toilet valve wasn't working, this time with a definite annoyed edge in my voice. Came back late afternoon, relaxed for 2 hours, then as we got ready for dinner, we realized toilet STILL didn't flush. Third trip to the front desk, seriously pissed off. All they had to say is that they found out the toilet must be replaced and we'd have to change rooms. When asked why didn't they leave a message or a note to that effect, so we could have changed rooms when we first returned to the hotel, their answer was - ""we meant to disable your key but we forgot"". This is how the management communicates to guests that a room change is required!Changed rooms, toilet works in new room, stayed for the second night. When we returned to the hotel on the afternoon of our third day, the key to our new room didn''t work. So I trekked back to the front desk for the fourth time with a complaint. The manager said when we changed rooms the previous day, they didn't check our departure date before giving us a key to the new room. He shrugged, reprogrammed the key and gave it to me without a word.Three significant errors, and not once did I hear ""I'm sorry"" or ""I apologize"". Stay away from this hotel!Don't stay here unless you inspect your room first! My husband and I stayed here while driving through town (on a cross country road trip). When we walked into our room we noticed a strong perfume smell which was quite overwhelming....well as it turns out that strong perfume smell was to cover up the smell of mold! Yes, that's right, there was two feet's worth of visible mold growing on our ceiling! gross, gross, gross. We stuck it out here since we just needed a place to sleep before we hit the road in the morning, but seriously, no hotel should be letting people stay in rooms with mold growing on walls. ewww. Yes, this place is in a very convenient location and inexpensive for Nashville ($100ish), but had I known, I would have paid extra money to stay someplace without a mold issue.This place was better than expected! good comfy place to stay and a short taxi ride from downtown! nothing luxurious but I would stay again for the price.Spir of the moment on a roadtrip, we decided to stop in Nashville for a night just to see the sights. We wanted something under $100, but nice...and Comfort Inn was the first place that caught our eye that seemed that would fit our needs. We stopped and walked in...the lady behind the counter said they had vacent rooms, but the cost would be $90 for the night...wtf, really?! Then she found out that we were from the same part of CA as she was, and she dropped the rate to $80 for the night...that sounds more reasonable. The room was clean. The service was nice. And the pool was refreshing. Also, it's only about 1 mile from downtown...close enough to walk. Fast Food places (Taco Bell, Arbys) is only about 2 blocks away too. Free breakfast as well. I'd recommend this place to any young person that wants a nice, clean, somewhat chep place to stay....A good place to stay for people who are not looking to be pampered, but are wanting to actually spend time in the city. The price is not as cheap as other places, but the hotel is 1 mile from Broadway, and very close to the free bus. The rooms are clean. There is a microwave and fridge in the hotel (one of the reasons I wanted to book it) along with free internet, free parking, and free breakfast. The breakfast isn't that amazing, but free bagels/waffles and bananas are always a positive. Overall, I would stay here again when wanting to visit downtown.We stayed here during our road trip through the southern states.  After a long drive from Louisville, KY, we were thankful that the hotel was fairly easy to get to from the highway.  Customer service:  The front desk employees were cordial, but not really friendly.  (Where were the smiles??  Aren't we in the south?)  Maybe it was because it was pretty busy.  The room:  The room was clean and had 2 double beds, a round table, an alarm clock which was plugged in, (surprisingly, a luxury on this trip), a flat screen tv, a refrigerator, and a microwave.  It was spacious enough for one person, but not so much for 2 people.  The sink was outside of the bathroom, but the bathroom was still pretty cramped.  Convenience:  The hotel was pretty close to downtown Nashville, should you choose to drive.  You also have the option of a brief 2 block walk to the Green Circuit bus stop, which will take you there for FREE and this one runs pretty late.  There are 2 other free circulator buses and they don't run nearly as long.  Amenities:  The pool looked really nice and clean, but it was too cold to get in.  We noticed the gym on our way to our room.  It looked pretty well equipped with a treadmill and a few other machines.  They served a free breakfast, which is ALWAYS nice.  The spread was nice: fruit, bagels, muffins, cereal, orange juice (a little watery), tea, coffee, sausage, and some weird eggs circle things, and a waffle maker.  I'm warning you to stay away from the waffles though.  They had plain and blueberry, which was a green color.  I tried both and they had some weird aftertaste to them.  I couldn't finish it, so I grabbed some fruit instead.Overall:  It's a decent place to stay, so I would stay here again.  I got my money's worth.  Next time, I would just avoid the waffles.  :-)Let's just say I went to the effort of getting a Yelp account just so that I can rate this heap of shit. This place isn't worthy of any stars, in fact it is the black hole of hotels. An abysmal vortex of crappiness that makes the Hans Brinker (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hans-brinker.com&amp;s=ccdcae37f160d35bf7781a1d0e3b00ff14d43b2b83e914439b952104f68e3566"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hans-brinker.com</a>) seem like the Hilton. On a positive note, I can recommend The Hyatt Place out at the airport. The cab ride to &amp; from the city is reasonable and the breakfast makes the extra miles worth your while.Good: Affordable, clean, and impeccable service.Not so good: Sheets were a bit itchy, vending machine ate my money.After staying here for three days, I was ready to head home, albeit sad because I had lost my camera in a cab the previous night. The guy at the desk, Mac, spends 20 minutes of his OWN TIME to help me phone up a bunch of the cab companies to see if they can find anything. Way to help a brother out, guys!Would definitely stay here again.DIRTY, DISGUSTING. The room reeked of Vanilla carpet powder with an undertone of stale cigarette smoke. There was still a Used bar of soap in the shower and water standing in the tub. There was a cigarette burn hole in the blanket on the bed. This was a ""non-smoking' room. Also the curtain was falling off. We could not stay in the room because our lungs burned trying to breath in the room. We had to find another room last minute at another hotel and this made for an exhausting anniversary instead of a restful one!","This place was a disaster from start to finish. To be honest, this could be the opening scene for The Hangover 3 - going from bad to worse. I think that makes sense actually - Las Vegas, Thailand, Nashville...  We booked through a third party, so this possibly led to some complications, but read on to find out what happened. This is a long one, so skip down to the bottom to see my bullet-point list if you are like me and consider the length of this review to be unacceptable* - I have embarrassed myself here to be honest, but I could not edit this at all - I tried!We needed a room for 5, so we booked a double with a crib, and even called a week before our trip to confirm that they could provide the crib - 'no problem, it is guaranteed!' So we arrive, go to our room that was already sub-par (cigarette smoke, not that clean, decor was straight out of 'No Country for Old Men'**) and found no crib. We called to have them bring it up, and they told us they could not provide it.  After a discussion they suggested that they would send up some sheets so that our extra person could stay on the floor 'THE FLOOR!!!??? So this was unacceptable and we let them know clearly, and they kindly offered us another room, no discount, full-price. We suggested that we might leave to find a hotel where they could accommodate us all, and they invited us to do that, but that we would still have to pay for not one, but TWO nights.... What the ......? We were locked into a contract to the death with these guys - is that legal? Were we going to be visited by 'The Family'*** in the middle of the night? While we were on the phone, someone decided to paint our front door - PAINT THE FRONT DOOR!!!??? Congratulations on attempting to improve the decor, but painting the front door ten mins after we checked in was a ridiculous move, and one of us ended up with paint on our jacket. So we went down to chat to them at the front desk, and this didn't go well. They said we were welcome to leave, but they would still charge us for the first night, and because we were less than 24 hours out from the next night (we planned to stay for 3) they would charge us for this. We spoke to management, we spoke to Comfort Inn Head Office, we spoke to our third party and no-one would help. I did't say could, I said would.So bullet point form for those challenged with time;- suggested one of us sleep on the floor- even though they could not accommodate us, they would not refund us- management were super rude - Comfort Inn Head Office were totally unsupportive- started painting our front door 10 mins after we checked in- staff were 'looking' and 'peering' through the windows constantly- we went down for breakfast the next morning and they started cleaning our room before we had removed our luggage or checked-outThis hotel was super expensive, the management were rude, frat boys partied it up until the wee hours, breakfast was disgusting, overall this is a terrible hotel - YELP should offer a negative star review. It is the hotel equivalent to that movie BASEketball**** that the guys from Southpark made a while back, although that gets an unbelievable 6.4/10 on IMDB - we are living in an upside-down world right now!Do not stay in this hotel - you will be disappointed......Unless you would like to see people attempt to work out how to use the waffle machine in the morning. I am surprised they didn't have a Navy Seal operating this thing, it was a tricky little sucker.... Very entertaining - we took a video and will be posting this to YouTube at a later date.Thanks,Lee*the length of this review is far too long, sorry for those of you who didn't intend reading a novel when you searched out a review for this hotel**what am I doing relating this hotel to movies? I am not like this in real life, sorry.***I had to add a third, and this is not talking about a movie called 'The Family' as that sounds great, almost like 'Meet The Fockers', just without the comedy, a pure family movie. I am talking about 'THE FAMILY' like off Godfather or something? Scarface? I dunno, I am out of movie references...****just having a laugh now....Pretty sure this is the best hotel in Nashville ... at least for under $90.  You got the pool, the continental breakfast, and you're only a cheap cab ride away from the real downtown.  If you're old and want quiet, maybe not the best.  But if you're looking to have a beer down by the pool with some cool cats, go for it.This place is an absolute dump. It is a motel, not a hotel.  exterior noise is significant. Bathroom is tiny. You can hardly close the door when you are inside. Room smelled funky and everything was dirty and old. Internet is free but extremely slow. I would NEVER EVER stay here, EVER! If I could give it negative 3 stars, I wouldThis hotel is actually pretty great for the price.  It's probably the best cheaper hotel to stay in town (and by in town I mean within walking distance to popular downtown Nashville bars and restaurants).  It doesn't look run down or creepy like most of the cheaper hotels around, and its in a safe AND convenient location right by I-65.It is located on Demonbreun which means Music Row is a block away and there are several restaurants shops and bars right across the street.  The Comfort Inn is a short $5 cab ride to most of the tourist locations including the Ryman and all the honky tonks on Broadway.The rooms are pretty spacious and very clean although a little dated.  You get free Internet and access to the outdoor pool when the weather is nice.This hotel was absolutely disgusting and infested with COCKROACHES. We complained twice  while we were at the hotel and all they offered to do was spray. At the time we had no idea they were COCKROACHES, but the hotel admitted they knew on the phone later when we called. When we called to complain for the FOURTH time they still refused to give us our money back. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT STAY HERE! We will be calling choice hotels and the board of health to complain.For the price, you cannot beat this Comfort Inn in Downtown Nashville.  We used a Groupon certificate for a large suite and it was very nice.  The staff met every need we had from extra tooth brushes to arranging a great Town Car and driver for transportation.  The downtown location is very good too.  The overall experience was far better than I was expecting for a Comfort Inn.  The large outdoor pool was clean and nice, the room was large and immaculate, and the complimentary breakfast was good.Great place, nice staff, upgraded our room for free. Pet-friendly! and nice flat screen HD TV. Stayed here on our cross-country road trip 1/5/12.Comfortable and easy to get to.  Room was a little on the small side, but we were only there for one night.  Clean, everything worked.  All of the room doors open to the outside, which I think of as a slight negative. Very convenient to downtown, particularly the Ryman.The location is great - in walking distance from food, bars, tourist attractions &amp; other downtown related things.About a ten to fifteen minute ride from the airport.Obviously not a fancy hotel, but a really good deal for the location.The couple who run the place are very nice &amp; helpful.My room was modest but spotless.Free continental breakfast in the morning, free internet, microwave &amp; fridge in room, and standard toiletries.I have no complaints &amp; would definitely stay there again.This place is great, the rooms are agreeable, there is a microwave, fridge, and coffee pot in each room.  The pool was not freezing and very refreshing, a quick trip to the front desk gets you towels.  The internet is a little slow, but it is free with the room so it is great.  Music row is close by, it is pretty much right off the freeway which makes it accessable even for only a night on a drive through.  I have stayed at many other hotels around the same price on my trip cross country and this one so far takes the cake, and i can have my dog with me, which is even better.  It is about a 15 min walk to downtown from here, but if you plan on drinking the front desk  will call you a cab which i am sure will only run you a couple of bucks, I walked it was great exercise and a fun way to see the city.  I will definitely make this my place when i come back to nashvilleAt first we thought, okay hotel for the price. Until 20 frat idiots decided to trash the hotel by throwing junk into the pool and jumping in the pool, screaming all over the place until 5am! Front desk did nothing and told us to call the cops. They told me if I felt I had to leave that was up to me because I booked thru hotwire.  Learned my lesson not to go thru hotwire  or stay here.",,"['sister', 'comfort', 'inn', 'visiting', 'price', 'location', 'best', 'bet', 'landed', 'early', 'front', 'desk', 'allowed', 'check', 'extra',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-hermitage-hotel-nashville,The Hermitage Hotel,4.5,$$$$,111,"I will update my review to five stars. I had forgotten this was available with American Express Fine hotels. Darn! Now that I think back to my first visit I wasn't upgraded because the room last week was the same as in 2013. Disappointed that front staff indicated they upgraded me in 2013 as I realize in reading my first review again that they didn't. Oh well.I will keep my rating at a 5 since it is based on this visit. I still believe a five star hotel should have free water. The room is very lovely and has a lot of charm (as does the whole hotel). Certainly not a chain. The service was outstanding to include the Capitol Grille restaurant.What was particularly nice this time was my breakfast. For $20 including all taxes and fees you get a large pot of coffee, two eggs, choice of meat, choice of biscuit (yum!) or toast, potatoes and orange juice. And delicious jelly. An absolutely amazing deal! And to package it as $20 total is really smart. I usually skip breakfast because I don't have time and it is so expensive. This one was delivered within 20 minutes and was so inexpensive. The best part though was it was the most enjoyable room service meal I have ever had! It was all FRESH! They have their own garden so it is all farm to table. Amazing. There are a few things they could still do but I will give it a five. It was a delightful experience.The Grande Dame of all Southern hotels. I remember the first time I walked into the hotel lobby, the building had just been purchased by Park Hotels I think it was, and they were planning a $40M refurb. And this property was in great need, you could see the detail, you knew it was special, but the years had not been kind. Much to the amazement of the new owners when they began to dismantle the stained glass ceiling, they found this beautiful artwork underneath a layer of brown cigar smoke that had accumulated over 70 years +. Well here we are after the latest facelift, and I'm still their biggest fan. Just something special about this hotel, I guess 105 years of history will do that for you.The rooms are beautiful and tastefully appointed. Got a great rate on a Junior Suite, very reasonable, made for a fantastic last night in town after the best Christmas ever. The hotel was busy last evening, no executive suites available but thats not unusual because the ballrooms are in constant demand. They look like something you would find at the White House. I'll never forget my parents dragging me here when I was a kid, and over dinner my dad instructing me to ""go see the bathroom."" I told him I didn't need to go and he insisted...""Go to the bathroom young man."" OK, so I went .... 15 minutes later he had to come find me, I was having my shoes shined. LOL I'll bet more ladies have visited this men's bathroom than any other facility on the planet. I know I've toured 5-6 through there, the other guys don't mind, its a right of passage that everybody must experience. The rooms and beds are designed for extreme comfort, we had a direct view of the State Capitol which always makes this a unique experience. Downtown Nashville is pretty compact so you can walk anywhere you want to go from here without breaking a sweat, just valet your car and forget about it until departure. Make sure to check out the Oak Bar and if you make a reservation at the Capitol Grille and go in with no expectations, you'll enjoy yourself. Just wished the Veranda had been open, thats my favorite spot to have a drink just off the lobby, may be a seasonal thing. Anyway, this place is just spectacular, if you're in Nashville for a visit do yourself a favor and come check it out and have a few in the Oak Bar. It should be on everybody's Bucket List.I am in love with this hotel.   When you get at the doors, it's 5 star service right away.  The doormen came out to greet me and take my bags inside.  Walking into the lobby and up the stairs, I was amazed.   The stained glass ceiling and the furniture/decor is just breathtaking.  Throughout my stay I really felt taken care of and valued.  The Molton Brown products are obviously a plus as are the super luxurious bath robes, turn down service complete with mini treats, slippers, and filled ice bucket.  There were treats near the elevator in the afternoon, apples and water at the gym, and water bottles at the door when my morning began. When it rained one day, they provided umbrellas at the lobby entrance as well.   The hotel also has a pillow bar!  Not only are there 4 down pillows on the bed - there are 3 additional options in the closet (memory foam, latex, and buckwheet) and from what I hear, there are other options if you call the front desk.   There is a nespresso machine too (although, I'd prefer coffee maker over espresso). And how could I forget a TV in the bathroom.  Staff was 100% competent and provided a high level of service.  They were also very knowledgable and offered suggestions and directions every time I left the hotel. Hotel is completely worth it.  Put it on your list now... It is a must do. ((on the other hand, oak bar is more take it or leave it, kind of cool, but not imperative to check out))When my friend told me that we were staying at The Hermitage I was shocked. This place has been around for over a hundred years. Valet parking, the staff was very welcoming, someone to carry your bags, the lady that checked us was a little stressed but she did give us some great tips of places to visit. The room was huge, cloth robes were on the bed, the bed was turned down, we had a bottle of champagne waiting for us. We had not just a coffee machine, but and espresso machine. We had a Jacuzzi tub, clear glass walk in shower. King size bed with comfy pillows. If you can afford it, or just even stop in for a drink in The Oak Bar.Beautiful hotel and especially the lobby. What is so unfortunate is the service which I would rate a one if I could. Me and my wife have stayed at 5star hotels all around the world and never had this bad experience with the service without them even try to make up for it. 2 times in a row we have ordered Roomservice and gotten the food 1,5hour after we called (at that point when you don't even want it anymore). Also trying to schedule a massage turned out to be a disaster when they were going to call back and confirm and never did so I called back and asked and they had no idea what I was talking about and ended up getting a completely different massage than what I wanted. I want to point out that the valet is very good and friendly staff.The Hermitage lives up to the 5 star ranking. I loved interacting with the bellmen in tophats. They were very energetic and respectful. The bed was extremely comfortable. I LOVED the lobby. So picturesque. The only problem was an alarm clock set for 530 am that went off the first two mornings we were there.  Cider and cookies delicious. Feel like you've gone into the twilight zone and returned to the roaring 20s. My boyfriend enjoyed walking to all the downtown attractions.My second historic hotel of America was checked off my list in 2013. While indeed normally pricey, I booked late and mid-week and found it affordable and worth every penny. The valets treated my car fantastically, trust me, I watch like a hawk. And they always had an extra umbrella to lend me when we went strolling if there was even the slightest chance of rain.The concierge could not have been more knowledgeable about how to get around while walking, the acts on Whiskey Row that fit our bill and just exuded true southern hospitality.The room was wonderful. Where else do get slippers and a bathrobe and turndown service nightly?The Hermitage will be a regular stay while in Nashville in the future. I hope they have the spotty wi-if repaired by then.Wow. Simply the best hotel experience I've had in a really long time. A stunning hotel with impeccable service. This place rivals any Ritz Carlton. I cannot wait to come back!It was super fancy and the service was very nice. The bar area was old school and elegant.The employees there if you ask will let you peek into the famous mens art deco bathroom. I would definitely recommend this place to everybody!We only came for a drink in the downstairs bar, but it was great! The service took a little while, however it was packed, and when we did order our drinks were great! Be sure to stop in and see the men's restroom. Girls are allowed in there, too!I have only had a few occasions to stay in a historic hotel and this one is definitely one of our favorites.  My wife and I took a short vacation to Nashville in order to do the normal tourist things in a different city in our new state.  The people at this hotel treated us as if we were the most important customers in the hotel and were just so nice and polite.  The room, along with the rest of the hotel was absolutely beautiful and they had made everything so comfortable. It was so great to be able to spend a few days feeling like you are being spoiled.  It is also located in such a great spot that we were able to walk to several places including museums and Music Row. I highly recommend staying a couple of nights here.Stolen Jewelry.My sister and I visited Nashville for the first time Memorial Day weekend. I was so excited to be in Music City and take everything in! Unfortunately, The Hermitage Hotel left a pretty big dent in my impression of Nashville. We arrived back to our hotel room after spending an afternoon in Belle Meade to discover that I had jewelry missing. A gift from my parents, a pair of diamond and pearl earrings, were gone. I filed a report with the hotel and have yet to hear back from them, but I don't really expect to. This ordeal makes it difficult to say I had a great time in Nashville. I loathe the fact that I can't enjoy myself in a brand new city without worrying about who will be in our room going though our things.If I go back to Nashville, I will not be staying here again.Other observations:Pros: The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and that celling is gorgeous!  The bar serves delicious and well-made drinks. (The Tennessee Waltz is amazing!) The restaurant was on point with the food as well.Cons: Our room was okay. For what is cost to stay here, the beds weren't super comfortable and the sheets seemed haphazardly clean.Celebrated my birthday here tonight and I could not have been happier to do so! One of the best experiences of our Nashville trip so far. I wanted to come here because I read Taylor Swift say in an interview once that she took her Mom here for Mother's Day brunch once and fell in love and I had a similar experience. the ambience definitely takes you to a different time period. When we arrived, the staff was very friendly. Our waitress Trisha was very sweet, explained all the menu options in a way that made you want to order everything because it sounded so delicious! She was also very kind and accommodating to my different food sensitives and double checked with the chef which was very caring.  The food is all very consciously-sourced which was reflected in the taste and high quality! I had the double stacked burger with a delicious salad (almonds and sundried blueberries can anyone say YUM!!) my mom got a tasty trout dish and fresh grilled squash and my dad had lamb loin which was cooked to perfection and very pretty (decorated with edible flowers). The ingredient combinations with each dish are inventive and uniquely delicious. We had a slight delay with two of our plates and Tim, the manager was so kind and apologetic to us (even though we didn't mind much!) And he and the chef Garrett comped our entire meal because of the wait! It was clear the chef Garrett runs a very skilled and considerate kitchen and they all really care about their guests. Thank you! It was such a special birthday treat and the staff here is an amazing representation of Nashville hospitality! A true treasure of the city!They call it a 5 star hotel but they sure don't act like one. Service is very disappointing!This hotel is stunning! The only five star hotel in TN, and these guys certainly know what they are doing! Everyone was so friendly and polite, and never seemed rushed to get away from a conversation. The building is historical and beautiful from the lobby to the bathrooms. Great tub with a TV to watch and a separate shower. The rooms are elegant and comfortable.The Hermitage is premium. While it's the nicest hotel in the city, you also pay for it. I've enjoyed staying here my last two trips to the city, I've almost spoiled myself to where nothing else will measure up. Anyways, this is my jam. Slippers are nice and the TV in the bathroom is cool too.My first stay here I was surprised to have a man knock on my door and offer me a complimentary bottle of Champagne. I drank it. And it was good.We loved it! I might go 4.5 stars since the turn-down service was a bit inconsistent.The hotel is lovely, tastefully decorated, and nicely appointed. The beds are comfy and the bathroom is spacious. Frette linens were very comfortable. (Molton Brown personal products ~ not very impressive. Sodium Laureth Sulfate in the shampoo, for example ~ a huge no-no.)The staff were entirely delightful! They made it pleasant every day and seemed genuinely happy.Thank you for the cookies and lemonade each afternoon. :-)Amazing gorgeous hotel. Everyone seems to know your name right away and they address you by name....it's pretty cool.  It's like a stay in a fantasy world where everything is perfect. I left my hotel keys at a nice restaurant tonite, they called the hotel told them and when I showed up .....not able to find my room key, they had already made me a fresh one,Definitely a place to stay!!!!Beautiful hotel! ! Spectacular views !! Great getaway for my husband and I!! Concierge and wonderful service! !! Loved the already ready bubble bath  (once you start running the water ). Perfect location! ! Boutique is perfect for dress shopping! !!  Definitely recommend! !!!!! Definitely a 5 star! !!!!Beautiful, classic old hotel that has been well taken care of. Rooms are nice and spacious and the service is impeccable. From the gift shop to the valets to the front desk to the phone operator everyone was gracious and charming and extremely helpfulStrongly recommend!","For my 700th review, I wanted to write about something absolutely spectacular.  Sunday evening.  First of all, I would like to point out that I have driven through Nashville over 50 times in my life, and I only stopped once- I ended up being encountered by 3 meth heads and got food poisoning.  That left a reallll sour taste in my mouth.  I was driving back home to MEM from SDF (sorry I use airport code, SDF=Louisville).  My car KEPT telling me to get rest.  But I had no idea about any hotels in Nashville.  I kept looking up stuff, and I saw this place.  So I looked at rooms, and saw the place had promise- so I booked a grand deluxe, on a whim, with a AAA rate.  Mind you, I did this about an hour from Nashville.  I got to the city, and I was able to find the hotel fairly easily.  I packed light, with my backpack.  I pulled up to the valet (which should be valet only here), and told them I was checking in.  Very nice.  I walked into the hotel, and was amazed at the old world elegance this place had.  And the fact it was about 10PM on a Sunday night, it wasn't hectic at all.  I gave the gentleman at the front desk my AAA card, my license, and my AMEX.  He asked me if there was anything special going on, and I just told him I needed to relax before my upcoming week of hell.  He told me he had good news for me, that I just got upgraded to the Presidential Suite!  I thought I had gotten punked, but it was for real!  I just wanted some extra space (as the grand deluxe is 590 sq ft).  He gave me the keys to room 812, and the adventure began...I took the elevator to the 8th floor (out of 9), and my room was right there.  I couldn't find the door, (as it was labeled 812)- then I was realized, I had 3 to choose from. I entered, and there was some graceful music playing from a Bose sound system. The pics I took should be self explanatory, but let me tell you what- staying in one of the nicest rooms in the state, was truly a once in a lifetime opp- considering the price I paid.  The view of the Capitol was phenomenal- at night and at day.The actual suite is about 2000 square feet- with the bedroom on the right (marble bathroom tucked away), a huge ass tv area and living area with dining room table for 6, and 1/2 bath there.  On that end is also the mini kitchen with tons of bar stuff and snacks.  I still couldn't believe it.  I could walk from one end of the suite to the other, and honestly get winded- it was that big!  The bathrooms were equipped with Molton Brown amenities, the stuff I currently use to keep my skin clean- I was surely impressed!  I was also surprised to see they had a choice of buckwheat, latex, and memory foam pillows in the closet for your liking- but I just stuck to the 5 on the bed that were already there :).After playing around in the room, I decided to walk around downstairs and soak in the rest of the place.  I started on the Mezzanine level, where the spa, fitness center, and Governor's Salon was.  There were also 3 ornate tables that could be used for chess, overlooking the lobby.I had heard about the famous bathroom here, so I looked.  And when I went into the bathroom, I realized this is really nice- but not the one I had seen in the news (next review on that one).  So I went downstairs to the bar, got some food n drinks, and headed back up to paradise.I had to take a shower, and that thing was awesome.  There were 2 handles, one for a handheld water stream, the other for a nice surprise- a freaking 4 head ceiling shower that felt like a rainstorm.  I fell asleep in the robe that night...Waking up was hard, as the bed was so comfortable and I realized I had to get back to Memphis soon.  So I took another shower, and I was on my way.  Valet got my car in a matter of minutes, and they were as friendly as can be.This place is on the high end, but I tell you what, there was absolutely no complaints here.  If I could give this place 6 stars, I would.  And it gave me an entirely new perspective of Nashville. So for that, I thank you dearly.Cheers!Hermitage Hotel is the only 5 star hotel in Tennessee.Our adventure began this past wknd while at the Yelp Spring Fling wknd festivities. I've lived in Nashville for over 10 yrs and never have i stopped by to tour the place.As you walk in, you walk up these steps that lead you to the main foyer where you can check in and take in the view. To the right was a staircase leading down to the restaurant Capitol Grille and also the Secret Bathroom!i didn't get to tour much of the hotel since that was the extent of my visit but i'm pretty sure the rest of the hotel is just as extravagent as what i saw.This hotel is exceptional; I've been treated like a king! Booked through Amex platinum travel and I received a $100 food and beverage credit which only made this experience better. If you're in Nashville and you're not staying at the hermitage hotel you're doing yourself a disfavor.My new husband and I took a mini-honeymoon to Nashville, and The Hermitage could not have been a better hotel to recover from our wedding. From the moment we pulled up to when we drove away, the staff was so friendly and accommodating-- we never wanted to leave! The room was incredible-- the capitol was framed perfectly through one of our windows, the bathtub was DELIGHTFUL (you can watch tv! while bathing!), and the bed was, literally, dreamy. And as someone who usually yelps to review restaurants, I can't skip all the delicious treats. From a champagne welcome to perfect room service grits to nightly chocolates, we never needed to leave the room. We DID leave the room, however, and were pleased to find that the best of Nashville was right outside the door. Even in wintry weather, we were able to walk right over to Broadway in just about 5 or 10 minutes. Perfect location!In all, we just loved The Hermitage and hope to spend at least a few of our anniversaries there. (if I could, I would take away a half a point because I needed about 25 more packets of the bath salt thingies. I'm serious, I loved that bath tub.)Five stars. This hotel is a gem. We were slightly worried when making hotel arrangements when visiting Nashville (upon discovering that there is not a Ritz-Carlton in this city) but this hotel FAR exceeded any expectations that we had. The room was spacious and we had adjoining suites with the rest of my family and the rooms were beautiful with big bathrooms. They even provide each guest with a choice of 3 different pillows (down, memory foam and barley) so you can pick the one that best suits your preference. There's a 24 hour gym with plenty of machines to choose from.  I should also mention that the lobby is positively breathtaking when you first walk up the stairs. There's a large stained glass mural on the ceiling which creates a beautiful dissipated lighting effect and lots of comfortable sofas and chairs to lounge in while you people watch. The Capitol Grille which is located downstairs on the bottom level is amazing for Breakfast, brunch and dinner (we ate there for each of those mealtimes). Oh and the hotel is pet-friendly--it doesn't get any better than that! We will definitely be staying here whenever we come visit my sister and her husband in Nashville!!!I don't often mingle with the upper crust of society, but this place was certainly the prime cuts of hotels.  The service from entry to exit was phenomenal.  The lobby was already decorated for the upcoming Christmas holiday and it was elegant and gorgeous all wrapped up into one.  In the morning there is complimentary coffee and muffins and in the evenings from 4-7 there was complimentary spiced cider and cookies. (I raided those gingersnap cookies all night!)  My buddy and I explored every inch of the hotel and attempted to use as much cool stuff as we could.  The best part about this hotel was the gym area located on the mezzanine level. Here is why and no it was not because they had a really awesome tiny locker room with a nice shower and toilet area with complimentary toiletries and fine lotions.  This was located right outside the gym area where you can pick up your complimentary bottled water and towels. It was that flavored water son! They had two different flavors; cucumber and mint water and melon water.  This water was so fantastic.  I drank these waters all weekend like a boss!  What is that, you want to match wits with someone and play chess while sipping on a fine beverage? No problem, grab yourself a bourbon beverage downstairs at the Oak Bar or flavored water and go to the front desk and get your chess pieces. Proceed to the mezzanine level and have a seat and play the game with a fantastic view of the splendid lobby.  I also recommend taking a stroll over to the glass case next to the receptions area that contained some of the history of the hotel; it is interesting to see that back in the 40s the hotel rooms were only $10 a night. Real talk on the bathroom.  The bathroom that everyone talks about is pretty neat. Would I travel far and wide to see it, no; would I stop and see it while I was in Nashville, no. Could I see myself filming a rap video in there, hell yes! Check it out, it is pretty cool.The rooms were pretty nice.  The beds and sheets were comfortable.  The robes were also really nice and silky smooth.  The bathrooms had a good size tub, a standup shower, with a TV and dual vanity sinks. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here and taking advantage of all the perks this hotel has to offer. They have fantastic services and the hotel is in a great location, right near the Ryman Auditorium and the Bridgestone Arena.Beautiful lobby.  Beautiful exterior.  Very expensive hotel---and for the price, the rooms are dated.  I'm not into the antique feel or look, personally.  If you are--you will like it.  The bathrooms are very nice, however.  The gym is really small, and there's no spa, no sauna, nothing really special here to enjoy outside of your room.  It's a nice hotel, just a little too stuffy and boring for my taste.  If you like that scene, this will be for you.  I prefer more modern spaces with more amenities for the price.  We like 5 star amenities, and we look for that wherever we stay, but we ended up walking to other high end hotels to enjoy a more relaxed feel for dinner.  I doubt I'll stay here again.I enjoyed my stay here. The staff is professional and the service is efficient. The rooms are quaint and upscale. They have a nice restaurant downstairs and the coolest men's room I have ever seen in my life. There is a lot of history in its construction and the location is awesome - walking distance from popular bars and nightlife. I would highly recommend if $600 a night is in the budget.Beautiful hotel beautiful rooms.Such a beautiful property. The staff is very polite and professional. What I loved most about the hotel was the huge room! Aside being very spacious, the room was clean, well organized, and very well decorated. The vanities in the bathroom were in great shape. Great shower too. A big closet, a small safe-box. The room had a very comfortable bed. The pillows however were a little cheap but luckily they have three different kinds of pillows in the closet. Their turn down service is great too, although the service never came on the second night (no, I did not have the privacy sign at the door)! Also, the cleaning staff had taken the minibar key on the second night; I just didn't bother asking for another one. Ordered room service a couple of times, the food arrived hot and on time. It was delicious, both times!Great afternoon snacks in the lobby: hot apple cider and homemade cookies on the days I was there!The gym, though small, still provides a great space for a quick workout. I am taking one star off for the breakfast. The breakfast is served at the Capitol Grille downstairs and in the morning the smell of old grease from the restaurant is very overwhelming! The wi-fi is free but the signal is very spotty. Also,  in the middle of the night (3 am) I could hear metal banging and it was very annoying. Didn't hear it on the second night, the noise was back on the third night. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. If I am ever back in Nashville, I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else.Location 5+. Atmosphere 5+. Staff 5+++. I only visit a few times a year but they remember my name!We just came home from a three day stay and absolutely loved this hotel ! They gave spoiled us for the ordinary and I'm quite sure no other hotel would ever be more special. The staff was fabulous and so accommodating ! We were delivered fresh cookies and slippers at night , and they filled our ice bucket. The free cookies and tea in the afternoon was lovely as was our complimentary newspaper in the morning. Just sitting in the lobby was a treat . I can see why it is five star ! Our only complaint  was the water was never hot hot ...more warm for the showers We will be back ! Stop in even if you can't stayWow, loved everything about this hotel!  Spectacular room, comfortable and spacious with fine amenities; excellent, courteous service and central location.   The food and the whiskey list in the Oak Bar are equally impressive.  We will be back!A gorgeous hotel with a very well trained staff ~ Our room was beautiful with a wonderful view of the capital.  The care of the hotel is meticulous.  I hope to be able to stay here again very soon!I really like this hotel. It has a wonderful atmosphere, staff is friendly, its beautifully kept and such a treat because I live in Nashville.My parents visited Nashville and stayed at the Hilton. Well, their hilton experience was rather poor to say the least. They needed a new hotel ASAP that also took dogs (few do in Nashville) so I suggested this place. When they went to check in, they were immediately upgraded to a huge suite AND given a $100 gift card which we used on dinner. Let's talk about dinner in the restraint there. Amazing appetizers. Amazing main course and the most amazing desert. But back to the hotel. The staff are super friendly, the rooms are amazing, clean and homey. All I'd ever as for in a hotel. I trusted leaving my parents here - as some of the other hotels are well, not in the best part of town. Great experience.Stayed there for a girl's weekend and the hotel lived up to its 5-star billing.  Beautiful hotel, spacious bright room with great view, huge bathroom with dual vanity sinks (god bless).  Awesome and attentive staff, helpful concierge, great location walkable to all that downtown has to offer.  They even have alternative pillow options in the closet if that's your fancy - buckwheat, memory foam, latex, or plain ol' regular ones.This is a great place and a true Nashville tradition.  I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking unique experience from yesteryear.  The Oak Bar is great but closes a bit early and the furniture is a little tired but I would pick this place over all the others for location, tradition and old school charm.You get what you pay for. This is the most beautiful hotel in Tennessee.The Hermitage Hotel is a 5 DIAMOND hotel, over 100 years old and knows exactly how to treat guests from the time you pull up to valet parking until you check out.The rooms are elegant, the beds- amazing, linens and towels are Europe's finest. We live in Nashville but have stayed at the Hermitage when my husband and I needed a weekend getaway or for a special occasion.We had our daughters 18th birthday party there hosting a group of about 20 guests. The hotel has it's own event coordinator. After a couple of calls explaining what we wanted, the celebration went exactly as planned. It was a great experience for everyone. The food is unbelievable, service could not be better. If you want to purchase any of the luxury items you'll find in your room, head to the gift shop. They carry what your heart desires. Want to be pampered? Need a special weekend? Want to be treated like royalty?Check into the Hermitage Hotel. You won't be disappointed.Loved the lobby, location and rooms. I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if the reservations hadn't been an ugly hassle. Connecting rooms were at first available, then not, then okay at check-in, then not an hour later. Made our visit stressful instead of pleasant.","Beautiful landmark hotel with top notch service and amenities.Beautiful hotel, great staff and two very good restaurants, how can it get better?  Yes, you're going to pay for what you get, but this hotel is the best of East Coast luxury with a mindful recognition that it's representing Southern traditions.  Oh yeah, the men's original art deco bathroom on the bottom floor is outrageously cool.  Ladies, have your gentlemen ensure it's vacant and sneak in there- how many bathrooms have you been to that are a frequent photo shoot locale?The lobby is beautiful, the rooms are well appointed and the staff is always very helpful.  My favorite part is the Capitol Grille and especially Oak Bar, the best spot in Nashville to hide away and have a great drink and apps.Disclaimer:  I did not stay in any of the rooms here.  I came here for a wedding reception.The Hermitage Hotel is really amazingly beautiful.  Architecture fanatics will appreciate its Beaux-Arts design that sings of old Paris gone by.  Built at the turn of the 20th century the Hermitage is one of Nashville and the South's most well known 5 star hotels.I normally wouldn't stop and write a review of a hotel that I haven't actually stayed in a room at but I did for Hermitage because the hotel staff was incredibly outstanding.  I can't even tell you the last time I was treated with such love and respect by people.  I wish this would be a national standard for any hotel regardless of its rating as the world would be a happier place.The inside area will take your breath away.  This is where the main reception was held for my friend and toward the end of the room they opened up the upstairs area with hot food like prime rib and mashed potatoes.  The food was excellent.  There was an open bar during the reception.  I asked the bar tender if he had any olives to make me a dirty martini and he did not; however without batting an eye he went downstairs to the main bar and got the ingredients to do such.  The customer service was really great.The ballroom area that they have for dancing isn't very large but comfortable enough to put a couple dozen or so small tables and chairs and set up a DJ or band.  I didn't spend any time in the downstairs bar but it reminded me a lot of the very great bar at the Driskill in Austin:  cozy, dark and beautiful.  I have heard a lot of good things about the one at the Hermitage and would love to come back and have another martini.I just want to take a minute and Thank,  Janet Kurtz and staff at The Hermitage Hotel. When we sold our home in Green Hills we wanted to celebrate our success so we decided to check into the best hotel in Nashville. Not only are they ""dog friendly"" they made special arrangements for us with a handicapped friendly room. From the moment that we arrived to the moment that we checked out it was beyond our expectations. We used room service as well as going down to the Capitol Grille for meals. All was nothing short of perfect.  The little bed that they put in our room for ""Harley"" was not to be believed and the doggie treats and bottled water put out during ""turn down"" service made us and him very happy! I cannot recommend this hotel enough to both locals and international travellers! It is one of the crown jewels of the South and worthy of a visit for a night, a weekend or a week....Thanks again for the wonderful service we received during our stay. The personalized stationary that we got was pretty special too!! xoWe had a wonderful stay at the Hermitage. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We had a red eye and arrived at the hotel about 8am. They were able to get us a room in 30 minutes. The hotel itself is beautiful the rooms are large with a large bathroom. The staff was again very friendly and helpful.A friend and I heard about this hotel before we arrived, and decided to have ourselves a little wander here, but not stay, I can only vouch for the beautiful lobby and the tiny boutique in the front of the hotel. What a beautiful space! The furniture, lighting, colors, and smells (they pump the most beautiful smell into the lobby for some reason). We nade ourselves comfortable by the warm fireplace and had ourselves a nice little chat. We did a bit of window shopping in the boutique, which actually had a couple dresses and jewelry that I tried very hard not to buy. It's definitely worth a stop if you're in the area. A bit of history, a bit of beauty.Wow. All I can say is wow. A stay in this place was a complete treat from the curb, to the room, and until I got my keys from the valet to leave. There is nothing that I could suggest they could do to have made my stay any better. I am a sucker for manners in the business place, and (as expected from such caliber of a hotel) everything was yes, sir/ma'am, right away sir. ""Have a good day"" this, ""how was your dinner"" that. The room itself was great. Comfortable beds, clean sheets, and the best part of the room was bathroom. Double granite sinks, Tub complete with a bookrest, and a wonderful separate shower. I also enjoyed the mini bar here, as most do not tickle my fancy. The proximity to the Mall and other cool sites around downtown was great, and I will definitely return here when I hear Nashville's beckoned call.Absolutely beautiful historic hotel, impeccable service.  I cannot come up with anything that could have been better!  My husband and I stopped in with no reservation.  Not only were we in luck, we got a top floor corner junior suite overlooking the Capitol.  The room was so nice, we skipped going downtown for dinner and ordered room service.  The bathroom...marble double vanity and shower, separate soaking tub with a flat-panel television, over-sized towels, and separate ""water closet"" (that would be toilet room for simple folk).  I was saddened to come home to my own bathroom after that.Aside from the usual amenities you expect from a full-service hotel (fitness center, spa, business services, etc), there is turn down service, three additional types of pillows stored in the closet if you don't care for down. luxurious bedding and bath products, afternoon tea (missed it darn it!), choice of newspaper delivery, and the list goes on.  The hotel even offers a bath concierge-they will draw your bath to your desired temperature and allow you to select your salts-or rose petals!  They are so damn service oriented, they might take a bath with you if you ask.  They also take pets and offer special services to them as well.  Crazy!My husband really blew it with this one.  We fly into Nashville about once a year.  He better find discounted plane tickets to make up for my future stays here.  It is expensive, but so worth it.From the moment we walked into the hotel we were always addressed by our names.  The concierge service could not have been more helpful.  Try the in-house restaurant, Capital Grill.  High end service and food ( this restaurant is NOT part of the national chain by the same name). While the room rates are a little pricey, you get old world charm and large suites.  Enjoy!I think the front desk staff could use some customer service training. It's simply not polite for them to answer the phone while guests are waiting. Also, they are quite slow. They should be great for the money they charge.Check out the world famous Men's bathroom! Great for some fun photos! Cool bar too, but it gets PACKED for Happy Hour so get there early. I didn't stay at the Hotel itself but I will for sure next time I go to Nashville!Worth visiting while in Nashville. Have to get a drink at the downstairs bar as well.The Hermitage Hotel was beautiful! It was a great location to the touristy streets (walking distance) which was really nice. The staff was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and and courteous. The hotel was beautiful and they have a really neat little ""history"" area with tid bits from the past. Here's where I give the hotel 4 out of 5 and not 5 stars. We sat by the fire and had some wine and ordered food as well. The menu was okay, for my allergies there wasn't much for me to choose from. They were really nice trying to accommodate me but compared to their ""sister"" hotels, the menu was limited. At 2:00AM and 4:00AM there were couples SCREAMING and fighting in the hall. No one came upstairs to stop the fight which was frustrating. Best part of the hotel, the cookies during the day and the muffins in the morning, delicious!!I've had breakfast here twice when in town on business, and dinner once, when my wife and I went to the theater. I found nothing to criticize whatsoever. The staff were attentive without being obsequious. The food was excellent, portions reasonable. The ambience was good, although I would avoid sitting next to a large, noisy party - it's old, there's not any noise cancellation in the dining room. Highly recommend listening to your waitron's opinions, as every one I've had was knowledgeable about the menu, the history of items on it, and the area. I haven't stayed in the hotel itself, but I understand that like most historic hotels, the rooms are mainly small and dark. It's quite expensive for Nashville, too. But I'd come here any time for breakfast.One note. If you are used to East Coast style ""iced coffee"", be aware that the iced coffee here is more of a milk drink with a dollop of coffee, and some ice in it. I found that a little odd, but I'm sure it's just me, since everyone else in the dining room who was drinking it was enoying it.The ""sock sausage"" is very smokey, so if you don't like smoked meats, this is not for you. The link sausage is fabulous. The grits are great and they'll add cheese on request - they even brought mine on the side. Fresh juices, too. I'd recommend any time.Southern hospitality at its finest! Close to Broadway, beautiful, spacious rooms, outstanding service, and amazing food (Capitol Grill) - I didn't want to leave!What a beauty!The Hermitage Hotel is not only grand but also very comfortable which is a combination that can be tough to pull off but they do it with such quiet grace. My review is based off of attending the Share Our Strength benefit dinner here last weekend that was executed without a hitch. This is such a spectacular option to hosts small to large scale events such as weddings, special receptions, and fundraisers. The staff is professional and friendly while the spaces within this hotel offer up elegance and sophistication. I truly appreciated the banquet servers too as they were very discreet and accommodating in ensuring that both my date (vegetarian) and my (vegan) diets were honored although the slated menu for the evening didn't reflect those options. I am so impressed that I am tempted to treat myself to a weekend here to unwind and be pampered although it's just a few miles from my home!TIP: This is a solid option to offer up to out of town guests as it is located near many attractions.I have only ever shot weddings here, but the hotel is superb. Very well run, the staff is very helpful, super clean, and I'm assuming is worth the price you pay.This hotel is superior. Very clean and large room and bathroom with tons of amenities, like TV in bathroom, evening delivery of cookies and water to room, luxury towels and bedding, excellent in room coffee, friendly staff, etc. I highly recommend you stay here if visiting Nashville!The Hermitage Hotel is Tennessee's only Forbes Five Star and AAA Five Diamond hotel., this hotel is over 100 years old and was beautifully renovated just a few years ago. Even if your a local, it's worth stopping in just for the historic value. Located smack downtown Nashville, within walking distance to TPAC (Tennessee Performing Arts Center), The War Memorial Auditorium, Tennessee State Capitol, the Bicentennial Mall, Bridgestone Arena and the Nashville Honkey Tonk District, 2nd avenue &amp; Broadway.The Capitol Grille is nestled inside as well as The Oak Room Lounge.What a treat it was to stay at The Hermitage Hotel from the moment you arrive the staff is inviting, friendly &amp; extremely helpful.  I can not imagine visiting Nashville and staying anywhere other than this hotel.  My brother recommended The Hermitage Hotel assuring me that I will love it he was right on.  It was so difficult packing up to leave this gem of a hotel.  Avoid the time &amp; energy it takes shopping hotels book this one immediately you will be so glad you did.Thank you to the fantastic staff you made a rainy weekend in Nashville seem sunny.","Overall: A fantastic hotel experience.Rooms: The room I stayed in had a great view of the Capitol. The bed/pillows were extremely comfortable (trust me, i'm picky) and everything seemed very clean. I consider cleanliness a paramount for hotels right now given the bed bug paranoia out there. The bathroom had a big soaking tub and a separate stand up shower.Food/Drink: I didn't eat at the Capitol Grille but have heard great things about it. It's not affiliated with the national chain. The little hotel bar downstairs is great for a drink/relax session. It's all dark wood/leather chairs. The drinks are expensive, but taste great and I definitely didn't feel cheated out of liquor. I give my thumbs up to the pear martini.Service: Fantastic. The desk attendant was very polite &amp; even opened the little store when we had a last minute need (even though it was midnight!)Location: Far enough off Lower Broadway (where the bars/honky tonks are located) to be quiet but close enough to walk if you're wanting to get the full Nashville experience.Cost: Start at about $260 and go up to $1,500This hotel is the real deal. We stayed a night to celebrate an anniversary and it beat the heck out of past travel anniversary celebrations. The service was impeccable, everyone pronounced our last name right (silent letters - impressive), and the room amenities are a cut above. We had dinner out, but Oak Bar is the perfect spot for a nightcap and breakfast at the Capitol Grille was tasty. The renovations are beautifully done. Worth every penny.Fantastic hotel!!! Extremely charming. Great location and extremely friendly staff. The location was perfect. We were far enough from the main strip so that we didn't hear the noise yet we were in walking distance from all of the fun. The bathrooms were very nice - separate door for toilet, double sinks, tv, and nice bath tub. Rooms were very clean.Again the ever road warrior, I found myself in Nashville this time. Semi lost and arriving way past the witching hour, you can imagine how surprised I was to walk into this outstanding building.I was a) surprised b) in awe.A) Because I knew we never stayed in places this nice for the project I was currently on.B) Aesthetically it was an olympic adventure for my ever so tired eyes. A moment before I couldn't of kept them open but from the time I walked into the lobby I felt as if I had to take it all in.The staff was divine, the rooms were exquisite, and I can't wait to go back. I don't even need a reason, but if you do:Spa bathrooms with traysMolton Brown toiletriesMarble showersTowel warmersPlasmas off tubBuckwheat, Down, or Tempur Pedic pillowsSlippers, Robes, and special arrival packagesI would go on, but you get the idea...The Hermitage Hotel is truly a classic and easily the best hotel in Nashville.  The rooms might not be as big as some hotels in this price range but the decor and service more than make up for that.  As you may have heard, the men's bathroom in the lobby is really an attraction.  The rooms are comfortable, well-appointed, and classy.Like most other high-end hotels, the service is very attentive and accommodating.  They help when they can but know when guests don't want help.  How many times have you had hotel staff grab a small bag and carry it a few feet then look at you expecting a tip?  Won't happen here.  That said, if you're cheap, this isn't the place for you - unless you're on an expense account!The location is great too.  It is walking distance to many Nashville attractions, including the Honky Tonks, Country Music Hall of Fame, State Capital, State Museum, and even the Colosseum.  Upper floors and the rooms on the north side have great views of Downtown or Capitol Hill.The Hermitage is truly worthy of its 5-star status.  I've never stayed at a hotel where i really couldn't point a finger at some flaw or another.  It's a class act.  Some of my favorite details about the hotel included the selection of pillows (buckwheat, memory foam, etc), the luxurious bathrobes, the plasma TV in the bathroom, the super-fast high-speed FREE Internet connection, etc.  For dining, the Oak Bar is a great setting for a drink and an app. The main dining room has a wonderful menu and great service. I highly recommend trying both during your visit (I also hear taking Afternoon Tea is also a great experience, but I didn't try that).Lastly, if you think you can't afford this place, try <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a> during mid-week or off-season and you can definitely find a deal.  It's no more expensive than the Hilton, Sheraton, etc. and definitely has a lot more character.  Put it on your list if you're in Nashville- you won't regret it.This historic hotel is absolutely gorgeous. The staff is wonderful, helpful and friendly. I didn't stay here, but I did have afternoon tea and dinner here at the Capitol Grille (separate review). Afternoon tea: There's a menu on the hotel's website. Huge selection of hot teas and 5 or so varieties of the iced tea. We had white ambrosia and the iced white ginger pear tea. Delicious! The full spread is $21 per person and you get:* one tea of your choice (with as many refills as you like) * 3-tiered tray of finger tea sandwiches (caprese, cucumber, turkey, salmon)* Chocolate covered strawberries - mini balls of crispy chocolate covered half. Lemon tarts covered in raspberries. Apple pastry. AMAZING!!!!!!! * Scones with Devonshire cream and strawberry preserves Check out the men's art deco bathroom outside the restaurant. It's lovely. I posted a picture of the plaque outside the restroom explaining it's significance.Rarely does a last minute hotel reservation rise to the level of perfection but our stay at the Hermitage did!  From the telephone reservation to the bellman , front desk clerk and charming Justin who got us to our room, showed us the views and all we needed to know about the hotel .  The hotel arranged massages as we had been driving all day and then made dinner reservations at the Capitol grille.  ( the meal was good not perfect) This is a beautiful hotel with an exceptional staff. I would return to Nashville just for a night here!Great hotel in a town that I don't believe has many great hotels. As a matter of fact, this may be the only one.The lobby is really picturesque. It is one-of-a-kind.The rooms were nice, spacious and comfortable all the way around. The walls are a little thin. There was a yippy dog down the hall that was making a lot of noise (dogs don't belong in hotels, sorry!). The bed creaked excessively when you moved. Other than that, it was exceptional.The staff was courteous, attentive and helpful. The girl at reception had an accent (russian?) so thick I  understood about a quarter of what she said. Not a problem.I can't see staying anywhere else in Nashville.Smiley face and a star.The nicest rooms and best service in Nashville, and among the best anywhere!They capture the class and sophistication of a bygone era with grace and competence without it coming across as pretentious or arrogant. Stay here if you get the chance!One of my favorite things to do in this town is to take beer in the Oak Bar. The atmosphere is dark, warm and enfolding. They bring you salty snacks. I know, everyone says this ('cause it's true!)~ but the staff is hospitable and you always feel welcome.I've only ever been to three or four other Teas in my life, but the Hermitage Afternoon Tea goes down as my favorite, partly because of the gorgeous lobby. Great tea selection too: the white ambrosia was the unanimous table pick but I liked the black currant. The scones with cream were sublime.Top notch hotel.  The lobby is large, yet cozy with many seating areas and a fireplace.  Very helpful staff who was there to help with anything we needed.  Large room with huge bathroom.  Lots of nice touches....coffee and muffins in the lobby in the morning, cookies in the afternoon, free wifi, bottled water to grab on your way out to sightsee....Hope to go back to Nashville and definitely will stay at the Hermitage again!The hotel is stunning and I am disappointed that I only got to visit the lobby. We came here for happy hour and they lead us to this dark, crowded bar which was packed with people who appeared to just get off of work. I had the ruby red cocktail and it was on of the best cocktails I ever had. Our bartender was super nice and kept us supplied with ranch popcorn and tomato flat bread. I am really glad I got to try the place but was really surprised by the happy hour prices as they seemed pretty high. I was also disappointed to learn that they didn't offer the cava, or any wine flights, by the glass. I guess I am lucky to be in California because that is never a problem here. but that is a minor complaint for such a great place.The best!  The service and rooms were gorgeous, large bathroom and great tub.  We had a very relaxing and fun getaway.I have stayed here many times on business and once on a vacation. It does not get better than the hermitage. The staff is amazing - i think the room service attendant even knows me by name, the bellman give great restaurant suggestions - basically everything is top notch. I love the bathtubs and the molton brown bubble bath - nothing compares. I moved to Nashville now and I am sure I will make it to the oak bar for the onion bisque very soon.I cannot comment on the lodging, as I did not stay in the hotel.  I attended a business dinner here, and the food was terrible.  I can't even explain how disappointed I was in this meal.  The hotel itself is beautiful and historic -- that's the only reason I'll put 2 stars in this review.  As for the food, the service was quite slow and nothing was remotely close to hot.  The salad wasn't very fresh, and the dressing was too bitter.  The mashed potatoes serving was literally no more than a Tablespoon.  The beef filet was an excellent cut of meat, but served as rare as I've ever seen meat served.  Normally when you serve a large audience, you would serve the meat medium.  I could even see medium rare for this cut of meat.  If it's really great service they may take individual preferences.  But there was no choice offered, and it was beyond RARE!  The veggie sides were cold and also maybe 2 bites worth.  Desserts were also tiny little cups and nothing worth writing about -- and the coffee was served about 15 minutes after we asked for it with the dessert.  I'm glad I didn't pay for this meal, although I did have to pay a babysitter $25 since my wife attended with me that evening.  We didn't get our money's worth.What a beautiful place. My favorite part of the hotel is the nice big comfortable rooms. Very nice rooms.This is a beautiful property. We called requesting a handicapped room specifically a roll in shower for my father, I was assured this was available.  Our room had a tub shower not roll in - not what we were told. The hotel told us we could move to another room and I could sleep on a rollaway. Really - a rollaway for 300 a night? We moved to another hotel.Beautiful room!! Amazing customer service. Great in house restaurant and bar!!  Had one of the best hotel stays of my life here.  Service was second to none.  Can't say enough about all the little touches that made it an amazing tripMy husband and I recently got married and I will say that by far the best wedding decision we made was to get married at The Hermitage Hotel in downtown Nashville!  Every aspect was top notch, from the planning to the ceremony and reception, down to the ease of checking out the following day.  We received the 5 star service you would expect at a much more reasonable price than you may think.  It was worth every dime!  Kimberly is a dream to work with and everyone on staff makes sure your experience is peaceful.  They think of everything so you can fully enjoy the most wonderful day of your life!  And, it is a GORGEOUS venue!","Surprisingly, a limited menu, especially considering this is a 5 star hotel!! Just goes to show what hotel dining is all about.I give them 5 stars because they are the only 5 star hotel in town. If you are looking for old world Southern hospitality mingled with some amazingly beautiful historic architectural detail than this is your place. I am mostly here to mention the Menes bathroom downstairs. I really hate public bathrooms and I can't think of much I find more repulsive than the men's public restrooms but my god this place is something. It has a shoe shining stand in it. More importantly when the hotel was restored the kept the art deco design motif that's been in there for ages. This is where they say dignitaries including presidents conducted business in this very bathroom. It's been featured nationally on the travel channel. If you are looking for an off the beaten path thing to show an out of town guest that captures the history of Nashville then I say take them for a drink and a peruse of the Hermitage bathroom.The architecture is wonderful. The fact that this hotel is 100 years old and has housed so many well known people is amazing.  The Oak Bar is something to experience, cocktails and apps par excellence!! You never know who you might run into.This is reputably the best and most luxurious hotel in town and it's not hard to understand why.  The Hermitage has been around for about a century and still stands as richly elegant and beautifully articulated as it did when it was built.  It was purchased and renovated in the early 2000's, mostly updating the guest rooms.  The lobby is covered in the Italian marble it was originally built with and the detail work on the architecture is astounding.  It's a bit pricey to stay there, you're looking at rooms going for about several hundred dollars a night depending on the season and how booked they are, but if you're bank account will allow it, I wholeheartedly recommend staying here.  Even if you are short on funds, you should at least go visit the hotel.  It's one of the more beautiful buildings in Nashville, both inside and out and it's regularly featured on the Travel Channel.It's located in the heart of Downtown just up the street from the Capitol, and is in convenient walking distance to a lot of cool sights and happenings in Nashville.  They have a fantastic restaurant in the lobby called the Capitol Grille that's great if you're looking for a fancy place to have a date night or even somewhere to impress your business client.  They also serve holiday buffets here, which is a great way to experience the hotel and its amenities without having to stay the night.A stunning hotel. The lobby took my breath away. The ambiance was very nice, the lighting perfect, and the restaurant immaculate. The menu was slightly limited, but had attractive options. My Coq Au Vin was surprisingly overcooked. The staff kept confusing my friend and I for each other. A hostess greeted my friend as me and we were both given the wrong meals and our validated valet tickets were reversed. See what I remember from the evening instead of how wonderful the reason we were celebrating was? Oh...and they have a really really hot doorman.I LOVE it here!  Definitely one of the nicest places I have ever stayed, and it spoiled me.  We stayed here during our honeymoon, and it was certainly one of the highlights.Staff is SO friendly and kind to everyone.  For breakfast at their restaurant, they made me a special vegan plate that left me feeling full (a tall order at most places for breakfast!).Our room was beautiful, so elegant and spacious.  Like Heather C., we stayed in the room as much as possible, because we didn't want to leave.  I loved Nashville before, and I love it even more now.The best.  I loved this hotel.  It's just awesome.  One of the most luxurious  places I have ever stayed.  Walked to the nightlife, restaurants, and the country music hall of fame.  The Oak bar was great. Had dinner there and should have shared with my wife because we each could not finish our meal, so much food and delicious. The staff gets 5/5 stars, as they were spectacular.I was fortunate to stay here four nights a few years ago during a conference.  It's awesome.  The beds are so comfortable and the rooms were very clean.  They left warm cookies next to my bed each night with a little note telling me ""sweet dreams the weather tomorrow will be .... "" and warm sleepers and robes too!  It was quite magical.  Since then I have returned to the hotel for a special event once a year (not staying there unfortunately) and the place has not lost a step.  Catered food is great.  The scotch selection downstairs was great too.  I hope some day I can afford to stay here again!Fabulous hotel.  Very comfortable.  Everything was 6 stars! Expensive, yes; but worth it.You have to forgive my hard scoring.  It is partially a reflection of my own bad decisions.  You see, this place is VERY expensive.  But I was unfamiliar with the city, and wanted to be sure the place I went to was awesome.  And yes, it is everything you'd ever want.  All the good things said about this place are true.  But I overpaid, and I will take it out on them in their rating.  So, in a sense, it is a 5.  But you can certainly have just as good a time at the many other places, only a few blocks away, at a third of the cost.  Easily.We stayed here two Easters ago for a long weekend. Our room was really spacious and we loved coming ""home"" every evening to a fully turned down room, complete with bedside cookies and waters and classical music softly playing in the background. We also enjoyed the afternoon refreshments in the lobby and found the valet parking guys out front to be very polite, even though we were constantly in and out. The bathroom was very large and had Molton Brown bath products.We also ordered in room service for Easter sunday brunch and everything was delivered quickly and cooked well. The biscuits were great.I've never eaten here, I've never stayed here, but I have been in the men's bathroom. (Say Huh?) And yes, I may have a bi-gender name, but I am female. The men's bathroom located in the hotel's restaurant has two very interesting and noteworthy amenities. First off all, there is an entrance to a tunnel that supposedly leads to the Capitol building across the street. Rumor has it, that's how former politicians would get ladies of the night to visit them discreetly. Secondly, the bathroom is famous for it's 1970 art deco. There's even a little plaque explaining all this. It's not abnormal to find a group of girls wandering in to see both of these aspects. Be careful though, my friends and I totally confused some foreign gentleman.One of the most beautiful places I've ever stayed. Exquisite. True Southern gentility. Breakfast in the grille was truly one of the best I've ever eaten. Superlative.Stayed here in December '10. Highly recommend The Hermitage Hotel! They do everything right...including the little thing. If you are planning a trip to Nashville, The Hermitage is the place to stay!Stunning and I mean STUNNING stay here over the holidays/new years. We stayed in a suite that was absolutely gorgeous. The service was IMPECCABLE from the moment I stepped out of the car. They valeted our car, escorted us up the stairs and the front desk greeted us with champagne and already knew the name of the reservation (from mentioning it at the front door). We were checked in and our baggage arrived shortly after we arrived to our beautiful suite (a present from the boyfriend for our first New Years together). We had reservations downstairs at the restaurant and took us (even though we were late). The new years dinner was absolutely to die for too (their duck confit is infamous and rightfully so). When we got back upstairs to get ready to go my boyfriend asked if I always arranged my makeup so neatly. What? Never. I walked into the bathroom and while we were gone they had come in, hung up our stuff and had neatly arranged my makeup on the counter on a towel in the bathroom that I'm sure might be larger than my bedroom at home. (Actually I'm sure it is.) We had some champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries that we had ordered waiting for us and took a bubble bath in the jet tub large enough for the brady bunch to fit in. Unfortunately we were watching TV while the jets were going and blew a fuse. Luckily they fixed it after we called.We were beat by the time we came back and slipped into bed. I unfortunately lost my boyfriend to the west wing of the bed (HUGE bed) in his drunken stuper of tossing and turning but it was fine. I was exhausted. The beds were the only mediocre thing (they were large but not the softest). The next morning we ordered room service (after leaving our orders on the knob outside) and everything was correct and they were prompt in bringing things we forgot to make note of to ask for on the form.I could live like that...but I'd become overweight, spoiled and overly pampered. I could actually be okay with that if a proposition was made by The Hermitage. That place is BEAUTIFUL. Highly recommended if you want a great stay in Nashville (also close to Broadway and the Ryman/Opry to honky tonk it up!)Fantastic for a special occassion restaurant.  portions are perfect, flavorful.  Very tasty.AND CHECK OUT THE DECO BATHROOMS- they are a must-see.This hotel is part of history.  The lobby is beautiful old world.  The restaurant  (capital grill )is like you wan't to believe the old south was.  The rooms are good sized and very comfortable.  Service is as good as you would wan't it.  Don't miss visiting the men's room on the ground floor and read the plaque outside. In fact the restaurant hostess will give you a tour,Been here several times over the past years. The food has gotten progressively worse. Very disappointing. The setting is beautiful, too bad the menu is weak and the preparation lacks creativity.I can't say enough about how great the experience here was!  Had a wedding here and things couldn't have been better from the valet services to the food!   Great location, great service all around, and a great venue!  If you are in need of a high end place to stay or place to host a large party this is it!  Rooms are very nice too, pricey but worth it with the service you get here!I had a chance to eat at the Hermitage while visiting our legislators in Nashville and I was really impressed!  For one thing, the restaurant is gorgeous and has some spectacular architecture-don't know how old the building is but really nice.  I had the grilled pimento and fried green tomato sandwich with the slaw and yummy!  Everyone I ate with enjoyed their meal-the only negative was they have one fishy smelly dish that whenever the waiters walked by with it, we were all thinking ""phew, I'm glad I didn't order that!""  Very nice for lunch, will definitely return when in town.","['update', 'review', 'five', 'stars', 'forgotten', 'available', 'express', 'fine', 'hotels', 'darn', 'think', 'back', 'first', 'visit',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/aloft-nashville-west-end-nashville,Aloft Nashville West End,3.0,$$,68,"I've heard great things about the Aloft chain but they're part of the Starwood Brand and I'm usually a Marriott or Hilton customer. This time, however, the Aloft was in the place I wanted to be, they were at a competitive price point and I also needed to have at least one night so that now I am earning free Starpoints after I linked my Uber account to Starwood. It's green lights all around.Check-in was solid with a friendly valet and a great check-in clerk. I was on the elevator to my room in just moments. Excellent, aside from the $28 charge for both self-park and valet park.The room was very nice. Quite massive. Like enough space that you could put a small two bedroom apartment in here. Long, wide and very roomy with the usual furniture and a window out to the street.Hallway and neighbor noise was minimal. Street noise was significant with loud engines and sirens and other random nonsense. I was only on the 4th floor. Maybe it would have been better higher up.The bathroom was similarly large and spacy with a lot of wasted space. I do need someone to explain the ""let's not have a door on the shower so the floor gets all wet and slippery"" thing. As well, it gets mighty cold without a shower door or curtain to close.The room was cleaned nicely during the day but when I went to make a cup of coffee in the morning from the Keurig, both pods were decaf. Fail!Nice hotel. Good room though noisy. Coffee issue. Spending parking. It was A-OK.Being a SPG member I've stayed at numerous Alofts around the country for business and pleasure.  Seeing that this Aloft was in a great central location I thought I couldn't go wrong. Arrival was pretty cool as they had open mike night and the bar was very happening.  The interior of this Aloft is pretty much the same as all of the other ones I have stayed at - bar and snack bar on the first floor, ample seating with charging jacks, and rooms in the upper floors.  I was told that I had a handicap room and was initially excited.  However the girl at the front said to let them know the next day if I wanted to change rooms since the shower was ""weird"".The room looked similar to what I was used to - studio style.  However it smelled very moldy.  The water stains on the ceiling confirmed my suspicions.  The shower indeed was very strange as the head was only tall enough for a hobbit to shower in.  I changed rooms the next day.My second room also smelled funny although I was able to use the shower.  Overall I would say that this property is not as well maintained as the other ones I have stayed at with the rooms a little run down. I will say that the staff here are extremely friendly though.  The bartender at WXYZ lounge Lisa was awesome.   Be sure to ask her about her WWE past, she's a trip,The most frustrating thing about this hotel was the absurdly expensive parking. The location is pretty amazing though. I loved being close enough to walk around music row, but you can't truly experience all that Nashville has to over without having a car. Having to pay so much for parking every day was really frustrating. Valet and self-park are the same price which makes no sense to me. In fact, it makes more sense to self-park because you get to park closer to your room. The phone didn't work and I didn't see anything indicating that they had room service. I'm lazy on vacation and I would have appreciated that. I'm also cheap so I would have preferred having shampoo and body wash I could take home when I was done instead of the locker room style dispensers. It's true....the bathroom door is weird and slotted so anyone outside the door can hear anything. In fact the walls are super thin and we had the joy of hearing when our neighbors flushed or showered. I'm sure they were annoyed that they had to hear our ridiculous conversations.The Keuring was clutch! That thing ended up being a lifesaver for me. And the free WiFi was pretty great. I also really enjoyed that they had live music near the bar in the lobby. I liked that I didn't have to leave the hotel to hear good music (again, I get lazy on vacation).Overall, I'd stay here again....I'd just skip bringing a car and stick to using ZipCar to avoid the parking fees.Really debated whether 3 or 4 stars, but ultimately decided on 3. Pros: trendy, chic, young clientele, central location to downtown, Broadway, the gulch, etc., comfortable bed, and friendly helpful staffCons: I know it's been said before, but dim lighting. As my wife and I were getting ready, we wished we could see what we were doing. My wife had to move the iron right beside the door because that's the one direct spot in the whole room that had enough light to see the wrinkles in the clothes. Also, no complimentary breakfast, and expensive parking. We paid $30 for parking for one night. Verdict: if it had breakfast or cheaper parking, it would've easily been a 4 star. But it wasn't. I'd stay again, especially on someone else's dollar.Nice hotel. In a great location. I have a King suite that is very spacious. It has wrap around windows. Bed is very comfortable and I love the bathroom.My company put me up here for a conference. I didn't mind it but I would not choose to stay in this type of hotel. The workers were very polite and had great customer service. The room was a decent size. The only issue I had was the lighting. I had to turn on every single light in the room for me to see anything. That was definitely a con. I love the Green Choice program and I love that they reward you for it. If you choose not to get the sheets or towers changed out you get a $5 voucher for food or the bar. Overall I had a pretty positive experience but just not my type of hotel. Hotel is right near Broadway and there are a lot of decent restaurants down there.Not been there as a hotel guest but we went for the Sunday open Mic and it was fantastic! Parked the kids at the pool table in the lobby (free!) and we hung out at the bar enjoying the performances. Great performances and waaay better than those touristy honkytonks downtown, especially with kids. The bar food selection was plenty, nicely priced and actually pretty good. Try it!!I stayed here with some family that were visiting - the room they got was HUGE. Loved the layout and loved the modern look of the hotel and the room that we had. There was a Keurig, pretty paintings, cool lighting, and cozy beds. Really loved staying here - for some reason, it reminded me of a trendy Euro hotel. The staff was accommodating and friendly. It's close to downtown and Centennial Park (which is great for those who are visiting). Overall, great hotel and great location!Nice location. Friendly employees.The bathroom doors are slatted, so there's not really privacy if you're sharing the room with friends and need to use the bathroom. The towels look and feel old. Our friends were put in a room where there was a huge brown stain on the mattress. They were moved to a new room but then the next day, the hotel put another set of our friends in the mattress stain room. And guess what? The huge brown stain was still on the mattress.Overpriced.The rooms are LARGE. I think anyone can appreciate that. The fixtures, furniture and overall vibe are very ""aLoft"" -- to which, if you've ever stayed in an aLoft, you know what I mean. I loved Randy B's feedback, they're totally on point. You're either going to like the aesthetic or not. I know my parents would really not appreciate this place at all... ""community areas"" are not their thing. A pool table in the lobby, not for them. I, on the other hand, like the youthfulness of it all. It's different from my everyday hotel routine and I appreciate that. It isn't drab and it isn't old-fashioned and you know that the comforter hasn't been in service for the past 20 years. The aLoft offers valet, don't bother self-parking. You could avoid the parking fees if you found some street parking, but with the construction around the hotel that would likely be more trouble than it's worth. There's a great brunch spot right across the street -- hit them up for chicken and waffles on Sunday. Hattie B's and Chuy's are within walking distance as well -- nice!If you need to head across the highway and want to hit up Acme, snag an Uber. It'll run you about $5-6, which is cheaper than a cab.Extremely horrible service (super rude lady welcoming you). We had a king room reserved but, they told us the ""gave the room to someone who needed it"" upon our arrival and we never got an alert or phone call to tell us. Then, we could not get a refund to go somewhere else. Tried to speak to the manager but, they didn't not have one on the site. We get into our room to find a horrible view overlooking a rusty roof.. I advise staying anywhere but, here!!!It's a cave!   Not a fan, at all.  - room is way too dark.  Aloft, buy some lamps.- the nightstand has a clock from 1950...  Aloft, how about a RADIO in the rooms in ""Music City""?!?  Or at least a clock with a smartphone dock for audio speaker hook-up? - half the room is a ""nothing space"" without furnishings.  -  the showers are ""locker room like"" with soap and shampoo dispensers on the wall.  I don't want to share my toiletries with the last dozen guests and how do I know someone didn't tamper with these products?- the audio on the TV in my room didn't match the visual. Either a bad TV or bad cable/satellite service.  And TV screen too small.  Aloft, make a friend at BestBuy. - my room's view sucked. See photo.  I checked out one day earlier.  This is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at.Great hotel. Their lobby is similar to the W Hotel but without the hipster feel and house music. Free pool table, poker set, Pop art on walls, modern furniture, free wifi and a large work space desk with room 8 and plenty of electrical outlets for all your gadgets, well stocked snack bar, free lemonade(nice on a hot day), small but nice bar. Staff was insanely friendly. Location was a 30 minute walk from downtown(my dad is 2 years removed from double knee replacement surgery so you should be able to beat or match that time). Hotel is near music row and numerous restaurants and bars in West End(Hattie B's for lunch is a must for any fried chicken lover), and Vanderbilt University. Suite 816 was MASSIVE by ant standards. May have lacked luxury but made up for it in comfortability. Balcony had two tables and decent views of Downtown. Two queen beds were super comfy and pillows were heavenly. Bathroom was void of a tub but had the ever popular spacious, walk in shower. Large work area, couch, 42 tv, small walk in closet, and original art on the walls. Only minor complaints: under powered, slightly noisy AC, hate how when you check out your hit with like 3 hidden taxes(increasingly common at many a hotel), and a what seems pricey charge for valet parking in budget friendly Nashville. From other reviews I was skeptical of this hotel but I'd recommend it to all but the pickiest of travelers.<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g55229-d652981-r279426320-Aloft_Nashville_West_End-Nashville_Tennessee.html&amp;s=0ab6ef4d2bd0907876b24363038c6e8f7375fed200109fb9549ec78645dca481"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>PET FRIENDLY!  Treated my doggies like rock stars whenever we came through the lobby.They even got little doggie gift bags upon check in.Comfy beds, hip decor, good location. Only complaint: could use a bit more lighting in the room. Was kinda surprised at having to pay for parking ($28/day) but I guess there's no cheap parking in Nashville. Even so, good location - close to a lot of cool things to do. It's a 5 buck Uber trip to the heart of Music CityOk so the hotel was fine, but the parking was weird. They have self parking and valet parking. Both were $30. Seemed exorbitant for what you get. I self parked and its difficult to get to your room. If you valet thats fine as well, but I like to come and go as I please and it seems they have one valet guy on duty. And I didnt see a guy really late at night. Anyways it was weird. The hotel is about a mile from all the bars in the downtown district and about the same to the gulch. So its walkable if you want to spend 20 minutes. The hotel was kind of expensive as well for being off the main strip. No shower door so water got all over the floor. Hotel was clean and nice, and of course alofts are a tad quirky, so I may stay here again if I get a good rate, but that parking fee was ridiculous, so may stay away.This place is a solid three for the accommodations but definitely a 5 for staff friendliness. They are so kind and sweet. And so willing to help you figure your way out around Midtown Nashville.  This area is growing and there is a cute area walking distance.  Rooms are spacious. No real complaints other than my Keurig not working in the room but there is free coffee in the lobby every morning!My partner and I attempted to attend an event hosted here in the Penthouse. There is only one way to get up to the Penthouse -- a single elevator -- and for the hundred or so people going to the film premier after party this caused quite a problem. When it was finally our turn to get on, the elevator stopped working, trapping us inside a full elevator of people. Our phones had no service inside, and despite numerous calls using the phone in the elevator, the receptionist did not manage to convince us that we were safe or that help was on the way. We were told after our second or third call to push the firetruck button. The fire department arrived sometime after 1 a.m. and pulled us one by one to safety, through the crack in the elevator shaft. We missed the entire after party, and everyone who had been trapped inside was pouring with sweat and could barely breathe from the lack of air. At least one person in the elevator had gone into shock. However, no hotel staff was there to greet us after this emergency, with water, an apology or any other type of aid. It was as if they completely did not care. When my partner complained and asked the front desk for some water, he was told that they were busy attending to their receptionist who had answered our calls and who ""was crying"" as a result of the situation. She clearly had not been trained on how to handle an emergency and it was presented as if her inability to handle the problem took precedent over the 9 people to had actually been a victim of the emergency. My partner, a veteran and former firefighter, has attempted to contact the management about their lack of customer service, and the need for better training and emergency protocol, but was told that they would not communicate with him on this matter because they ""do not consider him to be directly affected by the situation.""  A quick search of other online reviews for this hotel will confirm that safety is just one of many areas where Aloft displays their complete lack of regard for the customer's experience. Choose any other hotel if you want to have a nice stay or event.We stayed at Aloft after the Sheraton overbooked the night of the George Jones tribute concert. I'm not sure of the price for the night because Sheraton took care of our bill since we had already paid for our original reservation.Overall, we had a good experience. Staff was friendly and check in/ out went smoothly. The decor is ""hip"" and ""edgy"" but it was still cute. The room was very nice, I loved the floors! The bean bag made little sense to me but it wasn't that much of an eyesore. Bathroom was nice and I could see why other reviews were unhappy with no shower door. Also, they had a decent selection of snacks and drinks to purchase or you could go to the restaurant attached to the hotel. We didn't partake in breakfast but it seemed the selection was decent.Valet was confusing at first because GPS brings you to the front of the building on West End and you need to go down 18th and turn around to get in the valet line. Parking, valet and self park, are the same price so it's just easier to valet. The valet guys were quick and also helped us get a cab fairly quickly.So overall this hotel is nice and aesthetically pleasing. It seems like it's probably a bit pricey since you are paying more so for the ambiance and the area. We enjoyed our one night stay and the service was awesome.Stayed here because it's a dog friendly hotel. The room is nice but the phone is broken. The girl at the desk is straight up rude and needs a course in manners. Good thing I'm only staying one night. Not exactly the southern hospitality one would hope for.I really wanted to like the Aloft, but the best thing about it was the staff and I don't stay at a hotel to room with them lol. Many of the reviews are sadly very true, the floors in the rooms are laminate and peeling up, the shower had no door and the water went everywhere all in front of the toilet, the curtains had to be fiddled with several times to block out the light. The toilet seat did not fit on top of the toilet correctly so you would be sitting on the seat and touching the porcelain bowl at the same time. Design flaw or just gross?I guess when you stay at a hotel you really crave simple creature comforts and I didn't really feel like I had those at this particular location. I understand the conceptual design of the Aloft and gave it a shot, and sad to say, I would rather stay at a Holiday Inn Express. I did in fact pack my bags and I am moving to Union Station mainly for location, but also because I know the hotel very well and a room became available.Pluses: The bed was comfy and the sheets were clean, bathroom counter was clean and Bliss products are always nice. The room was VERY spacious (almost too spacious) with two beanbags. Decent view of downtown and there is a pantry in the hotel lobby where you can buy snacks and drinks.","Have you ever went for a drink of water in the middle of the night, only to spit it out because it turned out to be Sprite? The taste isn't bad; it's just that you weren't expecting it.That's how I feel about this property - it's much different than other Aloft properties, but that's also a-okay. Until very recently, this hotel was a Hotel Indigo and though it may pass as all Aloft in the lobby, once you get to your room you might find yourself scratching your head, 'did I check into the wrong hotel?'. The room is very nicely-appointed - in fact, it's a much more sophisticated design scheme than the typical Aloft style. Better linens, hardwood floors, Keurig coffeemaker, chic lamp... and, the water pressure is strong enough to get your hair squeaky clean and the bathroom comes equipped with a freakishly-strong hairdryer. I approve!Despite all the niceties, something is still lacking... part of the reason why I really enjoy staying at Starwood properties is their employee culture positively impacts every one of my stays. I realize the transition just happened several months ago, but there's still some lingering customer service issues (there was a mix-up on their part in which they only booked me 1 night instead of 2, though I had the email confirmation) and a certain warmth is missing. For just a few bucks more, you could stay at the Hutton across the street and get an A+ boutique hotel experience. Though I love my SPG points, the savings aren't deep enough to justify a ho-hum stay.Sorry guys - I generally adore Aloft properties but this one is just a little off.I booked here for my boyfriend and I. The valet at the side of the building was a little weird and pretty pricy however so is self park. Check-in was great. Really nice lobby. Cool vibe and decor. Perhaps a bit on the dark side though. We had a king room and were disappointed. Small, not a great view, dirty windows, not super clean bathroom. Plus the air vent rattled a lot and the room smelled very chemical. The front desk was kind enough to immediately show us something else which unfortunately was also not great. The king rooms were disappointing. The double rooms had a view and were much larger. We would have been happy with this except the beds were a bit small to share. We ended up getting our prepaid reservation refunded and stayed at the Sheraton downtown instead. A+ to aloft on customer service! Unfortunately the rooms just didn't suffice for our needs.Way over priced at $279, tax and fees $354. Not what I am accustomed to for the price point. Printers in costumer office space didn't work, staff did allow us to use printer at front desk. The whole place is in need of an update, looking weathered and wore. A price of $129 a night would be close to acceptable.Don't do it!I booked a trip with aloft for 12 girls on a bachelorette. We booked two rooms and a suite. A week before I arrived I filled out a credit card authorization. We requested our rooms early because of our flights and we wanted to do some decorating. They were able to get us in early but not really. When we got in the first room the fridge needed replacing so they sent someone up to do that. Then in our suite they had to fix the patio panels (?) and a light. That same light went out 10 minutes after we were in the room. So after being delayed a couple hours for that we found out the phone was broken also. They were very accommodating and polite but there were so many issues! With just the lights being on the room blew a fuse at one point during our big bachelorette gathering and games. Too top it off we specifically checked to make sure my card was on file and they still charged the girl who booked the rooms! When I called to explain the issues they offered nothing but to recharge my card. It's a cool hotel but the hip parts of it don't make up for the issues.Unlike the ALOFT  18mls south on 65 in Franklin, TN this one time INDIGO Hotel does not compare. Not clean, trashy, pool table in lobby.....H E L L O !! Give me a break.Location too far from restaurants, bars nightlife also a little 'OFF' when the sun goes down. So, to cut to the chase. Do Not Stay here way too much money for hotel class &amp; or location. Quite a shame as it used to be rather EDGY.Ending on a good note. HANNAH, at reception an absolute delight. Way too classy &amp; professional  to be employed by this hotel.I was in Nashville for work and my client booked this hotel for us.  Hotel: ok, this hotel has its flaws, but all in all it was an awsome stay.  The pros: Easy business centerOutside of all the downtown traffic.Convenient snack bar in the lobby.  This came in handy multiple times, and if you forgo house keeping you get $5 buck in credit that you can use towards snackies!Shipping Packages:  We had pelican cases and other gear shipped to the hotel, even a huge package that was freighted there and they not only held it for us but helped me load it all to our van.  After our work event they took care of our cases after we left to be picked up by UPS.  GREAT SERVICE!  Also, there is a 24hr FedEx down the street.Location:  This hotel is right next to Music row.  I'm not sure why other yelpers say that it's far from restaurants.  There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the area that you can easily walk too.Parking:  If you have a car it's $25 overnight, If you have a large van that doesn't fit in the parking garage talk to concierge and they'll help you out.This is not my favorite Aloft hotel that I have ever stayed in (and I have stayed in a few). The walls are thin (which we discovered thanks to the guys next door who talked loudly  and for an hour after getting in at 3am - yawn!). It seemed a little dirty to me. The location was a little funky. We were just staying one night as a stopover on our drive home from summer vacation, so we didn't care that much, though. We did love the bean bag and I thought the shower had awesome water pressure!Anyway all of that aside, I should only give it 3 stars at best but I'm giving it more because of the valet when we left - Goose was his name. We were up early, ready to hit the road for a 7 hour drive home with our three young kids when Goose pulled our car around and it had a FLAT TIRE. Ugh! Goose was beyond helpful. He quickly found an air pump to get it inflated enough to drive down the street to Firestone. He was cheerful and energetic, especially with our kids who were obviously getting antsy. He helped us get through a frustrating experience and he was just awesome. Thank you Goose and best of luck to you!Have you ever wanted to stay in a Real World house circa 1998? Nostalgic for your NYU dorm room? Curious about living in an outdated IKEA catalogue? Then by all means, book this hotel! But if you are mentally over the age of 21, stay far, far away.There were two good things about this place: the location, and the water pressure in our prison-style open shower. The valet guys are also up to snuff. Other than that, I can think of nothing redeeming about this stay except for the moment we pulled away in the car.First and foremost, know that this is a glorified hostel. I'm not sure what the W brand of hotels is trying to pull over on people, but it is not a similar product. I've noticed that in the customer service responses to reviews, they seem to be pushing the ""trendy, modern, urban"" angle, but this place is none of those things. A crazy color scheme, laminate flooring, terrible art, and a pool table populated by frat boys doesn't equal trendy or urban. It just equals cheap. We're in the 20-30 target demographic for ""trendy, urban"" and we didn't even like it. If I were an older business traveler staying on points, I'd be out for blood.The rooms themselves are completely baffling. Why would you ever put a weird bean bag in a room and expect anyone who isn't in high school to use it as a chair? Why wouldn't you put a solid door on the bathroom? Why the paper thin walls so that you can hear every utterance from people in the next room or the hallway? Was this place designed by a high schooler who won a contest? I'd be willing to overlook everything if the customer service staff stepped up to the plate, but surprise - they didn't. It began when we arrived and were ignored promptly so that the one employee could google something for her friend. The cleaning man left trash on the floor and didn't even touch the bathroom sink or counters. And the kicker: at 11:00 on New Years Eve, our toilet stopped working after a #1 flush. When we asked someone to come up, he handed us a plunger in a plastic bag and walked away. Happy New Year to you, too!We will never be coming back to another Aloft hotel, and plan to tell everyone we possibly can how weird and awful this glorified summer camp bunk is. If you want to stay in a real hotel, go elsewhere. Anywhere. At the very least, this company should make it clear to customers what they're getting into. Either market only to college students, or warn everyone else.LOVE THIS HOTEL!Stayed here for my Mom's 58th Birthday and I could not have been happier with my choice. Super convenient to Broadway, just a quick drive down the road.The rooms are HUGE, clean, and everything is very hip. My fiance and I are both 26 years old. We loved it. We played pool in the lobby, and grabbed snacks at the 24hr snack ready place in the lobby. Our bed was comfy. All in all - great stay and I would definitely recommend this hotel!This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Sister to the W hotel?  I don't think so...  Motel 6 would be better than this place!  First of all, none of the rooms have closets!  Yep, that's right.  The windows are so dirty you can't see out of them. The mirror in the bathroom is not over the sink. It's like 6 inches away so when you are brushing your teeth, or my husband is shaving, you can't see yourself!  There is a ""restaurant"" down stairs (yeah right). The waiter didn't even come to our table. He yelled at us from behind the bar ""what do you Two want?"" But tonight was the final straw. I went down to get a glass of wine. The bar didn't open for another 45 minutes so I asked if I could bring a glass up to my room. Not a glass of wine, just a glass. And they don't have glasses!  Only cardboard coffee cups!  Sorry!  Wish I could give this place ZERO stars...  Lesson learned here. Don't let hubbies secretary book hotel reservations in the future!Usually I really like the Aloft hotels...this location is aight but not exactly the cat's pajamas. This one seems a bit older than the others, which is definitely not a bad thing. Our room was like an actual loft space, something that the airport Alofts have not been able to capture in my opinion. The GOOD: Location is great, we had a spacious room, and there was a Fatboy bean bag in the room for loungin'! The BAD: Our room was right next to the stairway door and it was LOUD for sure. Power lines ran right in front of the window view. The parking situation is grim unless you want to pay approx $25 a day for valet. The UGLY: No pool = sad face.Keep in mind we booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> so I'm pretty sure they stuck us in the worst room possible. I'd hate to see what they do to the hotwire customers! Cheers!Place looks a lot better online than it actually is. If you're wanting downtown downtown this ain't it, expect to take a cab about everywhere, not much around this place, slightly ghetto location but not terrible, I just thought we'd be downtown a couple blocks from Broadway. ALoft use to be a corporate office building and it explains why the building is so confusing to navigate and awkward, not sure how the other rooms are but we had 1 tiny window and the view of downtown wasn't great, they need to wash the windows, woulda been cool to have a clear view. The staff was great and very nice and helpful. Our room came out to $200 for 1 night (Memorial Day Weekend) with 2 Queen beds and parking with tax. The room was huge and very comfortable, modern styling and super quiet, we didn't hear anyone the whole time we were there, beds were very comfortable and everything was clean. Not bad but not great either, when I visit Nashville again I won't stay here based solely on the location, was just kinda annoyed to be sold a ""Downtown Hotel"" and it not really be one.This was my first time staying in an Aloft hotel.  I was super excited, as they are supposed to be really fun and hip, right?  Well.....that doesn't mean you can skimp on service and quality. I'm going to list some pros and cons here....CONS- The parking was confusing, no clear signs that only the valet could park on the first 4 decks.  We ended up having to move our car.  Twice. - The parking is really expensive ($24 a day).  And the SAME price if you valet or self park.  That seems really ridiculous. - The stairs from the parking garages to the hotel were gross and smelled like trash.  I almost threw up....not a great first impression. - The bathroom doors in the rooms are not private - you can hear what is going on through the plantation shutter door.  Thank goodness I have been married for a few years and my husband and I are not that embarrassed of each other.  - The sheets were really itchy.  Not good quality. PROS- Nice funky art all around the lobby, halls and rooms- Keurig machine with coffee/tea in room- Cheap and yummy breakfast menu downstairs with a full barNot sure out of all of the hotels in Nashville I would try this one again.  I'm really only giving it 3 stars because they had a lot of pretty cool art to look at.  Take that away and it would have been a 2 star for sure.My husband and I stayed here for 6 nights recently when visiting Nashville. I really liked this hotel. The location is great, not far from downtown (I walked in one day!). The rooms are spacious with LOTS of places to put your stuff. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom has lots of room, too. The shower is neat and it has good water pressure. There is a refrigerator and safe in the room. There is also a Keurig coffee maker. There is free Wi-Fi. The elevators are fairly quick. There is a cafe if you need to eat breakfast, we did one day and it was fine. We skipped room service and used our $5 vouchers to get breakfast and other things. The valet was very quick to get our car. $25/day is not really that expensive. They were always very polite and eager to help. There were always taxis available if you needed one.  The staff at the front desk are friendly and make you feel comfortable. There is a bar with live music. I would love to give this hotel 5 stars, but cannot because of noisy housekeepers on more than one morning when we wanted to sleep after being out late at the honkey-tonks the previous night.  Never the less, I would not hesitate going back to the Aloft when we return to Nashville.Aloft Nashville West End was not as bad as I expected based on the reviews. I ended up getting this hotel through Priceline's ""name your own price"". Based on other hotels in the price range I fill it is above standards (hence 4 stars). Yes you can hear people in the halls and doors closing, like many hotels. The hotel must have been in a shabby state when Aloft purchased it. While the decor is fun you can tell some things are cheap/ Ikea like. While I dislike fake hard wood floors, I would rather have that then the nasty carpet in other hotels. I didn't like how the bathroom doors were slatted but the shower and its high pressure shower head was amazing! They have a nice lobby set up to entertain with a nice bar. I just parked my car on the 3rd level (room level) and skipped out on valet parking even though I believe they are the same price. The staff was nice and helpful with great attitudes. Overall its a fun environment within walking distance of shops, restaurants and Vanderbilt but a little way from the main part of downtown. I would definitely stay again!This hotel is a serious work in progress. The staff lacks attention to detail. The room was mostly clean, aside from the prior occupants' folded socks and used soap bar. In the same vein, the in room coffee looks inviting but without cups to hold it....well, you get the drift. Not the end of the world but also not what I was expecting. Makes me wonder if one of their staff is trying to sabotage the place.....What an awesome hotel!The rooms are spacious and cool. It was fun, stylish and comfortable. I would take this over hundreds of other dull hotel clones any day. The staff was incredibly friendly. Every need was met. I will ABSOLUTELY stay here the next time we come back to Nashville.I was excited to stay at an Aloft and had high expectations. Right from the start I had a feeling of gloom when I enquired about parking options -  $25 daily, not counting tips every time the valet gets your car. I was falsly told the less expensive lot across the street wouldn't allow overnight parking. *Hugo clued me in to parking on the street in front of the hotel which was free after 6pm Friday and thru the weekend. The hotel is chic and modern - designed for the young urbanite. The lobby was well lit and decorated with neon lights and plenty of cool (uncomfortable) seating. There was a food gallery with overpriced treats that led into the workout gym. Sweaty patrons has to walk through a food area, yuk!  The lobby music was very loud.The RoomWhoever designed the room/bathroom have no idea what they were doing. They focused on 'cool' and bypassed function and common sense. What adult ever sits in a beanbag chair unless the HAVE TO? None. Too uncomfortable to sit in and way too hard to get out of. How stupid can they get?Bathroom with a louvered door is as equally stupid. No privacy from sound and smells and the light shines through at night. Next is the, How F__ing Dumb can you get. NO SHOWER DOOR! Water on the floor everywhere including the bathroom. Add water + No exhaust fan and you get mold on the bathroom floor and warped wood in the room. Add on paper thin walls, cheap fluorescents everywhere (haven't heard of LED?), weak internet and slow elevators and you have the Aloft in Nashville.On the + side, the employees were extremely nice and understanding and did their best.I'd have to go with Lotionistic and give it 3.5 stars.  Would I stay there again? Maybe, maybe not.  It's expensive because of the location, parking, and its hip urban feel. I think I would recommend it for girls night out, wedding parties and adult family reunions.  For the price, I may have preferred a downtown place with complimentary breakfast.  (Especially if you're expecting a hangover.)They do allow pets. We brought our 40lb dog with no problem, except no green area nearby to walk the dog. We booked this hotel through hotwire, because a previous hotel booking went awry. It was my daughter's 21st birthday (which was cut way too short because of our other hotel's screw up and hotwire's long time to resolve the problem), we had five girls and a dog on the 9th floor.  The room with two beds and the bean bag chair was definitely big enough for all of us. Pros:  Very clean, allows pets, nice sized bathroom counter space, roomy, shampoo and body wash dispensers, lots of towels, hair dryer, iron, ironing board, coffee maker, floors with thin carpet overlay (I prefer floors), comfy beds and lots of comfy pillows, big mirrors, drawer space, hangers, charger, big bean bag chair for extra person to sleep on, desk area, alarm clock. Very modern, loved the artwork and chic feel. I remember the same lamp being on an HGTV episode. I took pictures, but I don't think they do the room justice. (Better in person.) Lobby looked fun. Front desk clerk was friendly, busy and efficient.  We didn't use valet or bellhop, but saw him assisting others and he was very friendly and helpful. I loved the shower. It's very roomy, and a big showerhead with a great flow. I take notoriously long showers, and temperature was great, and didn't get water on the floor like others stated (and I normally do at home).  Was surprised no fan. Lots of lighting.  I can't believe people complained about the shower because that was one of my favorite parts of the room. We thought the beanbag chair was great and definitely added to the experience/value/feel.According to my 20-something girls the location was good for night-life. I saw some outside seating that I would have enjoyed if we were staying longer. They have room service, we didn't use. I have no idea if we had neighbors or not, but no problem with noise. Wifi was reliable. You need a passcode. Checkout time is noon, which is nicer than 11 a.m.Cons:Parking sucks. We arrived at 1 a.m. because of hotwire and other hotel problems. Didn't see the sign on the bell stand parking $24 until we pulled out. Getting in and out of garage was a pain. (Especially with one ticket and two cars.) The parking was added on to our hotel bill. (So from 1 a.m. to Noon the next day, we paid $48 just to park. Total bill was $272 for one room, double beds. I would never pay that much for this, but hotwire is comping us for some of it. We stayed on a Friday.) No complimentary breakfast. (We called the front desk and asked.)I didn't see a comment card in the room. The strip of wood between the bathroom sleeping room was loose and I would have left a note for engineering. They accept pets, but not convenient for walking pets.   Coffee provided was ""light"" I would have preferred dark. And more of it. Thankfully, I bring my own instant to add. There is construction outside - didn't bother me, I couldn't hear it, but might bother others. I guess I didn't feel there was a cost-to-value ratio. I think a hotel with better parking and free breakfast can provide a similar experience for less money, albiet possibly not as modern. I was pleased, and I'd stay here again if the price was right. But I'd probably check out the other downtown hotels first if you're money/value conscious. But if money is no object,  you have a big party, or you're looking for an urban chic feel - then go for this place first.A Loft is an attempt at ""edgy""  and ultra cool for somebody.  Who that somebody is, I'm not really sure.While the rooms are big, it's not really useful space.  The bean bag chair is not relaxing or functional.  Done up with IKEA furnishing and soap dispensers on the wall, not sure if this is the ""hip""  that I'm looking for.Although the reviews say property was refurbished our room showed considerable wear, especially the laminate floors and a very loud heater/AC unit.  Positives, the mattress were comfortable and reasonable access to downtown.Pay for parking at $24 per nite always frosts my cake but I guess this is par for the area.  This is not a budget hotel by any definition so be ready for $200+ + per nite without anything happening in town. Our group had a great time in Nashville, but this hotel was not really compelling for a return visit.  I think there are better values and venues.","We stayed here for my bachelorette party and I must say that the website is deceiving.  We had a room booked that said ""King Bed + Queen and seating area."" False.  The room was nice, but not for 5 people.  They first tried saying that the fold out couch was actually the queen bed when we checked in. False again.  It is a tiny twin bed that folds out.  Management really wasn't helpful unless they gave us a not as good room.  We ended up keeping the room we had due to lack of options, having 3 people sleep on the bed, 1 on the fold out couch, and another person making a pallet on the floor.  It gets three stars for the location.  Walking distance to a lot of great places and a very quick and cheap cab ride to downtown.  Just be warned it is pulling teeth to get good customer service thereMy partner and I stayed here for two nights. I have mixed feelings on the place. Overall it was ok and I'm hoping the things we experienced were exceptions to the norm. As this was our first experience at an Aloft I had no expectations set. Since Nashville doesn't have a W this was the next best thing we thought. Our flight was 2 hours late getting to Nashville and we arrived at the hotel at 10:30PM. Upon arriving we learned that half of the hotel was without hot water and it would be repaired the following day. To compensate for this they comped the room for the night without hot water as well as valet for the entire weekend. They were nice and very apologetic and focused on making sure we were taken care of. The only thing they could have done outside of this would have been to try and contact us in advance of our arrival to let us know the situation and give us options. As it stood, the rooms on the half of the hotel with hot water were taken and other hotels in the area were booked. Aside from that, the room was nice. Decor was great - modern and minimal. The louvred bathroom door was odd as was the lack of any decent place to sit aside from the bed, a single desk chair and two oversized bean bags. The room was, and I'm not kidding, at least 800 sq. ft. so there was plenty of room to have seating. Cabs are easy to get outside the hotel. A few places to eat along Broadway that are within walking distance. A few nice gay bars within walking distance that were great to check out too.I'm not sure where to begin.I've heard GREAT things about A Loft and W hotels but this place was an absolute bummer.While choosing where to stay, I read many reviews about it being ""under construction"" and ""Cant wait to see when it's finished"", so I was hoping that we would get there when the renovations were done.  I asked multiple times while we were there and they said ""oh, yes were done""  Me'thinks not.- The room we stayed in had scuffed and chipped furniture, the molding and general carpentry work from the floor to the ceiling looked cheap and something you would expect from a inexperienced and rushed ""do it yourself-er""- The bathroom door was slotted so you could hear ""EVERYTHING"" going on in there.  Me and my girlfriend took turns kicking each other out the room each time major business needed to be conducted.- The shower, (granted was handicapped) had no curtain or door and was built in a way that was impossible NOT to soak the bathroom floor and required us to use ALL of our towels to keep it from seeping out into the hallway which the wood floor was already water damage as it buckled and separated throughout the unit.- We also had to ask on a couple occasions for our towels, water, coffee to be replaced as ""the talent"" forgot to get them to us.  This had to be done in person as the phone in our room was busted.- Windows looked like they haven't been cleaned in years and the room as a whole felt dirty especially with mold and mildew around the bathroom grout and caulk lines.-  Initially, I thought it was a neat idea to place FATBOYs in the rooms, but upon further inspections there were a few lovely white spots all over (Gross).Seriously, Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.  For the price we were paying Id wished I spend a little more and just stayed downtown.  I had to go outside a few times and make sure we were staying at the right hotel!This hotel was called Hotel Indigo when we booked it so I was a little bit nervous when we showed up and it was called Aloft Nashville, but i was pleasantly surprised.  It's a nice hotel, better than the hampton inns in the area.  Nice hotel and a short cab ride out of the main downtown area.  The rooms were really nice and unique, which I loved.  The only strange thing was that the bathroom door was slatted wood, so there's no, um, privacy.  Otherwise, I loved the room, the bed was super comfy and the coffee machines are mini kuerigs, which was cool.They have life music in the lounge area and a bar.  The restaurant attached looked good too, but I did not have a chance to try it.  NOTE:  Parking is $17.48 not $16, as they tax it. Maybe that's a Nashville thing?  Anyway, I highly recommend this hotel for your stay in Nashville.I don't quite understand the negative reviews.  It's Aloft so it's lofty.  I think the room was well laid out and quite unique compared to most chains in the business and personal traveler market.  The location is A-OK - not much walkable in the immediate area but it's close to downtown and the university.  I think when they're done with the new condos and other development in the next few years it will be a better and more central location.  The check-in process was a little strange (and I've stayed in Aloft properties many times before) but I'll chalk that up to the individual and not the properties.  The rooms are funky with cool art, interesting bathrooms and spaces, and giant pillows.I might be back. :)This was my first stay at an Aloft, and I traveled with a friend who stays here often. We did not use the valet/ parking lot, so I cannot comment there.Pros-- Clean-  A LOT of food/beverage options for breakfast and snacks- City bus across the street, so you can easily get up and down broadway on the city bus. PS the city bus DOES accept dollar bills. Can you walk to downtown Nashville? Eh..if you want, but not that close (probably 30 min walk?). Cons-- On Labor Day weekend/ Univ of Kentucky playing in Nashville, there was ONE poor soul working the front desk alone and answering the phones alone. She was a GEM, never lost her cool. But there was easily a line 5-6 people deep and she had no help. Shame on management for not staffing better (who cares if there is a sick call, then a manager needs to come in and help on a weekend like this).- NO ONE that works at this place has any idea of what to do/eat/see while in town. No one had heard of the famous ""Station Inn"", no one could recommend a breakfast place that was open on Labor Day Monday within walking distance of the hotel (I told them ""Yelp says.."" ). One employee even mentioned three CHAIN restaurants as the BEST restaurants in town; that's so insulting it isn't even funny.Visually, this place is adorable - but like a 22 year old girl adorable who doesn't know how to be a lady when she opens her mouth. Paper thin walls, lack of eye contact from desk staff, and oh, don't get romantic here because you can hear EVERYTHING whether you're in the next room or bathroom. I have to say this too - it attracts college students trying to be hip. I can't blame them, I would have done the same. As I watch them drop water balloons from the rooftop on to passing runners - I realize they are sooooo uncool to be roomies next door. Being all grown up with money - I'll be staying somewhere else during my next visit to Nashville.3.5 stars actually. If you're not a picky person, you'll be pleased. I booked a rm on hot wire . com, so didn't know what hotel until after the fact. VERY concerned b/c all of the bad rvws, but it was fine. CONS: 3 employees looking busy at the front desk, but it took a loooong time to check in; furnishings starting to look tired - chips/scratches on most wood furniture; shower fixture worked, but had missing pcs/very loose; can hear neighbor if they have sex loudly at 2am (connecting doors in rooms). PROS: location; good rate on site mentioned above; friendly staff; cool vibe; clean and comfortable. Some ppl mentioned wood floors. Our king rm had carpet, so no issues there. I would say ""So what?"" to other rvws re: beanbag chairs in the rms; no shower door; louvred bathroom doors, etc. Pay a hundred bucks more / nt elsewhere if you want a traditional hotel/room. Can't comment on pkg rate - we parked for free on the street during a wknd stay.OK hotel. JUST OK. The lobby smells like fruity pebbles all the time (a plus) and it seemed to be bug free.. There were a couple weird things tho. One night our room smelled terribly like cigarette smoke. It was blowing in from the air conditioner. It was doing it all night. I got really sick. Turning it off wasnt an option because it was 90 degrees out. A security person came up to check, smelled it, and wrote it in a log. It was a terrible night because of it. I really think compensation should have been given for this..like a night free or something. I couldnt sleep because of it. Also, someone in our group swears money was stolen from her suitcase.  I dont know if I would stay again as it doesnt have room service, the bar is odd to order a drink at, there isnt a spa or pool and its kind of far from all the fun of broadway. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful tho.The people were great. Awesome personal service. The hotel rooms are noisy. Paper thin walls and the person in the next room had a barking dog. Valet service was ok, not great. Beds are comfortable. Will not stay here again simply because of the noise and ""pet friendly"" hotel policy.Booked a king/queen suite, got a queen, full pullout. Dirty floors.  Took over a half an hour to get sheets for pull out. Would not stay here again!Great place to stay! Easy to walk every where (great location), spacious rooms and fun lobby. Best of all- the staff! I'm in the hotel biz and wish I could take the amazing gal that works the front desk and take her with me- wish I could remember her name!! I will be back because of her! Great hotel!My buddies and I came to Nashville for our annual Mancation this weekend and stayed at the Aloft.  This hotel has a fun atmosphere and a great, central location for people who are looking to explore the city and have some late night fun.  A special thanks to Nick and Christie for your personal touch and hospitality.  You made our stay in Nashville memorable.It's cute. The room is decorated very nicely. Parking at atrocious with very small spots and people parking sideways. Staff here are not typical Aloft staff (this is an independently owned Aloft that has recently transitioned from Hotel Indigo) and you can tell that they are not going to go out of their way to make you feel overly welcome.  But it does have free wifi (I love that in a hotel!).The bathroom - as one person put it earlier, the door is a slanted wood door that allows little ""privacy"" as one is in the bathroom (you can hear EVERYTHING that anyone is doing in the bathroom). While showering last night, the water suddenly became SO hot that I had to step aside in order to adjust it. Then, this morning, the water never became hot after 5 minutes. Then there's the nightstand beside my half of the bed. It's so gross behind it that I decided against taking a picture of it once I had my camera in hand. I don't know what it is all over the wall, but it looks like someone splashed something all over it (or sneezed all over the wall) and it and it has never been taken care of. Simply disgusting.Would I stay here again? No. Maybe they are just trying to work out the kinks that anyone would go thru during a transition, but it is not impressive.The Aloft is one of those hotels you know has potential, it's just a bummer I was staying there during construction! I think that the location is really perfect, right in the middle of everywhere you want to be. The room was a fairly good size, and the hotel staff couldn't be nicer. It did seem like the walls were a little thin, but thats what cocktails are for, right?Best service everWhat to stay here vs the other hotels in the areaBest trained staffNo hot water. I let the shower run for 10 minutes and no change in temp. If you have a car and self park, it is a hassle. The two treadmills were out of order.Don't look any further for a hotel in Nashville.  This is the best!  Although it's about a mile walk to downtown and HontyTonk Row, etc, you also have some fantastic bars, restaurants and music venues a few blocks away (Winners, Losers, Blue Bar, etc). This hotel bed and shower are superb!  We booked it when it was called Hotel Indigo and we've heard one too many times ""we're in transition"" but no matter, still great place. Let's hope it stays that way once the 'transition' has been completed.What would you do if a bomb exploded, shaking the entire hotel and woke you at 6:30am? Would you be scared? Would you want to know what was happening? Would you try to call the front desk? I was traveling with a friend to Nashville and was happy to see that we had bid and ""Named Our Own Price"" at the Aloft Nashville West End on Priceline. Though parking was expensive ($22), our check in at around 7:30pm was pleasant. We went into our room and it was ok. However, two incidents occurred which were greatly upsetting and reflect very poorly on this hotel and Starwood.At 6:30am, we were awakened by an explosion that shook the entire hotel. It was so violent, that we felt that it HAD to be in the hotel or very close. I immediately picked up the phone to call the front desk to find that there was no ring tone! My friend ran to the door and said that he didn't see any smoke or fire but we should get dressed and leave the hotel.I had the sense to use my cell phone and call the hotel's main number. It was immediately answered by a female who sounded very calm. I told her that we had heard an explosion and were very concerned. She asked if we hadn't noticed all of the construction (ummm no, we were supposed to?) going on down the street and stated that a new hotel was being built down the street. The builders/city used explosives two or three times a week at 6:30am to clear the grounds. She further stated that the hotel was not given notice when these explosions would occur and it wasn't their responsibility. I asked that since the hotel knew these explosions happen, shouldn't the hotel notify guests that this *might* occur? She then brusquely reiterated that it was not the responsibility of the hotel to inform their guests because they are not given prior warning from the city, so it was out of their hands. I was shocked.We are from Washington, DC. We both had had experiences in our lives with terrorism, bombs etc during 9/11 and other incidents since then. Clearly our lives were/are affected differently than someone from Nashville. The Boston Marathon bombing was only a few weeks ago. So when the explosion occurred, my first immediate thought was of the Oklahoma City bombing in the 80's and terrorist attacks.I was too upset to sleep so I took a very long shower, packed and went downstairs to the front desk and told the person there, Hugo, that I wanted to speak to a manager about what had occurred that morning. Knowing I was so upset, I made sure I was speaking in a low, calm, carefully modulated voice. I realized there were other guest behind me and didn't want to create a scene as they didn't seem upset at all. Hugo was immediately defensive and angry. He said that general manager wasn't there and when I asked if there a manager on duty, he said no. Rather than addressing my concern, he asked if I wanted someone to look at the phone and see why it wasn't working. When I said no, he asked if I wanted to close out the room and have my car brought around from the valet.I told him my friend was still in the room and would be down shortly. Instead, I wanted to find out how to contact a manager. He went to the other side of the desk and brought back a business card for the general manager. As he handed it to me, it stated once again that the manager wasn't there. At that point I asked what his name was and wrote it down on the card. He asked once again if I wanted to check out. Since it was clear that he wouldn't help, I said yesAs I waited in the lobby for my friend, I overheard two employees behind me talking in the breakfast nook area and got up to speak to them. One employee had already walked away by the time I reached them but I managed to flag down the remaining employee and asked him if there was a manager on duty. He pointed to Hugo and said, ""It's the guy at the front desk"". I was puzzled, and asked again. He stated that Hugo was the front desk manager and in charge until the general manager came in around 10 or 10:30am. When he asked what was wrong, I told him what had happened starting from the explosion, to the call, to what Hugo had told me. I was SHOCKED when he said that the explosions don't happen two or three times a week. THEY HAPPEN EVERY DAY! He said he'd have the GM call me when she got in.The second my friend came down, we left immediately. As we walked out the door, Hugo said ""I'm sorry about YOUR problem."" MY PROBLEM?!?!?! REALLY?!??!?!?When I got home, I sent an email to Starwood. No response. No surprise that the GM at the Aloft never called, even though I called and left a message too.I'm sure the hotel didn't want to lose business but they should have explained about the explosions. How greedy Aloft Nashville West End and Starwood Properties! You might have gotten my business for one night but how many potential customers reading this will you lose now?STAY AWAY!!!!!!!Although this may look like an Aloft, this location is a disgrace to the Aloft brand. Never experienced a hotel team that is so unattentive to guests and to keep up what needs to be done in the hotel.  Terrible experience the first stay and then tried them again to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was a fluke--but no...this place has some real staff problems. Not staying here anymore.","Place looks better online, I expected more from a W affiliate. The room was just ok, ceiling was dirty but it was decent. It was overpriced for the quality that's for sure. Next time I'm in Nashville I will try the Hutton across the street or stay mainstream with a Hilton. This property needs major improvement to compete. On the positive side every single person on the staff was more than excellent. All of them went above and beyond and made we feel very welcome . The staff deserves a better property. Location was excellent. I hope they make some improvements with the property, if so I would consider returning just because the staff was great. I love Hannah, she was excellent and I wish her the best!The hotel is under remodel and the anticipated completion date is April 1st.  I found the rooms to be disappointing and nothing special.  There are far better values.  The room was clean and the staff friendly enough.  IMO the remodel isn't going far enough.  The bathrooms aren't very nice and the furniture was worn.  I can only hope these will be addresses with the remodel.The hotel &amp; the hotel staff were good but, during a recent stay of 5 nights our 2013 Lexus was keyed in the parking garage on both sides of the car. While I know there is little they can do to prevent this from happening, I expected a call from management. It never came:(Had an absolutely wonderful stay here. Staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. We had two issues w can drivers which was out of their control. They were nice enough to recommend a specific can company and drivers they knew so we wouldn't have the issue again.they even ordered a pizza for us late night. All we said was we want pizza and they took  care of finding the pizza place for us and calling them. Pizza showed up at our door ! We didn't even have to go down to the lobby and pick it up! They had it sent directly to our room.  The hotel was very chic and modern our room was huge and the decor in the hotel was beautiful . One of our walls in the room had music notes and a trumpet drawn on it! Perfect for music city Nashville! When we checked out we had questions about the bill and the were courteous and patient while we had questions! The room was even cheaper than we thought!!! Very pleased and will definitely be staying here again when we visit NashvilleThis hotel is under major construction - do not stay there unless you like smelling paint, having the floors and lobby covered in plastic and construction dust everywhere. As well the entire block across the street has been leveled and construction is beginging there as well.   I spent the entire day listening to a jackhammer from 7am till 5:30pm as I tried to work in the room.  My room was remodeled but the floor was not so it was weird walking around the work being done in other rooms.  As well the work done in my room was sloppy.  Paint chips were on the floor the new bathroom had a mirror with a broken frame.  The window curtins were horrible and clearly left over from the hotel purchased by this chain.  So why they are keeping the hotel open as opposed to closing it and remodeling it is beyond me.  Another tip...do not pay for their parking it is a rip off.  You can park a block away using meters on the street which go off in the evening.  Just check the no parking times.  I parked across the street at a meter all night for free.Best of all when I called the front desk to have a conversation with customer service to find out when the jack hammering would end for the day it went as follows:""Hi can you tell me when the jack hammering at the construction across the street will end for the day.  When do they stop for the day""?Agent:What construction:  Me:The one across the street.Agent:I am not aware of any construction.Me:How could you not be aware of the construction across the street?  They have flattened an entire city block and the noise is intense.Agent:Oh that construction.  Well maybe 5pm or 6pm.Me:So you really have no clue when they stop do you.  Click.I can't express how pleased we were with the Nashville Aloft hotel during our stay the last weekend in July.  Although the hotel is a little loud in both music and decorations (it gives off a semi-awkward hipster vibe), the staff could not have been nicer - big shout out to Jamie, one of the front desk attendants who was new to this location and had traveled all over for Aloft's parent company Westin - I have never met someone who truly embodied customer service like she did!  My boyfriend had lost his ID the first part of the trip, so when we arrived we were not feeling our level best.  However, we were checked in quickly, booked a second room in no time at all, were given good suggestions of places to visit, and on our second night were given some waters when we came back from having a couple (too many) drinks at the bars downtown.  Not only were the front desk people pleasant, the housekeepers (although very loud @ 930 in the morning after a night out) gave us extras towels and soap when we asked with a smile. For those looking to be within a 5 minute cab ride of the bars on Broadway (the main bar district in Nashville) but near some more local bars and restaurants with way more atmosphere, stay here!  We will definitely return on our next trip to Nashville which will be in the near future - we want to move here :-)First off, I'd like to state that we DID NOT stay here. Several friends and I along with my girlfriend decided at the last minute to travel to Nashville TN for the night from Louisville KY (06/15/2013). We all hopped on our Harleys and headed south. After a nice trip down we had planned on staying at the Holiday Inn Express in downtown Nashville. When we got there, they had no rooms available but, were more than happy to call around and find us a room. They called several hotels with no luck but, then called Aloft. The person there said ""They weren't supposed to quote prices over the phone but, let's just say it's right at $199 and they had twenty rooms available"" We were fine with that and jumped on the bikes and headed over there. When we got there we were told that they did not have any rooms available. They lady (and I use that term loosly with regards to her) said ""Even if we had rooms available, they certainly wouldn't be $199, we are a four star hotel."" We were absolutely appalled to be trated like this. Me being me decided to jump on my trusty smart phone and check for myself. What do you know? They had plenty of rooms left and were actually only $189 a night according to their own website. I'm not sure if it was our biker gear or what but, I cannot believe we were treated this way. Rather than cause a scene we decided to call around and find something else. At this point, we really didn't want to give them our business anyway. We ended up findin the Hilton downtown for $292 a night (which we had no problem paying) and it was a very nice hotel. It also ended up being much closer to where we wanted to hang out for the night. All in all, I will never stay in a hotel owned by this group.I came to this hotel with an open mind, even after reading the reviews. My conference hotel was full so Sheraton sent me here. Okay so the lobby looks like a Pinkberry...a different vibe I get that. My room has 3 bean bag chairs...not my demographic I get that. However it began to go South when there was no light anywhere near the desk. Not on it, not over it, nowhere. In fact that side of the room is kind of a black hole. There are only two inconveniently placed outlets available (one is to be crawled under the dark desk to find) in order to power my electronics. There is a cool light in the corner that is not plugged in because there is no outlet anywhere near it. I have one trash can and it says it is only for recyclables. Why are the only cups in the room the paper ones by the coffee machine? The topper however is that my room did not get made up. No one had come near it since I left at 7:30 this morning. I was willing to overlook some stuff but really? I was told that this has been a regular occurrence as of late. What am I paying for? And the front desks answer was ""Sorry what would you like us to get you, towels?"" If I were to come back to Nashville I would choose a different hotel.",,"['heard', 'great', 'things', 'aloft', 'chain', 'part', 'brand', 'usually', 'customer', 'time', 'however', 'aloft', 'place',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-nashville-downtown-nashville,Hyatt Place Nashville Downtown,4.0,$$,66,"Hyatt Place Nashville Downtown was hands-down the best place to stay for my bachelorette party weekend. Though I originally wanted to book at a nearby, higher end hotel, the room rates were outrageous. I remembered the Hyatt Place from a previous Nashville visit and knew: the location is ideal, it's a relatively new property, and the rates were in line with what we were looking to spend.  The rooms are large and perfect for sharing - the couch has a fold out single bed. The bathrooms are large and there is plenty of counter space. I also enjoyed the full length mirror in the room, just outside of the bathroom, which is located near an outlet. Even with three girls in my room, we had no problems getting ready at the same time. Like other reviewers, I did not care for the frosted glass sliding door on the bathroom. Privacy is not overrated! A hot breakfast with tons of options is served every morning in the lobby. I was stunned to receive a plate of breakfast sandwiches, scrambled eggs and biscuits and gravy from my friends who were up early enough to take advantage of this perk. The lobby also features a bar and a small menu that is perfect for late night snacks. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, but we were disappointed that our room was not cleaned after night one. We had placed the do not disturb sign on our door, which was there until around noon. When we left the room we noticed a bag of fresh towels, but we really wanted our room serviced since we had a bunch of plates and drinks scattered around. I called to request a housekeeping visit and was assured we would receive one. Two hours later when my sister went back to the room to pick something up, she called down with same request. Unfortunately, our room was never cleaned so by the time we left it was a bit of a mess. That said, I can't dock any stars from Hyatt Place, and here's why: after being home for three days, I went to switch my purses around and realized with a pit in my stomach that the last time I had my other bag I was in my hotel room. That's when I also realized I had left another bag (yes, I brought three handbags on a weekend vacation), plus a pair of shorts and a tank top. On the day of our check-out, I was running late for a brunch reservation and was scrambling to get everything together - I must have forgotten to check the closet! I called the hotel, thinking there would be no way that my stuff was still around. I was STUNNED when the manager confirmed that they had everything! I gave him my credit card number so that the hotel could ship everything back. The next day, I received a voicemail from the head of housekeeping confirming the shipment. Today, my items arrived, along with two additional shirts my future sister-in-law also left in the room. I've left pricey items in hotel rooms before and it has always been a lost cause (RIP, Joe's Jeans). I cannot believe my stuff has been returned and I am so very grateful to the housekeeping staff. Next time I take a trip to Nashville, I know exactly where I want to stay!This is a pretty large Hyatt Place in the heart of Nashville.  It's a great location, located right next to the Country Music Hall of Fame, and therefore close to Broadway Ave, thec convention center, the arena, the amphitheater, and lots of tourist attractions.  They have a pool and workout room, but no hot tub as far as I can tell (which would have been nice even though it is crazy hot outside, since I got sick with a cold during my stay...).  Some positives of the hotel are the ""happening"" vibe it gives off.  Just about every night during our stay they had live music in the lounge, and it seemed like every day there were troves of people checking in or out.  It always seemed lively and busy in the lobby, which could be good or bad I guess depending on your perspective.  The rooms aren't huge, but they're nice and cozy.  The windows have a nice black out feature so you can sleep as long as you like into the day without having the sunlight cause an annoyance.A major downside of the hotel is noise isolation.  People in the hall sound as if they're inside your room.  There was a very loud room across the hall from us having a party the other night, and I could have sworn it had to be an adjacent room given how ""in your face"" the sound was (I didn't figure out it was the room across until I went outside).The room doors are very heavy, causing them to slam shut behind anyone who opens them and isn't careful (so basically everyone).  When this happens in any direction 1 - 2 doors away from  you, your entire room rattles and the bed shakes.  It definitely woke me up every morning as people started evacuating their rooms for breakfast downstairs, so plan to be woken up by this noise pretty much daily.Speaking of breakfast, it's a pretty amazing one.  Lots of options, very delicious...though it would be nice if it lasted a little longer.  I barely made it down in time 3 of the nights, and the other 2 neither of us were able to make it.We were in town for about 4 football games during our stay.  I was excited about this when we booked, but now having stayed I wish we hadn't.  The whole town, including this hotel, becomes full of drunk, partying sports fans...which made the stay for people like us just trying to enjoy the city somewhat unpleasant.The 3 elevators work pretty well and are efficient in most cases, though when the hotel filled up over the weekend there was noticeably increased waiting and fullness.All in all, I recommend this hotel--especially if the ""scene"" I've described above sounds like your cup of tea.Amazing view and proximity to everything. We had a riverview corner room on the 12th floor and the toilet made noise all night. Almost asleep? Lemme help you with that... ""Gurgle gurgle, p-toosh!"".  Construction on the building next door starts bright and early at 5:30, so be sure to bring your hard hat, and blueprints, because then it'll be just like being a part of the construction crew. I understand progress, but hotels usually make note on their websites when there is construction going on in close proximity. I was given runaround at check in, even though I had the reservation in my Passbook app, as well as the card it was booked with. When asked for ID, none of these things were good enough, nor was my wife's ID. I had to backtrack to a car, that had been valeted, to pick up my ID before we could check in. This, after I checked in with a tap of my watch at a Marriott a month earlier. Ladies, my wife pointed out to me that the bathroom vanity is rather oddly deep and would cause you to do your makeup at an arm's length from the mirror.  From what I understand, that complicates eye makeup big time. The bar staff was outstanding, as we came in late and got snacks and drinks before bed. It's a shame their best staff works late night. Recapping, 1 star for location, and another for the bar staff. There are too many options in the area to return here for a second try.4.5...because I was looking forward to using the indoor pool instead of the gym (laziness during vacation issues) but unfortunately, it was closed during the 3 days I stayed here.  Other than that, this is a great downtown Nashville hotel. The rooms, ammenities, dining area, lobby, elevators, and even the hallways are clean, well-kept and the customer service was exceptional. The location is very convinient and perfect for anyone who wants to explore downtown Nashville or be anywhere near almost everything. Their breakfast buffet had always something new to offer, replenished even before the containers got empty, a wide variety of options, the tables were cleaned constantly, and the dining area was comfortable and clean.  I highly recommend this Hyatt Place for a great Nashville experience.People and service is GREAT, bar tenders are GREAT.  This review is sure to change AFTER all of the construction next door is complete.  Until then, ask for a room away from the construction side.I felt bad being so hungs while enjoying the hot breakfast filled with amazing eggs , sausage , biscuits and all the gravy one could want. I'm sure those parents were trying their best to explain the unfortunate group of girls who looked like they l wanted to die...Stayed her for a long weekend for a baes Bach and had a blast . We were in walking distance to a liquor store , all the bars on the main ""strip "" and everyone in the south is of course so nice .My reason for the deduction of a star is Our rooms weren't cleaned once during our weekend stay. I was totally fine without my bed being made but our trash can was over flowing. You also couldn't get the room service delivered it had to be picked up I mean this is America..... SadnessThis is probably one of my favorite hotels I've stayed at. It was really clean and is located very close to the live music venues on Broadway. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. We checked in with Amanda who was friendly and personable. We were traveling for a special occasion which Amanda asked about, upon returning to our room after dinner we found a bottle of champagne and two glasses along with a note stating the champagne was from Dave and Zoe. At breakfast the next day Jermaine came up to our table and asked what we were doing that day, when we told him we were headed to the Jack Daniels Distillery he told us a little bit of history and told us about a couple things to look for. I liked that he made it a point to talk to us and gave us an extra bit of history we wouldn't have gotten anywhere else. If you are staying in Downtown Nashville stay here. It is walking distance to Bridgestone Arena, The Country Music Hall of Fame, Broadway and the Johnny Cash museum. It is also really close to The Gulch.Great place to stay. The fruit infused waters are great, with alternating selections everyday. The rooms were very nice and clean. The staff was super helpful to all our needs. The breakfast was great and the chef even made me a special breakfast sandwich since they had no vegetarians sit out, also wanted to know how long I was staying so he could have them ready. Free WiFi worked flawlessly. Great bar downstairs with live music. No complaints about this place, would stay again.I was lucky enough to spend one night here last week. I really loved the hotel and it's proximity to Broadway and other tourist attractions. If you have any interest in the Country Music Hall of Fame, this is your spot. It's just around the corner.Our rate was through Priceline Express and even though it was more than I normally like to spend, I feel like we got our money's worth. The staff was incredible, the beds were comfortable and our room was a decent size (sometimes they give you the smallest room available when you book through Priceline or Hotwire.) Other pros: fridge and coffee pot in the room, nice sized pool, easy access to parking lot, and free wi-fi. Cons: no bath tub, parking is not included ($20+tax per night), ""free"" breakfast is only pastries and coffee with a bowl of fruit--not a ton of healthy options.All the cons were minor and didn't outweigh our love for the hotel. We wouldn't hesitate to come back next time we're in Nashville.This hotel was a great choice. Beautiful southern decor when you walk in. Large clean rooms. We are here for a conference that is two blocks away, next to the Country Music Hall of Fame. If you go two blocks up the street you are on Broadway. That is where the party is at! Live music everywhere, flannel, beards and fun. This is a great choice for a stay. The free breakfast is awesome, your normal choices plus breakfast sandwiches, open faced bagels with egg cheese, spinach and ham. Great coffee. The bar is beautiful with a southern cow hide decor vibe. When we checked in, Terri helped us. Wow. Top notch. She gave us a map, told us where to eat and go to hang out. She gave us coupons, cab numbers, everything we need. Above and beyond. Thanks for a great stay!!This Hyatt Place is fantastic.  Yes, it's not a high-end hotel, but is nice and well-maintained.  And that staff is great--super friendly and more than willing to help in anyway possible.  And they were so sweet to send a little birthday gift to the room for Stacey M.I do recommend asking for something as soon as you need it--I asked late in the day (afternoon) for the makeup lamp to be fixed, and it was not fixed until the next day.  Speaking of makeup, we had the unfortunate luck of staying while a Mary Kay convention was in town and that was annoying as hell, and I'm not just talking about the bad makeup.  But, the staff was so great, that it outdid any challenges due to the influx of saleswoman. I didn't love the continental breakfast, though it wasn't awful.  I just really don't eat anything offered at continental breakfasts.  Beds were comfy and rooms are decently-sized.  Besides the staff, and the awesome location (so close to Broadway and in nice weather, you could walk to The Gulch), I loved the fruit infused water, because I'm bougie like that, and also, they had a strawberry version. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. In fact, if ever visited Nashville again, I wouldn't even look anywhere else.This place is just perfect, location, clean, modern, highly recommended for a downtown Nashville stay!An easy 5 stars. Meets &amp; Exeeds.A first class property just 2 blocks from all the entertainment and dining activity in Nashville that delivers something for everyone from the business traveler, tourist or even for a getaway weekend.Great service.  Very attentive,  detailed,  friendly and a staff that overtly shows their sincerity. Lobby is extremely well appointed.  A 24/7 contemporary cafe is there no matter when you call. Even with an early departure like mine at 5am, I was able to order a geeat cooked to order breakfast sandwich.The rooms are splendid. Mine was modern, comfortable, roomy, well appointed with incredibly plush King bed and a huge, comfortable sectional sofa instead of the typical obligatory hotel room chair. The bathroom is fantastic.  Bright, roomy, clean clean clean and an awesome shower.Awesome place to stay if you want to be in the heart of Nashville. Walking distance to everything! Very clean hotel. They have fresh infused water  when you enter (perfect for hot days). Breakfast was better than the normal, they have egg white and normal breakfast sandwiches that were delicious. Local artist play at the bar, both nights we sat and listened either before going out or on that back from dinner. If you want a quick snack with a cocktail in the afternoon, their hummus plate is awesome with 3 generous servings of different hummus. Staff super friendly. When visiting , I will stay here again !Everyone here was amazingly helpful and super nice. The Starbucks/bar/limited menu in the lobby was great. Best lobby I have had in a hotel, live music every night, lots of tables, comfy chairs. Rooms were spacious, will agree with the other poster that the vanity is crazy deep so make up is hard to apply especially with the standard low lights in hotel bathrooms. Great breakfast buffet and well trained staff, highly recommend. Location is awesome all downtown is easy walking distance and anytbing out if town is only a $5-7/Uber/lyft ride. We would definitely stay here next time.Stayed here for a Thursday-Sunday in late January. The hotel was lovely. Fruit infused water in the lobby (seemed to be a thing in the area), continental breakfast, friendly staff. The continental breakfast was more than the average continental breakfast of stale old pastries. They had lots of options hot oatmeal, egg sandwiches, french toast. A free 24 hour fitness center was an excellent plus, though on the small side. The day I used it got there at 5:30 and it filled up within the hour. Pool was nice and the day and time I used it was empty. The best part was on Saturday which was my 30th birthday. The hotel sent up a birthday card and a bottle of champagne. I can't remember the brand but it was very good. Queen size beds were comfyMy only complaint was the key cards. You had to use them to get up the elevator and it was a bit of pain especially as my hands were always full.We like it very much. Great staff, and the breakfast is very good. Bar area is not loud, except for when there's local music. Rooms are good size and the decor is slightly modern. Only downside are the beds. The couch is more comfortable and I slept there after the first day. The mattresses are hard and thin.Good clean workout center with treadmills, cycles, weights.Great place to stay! First time to Nashville and didn't know what to expect. Staff was always friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast was the best! We were there for 3 nights and the breakfast varied over the 3 days. Clean with modern decor. We worked out in the gym that had sufficient equipment for many people and towels were provided. The free fruit infused water was so refreshing and wonderful. Great location because we walked to everywhere in downtown. Totally recommend staying here. I would definitely stay here again.I spent last night at Hyatt place downtown Nashville. The check in process was easy and the staff were so nice and helpful. They even gave us a handwritten thank you note and a gift bag with water and goo goos! Our room was clean and spacious and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious snd when I told them it was my birthday they gave me a red velvet cupcake! Yay!!! I hope to spend more birthdays here! The proximity to Nashville downtown entertainment is a big plus as well.Great new hotel in downtown Austin. Very clean, modern rooms, safe area, close to bars and indoor parking. We will be coming back on our next trip.","Nice new hotel. Great breakfast buffet offering that comes with room.  Staff is very nice and helpful.  Location is perfect to Broadway, Riverfront, dining, and Titan Stadium.  June 2015 there is a bit of construction to look at and hear but it was not distracting enough to be concerned.Friendly staff, but problem rooms and horrifying coffee. WHY do these redesigned hotels insist on installing sliding bathroom doors that don't actually close, and with a glass door? C'mon. Really?Also: nice continental breakfast had the most awful coffee I have ever had in a hotel. That bad.This is a great business Hotel - great staff, modern, spacious rooms with a sitting area, desk, nice beds, flat screen TV's - the rooms are very comfy.  Free Wi-Fi, a really great breakfast - one of the best complimentary spreads I've seen at a business hotel.  In the evening there is live music in the lobby / bar area.  I would stay here again - any other hotel would charge you for Wi-Fi and breakfast. They have computers that are easy to access and a printer in the lobby - this hotel has everything for the business travler - or the tourist.  Oh - nice touch is the infused water in the lobby - today it's cucumber, lemon / Orange and a berry water.I come to this hotel at least once a month. On every visit I am welcomed with smiling faces, and a willingness to make each stay here the best one yet. The rooms are clean and well layed out. I love the big couches and large tv to veg out to as soon as I get into the room. The food is pretty good and available 24/7 also. The location is great. You are right next to the Listening Room and walking distance to Broadway.This was my first time staying at the Hyatt Hotel in downtown, Nashville. The Hyatt employees, Dave and Kelly N., definitely helped smooth the check-in process upon arrival. They were very friendly, eager to help, and social with us, so you definitely get a warm and welcoming vibe when you arrive. We even were surprised with a celebratory bottle of champagne with nice glasses to help kick start my birthday in the right direction! I felt so special since no other hotel has done that for me before, thanks guys! The hotel is well maintained, very clean and has wonderful modern decor. There is also a lounging area on the right side with comfortable couches, TV's, and even a mini office-looking computer station (free-wifi). I booked a room that had 2 queen beds and 1 couch. The couch is actually a pull-out couch so it could comfortably sleep two people. Every room, ours included, has it's own refrigerator. The safety of the hotel is top-notch. The elevator requires you to scan your key-card (room key)  prior to entering your floor level to ensure you are a guest at the Hyatt. The location itself is very safe and in the heart of downtown so everything (bars, restaurants, nightlife, shops) is literally less then 5 minutes walking distance. Parking: A bit pricey. $25 to self park over night &amp; $28 to valet over night. They have their own parking garage which is convenient since it is connected to the hotel, but the only downside is that it's a little small. We drove around a few times to find a spot until someone left. There's a lot of parking spaces and lots near the hotel tho (literally across the street), so you don't have to look far. Overall, my friends are I were VERY pleased with our stay at the Hyatt. The hotel as well as staff definitely made a great lasting impression on us and we will be returning! I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone! Whether you're looking to book for vacation, business trip, bachelorette, or bachelor party, the hotel will NOT disappoint. The location is perfect and one to two blocks away from Broadway Street which is where you wanna be, the staff is friendly and helpful, the rooms are very clean, the place has it's stuff together aka it's very presentable. If you read my previous reviews on other hotels which I stayed at ...you'll know I'm not kidding, I'm giving it the credit it deserves.What a great place this is.    This is one of the larger Hyatt Places I have stayed.   The service has been exceptional.   The larger family room and dining area has been a real plus.  They just ran a fedex package up to my room.   The location is right in the heart of all of the sites.So after an 11 hour drive, this hotel absolutely made us all feel better.  The front desk was warm and smiling even at 930pm.  The rooms were beautiful and for once the pictures didn't do them justice.  Wow!While the hotel was a little pricey, I am glad we booked it.  The room was very nice and larger than a traditional 2 bed room and it had a very nice free continental breakfast included.  It is also conveniently located downtown and the staff was always very friendly.  I would definitely recommend staying in this hotel while visiting Nashville.Loved staying here. The location is wonderful. So close to downtown and fun things to do. An easy Uber away from all other parts of town. Very close to a wonderful walking/bike paths on and across the River. Great staff. Wonderful views. They even had live music to keep in line with the downtown Nashville feel. Not a lot of crowd, but it was a slow weekend. I bet it's a blast when there is something big happening and the hotel fills up.Solid 3.5 starsPros: -updated rooms-gym/pool available-free breakfast (that's much better than other reviews give it credit for)-Close to downtown and music city center-clean-friendly managementCons- -The extra security measures to allow you on to a floor are somewhat of a pain and don't offer that much more security-the bed wasn't hugely comfortable, but that's a personal preference type thing-the front desk staff rarely acknowledged me unless I was standing right in front of them and that was strange to me. Overall, this is a great business hotel and it's in a great location. I would return, but don't expect 5 star treatment here.Two words: FRAT. HOUSE.The Hyatt Place Nashville Downtown is a boot-tappin', ye-hawin', rabble-rousin' time, y'all!  Management knows it--this is the only hotel I've ever stayed in that comes with earplugs on the bedside table.  It's also the kind of place where you might walk home from the bars on Broadway to find a lil cowgirl puking her brains out in the parking lot while your own going out companion offers her a hair tie.  (Purely hypothetical, of course...)I booked the Hyatt Place via Expedia and still plunked down $408/night.  Exsqueeze me?!  For this price, I expected a little more swag.  While there is a late night menu at the bar, they do not offer room service.  My fellow boot-tappin' ye-hawers also had frequent trouble with their key cards malfunctioning.  Not a deal breaker, but definitely a nuisance.  Not suggested for a business trip or family vacation, but (if you can find a good deal) this just the sort of spot you might want to invite 23 of your closed gal-pals for a weekend of civilized binge drinking.Really nice hotel. The room I stayed in was very spacious. Very modern and clean. A plus was the black out curtains, more like black hole curtains, let no light in. Loved it for getting to bed early in the evening. Or sleeping in... The only thing I didn't like is that sound in the hallways traveled very well. I could easily hear people having normal conversations all the way down the hall late at night, sort of irritating but it would never hurt to get some sort of sound dampening wall hangings or something. Great location with great staff. But please do something about the poor free coffee in this hotel in the morning, seriously... It's sort of bad, even though it's free. I would totally stay here in the future.Came here with a group of ladies for a bachelorette party and we were blown away by what we got for the price of our stay. The Nashville-themed decor was super fun, the staff was impeccably nice, the rooms were gorgeous and everything had that squeaky-clean feeling that you want in a hotel. We loved that Broadway and our favorite bars / restaurants were a short walk away from us, and the breakfast included in our stay was beyond our expectations.I would not hesitate to stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Music City!Clean and new. Great breakfast buffet that is complimentary. Pretty expensive rooms that aren't that impressive, but we're downtown so, what do ya do? Least favorite part: bathroom door is a sliding door that doesn't latch/close. It would be nice to shower in peace. Overall an okay place, but you could probably get better for the same price. Most expensive parking too.From what I understand, this Hyatt is pretty new. Opening in November of 2013, this place still has that ""new hotel smell."" I stayed here for a conference and thoroughly enjoyed my time here.This place has a very ideal location. About two blocks from the Omni and within walking distance to the Music City Center, The Shermerhorn, the Country Music Hall of Fame, Bridgestone Arena, Broadway Street and so much more! I could easily walk to all my destinations for the conference.The lobby is a bit small, but it's nice. The check-in counter greets you immediately when you walk in and there are really nice seating areas to the left and right of the counter. I didn't get to pay close attention to the details of the seating, but it looked very comfy. The rooms were nice. Very standard, but also very comfortable. Two doubles beds with a small sectional sofa, a desk, a TV, a small wardrobe and a shower/tub combo. We got there around 4pm and our rooms were ready. Everything was crisp and clean when we got into our rooms.I didn't spend much time in my room other than sleeping, but I was more than happy to crawl into that bed when it came time to crash. By the time I reached my room at the end of the day, I was beyond exhausted and the bed was a welcomed relief. I don't know how to describe the bed...it had just the right amount of firmness to it while still sinking into it. The pillows were wonderful. Fluffy, clean and comfortable. The bedding was all simple white, but sooo comfortable. I was so comfortable that getting out of bed in the morning was really hard.Each time I came back to my room the beds were made and the room was tidied up. Hyatt Place considers themselves a ""green"" hotel in the sense that they won't bring extra towels unless you leave them on the floor. They want you to hang up towels and reuse them - which I do anyway. They also change the bed linens every three days (or whenever you check-out and they get ready for the next guest), but they'll change the linens every day if you ask them. Wifi and breakfast is included with your stay, which was awesome. Being there for work I needed access to the Internet and I had no trouble using their WiFi. It worked throughout the hotel on both my phone and my laptop. I didn't stay to experience breakfast, unfortunately. From what I heard, it's a nice hearty meal. I had to run to the conference and eat the food there instead.The only thing I didn't like is the entrance to the hotel. It's a single automatic door. You have to enter single file and no one can enter or exit at the same time. That can be a hassle if you're getting dropped off via taxi and have a lot of luggage to carry in. And from what I saw, there's only two doors to enter/exit from. One at the front of the hotel and one on the back. And the back door was unlocked when I came back late one night (past midnight).I would highly recommend staying here if you're ever in the Nashville area. Prime location and comfortable rooms make this place nice and the WiFi will keep me coming back.Clean and close to Broadway, perfect spot. $20 for parking.This hotel seems to have nailed everything that millennial business travelers want: great location with easy access to good restaurants and nightlife, a local feel, seamless wifi everywhere, comfortable beds, and places to congregate with other travelers so you don't have to just work from a laptop in your room (with bonus live music).Great gym, nice pool, WSJs galore, mediocre free breakfast (but hey--easy access to good restaurants).  I haven't stayed at a Hyatt in a couple of years. After this visit, methinks that will change.Would definitely stay here again!ProsVery friendly and welcoming staff - always kind and helpful!Great locationClean, well-lit roomsDecent, simple breakfast - suited me perfectlyGood water pressureDespite having a construction-facing window, I rarely noticed any noiseUpdated equipment in the fitness centerNice pool areaFresh apples and fruit water at entryFriendly, quick and efficient maintenance team (we lost a few rings behind a fixed-position dresser - very quickly resolved!)ConsAir conditioning wasn't very effective at night - although I do aim to sleep colder than mostLap swim isn't an option in the pool because of the step placementI considered it over-priced, but in the end I was pleased with the experienceNice location, close to downtown Nashville. But do not eat the food, nachos have cheese sauce not real cheese  and room service isn't actually delivered to your room. The rooms are nice. Drink the Jack Daniels Sinatra.Great staff, clean rooms and live entertainment in the lobby bar in the evenings is a plus. They don't have room service, but their kitchen is open 24 hours. You can call in your order, then go pick it up. It's a little pricey for what you get. They have free breakfast in the morning. The eggs look and taste like they came from a powder, so stick with the great selection of fruits, cereals, breads and the yogurt bar.","Excellent staff. Super friendly and the rooms were very nice with ample space and very clean.I would highly recommend staying here if you are heading to Nashville. Broadway is only a 5 min walk and the view of the Cumberland River from the hotel is beautiful. All of the staff were very polite and friendly. We had so many questions about the area  and everyone was patient and very resourceful. The lobby is amazing. There is live music, a full bar and you can order food anytime. The breakfast was great. They had sausages, eggs, breakfast sandwiches, French Toast, cereal, bagels and biscuits with gravy. Our room was very spacious. We had two queen beds, a foldout couch and a beautiful view. The cordless phones were a neat touch and they had an MP3 player where we could play our iPhone music. We did try to order room service one day after 12pm and they never came. I saw another reviewer had the same problem. It still wasn't enough of an issue to take a star away. I will definitely be back and highly recommend this hotel.The Hyatt is a BEAUTIFUL hotel and the staff are overly accomodating! They do an amazing job. Here are some helpful notes:Lobby - beautiful. The decor is awesome and fits the theme of the city well. The free infused water is awesome.Rooms -The rooms are very clean and well maintained. They have new TVs. The bathrooms are very clean and have great water pressure.Food - The FREE breakfast is awesome. The drinks at the bar are great too! Location - awesome to downtown! It's only like 2 blocks to the bars and main attractions. Staff - so NICE and accomodating!  Everyone! They are great - really anticipate your needs and execute flawlessly. We visited for a bachelorette weekend. They manage groups very well. Katelyn is amazing - the reservations were managed to perfection!  It was a  VERY simple check in process and they even had a few rooms available for early check-in. Check out was also very easy.Also,  FREE Internet.Stayed here for a conference in June and it was A-OK. Here's my breakdown of pros and cons:Pros:-Live music in the lobby at some points during my stay-Free fruit-infused water by the main door (strawberry + kiwi = the bomb)-Free coffee in the morning-Great views (obviously depending on your room - I had a view of downtown from mine)Cons:-Breakfast. I know what you're going to say - but it's FREE! How can you complain about free food? Well, here's the thing: I was here for a work conference and I get per diem for my meals when I travel except in instances where I get them for free. I would rather pay (and get compensated by my company) for a quality breakfast than eat the free one they provide. It's the kind of poor-quality food you would expect at a low-tier hotel: thawed, sad-looking cut fruit; cheap muffins and pastries (I'm assuming they tasted bad but I'm vegan so I didn't try them); sticky tins of jelly and cardboard bread. -It's off the main drag a bit. -Food choices are limited if you're a vegan (they have chips and salsa for $10...oh well, I guess they are hotel prices).The hotel is funny clean with friendly staff. The stay comes a great breakfast selection which is a plus. The location is downtown near Broadway and near the country music center. There are not to many restaurants around the hotel , however , the hotel's bar is open 24 hours. At the hotel they should extend their menu selection. Overall, I had a good stay. Highlight is the complimentary water with fruit infused when entering the building.Awesome location.   But price is set like this is a hyatt grand and it is not. It is a very clean hotel but it is not high end. They have free breakfast which is nice but not what I want specifically from my hotel.  But this is one of the best locations in town and the hotel is very newWhen we arrived there was no self parking so they offered to valet our car for the price of self park, but when we checked out 5 days later they tried charge us 3 days of valet. we didnt move our car and they did not tell us that self parking was available. they argued with my husband about it but did finally remove the charge. Not luxury if that is what you are wanting. We stayed there last weekend for the realtor conference. Totally disappointed. However it was definitely Clean and I liked the room set up and decor.The staff was friendly but seem to have had to training what so ever....AND No room service...what?! Food was inconsistence and slow!One star for clean and nice...but that doesn't make up for incompetence.The Hyatt Place Downtown Nashville is a great place to stay! Just got back from a bachelorette weekend and couldn't have been happier with our stay. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the rooms were spacious and the complimentary breakfast was delicious! It has great proximity to Broadway and other downtown attractions. Definitely a good choice!This is my third time to Nashville. I've stayed at the Renaissance and the Sheraton on my last two trips (great experiences) My husband and I are here celebrating our anniversary. I have to say we've stayed at other Hyatt's before and had great experiences but I'm very disappointed with the Hyatt Place here in Nashville. No concierge to help with activities, no brochures on activities, our first night here we were at the bar after a long flight and ordered some food at the bar the lady that was cooking was the most miserable employee and made us feel uncomfortable for disturbing her with a food order. Then after a day of activities we come back to our room and either the room is not made up or we had housekeeping walk in while we were napping in the late afternoon. Employees down in the lobby just standing around talking  and are not very friendly. For as expensive as this place is I wasn't too impressed with the rooms. There are so many hotels to chose from in this great city. I won't be staying here again.We rent the conference room every year in this hotel and we couldn't be happier. The staff is incredible, helpful and very friendly. The hotel is beautiful and clean. We will definitely recommend this hotel to others.Best service I've received at a hotel in years. Everyone was friendly. Everyone. From front desk to valet to cleaning crew. Nice rooms. Great location. Walk to Broadway.Stayed at the Hyatt in early May for a bachelorette party. I can't think of one negative comment about my stay. All of the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating - from the valet to the front desk to the cleaning staff and even the maintenance guy. Food was delicious too! Definitely will stay here again whenever I get the chance to visit Nashville again!This Hotel was fabulous.  I cannot say more about how friendly and accommodating the staff was for my stay here.  Every time we walked in the front door we felt very welcome.  I celebrated my 50th birthday here with six of my girlfriends. The staff sent a nice bottle of red wine and a birthday care package to my room, which was really thoughtful.   The free breakfast was good (when we got up early enough to go!)   The hotel is clean and well maintained.  We did have a problem with a clogged toilet one morning, but maintenance arrived quickly with an auger and fixed the problem.  The maintenance worker was friendly and had a great sense of humor!  The hotel is located within walking distance of Broadway,  many great restaurants,  and the Country Music Hall of Fame.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Thank you Hyatt Staff for making out stay in Nashville great!Great Staff, Great Location!This is the place to stay. Close to everything and a well -trained staff who great you immediately and know the difference between doing a good job and a great job.We will see you next time!Thank you!Great location, just a 5 minute walk to Broadway where the best bars and night scene is! The hotel was clean and staff very nice. I would definitely come back here next time I am in Nashville.Great location close to everything.  Staff is awesome.  We actually moved to this hotel after spending one night in another local hotel and not being happy.  Everything about this place is top notch.  Would highly recommend to friends.  Morgen and Nina are the best!My girlfriends and I stayed at the Hyatt this past weekend for a little getaway. The staff was super friendly the whole time - the lobby offered live music, free infused waters, snack bar and am extensive free morning breakfast. I gave the Hyatt 3 stars because during our stay, one of the elevators broke which caused a lot of angst getting to and from our room. Although they opened up the freight elevator to the guests, two elevators is hardly enough for a hotel that size. I spent more time waiting for the elevator than enjoying what the Hyatt had to offer.The Hyatt Place Downtown was generally great and I very much enjoyed my stay there. First of all, you can tell the hotel is super new, which I liked. There's nothing like a creepy stain on the carpet to make our old friend Insomnia come barging through the door. This place had none of that. My room was spacious, clean, and even had a couch. A couch! I ended up actually lounging on the couch a ton, which I didn't really expect. A super nice bonus to this room. The bathroom was also great-- bright, clean, modern fixtures. I'd never heard of the amenity brand before, but everything worked decently well, and I'm sorta picky about that stuff.I love that the wifi is free and pretty fast! I've recently stayed at a string of hotels that only had slow, expensive wifi, so this was an extra-welcome amenity.The included breakfast is pretty much your normal hotel continental breakfast, though they have some additional egg sandwiches that were a nice tough.My only complaint is that the service is not suuuuper great if you're calling from the room (it's perfectly good downstairs, in person). One night I called to ask a question about hooking up my laptop to the tv (something that the hotel info card said was possible) and got put on hold forever, then told an engineer would come, then no one ever showed up. When I called down again, the host seemed baffled. I also wasn't able to get a super straight answer about late check-out when I called down, but cleared it up in person. These are pretty minor details to me, so not work a whole star knockdown.Overall, I'd definitely recommend the hotel if you have business that brings you to downtown Nashville.Very nice place. Rooms are very nice, comfortable and clean. Service is excellent. They have their own private parking garage to keep your vehicle safe. They have a pool, but not a hot tub, and a great little workout facility. Live music at night, a solo acoustic artist. Their bar is nice and they had a small, very well presented, tasty and varietal continental breakfast. A short walk from the Broadway strip of downtown bars, food and shops. I recommend, although there are plenty of incredibly nice accommodations in downtown Nashville. This is also located just a minutes walk from the Country Music Hall of Fame.Highly recommend this hotel. We were able to get a room at the last minute despite it being CMA Fan Fest week in Nashville. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Our room was more than I expected. King size bed plus a cozy sitting area. The bar in the lobby is a nice touch.","Just stayed here for 2 nights with our 3 kids and were very happy!  We are sometimes hotel snobs - moving hotels if we are not satisfied and this was not the case.  The room was super clean.  There were 2 queen beds us a pull out couch (which had nice clean bedding each night).  The bathroom was clean and spacious.  Unlike other comments, I thought the free breakfast was great.  Reminded me of a breakfast buffet that you would pay for.  The cook made a special meal for my husband who can't eat cheese.  The staff was super friendly with my kids, showering them with Easter candy.  They even gave us a special treat bag full of goodies for the kids for the day (fruit, granola, raisins).  Plus it's a quick walk from Broadway so a great location.  I would definitely recommend this hotel - a great place for families!We have stayed at a few Hyatts. This one was probably my least favorite. We stayed at the opryland one just days prior and sadly could not get a room there since that location was all book, so this was the next best thing. If you are there for business this is the hotel for you. The beds aren't as comfortable as other locations. The staff wasn't nearly as friendly as I would have liked. If I approach you and you are working the front desk and aren't busy, I shouldn't have to wait for you to speak to me. I was also disappointed to learn that we had to pay for parking, shouldn't that be included in the price of the room?  I think it wouldn't have been such a shock had they told me that upfront but then again when I checked in they basically asked my name and for a form of payment. The lady didn't even tell me the floor number just handed me a key.  This location is nicely located in downtown and within walking distance to everything. The room was clean atleast.  This is definitely not a family friendly hotel in my opinion and that's what I look for for my family.Free parking on the street after a certain time! Great hotel - staff super friendly! A minute walk to Broadway! Loved the live music in the lobby too -  Rooms are modern and very clean, we even had a couch in our room plus 2 double beds!After reading the reviews on yelp and reviewing the hotel website which promoted itself as a luxury hotel, I booked the room for my 3 night stay. Upon arrival, it was disappointing from the moment we stepped into the lobby. I thought I was in the wrong place! It felt like a low end hotel. Cafeteria style bar that doubles as the breakfast area.. No room service but there was basic food and water available! We tried the breakfast and it was barely edible!  McDonald's is a step up from what we were offered. What a treat after traveling all day to your ""luxury"" hotel. My room was clean... The second day, maid service hadn't arrived by late afternoon and when we returned late that evening, the cleaning was sub par and no fresh wash cloths were left for us.  For $399 per night, I expected  very close to what my colleagues had for accommodations at the nearby Omni at a lower rate per night!  Their rooms cost less and their entire hotel and rooms were indeed luxurious. Unfortunately, they were sold out. I'm giving this one star only because it was a new hotel and didn't have a worn feel yet. That won't take long since the finishes were very low end! We won't return.We had a great stay at the Hyatt in Nashville! We were there their 1st weekend of opening and booked last minute! The hotel has great amenities complimentary breakfast, refrigerators in the room and our double bed room also had a sofa which was a nice plus. The staff was friendly upon arrival and check in was very smooth. The only thing that I could complain about was the abundance of lady bugs in our room! I have never seen that before, I know they are good luck :) however when there are 10 at once it got irritating, we did tell the front desk a couple times and they were still there. It took about 5-7 desk encounters &amp; phone calls to get it taken care of by our 3rd night there. I do give them the benefit of the doubt since it was their 1st weekend and prime lady bug season! The Valet guys would not let you park for 5 minutes and run to the room which was frustrating, not so friendly except 1 named Mohammed we met on our last day. Broadway Street is a block and a half away which was great too! We would definitely stay there again if we return to Nashville!Driving cross country from New York for 2 weeks and this is still one of my favorite hotels ever. Really awesome and authentic, modern decor in the lobby and rooms. Everyone was really pleasant and always greeted us. The prices are a lot better than other hotels that are located directly in Broadway. This place is a 3 minute walk from broadway and is probably nicer than the others. Free breakfast was delicious. Super clean.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-nashville-downtown-nashville,Hilton Nashville Downtown,3.5,$$$,74,"Stayed here Jan 15 - Jan 18th room 727...corner room. LocationThe location of this hotel can't get much better. It's a block from Broadway and everywhere you want to be in downtown Nashville. Our room directly overlooked the Bridgestone Arena which was really cool. We were able to walk everywhere and only a 10 minute ride from the airport. RoomOur room had a separate living room area with two couches and two small tables, a desk and a large TV. We were able to hang out here with our friends before heading out and close the doors to our bedroom which was nice. My only real complaint about the room would be no air vents, WHY!! And second, the lack of counter space, as large as the bathroom was there was only 1 small, tiny, counter top with the sink...ServiceTurndown service was ok. They came every day in the late afternoon, which was fine because we were out exploring. There were a few exceptions...we really didn't have enough small towels...we used the one washcloth we were given, I left it in the shower to dry and they took it away, but did not replace it with a new one! I also used the shower cap, left it hanging to dry, they also took this and did not leave me a new one! That was pretty annoying. We left a pile of dirty towels in the closest and they remained there for our entire stay...we requested a late checkout on our last day and the maid showed up at 8am to clean! We told them we had a late checkout and to come back...so they came back at 10am, my husband again told them our checkout was at 2pm and that was when we would be leaving. AmbianceThe hotel is gorgeous, the atrium is really impressive. On Saturday night they had a pianist playing music, kudos to her for playing some Taylor Swift!Something Really CoolThis was our first time using the keyless entry on our phone, we didn't go to the front desk once during our stay, we checked in on our phone, selected our room, downloaded our key and were able to use that to enter our room each time. This was fabulous!I usually stay at Hilton whether I'm traveling for work or pleasure. This experience has definitely changed that, I am very disappointment. Do not stay here!The bathtub did not drain well, you basically took a bath and a shower at the same time because it filled up so darn quickly. There was no fridge in the room. We had a 15th century coffee maker, with only decaf coffee! When I asked for regular (caffeinated) coffee, the staff replied ""I can get you some but I'd have to go all the way downstairs"" ummm okay?! And house keeping kept putting Keurig cups in our room, I asked around and apparently everybody else on our floor had a Keurig. Room service knocks on the door every morning, yes even if you have the ""DO NOT DISTURB"" sign outside your door. It was very annoying, while I'm on vacation the last thing I want to do is wake up early. I am trying to relax but there was nothing relaxing about my stay at this terrible hotel. During check out, our receipt had $30 charge per night for valet parking when we didn't even park our car with them... After asking the front desk to take off the charges they said with an attitude ""ugh next time you should notify us before"" instead of apologizing. Which is ridiculous, it's YOUR job to charge customers properly not the customers' responsibility. I don't work at the Hilton, thank you. I only give them 2 stars instead of 1 because SOME of their staff was friendly and their live music at the bar was good. You can stay anywhere else in Downtown Nashville (even closer to Broadway) for the same price. The only reason I chose this hotel is because I'm a HHonors member but never again. Also, I am a gold member and I did not receive any upgrade upon check in which is odd considering they do that at most hotels. I'm so disappointed in Hilton right now, my experience was just unacceptable.Self parked when I arrived. The next morning I tried leaving the parking garage and experienced a small glitch at the credit card terminal.  The terminal would not issue me a receipt. I pushed the speaker button requesting assistance and was very quickly answered and helped. I gave them my email address and they assured me I would have a receipt in my email within 15 minutes. After one hour had gone by and still no email I began to wonder.When I returned to the hotel a visited the front desk, I assumed they would have a telephone number to the parking garage management company. No they did not. Front desk sent me to valet desk and they did not have a telephone number either. When I returned to the front desk I was told the only way to contact the parking garage management was to go back to the garage and push the button requesting assistance. So another trip down to the garage, standing there at the payment terminal trying to have a conversation about my problem over a call box !The gentleman I spoke to here at the parking management company finally sent me an email receipt. Which just happen to have their toll free telephone number. The number you would think the Hilton front desk would have access to. I decided to speak to the MOD and share with them my experience and to give them the telephone number they profess not to know. MOD assured me only 5% of their customers self parked and my inconvenience wasn't anything they had anything to do with and they should not be expected to be of assistance to any of their guests that self park. Extremely poor customer service!!I expected better at a Hilton property.What a beautiful hotel!  This quite possibly could be the best location for any hotel in the US! It is surrounded by the Bridgestone arena, the symphony hall , the convention center, country music hall of fame, bars, restaurants, theatres, and then some more bars!  Now let's get real......  No self parking, there is a public pay parking lot but It is not owned by the hotel.  Valet parking is $34 a day plus tax and tip. It is a huge hotel with one set of elevators.  They have no pool, Jacuzzi,or spa for the price we paid I expected more. That is the reason for 4 stars.  Overall I love the location and hotel but they missed the Mark on amenities.I had a great experience from beginning to end. This is right next to where the Nashville Predators play and just a minute from LP Field (where the Tennessee Titans play). I posted pictures of my room (1 king bed suite) and was very impressed. I would definitely recommend if you are coming in for a sporting or music event.Perks:- Valet makes parking easy- Complimentary Wifi (if you are an HHonors member, which is free to sign-up)- Room was clean and fully stocked- Great proximity to many food/recreation areas downtown- Check in/out was super easyQuirks:- A little pricy during special events- Some room windows are attached to the lobby (which when it gets rowdy at night can sort of be heard)- Card key required to take elevator up (so don't lose it)Such a great hotel in a great location within walking distance to Broadway. The hotel is fabulous. My room had a view of Broadway.  I had a suite that was just beautiful. The beds are like sleeping on a cloud. This was such a great stay and experience. Highly recommend! The club room had great appetizers in the afternoon. Valet was super quick too!This is the best Hilton I have visited.  This Hilton is right behind Broadway- where lots of popular bars are.  I stayed here for a conference and they exceeded my expectations. The hotel is beautiful and very open.  When I reached the desk I was efficiently checked in and warmly welcomed to the Hilton.  I booked a room on the 10th floor. It was clean and comfortable.  I was given infused water daily with turndown service and coffee and weather information were available for me near the elevators daily- it pays to be a member of Hilton Honors.Housekeeping was reliable and noninvasive.  The room was quiet and the bath was adequately furnished.  The honors lounge was great.  The breakfast offerings included hot egg dishes, fruit, breads, yogurt, yogurt parfaits, juices, and milk.  Evening offerings included warm appetizers, chips, soft drinks, whole fruit, and other snacks.  Overall service and amenities were great.Location location location!  if you want to take advantage of the Broadway honky-tonk bar hopping scene, then this is the place to stay. Just a short half-block walk from the hotel lobby and you are in the heart of party central. No driving, no parking, no cabs.All the rooms at this property are suites. That means they have a completely separate sleeping area and living area.  Rooms have all been remodeled and have a contemporary modern feel to them.The overall vibe of this lis upscale.The bedding was plush and you are sure to sleep like a baby. We ate casual lunches and breakfasts on the property. They were standard hotel fare - not special.  But then you don't go to Nashville to eat at a Hilton hotel.You'll find it easy to get to this property from the airport, only a $12 fare with Uber. Next time you're traveling to Nashville and want convenience combined with a contemporary upscale property, then staying at the downtown Hilton should be your first choice.It's not often that I travel for business these days, but I had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton Nashville a Downtown for a single night mid-week not too long ago. It's also not often when I find myself wishing I had more time to spend in my hotel room when traveling to new places, but again, this was the case with this place.  The hotel is an all-suite location, so each room has a separate living/sitting/office area. There was plenty of room and I only managed use a fraction of the amenities offered.The bathroom was equally spacious with tons of counter space, which was a huge plus! The bed was super comfortable, which made it extra hard to get up when my alarm rang after my single-night stay.The staff was friendly and accommodating. The concierge/valet staff were very friendly when storing my bag as well.I can't speak to the price of the room as my office picked up the tab (and I never saw a bill), but word to the wise - wifi is an additional $10/day for up to 3 devices (which I still don't understand to be acceptable in 2015).Despite the unacceptable wifi charge, when I'm in Nashville again, I'll definitely plan on staying at the Hilton Downtown. I'm looking forward to it!Hilton hotel is located in the heart of downtown Nashville. Self parking is available for $20 a day or valet parking at $30 a day with unlimited in/out daily access. The hotel is contemporarily designed with a piano playing in the beautiful lobby. The piano is a nice touch but it is LOUD and it plays until 9pm every night. Uggggh which is late. It should stop playing at 7pm. The rooms are neat and tidy with modern fixtures. Nothing extra or special is offered. The bed is comfortable with the same bedding as Hilton Garden.Regarding the amenities:Dear Hilton Management, the Hilton hotel would be a HUGE success if you offered similar amenities like at Hilton Garden. 1) Such as giving free bottled water upon check in versus giving nothing or a silly cookie at the Double Tree. After traveling it is a nice touch to receive the free water. It is also great how Hilton Garden has free bottles of water available throughout the day in the lobby. 2) FREE WI-FI...come on in this day and age WI-FI should be free at every hotel and especially at the high end Hilton hotels. Free WI-FI is a necessity not a nice to have so make it FREE.3) WSJ should be free and readily available, not just USA Today.In the future, I will not stay at a Hilton hotel if there is a Hilton Garden available. As a frequent business traveler the free amenities mentioned above are deal breakers for me especially at the high price Hilton hotel charges, it is not worth it. The days of pay more and get nothing is so dated.Upgraded upon checkin as I'm a gold member. Executive Lounge was great. Good breakfast. Upscale rooms and amenities. Room service was good. I had a wine glass that wasn't dirty but lots of smudges and to much cork in wine (I can handle a little bit). I called and they opened a new bottle in front of me. Very nice. Drinks in bar were really good! They make an excellent ""Tennessee Mule"". Great area to work in room. Beds so comfortable... even though I work long hours there the beds provide a wonderful night sleep. LOCATION Can't be beat.My experience here has been great, hotel quality is on top, food service is beyond anything I have had at previous suites. Quality of the room is very good, my favorite part were the pillows which I wish I could take home with me, otherwise I recommend staying here it's downtown and close to many bars and restaurants. In the heart of downtown this is one of the best hotels in the area.I have never stayed here but have been to parties.  A nice corporate hotel in a great location.  Best of all it is great for urban hiking potty breaks and a sit down by the piano to rest your feet.  Quiet and no one ever disturbs you.Great hotel. There is one outstanding employee that should be recognized for providing the best service we have ever had. His name is Cliff @ the front desk. He squared us away with our parking situation and spoke to the manager and the hotel covered 1 day valet charge. That's huge. We are from Hawaii and that's what we call the ALOHA spirit, even here in Nashville. The entire staff so far has been very helpful from the valet to the front desk. We're planning on making Nashville an annual vacation spot for years to come. Hilton has been so good to us and we'll continue our loyalty for years to come.I was met by Will when I came in at 1am. He was pleasant, helpful and kind. He accommodated my questions and was extremely patient. Thank you WillGreat location, very nice rooms.  Very nice work out facilities that are open 24 hours a day.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.  Attended a conference in the hotel, staff and facilities were both very nice.   Need a key card to operate the elevator which is really a pain in the Butt.   Don't understand why Hilton needs to nickel and dime their guests by charging $10 a day for Internet when rooms run around $250.What a beautiful hotel, the suites are huge and has a great layout. When you walk in it has a huge grand entrance and it's very clean.  It is walking distance to lots of great restaurants and stores so that is a great plus for me.Having worked in hotels for many years, hotels much better than this one, at that, I am appalled at how little this hotel seems to know about customer service. I understand that my family and I stayed there during a very high traffic weekend, but NEVER in my life have I had a manager talk to me the way Jeff did. I managed a 4 star hotel. I understand that the shiz hits the fan on a regular basis, but you cannot think for a second that arguing that you're right is appropriate (amazingly enough, that's completely contradictory to Hilton's satisfaction guarantee...way to go Jeff!! Show me again how little your guests mean to you). Again, having managed a hotel much better than this one in the past, I can't believe that they're surviving with a management team that argues with guests. I shouldn't have to go to corporate to be heard. I shouldn't have to go to corporate to ensure that the room rate I was quoted is what I get charged. You'd rather lose all revenue on two rooms than just some of it? Really? The hotel itself is pretty. The rooms are nice. Obviously the housekeeping department is on point. But their front desk staff and managers on duty need some retraining...especially in reference to the Hilton Brand Promise. If you can't do what's expected of you, don't work in hospitality. Jeff, I think it's time you find another line of work.Limited use of electricity, new to the area. Unable to charge phone, limited / no internet access.Terrible hotel for a conference. The A/V contact had a terrible attitude, was extremely lazy and really had no intention of doing his job. I had to hire a private A/V consultant to come in and help me at which time the live stream for the conference was a total bust. The hotel is beautiful, but the service is poor. Our room was spacious and very classy and the bar downstairs is A+, but the A/V tech just killed the entire experience.","The positives about the hotel: 1. Beautiful inside with a nice lobby. 2. Spacious, nice and clean rooms with a comfortable bed. 3. It is in the perfect spot for most things you would want to do in down town Nashville. Right next to the Country Music Hall of Fame and the bars with live music. Pretty much can walk anywhere. The negatives: 1. Even after you have paid $400+ a night they charge you either $30/day for valet or $20/day to park in their parking garage. A huge rip off in my opinion. 2. When they come to clean your room in between the days of your stay, they clean only what they want to. They left our room service trays and plates where we had left them. 3. I only ran into maybe one friendly person. The rest just seemed cold and unfriendly. 4. Breakfast was included in our stay but it was worthless. Unless you like eating miniature quiches a little fruit and cereal you won't be full or feel like you ate anything worth a darn. I'm not expecting anything grand, but maybe some eggs, meat and potatoes? I still mostly enjoyed my stay but I would come prepared to pay a lot more for parking, etc. the next time.This hotel is great. I love the open model in the lobby. The rooms are very clean and nice. It is so close to Broadway you really can't go wrong.I REALLY really like the Hutton Hotel in Nashville, but I gotta say it's a little too far from downtown. When you can walk out the door (even on an unseasonably cold and dreadful winter day) and be on Broadway immediately, location is everything. This hotel is no dump. Very nice room (ahem- suite) that was much larger than my first apartment with a super nice view of the something or other museum (I don't know my Country Music). Gotta say I really dig the honky-tonk, it's a short walk to Broadway from here. Parking is a little weird here but easy to figure out. Great service, great location, great greatness.Great experience. Well maintained &amp; a lot of attention to detail. The rooms were very clean &amp; well maintained. The only thing missing was a fridge but it was an amazing hotel.I submitted this review on Trip Advisory and it never was posted. I'm not sure what is going on, but I'm determined to let people know what a terrible experience I had and to try to get the Hilton to check up on this hotel. It was poorly managed and dirty. I had a ROACH in my bathroom on the 16th floor. I took a picture and tried to post it over there. I took the stairs to my room (yes on the 16th floor, because the elevators were so sloooooooow. Then I had to scoot around service workers who had staged rolling carts in the stairwells to service a break area - fire safety hazard. Our rooms were not ready at 3pm, check in time, when we arrived. I waited until 5pm. The room was sloppy, not well made beds, etc.. I could go on, but those were the highlights. I'm not writing this again.vAmazing and beautiful place to stay! The staff was extra friendly. The room was huge and very clean. The meals were perfect- the biggest breakfast I've ever seen!  I would absolutely go back in fact I think I could live there!!  Great all around experience!!Awesome views of downtown, and walkable to all the Honky Tonks on Broadway. Great amenities, beautiful lobby, and the staff are accommodating.  We wanted snacks at 4 am (bet you can't guess why) and Rocco was so nice to help us out.  Travel a lot and honestly haven't found a hotel with staff more willing to make you happy.Fairly poor service from this hotel. My husband and I were there for a wedding and valet parked.  We were told it was $10. Not ideal but ok. Went to the front desk and paid w a debit card and went ok to enjoy the wedding. Fast forward 3 days and out bank account reflects $32 charge from the Hilton. What?!? My husband calls to inquire as we only agreed to pay $10. They assure us the remaining $22 will be credited back to us. Another week goes by with no credit and multiple calls to management of the hotel with nothing. $22 may not seem like a lot to some but it is to me. Plus the principle of it is worth more than anything. I hope this is resolved soon. Otherwise the hotel is beautiful. I would just be careful of a bait and switch.Nicely remodeled rooms.  Very courteous and trained staff.  The room rate of 199 per night did not include parking at 30 bucks a day nor triple taxes at another 30-40 per day.  What is very interesting is that there is no complimentary coffee or tea.  Also wait staff need tie clips as their ties were filthy from wiping down tables.  All in all a fair stay and very close to Broadway Honky Tonks.  Make sure your room is on the front side of building. Too noisy on the Broadway side.I've stayed here before and a good hotel for business travellers especially when your out in a 2 days. Easy parking good Staff and Room Service is done right no go backs. I enjoyed the stay here and the rooms are comfortable. Hope to come back.Rooms were nice enough, and the location was very close to Broadway where are the Honky Tonk bars are, which is nice until you want to go to sleep. Sound traveled into the room until 2am. The house keeping kept coming in at 8:30AM, which to me was unacceptable. Way too early for people on vacation.Definitely not worth what you are spending, considering they don't even provide free wifi, or breakfast, or have a pool.booI liked this place, but the service was crap.In the 3 days I stayed, the concierge never answered the phone.  (Triffles, Triffles, I just used Yelp to find a great breakfast, lunch and drink spot.)The location is basically Times Square of Nashville.  Pros and cons there.The rooms/bathrooms were great.  I was in a 1 bedroom suite/king and it was spacious and good.The TV/signal was crap -- about a 3-4 second delay when surfing stations.  The internet is paid -- also crap.  Lastly -- the housekeeping stole my joint (fact), and never brought the extra coffee I asked for/needed.  I mean...so it goes.The staff was super sweet and southern, though.  I was just hoping for better customer service.Stayed here for 3 nights on a recent family holiday to the USA. The hotel has a great location &amp; friendly staff. When I booked online through the Hilton Honors app it advised me that the hotel was currently renovating rooms, a floor at a time. Once we arrived we discovered that the construction also included the pool which was not mentioned before hand, plus with 2 children on school holidays &amp; summer it was an inconvenience that should have been noted when booking.The internet in your room is charged but free in the lobby. Its the 1st Hilton group hotel I have stayed in worldwide that charges honors members for internet.The shower in our room had mould growing on the wall &amp; when wiped over it came off easily which I think is unacceptable. The shower also filled the bath very quickly so after a 5 minute shower the bath was almost full &amp; took a good 10 minutes to drain once the shower was turned off.If I was to visit Nashville again I would stay at the Hampton Inn 300 meters down the road. It has a pool, free wifi in your room, free breakfast  (not that fancy but better than nothing) &amp; the walk in room rate we were quoted for a family room was $100 US less than what we were paying per night at the Hilton.Under construction. Returned from a long workday to obnoxious construction. After 5. I called to the front desk and they reported it will last until 7. So much for that nap. They offered to move me (already unpacked the night before). If a hotel has rooms away from the construction why do they book guests in miserably loud rooms?  Poor customer serviceWe've stayed at the Downtown Hilton several times over the years and this hotel is not quite the 5 star experience it used to be. They've removed the pool because it 'wasn't in high demand', something that my personal experience contradicts.The cleanliness is no more than a B/B-, our room wasn't vacuumed when we arrived, with crumbs from the last guest everywhere.The staff, while they smiled, had an edge to their expressions. We found them to be 'by the book' polite, but not what you would expect from a brand name that at one time was the gold standard of hotels.The room service menu had been pared down to bare bones.The sports bar was rather slow, where as in years past it was adequately staffed. The bar manager, seeing us sitting there for about 10 minutes said, ""The bartender will be right with you"", rather than taking our order. It was an additional 10 minutes before she came over to us.Next time we're in Nashville, we'll be staying elsewhere, either the Omni or the Hyatt.I absolutely love Hilton. But this particular hotel is in a great location right off Broadway walking distance to the famous Tootsie's, The Ryman and right next door to the Bridgestone Arena.The valet guys are always pleasant and help. The hotel is clean and fresh and the room service is actually good!PROS:The staff is extremely helpful and friendly. They were able to meet all of our needs even with a large group. Clean, decent sized rooms, turn down service, and comfortable roll away bed. The location cannot be beat. CONS:Make sure to get a room facing the front of the hotel. All other rooms are very noisy although you definitely get used to it. The pool was closed when we were there which we already knew but would have been nice to have it.This is about as good as a mid-level chain hotel gets.  Very spacious rooms, with a separate bedroom, two TVs, one in the bedroom, and one in the living room.  Refrigerator and microwave int he room as well as an arm chair and a couch, both comfortable.  Really my only complaints about the room was the lack of outlets near the bed and the expensive ($12 or $14/day) WiFi connection fee. Service was excellent - the bellhop who helped us when checking in was extremely friendly and very helpful with suggestions about his favorite honky tonks.  As others have mentioned, you really can't get a better location than this in Nashville.  You are a few minutes walk from the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Bridgestone arena, and Broadway.  The only reason to not stay here when visiting Nashville is either because it is too expensive or because you are trying to collect points with another hotel chain.Very nice rooms, clean and comfortable. However, the service and management leave a lot to be desired.  The staff seemed to go out of their way to be unhelpful, telling some guests in our party one thing while others something different.  The hotel is also close to several loud bars and music clubs, without adequate sound proofing.  Loud music, traffic, and general crowd noise will be coming straight into your room until 3am.Very nice. Comfortable clean beds. Great service. Close to everything.","I stayed here for three days while on vacation, and I really enjoyed the room and the hotel's location.  We were a minute walk from the main strip and an easy 20 minute drive to any location outside of downtown.  The bed was very comfy, the room spacious and bathroom clean.  I was a little bummed that we didn't have a window facing outside and that you had to pay for WiFi.  Otherwise, I was pretty happy!The staff is incredibly rude. There is no microwave, pool, or breakfast bar. You must pay for the wifi. You would think that after all of the expenses you are charged to stay here that complimentary wifi would at least be included. I am not a fan of this hotel at all. You can easily go somewhere cheaper, that has more accommodations and facilities, who treat you nicer. The staff are just plain rude! This place is all about wanting your money, but not about making you feel as if you are getting something for it.The only good thing about this hotel is the room setup and the restaurant inside, Trattoria il Mulino. We came for business. The room we are in faces the Bridgestone Arena and the noise before and after the hockey game is extremely loud. Music from a local bar has played each of the 3 nights of our stay outside on loud speakers until 2:00 am and later on Saturday nights.   I called the front desk to ask and complain and I was told where the music was coming from and she said, ""you are in The Music City after all.""  Completely unacceptable!  The hotel needs to put high impact windows in the rooms on the stadium side of the building. After my friend and I arrived at the hotel earlier in the evening we tried calling the front desk to ask for restaurant recommendations and the phone rang 25 times and there was no answer so we hung up. Again unacceptable!    The room set up was nice; however management needs to stroll through the rooms to look at the furniture. Stains on upholstered furniture tends to look pretty disgusting.  Also, no continental breakfast for guests?  Really, you are charging an awful lot for your rooms and I would think you would be more customer friendly to get return guests. Finally, I cannot believe that the hotel charges people $3.50 for wi-fi. This appears to be a huge money maker for the hotel to charge every guest for wi-fi. Shame on you! This will be my first and last trip to Nashville!  If you are coming to Nashville, I would highly recommend someplace other than the Hilton.Great rooms. Great location.  Loud music from Broadway :(. But I you are going to be up late the hotel is perfect.This hotel holds a special place in my heart because this is where my husband and I stayed after he proposed to me :) Paul booked the room and let them know he was asking me to marry him, he also worked with the concierge to have a beautiful flower arrangement waiting for me in our room (of my favorite, Stargazer Lillies). The hotels location to downtown Nashville is perfect for walking to all that Broadway/2nd Ave/Printers Alley has to offer... so if you're planning on exploring all the honky tonks, karaoke bars and great dining Nashville has to offer, this IS the hotel to stay at! To our surprise, upon check in, they had upgraded us, complimentary, to the Penthouse Suite and it was nothing short of spectacular! An enormous bedroom, full luxurious spa bathroom, wet bar, full dining table, ridiculously comfy sofa and another full bathroom... it was the most luxurious hotel I've ever stayed in... on a night that I'll never forget! The flower arrangement the hotel procured for my fiance was over the top... and made our room incredibly fragrant. The concierge also arranged champagne, bubble bath and chocolate strawberries to help us celebrate (and all for the standard room rate.... around $190). The hotels lobby is grand and a piano player truly added to it's elegance. We didn't try out the hotel bar, nor did we visit The Palm (which is attached to the hotel)... but the service, the room, the location, the upgrades were fabulous and over and above anything we had expected. We truly recommend the Hilton Nashville Downtown... for romance, for a night on the town, for anything... this hotel is the best!Nice hotel, but the $99 pet fee and parking fee were discouraging. The staff were exeptionally courteous and informative.  I would definitely stay here again!Great location and nice property.  Our room was spacious, comfortable, clean, decorated nicely and the air/heating system worked great.  The hotel lobby is massive and very nicely decorated.  I did not use any of the hotel amenities so can't comment on that.  The front desk staff were efficient and friendly.  Check-in/check-out was a breeze.  Definitely, will stay here again and highly recommend it if you are visiting downtown Nashville.This place looks beautiful and the location is great.  Unfortunately their customer service sucks!  I work in the hospitality industry so I know good service when I get it.  That did not happen here.  I've stayed in a lot of hotels, I use to live in Las Vegas and stayed at most hotels on the strip.Let me first start off saying that we arrived here on Christmas day/night around 8pm.  We didn't have a reservation, but we did get a room.  When we asked about valet, the front desk clerk said that someone was working but she had to call him to come park our car if we wanted.  So we just said forget it.  The first person told us it was okay to park on the street.  After doing so, someone told us we couldn't park the car there overnight.  They told us about a parking garage we could park in.  It costed us 20 dollars to park there.  All because they didn't want to call valet to come do their job they are getting paid for.  She acted like it was bad on our part to ask her call him to do his JOB!  So of course there was no bell man either.  So we went and got the cart ourselves, loaded it and I pushed it inside.  I didn't even know where the elevators were, so I was wondering around the lobby pushing this cart full of luggage, the front desk clerk saw me and finally came around to POINT me to where the elevators were.  Then she asked me if I need a bell hop.  I stated that it was pointless to have a bell hop now since I got the cart, loaded the cart myself, pushed it through the lobby, and was about to get on the elevator to go to my room.  Why would I want a bell hop to help me after I did all the hard work, why should I have to tip someone when they barely helped me.  We get to the room, the room was very nice, I will say that.  The pillows in the room were feather down and we were allergic, so I called the front desk to ask them to bring regular pillows to our room.  It took over 30 minutes, and when she did come she had two throw pillow size pillows (12 inches square) in her hands!  On top of that she didn't even bring pillow cases!  So I went down to the front desk and told them what happened, she said they didn't have any more regular pillows.  Really???  Upon check out we voiced theses issue we had and the woman apologized but didn't really care.  I asked to speak to the manager and he didn't do much either.  He made excuses that it was Christmas day and they were understaffed.  When we told him about the parking and valet, we asked them to take away the charge for the garage since we had no other option but to park there.  They said they couldn't do it, since they didn't own the garage.  The only thing they offered us was to take off the charge of wifi.  We had already gotten the wifi for free the night before, so they really weren't offering us anything.  When we got the car and packed our own luggage on the cart AGAIN, I dropped the room keys off.  Then the front desk clerk said she would comp the parking garage.  I told her I already paid for it, because she said she could take the charge away.  Guess she wasn't being honest about that.  It is sad that this place is so attractive and in a great location, but the guest services is horrible!!!  We actually checked out and tried another Hilton property why I don't know but we did.  We went to the Homewood Suites by Hilton.  The rooms were not as nice but the customer service was outstanding!!!  I will be writing a positive review about their hotel for sure.  Let me say the pillow incident there was impecable...they had the pillows switched out before we even got to the room.  We actually walked in on the guy exchanging the pillows for real size non feather pillows!  Amazing!What a great location for being in the heart of the Nashville Scene! I really like this hotel.Good central location, simple enough to get to the airport from, lots of dining options available in the close vicinity, comfortable rooms- I think they are all suites-, very striking lobby area and all of the standard amenities that you would expect at a a Hilton. I would definitely come back.This Hilton can be found in the heart of downtown. It's right across the street from the Country Music Hall of Fame, next to the Bridgestone Arena, &amp; half a block away from the convention center. The rooms offer a microwave &amp; a refridgerator (not a mini bar fridge). It also has 2 TVs on the smaller side. The bed however is SO comfy. The gym is small &amp; has numerous cardio machines, but is limited on cable machines. The free weights go up to 50lbs, but there is only one bench to work on. They do also have medicine balls &amp; yoga mats. In addition they have a water cooler. A good sized pool that is up to 5ft deep.I would recommend that you find out the schedule of the Bridgestone Arena as they play loud music on game days/nights &amp; draw crowds at other times for other events. Otherwise you will find it hard to take a nap or go to bed. Request for a location away from the Arena if you find it hard to sleep w/ noise. The same goes w/ sleeping towards Broadway. This is a major party street so it can get loud at times. Word to the wise!Stayed here, as well as attended a friend's wedding, here this weekend. The wedding rate was $149/night and for that this is a 4 star hotel, but the usual rate is over $250 so in that case it's probably more like a 3 star hotel.The good:- Nice sized rooms with a separate living room area- Comfortable beds- A huge bathroom to primp myself for the wedding- Right in the middle of downtown Nashville, as well as across from the country music museum- Plenty of cabs always available even though Nashville isn't actually a cab friendly city- elevators that move at lightning speed- $13 breakfast buffet that I didn't try myself, but my fiance has mentioned what a great deal it was at least 10 times (it's the little things in life that excite him)The bad- unimpressive workout room- pretty gross indoor pool that you couldn't pay me to step foot in- they need to learn how to make a latte...I could hardly drink the one they made for me downstairsFor those of you looking to plan a special event in Nashville I""d also recommend the grand ballroom- my friend had a beautiful wedding here last night! It's a simple, yet elegant ballroom...the type where any decorations will work.  Would I return to the Hilton during my next trip to Nashville (if there ever is another trip to Nashville)? Yes, probably...but it would depend on the price. I would be happy staying here for under $200, but over that I'd seek shelter elsewhere.+1 Central location.-1 Parking problem. Parked in self-parking by accident, and Hilton couldn't bail me out and wasted $5. Did the same problem at the Hilton in Atlanta and they bailed me out with a free card.+1 Continental breakfast is extensive, not your usual cereal and fruit.-1 There is a ridiculous amount of birds in the tree next to the hotel. The next day, the tree was splattered with bird poop and the victims were the valet cars nearby.Overall, very good experience. I just wish they could help out with the parking situation.Great all-suite hotel. Very accomodating great pet policy. Brought our pup here for a long weekend away and there's even a park adjacent to the hotel with doggy pick-up stations. Rooms were large and very comfortable, fixtures were a little outdated but the friendliness of the staff and great location make it easy to overlook.If you're a tourist in Nashville, you really can't ask for a better location to be in the thick of everything that the city has to offer. My friends and I stayed here over Memorial Day weekend for a bachelorette party, and were able to easily take in so much of the local culture by barely having to walk more than a few blocks. The hotel shares a courtyard with the Country Music Hall of Fame, and is directly next to the Bridgestone Arena. Many of the touristy bars are located on the strip directly behind the hotel, and there are amazing, famous but less touristy music venues only a short cab ride away. The hotel itself is clean, the staff is friendly, and the rooms were comfortable and well decorated. My biggest complaint would be that the restaurant was average, at best, as was the breakfast buffet. But what would you expect at a hotel?You absolutely can't go wrong with staying here if you've never been to Nashville!I spent a weekend at the Hilton Suites Nashville-Downtown in January 2011, and the service was fantastic. The valets and front desk staff were really responsive and very friendly. I'm deducting a point for the room - Room 1004 was a little worn - it looked like someone threw kool-aid on one of the walls, and it had never been cleaned up. However, housekeeping did a nice job, and the room felt very clean. The suite included a large bathroom, flat screen TVs, and mini-fridge. Amazing location for going out - you can walk to a ton of bars on Broadway in 2 minutes. Be forewarned that if you stay on the side of the hotel overlooking Broadway... you will enjoy music until very early in the morning. As in, 4 AM. And it's loud. So if you're looking to sleep in a quiet room, ask for the opposite side of the hotel. :-)We stayed here on our drive from ATX to VA to MD. Yes, we are moving :( Anyhow we had all our things in the car and needed secure parking. So we chose to stay here. First off, this is a SUITES ONLY. And they charge accordingly. I would have expected it to be better than what I was served.It is noisy, there is no view to speak of, and rooms,...wait I am sorry, suites need a better cleaning.On the plus side:Valet is super helpful which is a welcome surprise. It is within walking distance to many things of interest but my only interest was sleep before heading out the next morning.I am a diamond member and have to say this is one of the nicest Hiltons I have stayed at. Room is very nice and has recently been done. Room service was excellent biggest french dip sandwich I've ever had. The staff is extremely friendly.I would say the hotel was between 2 and 3 stars.  The room was clean, the lobby was clean, breakfast service was fast, but the noise level was yucky...We were on an outside room facing the Bridgestone arena.  The weekend we stayed they had a marathon going on.  We could hear the announcer, band, crowd at 5 in the morning.  In the evening we heard the local bars playing their music.  We did not sleep well at all.  Maybe if we got an inside room it would have been better...I stay here every time I come to Nashville for business and have always been quite happy.  The beds are SO comfortable.  There's a gym with some decent equipment and I love the glass elevator.Food &amp; Beverage went out of their way for me last time to try and get a meal that is more like what I'm used to in SoCal.  The bar attached has really good food and super friendly bartenders.This has a great downtown location and is very cozy for me when I am away from home.","I have always found Hilton hotels to either be hit or miss.  I have to say this was a miss.  As far as location, this is ideal if you want to stay downtown as it is right around the corner from Broadway.  Other than that, nothing special.  Rooms are true suites, but the separation makes the space seem smaller.  Lobby is nice, but nothing memorable.Service was less than I would expect for $269 a night.  We booked and prepaid for a city view room.  We were checked into a room with only a view of the interior of the hotel.  The mistake was corrected, but there was no apology.  We ordered a room service breakfast for two, but they included only one set of utensils and also missed sweetener for the coffee.  Upon checking out, we were asked if the bill was correct.  That would be the bill they failed to slip under our door as well.  I was also peeved that internet access was not included in our rate.On a positive note, the bell service and valet were very courteous.  The hotel also has a musician in the lobby bar in the evenings.  The gentleman we watched was very good and even chatted with us for a bit.  That was definitely the high-point of our short stay.There are many other hotels in the downtown area to consider.  If you can swing it, spend the extra money to stay a few blocks away at the Hermitage Hotel if you are looking for a better experience.Assuming you can get a decent room rate this is one of the better hotels in the area. For 1) all suites...so plenty of space in your room.2) easy walking to all the cool local places3) nice folks all around4) good workout room - if you want cardio and basic dumbbells you are all set. not big at all, but better than most hotels.This was one of the most eligant hotels ive been in for the price. the customer service is amazing. i say is cause im still here. great location great price great people. They do need dvd players in the roons.I really don't think there is a better and more convenient hotel to stay in downtown Nashville than the Downtown Hilton.  All of the rooms are suites and are spacious.  There are lots of good food choices in the hotel or nearby. There is a Palm restaurant conveniently located in the west side of the building.  The hotel sports bar is pretty good and the prices are good too. The meeting spaces are large and the staff is always eager to help.Very nice hotel that's in the middle of downtown Nashville. As others have mentioned it's located by all the bars and restaurants. Most of those places have good variety of bands playing every night. Also close to the home of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, Country Music Hall of Fame, and Bridgestone Arena. You can't go wrong staying here!Thank you Hilton for using fitted sheets.Stunning place. The lobby is beautiful and we were shocked at how big our room was. Immaculate, great staff.Super location &amp; within walking distance of all the nightlife and sights during the day.  Everything looks new but my room seemed fairly dated based on wear and tear.  Great gym and thought the morning buffet and sports bar were above par as well.  Really enjoyed my stay - though rather pricey as compared to other hotels in the area.Phenomenal location to all things Nashville. Staff was overly accommodating and rooms very smart. Sports bar on property and every honky Tonkin and bar you could want is in walking distance. Next to the arena, across from the country hall of fame, and walking distance to football! No wonder they're sold out mostntimes I call.The Downtown Hilton provides adequate accommodations but the staff is it's Achilles heel.  From an unwelcoming front desk to a housekeeper who opened the door before knocking twice the staff at the Downtown Hilton is lacking to say the least.This Hilton Hotel in Downtown Nashville is equivalent to a W Hotel in any other city.  Not because it's a damn great place to stay, but because there is nothing else in Nashville to compare it to.  I've been to this Hilton Hotel several times for business trips and it's pretty much the best hotel in Nashville for travelers.  It's not fancy or upscale, but it does meet a minimum standard for me, and to be honest, I'm a snob when it comes to travel since I do it a lot.The architecture of this hotel is unique in that you can either get a view of the inside of the hotel or of the street.  Nothing fancy to see from this hotel at all.  Perhaps, you'll be lucky to see the river and the stadium the Tennessee Titan's play in, but that's all.The facility is clean and kept in good working order, while the staff has the typical Nashville politeness and are actually very accommodating especially to city folk that visit.  WiFi and breakfast are free because of my company discount, but if you don't have a discount, they'll charge for WiFi use and breakfast for a minimal fee.Breakfast is usually done at the lobby area but I advise people to keep a careful eye on their luggage or laptop bags when getting food.  My coworker had his laptop bag and laptop stolen in broad daylight while he was getting breakfast.  The breakfast area is close to the hotel entrance and any random individual can walk in and walk out with being noticed.There's really not much to do in Downtown Nashville, especially if you're used to a big city like Los Angeles.  There are the typical country music bars and chain restaurants, but if you're willing to drive, you can find some interesting restaurants around the Vanderbilt area.  One thing I do love about Nashville is that when you dine or drink in groups, all establishments automatically provide individual checks.  I wish LA would do that too!Go Trojans!  Fight On!Came to Nashville for a business trip and had the pleasure of staying at the Downtown Hilton.  Beautiful all-suite hotel, super friendly staff, great room service,  this place surpassed my expectations.   The lobby is beautiful..high ceiling, two staircases leading to the meeting floor, a bar in the middle..  they have live music playing during the night time.   I would pay to watch the saxophonist play again!In-room dining was great, had a lot of healthy options.. seared ahi tuna salad, grilled salmon, fruits (as you can see I'm back to my pesci vegetarian diet).  The service was impeccable.The rooms were clean, well stocked, and had a beautiful view of city.  I highly recommend staying here if you ever have the chance to go to Nashville.p.s.  Did I mention I saw Little Richard here? (picture of his back posted) :pThe location is unbeatable if you are interested in the downtown honkey tonks or seeing a hockey game, all within very close walking distance.  The rooms are comfortable.  Two TVs, a couch, a fridge, a microwave.  The host at the sports bar was very friendly and helpful.  My only complaint: there was a band practicing in the arena across the street, but it sounded like they were in the next room.  Note to self: bring earplugs next time.This hotel is in a great location downtown.  It's a 2 minute walk to Broadway.  The rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff was friendly and responsive.  Loved the pool - it was clean and there were lots of freshly washed towels stocked and ready to be used.  The girls and I ordered room service for breakfast one morning and the food was delivered quickly and it was delicious.   I will definitely stay here again the next time I make it to Nashville.",,"['18th', 'room', '727', 'corner', 'room', 'location', 'hotel', 'much', 'better', 'block', 'everywhere', 'downtown', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-inn-at-opryland-a-gaylord-hotel-nashville,"The Inn at Opryland, A Gaylord Hotel",2.0,$$,42,"At the end of the day, a hotel is basically some place where you put your head down. It's a shelter for you so that you can rest easy and be ready for whatever the next day has in store for you. Whether its business or pleasure, at the end of each and every day, your hotel room is where you ultimately end up.The hotel is a little dated as far as all the other hotels are concerned. Even though its older, it's been kept very well. This hotel does have its southern charm still intact though. The lobby, although a little out dated in the decor, the reception still will still give you the good service you deserve. If you're not ready for it, be prepared to be called ma'am and sir. Yes, this is what they call southern hospitality. The hotel area is designed in the old atrium style type of hotel. In closed in the building surrounded by rooms is the pool and a massive function area. There's elevators that take you to your floor, hallways so you can walk to your door and rooms that have beds in it. In the room, there's also lampshades, a desk, a dresser, a television and a sink. There's also the bathroom, there you will find a toilet and a tub with a shower. The fitness center is pretty good. This is probably one of the strong points of this hotel. Also if you're into shopping, there is a shuttle that'll take you to and from the outlet mall. There you can do some retail therapy, or do some window shopping.The Inn at Opryland is a very nice hotel. Probably not the newest, but still give you a good night stay. I know I did and totally had a restful night. I'm sure I'll stay here again next time.Follow me on Instagram and snapchat: rodtorres3After a somewhat disappointing stay last time, I somehow found my way back to this hotel...should've gone somewhere else. This is a hotel managed by Marriott, but is not on par with Marriott quality. There are two types of room: the ones facing outside with exterior walkway, and the ones on facing inside, with interior walkway and overlooking an atrium. I chose an interior room because the exterior ones are just like a motel. Problem is, not only I hear noises from the walkway, but also from the atrium below (there is a pool and a hot tub....imagine kids and pool or young people with alcohol in the hot tub late at night....yeah, you get the picture). My room was located directly above the on-site restaurant/bar/live music venue, so I was bombarded by loud music, especially from the bass guitar, all night - until 10:00 PM. Yeehaw! I hope y'all like country music!! Room decor looks dated and tired, especially the carpet and hardgoods. Bathroom is annoying, with an extremely small bathtub (I'm somewhat tiny). When taking a shower, either my shoulders almost touching the shower curtain and wall, or I'm starring directly  in the curtain/wall. Instead of small bottles of shampoo/conditioner/shower gel, there are three gigantic bottles mounted on the wall. Not sure about you, but I don't have too much faith in fellow human beings that I want to share personal hygiene products with complete strangers. Another annoying thing is lack of complimentary coffee/tea at the lobby, like all Marriott properties. Sure, there's a Starbucks coffee machine - at $3 per cup!!! Nope! I don't think so.....   Although the property is located in a tourist area, there is not a single restaurant within 5 miles radius that's ranked in top 40 in Metro Nashville on Yelp...that's pretty sad.I was very very disappointed with this motor <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finn.It&amp;s=d0996a6742ccffc18ce1bc4ecec5434898bebeb1196a3be258b6ebe32ff2b16b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">inn.It</a> is not a hotel.

I called Gaylord Opryland direct.She had no rooms available but directed me to their Sister hotel ""Gaylord Opryland Inn""I booked two days.A king room was all that was available.I noted to them I would need handicap access. When I arrived at hotel the desk clerk suggested I take 2nd floor room with pair of doublebeds.I had to enter motel from rear entrance,down hall to elevator,go down 2 halls,exit double doors and out to exterior balcony hall to locate very disappointing room.All this while pushing my Mother in a wheelchair!

Uh...that's all I got to describe it. First of all, it has interior and exterior rooms. I had an exterior room and it was a cold day. Struggle. The room was ok until I went to the bathroom. That was the smallest bathroom I have ever been in. The shower was hard to get into as well. However, they did have a shuttle to Orpy Mills mall and good service. This easily could have been 2 star rank. Also, they have an indoor pool that you can smell from a mile away. Nothing like a cup of coffee and chlorine in the morning.This hotel has wonderful staff, whom are attentive and friendly. The room have been updated and have a nice look to them, however the hotel has a major flaw- the original building layout. Half of the rooms are interior, meaning they only open to the inside of the hotel. The major problem with this is you cannot open windows and have no fresh air flowing into the room. While my room was clean, the musty smell was overpowering and unacceptable. Since people walk by your window, the blinds must stay closed causing a dark room. This probably won't bother you if you are just sleeping, but any time spent working at the desk in the room will leave you underwhelmed. The second problem is the lack of a restaurant that serves breakfast- you can only get pastries and light snacks. However, there are several restaurants within walking distance that offer up breakfast. Lastly, there is a restaurant that has live performances, and those can get loud - but they promptly stop at 9:00.After reading reviews online I was a little skeptical of this place. However upon arrival staff was very friendly and the lobby resembled a Marriott property. I had high hopes! Those were crushed as our room smelled of air neutralizer over spray which after leaving and coming back was obviously covering the musty smell. Our room faced the main road and it was like we were sleeping on the Las Vegas strip all night. Very loud, beds were full size and uncomfortable. Great location but definitely felt more like a 'motel'. We were scheduled to stay 2 nights and checked out well before check out time after one night.This is okay if you're going to go to the Gaylord resort. Otherwise, I would skip it. It's far from Broadway and downtown-about 20 to 25 mins drive. There is a shuttle to downtown but it's $20 per person. To get to the Gaylord resort, you have to drive or take their free shuttle.As others have mentioned, the hotel is set up with exterior rooms and interior (atrium) rooms.  The atrium has an indoor pool and then a large, empty room.  Because of the pool, the hotel smells like chlorine and is loud. Our other pet peeve-they have coffee in the lobby which you pay $3 for.If you do stay here, go to Nashville Palace for lunch and dinner though.Marriott should be ashamed of this property! Half the rooms face the interior and the entire building smells like pool chemicals due to the non-enclosed indoor swimming pool. The other half are accessed through an outdoor hallway. Think cheap hotel from 1995. Every time someone opens/closed their door or rolls a luggage cart or cleaning cart by you will wake up and hear it. The room is decorated nicely. However it feels like a damp, moldy basement. You have to run your AC all the time to combat the humidity. The carpet always feels moist so be prepared to wear your shoes all the time. The shower is so small I kept hitting my elbows. Thing cruise ship shower but worse!!I forgot my toothpaste so I called down to ask for some. I was told that someone would bring me some. I wait 30min and nothing. I go to the front desk and look in their ""essentials"" shop to buy some and they don't have any. Ask the front desk and they go to look for some. 30 min later nothing. They said someone will bring some to my room. At this point I just go to a gas station and get some. It was my fault for forgetting to bring it, but if the hotel didn't have some they should have just said so. I could have saved an hour of my time. There is a Hyatt place that looks a million times newer and better 100ft behind this property.Marriott and Gaylord should be ashamed to be affiliated with this dump of a 'motel'. I stay at Marriott properties all over the country and when I saw this was 'A Gaylord Hotel' I immediately assumed it would be of high quality because of the Gaylord /  Marriott name. This is a trick, because the ACTUAL Gaylord is across the street and this joke motel is simply 'owned' by Gaylord, but nothing even close to Gaylord. The nightly rate for this craphole was absurd. This place was such a DUMP that I checked out 10 minutes after checking in and got my money back. I will never consider staying here and will go out of my way to make sure friends don't book a room here. I am ashamed to be a Marriott Gold Rewards Member and may look at other hotel brands in the future because of this joke of an experience.* Lazy front desk workers* Smoking everywhere* Humid walking through interior courtyard* Loud traffic outside with truckers going byAvoid this place like the plague.If you like motel 6 with mold, then this place is for you. The rooms are about the same size(tiny). We clearly had water damage on the ceiling. It could easily be smelt. The only difference between this place and a motel 6 is the price. This place costs about 2 1/2 times more. Ridiculous. Some people complained about the noise on the inside rooms. Try sleeping in one of the outer rooms on the freeway side. The reason I gave this place a second star is because the staff is friendly.Hotel is nice in lobby but don't get outside room!  The rooms are not worth price. You are right next to grand ole opry and opry mills outlets. They have shuttle free to opry and outlets. The downtown shuttle is nice but only one free pass for two day stay? ! You are paying enough to cover that second day bus pass too. It wasn't cheaper on day 2.The rooms are decent with lay out. No fridge or microwave! The problem is ac is hard to control, a slight smell on entering room. But the noise from the road is crazy! You will hear every motorcycle, bus, truck, and most anything else out side the door. I got Room facing main road but even side street had noise issues. So if they can't give you inside room, then go elsewhere. The opry is easy to leave on your own. Downtown places with parking probably best. The drive is not long to get here from downtown. Or stay down the street.This place used to be a Radison owned property and includED Sleep Number beds, they have since taken the SN beds out but for the most part, everything is still the same. The first time we stayed, our room over looked the pool and was quite quaint. This time, our room (3067) over looked the Cracker Barrel and two stories above the restaurant which hosted a very loud country band the room is not sound proof to say it lightly.Pros: location, directly across the street from the Gaylord Resort and convention center.Free parkingAlmost $100 less per night (during the Christmas season, which is when I priced both places)Several dining options onsite or within walking distance Shuttle busCons: shuttle bus to the Gaylord only runs until 7:30 pm even on the weekends. The shuttle bus to downtown is $20 per person.The noise levelPrice is still steep, in my opinion.Small children in the hot tub...I know that isn't the hotel's problem, I just hope that someone will read that part and refrain from allowing their children in the hot tub. Parking is hard to find after 8pm...on the weekends.We stayed at this hotel by mistake. I thought I was booking the large nicer hotel across the street. I'm sure this is how they get most of their business by the names being so close so beware of that. There is nothing wrong with this hotel, the inside is fine, the front desk is nice and the restaurant has pretty good food. I did book the exterior room thinking it would be a nice view but it was just the freeway and a cheap restaurant. If you are going to only sleep here because you are out exploring Nashville (which is about 20 minutes away FYI) then stay here!First thing is the terrible musty odor in the rooms.  Figured it was just the fact that the room was empty for a while.  We ran the AC for most of the day on high. Still smelled. We requested another room. All the interior facing rooms were booked so they graciously gave us another exterior facing room.  Guess what same smell!Housekeeping forgets to empty your garbage, hairs all over the floor. Sleep number beds don't work.   Exterior facing rooms are LOUD. From the traffic noises to the guests rolling their luggage.  Sounds like it's in the same room with you. One of the worst MOTELS  I've stayed in in years.  Many others to choose from.  Do your homework!!Hotel - definitely not! This is a motel!  We stayed there May 2015. The rooms had much to be desired. They were very damp and we had to keep the air on. The shower had great pressure and a tub, but be prepared if you're tall as the shower head is positioned low and you'll have to squat to get under it. The entire vanity area was so small it made it difficult to impossible for 2 people to share the area. The beds were horrible. The idea of putting sleep number beds in a hotel where there are a ton of children who will be anxious to play with them constantly and the percentage of having them not work was very high (like our room with 2 queen beds and 1 didn't work). These were just another poor attempt and gimmick to try and sell a product. The rooms facing inside were battling the constant strong smell of chlorine from the pool and jacuzzi,  which was open from 9 am-9 pm. The rooms facing outside were battling the humidity and were extremely damp and needed the air conditioner on constantly. Parking - I have no idea if there is valet parking as trying to find a staff member to greet you is impossible and non-existent. Park yourself and don't bring your bags in until you find out where your room is as you may be moving your car to the rear of the hotel (motel). Staff - if you could find them. The only staff we encountered was at the front desk who  were far from resourceful and housekeeping when they were slamming the door to the adjacent room over 4 times within 3-5 minutes in the early morning, so we actually got up and kindly confronted them to ask them if there was something wrong as it felt like an earthquake and they looked at us as if we had 3 heads and couldn't answer us as they didn't understand. It took their supervisor who overheard us asking, as she was also in the room to acknowledge our request to stop the banging of the doors as we were still trying to rest in the early am. We had also asked the front desk staff for information about tours of The Grand Ole Opry (did I mention Gaylord Grand Ole Opry?!?!?) and the front desk staff had NO IDEA!  We were stunned and embarrassed for them. I could understand if their name (Gaylord) wasn't all over it and they weren't on the property, but they didn't even use their resources and look it up for us!!  Someone needs to train their staff in hospitality 101!Would I recommend this hotel?  No. Why 2 stars?  It wasn't as bad as a 1 star (which there could be much worse), it was an overall clean room (not comfortable, dry or mapped out well) cheap for our 1 night stay and in a good location for the Opry. Don't be fooled by the photos. I was, and was so disappointed when we arrived. You get what you pay for. Need I say more?!?Stayed here a few times because of the price. Never had a problem except for the smell I always get upon entering the room. Staff is friendly and has shuttles that go to the mall. Not the worst hotel I've been to, but I don't come here expecting a 4star hotel.Oh Inn at Opryland, where do i start...I took my mother to Nashville to fulfill her dream to see the Grand Ole Opry, so, I decided to stay at the Inn. Seemed like a good idea as it was cheaper than the massive Opryland Hotel and much smaller. I made an assumption (bad idea, I know) that because the Inn was a Marriott, there would be great service and good amenities; how wrong I was.The Inn's website said they have an airport shuttle and when I landed in Salt Lake to connect to Nashville, I called the hotel to confirm they had a shuttle. The extremely unfriendly person on the other end of the phone told me it was $30 per person from the airport to the hotel ($40 round trip per person). I was immediately turned off to the idea and, upon further online investigation, I discovered a waiting taxi at the airport would charge a flat rate of $25 per cab to the hotel and back to the airport. We obviously elected to use the taxi, which saved us $30 for delivery to the hotel and return to the airport.The desk clerk was friendly when we arrived and quickly got us to our room. When I entered the room, I noticed incredibly bland decor and an extremely small bathroom. The rooms were so humid the sheets were wet and I can't remember a single time during my stay when I was actually able to dry off after a shower.There is not one place in the hotel to get a complimentary cup of coffee...anywhere. You can use the bland bagged room coffee if you want but I would worry about some surcharge or outrageous charge for using the coffee maker in the room and the cost of disposing of the trash associated with brewing a cup. My poor mother went to the lobby to get a cup, as she had noticed the coffee machine the night before, and it required her to swipe her card and charge her $3 for a cup. The front desk employee elected not to tell her there was a ""Starbucks""--loose association with the actual Starbucks, where she could get a real brewed cup for the same price. Inside the ridiculously huge atrium, there was a pool, hot tub and wading pool. After a long day wandering around all Nashville has to offer, I decided to go sit in the hot tub and relax for a while. To my surprise, the pool area is completely locked and evacuated at 9:00pm, leaving myself and several other angry customers with the option of going back to our saunas...I mean rooms...to end the day. I have traveled all over the world and I have never heard of a hot tub closing that early; trivial I know, but just another notch in the headstone.Overall, I was not impressed by this hotel at all. There was nothing stand-out whatsoever and there was nothing that would have suggested this was a Marriott. Service-meh, price-meh, amenities-NONE, style-terrible. I was very disappointed with this particular hotel experience and I would not suggest it to anybody traveling to Nashville. Do yourself a favor and find yourself a nice hotel downtown and grab a taxi to the Opry if you want to go.This hotel is extremely over rated and over priced! We had a horrible check in experience as they couldn't find our reservation and then once it was located we had to wait over an hour for our room to be ready. Once in the room it was not even cleaned. I don't blame the house keeping staff as I'm sure they were over worked and rushed. In fact the only friendly staff were the housekeepers. There was entirely way too much walking to get to our room. Once settled in we explored to find over priced mediocre food and the atriums full of fake looking plants. The room was extremely cold with no extra blankets and horrible pillows. There was definitely much to be desired from this location and I couldn't wait for our stay to end.If your a light to medium sleeper don't come here..A nice place to stay, rooms were comfortable. Several things are right, however, one major drawback is the noise. The hotel is set up with exterior rooms and interior (atrium) rooms. We stayed in an interior room, every noise that was made in the atrium echoed and came in our room. Little noise dampening was on the wall, door and window that separates the room from the atrium.  I was woke up at 6 am by people walking by our room having a conversation,  additionally this was added to by children screaming in the atrium, I don't know if they were in the pool, it's in the atrium...My company pays for me to stay here but I probably would stay on my own time. The hotel van is a throwback from the 60's- red, gawdy but comfortable. I was more concerned with the location than the appearance and there are tons of places to eat so you won't starve if you're not driving. They have Shoney's, bob Evans, Cracker Barrel and a mcdonalds. There's also a place in the hotel but I ate at the mall.Staff was nice at check in telling is about the amenities of the free business center, and the shuttles that take you to the mall, and downtown. Never heard of a shuttle charging to go downtown but I looked online and there's a city bus that goes as well. The shuttle to the mall was nice but early. Supposed to leave every half but he left before schedule so be ready 10 minutes prior. My room faced the atrium and I heard everything from the water splashing to dishes in the restaurant. Gotta take a star away for that especially since I'm a light sleeper. Elevator is slow and not sure if there is more than one. I've stayed at worse and I've stayed at better but a clean bed and a shower is all I seek and I got that. Bathroom was small but so am I so no biggie and the tv had the channel I needed so no issues there for me.","Stayed here for a medical convention in town, and unfortunately that meant all of the hotels in the area were completely booked (otherwise I would have run screaming from this place).I check in and get put in an exterior room over the freeway, and there is just a horrible smell in the room that hits you as soon as you open the door. I went back down to the registration desk and requested a different room and was basically told ""tough luck"", and no offer to do anything about the horrible odor. The only reason I ended up staying was that it was 10 pm and there was not an available hotel room within 20 miles (believe me I did a thorough online search). The decor is outdated and overall just shabby, worn carpets, small rooms, no refrigerator in rooms, etc. To add insult to injury when I went to the lobby early the next morning to go to my meetings, I was told that they didn't have any coffee for guests, other than a machine that would dispense a cup of coffee for $3. Just ridiculous. Why anyone would stay here is beyond me.This is the worst Marriott I have ever stayed at as far the room, decor, etc.  Beware when you check in as they will charge you fees and not tell you about it. First off, I asked them to charge my room fee to a CC versus my debit card. They took the card and acted as if they would, but when I checked my bank account an hour later I noticed they did not honor my request. I also noticed an extra $50 charge that I knew nothing about ahead of time.  I found out after the fact this was for incidentals. A few days after my stay, the $50 was credited back to my account but they had added another $30 charge for a shuttle. I did not use a shuttle during my stay. It seems as if they just charge what they want, when they want, with no signature required or any type of identity checks. I am still waiting on the reversal of this fee. I have spent nearly 2 hours on the phone trying to get the correct amount charged for my stay. Also, we stayed here for a soccer tournament with our soccer team. The pool closes at 9pm and not only that, they would not allow the parents and kids congregate anywhere outside the pool area. They told us we had to go to our rooms. 9 pm on a Saturday night, and we had to be in our rooms. I am a Marriott rewards member and I stay at Marriotts throughout the year. Not anymore though. I will be switching over to a new hotel chain after this. I am just hoping that sometime in the near future I will actually get refunded money so I am charged the fee that I was promised when booking the hotel. It has been an entire week and that has still not happened. Do not expect a nice looking hotel like you are used to with Marriott hotels. Make plans to be in your room by 9 pm if you are on site. And use a prepaid card or be prepared for extra charges. Never again. Lesson learned.  Notice by the yelp star rating that I am not the only one who feels this way.This is our 4th and final time to book this hotel. The service and rooms are simply inexcusable in this price range. For $300+ per night we were booked in a room that was small, poorly appointed and had a malfunctioning AC unit that made loud noise all night. The noise sounded like brakes grinding on metal. It was beyond loud and kept waking us up during the night. The room I booked was supposed to have a couch but didn't. The final straw was the valet service when we were leaving. Waited 20 minutes for the car. This was a mid week stay and the traffic was slower than a weekend. The wait was quite frustrating but to make matters worse, 2 of the employees decided to stand in front of the exit lane to chat while I am trying to leave. They kept talking and it took me another 5 minutes to exit after I had already gotten my car. I actually had to honk my horn to get their attention. They didn't move much at all even after I honked the horn. I find this to be ignorant and I have had enough of this high priced low service hotel.The hotel is modern and updated on the inside.  We had an interior room right off the elevator and I never heard it.  The bathrooms are very small, it was awkward to get in and out of the shower.  The room had a safe and a fridge.  Our room had a sleep number bed which if we stay here again I will make sure to request to not have that type of bed.  It's was awkward and kept deflating.  The pool was easily to get to but chilly.  Good location!  We could walk to Gaylord Opryland which was way better than spending over $20 to park,  and numerous breakfast choices around.  Overall, I would stay here again with a few minors requests.  Oh and they have an awesome BBQ restaurant attached to the hotel.This place is a dump.  The room smells, the toilet isn't mounted down all the way, the carpet is torn, and the outside is ugly!I brought 11 girlfriends with me to Nashville for my bachelorette party and we stayed at this hotel. It exceeded my expectations I had read some negative reviews before we went about noise and other things but we were very impressed with our stay. The front desk was very accommodating in making sure that our four rooms were all very close together and were even able to get us two adjoining rooms which was very helpful for the party. We had a great discount for a teacher appreciation deal that I found online. The front desk was very helpful in getting us cabs to go to Broadway. We determined with the 12 of us that it was cheaper to do cabs instead of the shuttle for the weekend. Really enjoyed our stay! Only downside was one of the beds was broken and tilted, my friends found that if they slept in it with her head at the bottom of the bed it was a little more comfortable. Great location for a couple of bars and restaurants and super easy to get a cab to all the fun in Nashville.We were very pleased with the accommodations. Room was very clean and yes the bathroom was tiny but it served it's purpose....LOL We will definitely still there again. We had an interior room next to the elevator and didn't hear a sound. No way I'd get an outside room but that's just for safety reasons no matter where we stay!!Disappointing is the only word that comes to mind about this hotel. For the price and how ""lavish"" it tries to sell itself to be, this place falls into my top 5 least favorite hotels. Here's why:- Do you like to sleep while staying at a hotel? Well, there's none of that happening here! This place is the best if you want to pay an outlandish amount to stir uncomfortably all night to the sounds of traffic and all the drunk people hanging and yelling out on the railings. They also have these Sleep Number beds, which I had never used before coming here. Turns out, they're completely awful air beds and are very, very small. My parter and I got a room with supposedly two queen beds, but they definitely were more to the tune if just full-sized beds. Each time my 6'4"" partner would bend his leg slightly, I would be almost pushed off the bed because it was so small. And because Sleep Number beds are just glorified air mattresses, I would pop up into the air any time my partner would move in bed and the way the bed is inflated makes it feel like you are perpetually going to roll off the edge of the bed. Seriously, these are the worst beds I have ever experienced in a hotel.- Do you like to connect all of your personal devices to insecure wi-fi networks? This is one thing the OpryTM Inn does very well! No password or anything on their wi-fi, so it's wide open to any devious individual who would like to compromise your information while you're connected to this insecure network. Let's hope you have some money left after booking the room, because you may want to pay for a VPN service to securely use this hotel's wi-fi. Oh, and as an added bonus the insecure wi-fi is also very, very slow. Don't except to do any type of work here. - They have flat TVs with cable except the cable package consists of the worst list of channels I've ever seen. Usually when you're stuck in a bad hotel, you can at least salvage part of the stay by enjoying the privilege of watching cable TV, but again, not here. You have every channel under the sun that features pseudo-reality TV shows like Iceroad Looters, Pig Paradise, Wedding Wrestlers, Man vs Boar, Hell's Pawn, and all that junk. They also pull that awful trick where they lock down the back of the TV so you can't plug in a laptop to watch Netflix or play video games - though not like you could use the slow, insecure wi-fi for Netflix anyway. - Do you like continental breakfast? Well screw you, because the Inn doesn't do that here. Enjoy your walk to the Shoney's in the parking lot.- Forgot your toothbrush? Drive to a store! I forgot my toothbrush and even the toothbrush they gave me at the front desk was more than disappointing. If you would have asked me before today what my least favorite toothbrush was, I could not have answered that question. I swear I've had plastic cutlery that was more sturdy than this toothbrush and when I started brushing with it, it literally fell apart in my mouth! I had to pull toothpaste covered bristles out from between my teeth. Sadly I also had forgotten floss. - Bathrooms were not built for the claustrophobic, handicapped, or tall in mind. Good luck closing that bathroom door while on the toilet and let's hope you're not over 6' or else that shower may be hard for you to fit into. - They have a couple areas where you can get water and snacks, but it's super overpriced. A bottle of water costs about $3 and you also don't get a refrigerator in your room so don't plan on saving any food or drinks for later. If you have medications that need cooled, I would highly recommend requesting a room with a fridge or bringing a cooler. - I understand the Grand Ole OpryTM is here, but does everything within this mile radius need to be called opryTM? It almost makes you think they're using the word opryTM like an unregistered trademark so that they can make more money on opryTM merchandise. After this visit, if I never see or hear the word opryTM again I will be a happy soul.UPDATE: The hotel made an error on the bill, but didn't correct it until after we had checked-out, paid, got a receipt, and left. Days later my partner sees a charge on his card for the difference they forgot to charge up previously.I was very impressed with this hotel. It was closest to the attractions and less expensive than others I looked at. Staff was great, room was clean and comfortable. Hotel restaurant was great! Only negative was the very small bathroom.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be on the edge of everything.This app is retarded. I made a mistake. Why can't I delete this review easily? This is not were I stayed. Stop trying to undo my edit!!!!!! Give me a break already. I did not stay at this place. Is that long enough for you? Please delete this review.Driving up to the hotel, I was a bit discouraged from looking outside. The building looked old and blah. But I took the benefit of the doubt, considering it was in a great location. Let me tell you, do not make the same first impression as I did. This place was so clean and beautiful inside! The atrium in the middle was a great sight to see. The pool was also located there, which was also nice. The rooms are clean and spacious, free wifi throughout the hotel, and their hotel bar has live entertainment if you want a taste of Nashville music. Will definitely stay there again as a cheaper alternative to Gaylord.Had an outside facing room which meant that I heard every motorcycle, truck, electric vehicle and raccoon rummaging through trash. Way way overpriced.not to be confused with the Opryland Hotel, and we knew this going in, however, it is now a Marriott property and to our surprise, not up to Marriott standards.  Bed was fair, room and bathroom dated.  For the price, I'd stay somewhere else next time.  Mornings, aside from the lousy one cup coffee maker whatever it is with something called powered cream I ventured to the lobby expecting courteous coffee with real cream and to my surprise they did offer coffee, in a machine to the tune of 3 bucks....Come on Marriott you could at lease provide complimentary coffee to your guest for the rates you charge.  I've had much better experiences at Hampton Inn properties all the way around with free hot breakfast.....Where do I start? We had an outside room. The people in the next room ""partied"" on the walkway until 4:00 am. So much for 9:00 pm quiet time. You hear everything through the doors. The next night was the same. Called the front desk at 1:00 am and security came and the party finally ended for the evening. The rooms are very small. You have to straddle the toilet to shut the bathroom door. The sleep number beds were broken and very uncomfortable.  No complimentary breakfast. Did like the complimentary shuttle to the mall and Opryland Hotel.The positives are that its a revamped older hotel. It is next door to popular chain restaurants, and across the street from the Gaylord Opryland Resort &amp; Convention Center. The front desk staff was nice and you could expect a warm ""hello"" from employees throughout the hotel. Now the cons. As you walk past the lobby to the rooms you'll notice the smell of chlorine from the pool located past the lobby and hallway. I had an exterior room which unfortunately was next to the hotels air conditioning units. The noise it made was very loud. Fortunately I spent most of my time away and really only minimal time in the room for sleep, etc. I also can sleep through anything. For those of you that need perfect silence good luck. When I got to my room after checking in I found the tub 1/3 of the way full.Tip- Try booking your stay at the Gaylord Opryland Resort instead.I stayed two nights for business trip. I was happy with the location and shuttle to the Gaylord Convention Center where my meeting was held. The hotel room was clean and well organized. The only and important con to me was that they might use some kind of odor remover in the room which made very bad smell to me. It caused a head ache on the second night.Avoid this place at all costs. It's basically a motel. Right on the highway. And the room smells dank. The phone doesn't work. The alarm clock keeps going off. Horrid.This place served it's purpose... But for the price- it should've had a refrigerator &amp; a microwave at least... &amp; a room safe...???  I can't remember when I've stayed in a hotel room that didn't have a fridge last, &amp; that includes a HoJo... Pretty bad... Beds were comfy tho. This place looks like a 1950s hotel that's been remodeled. All doors on balcony, either inner or outer, pretty sure the inner courtyard used to be open-now enclosed with pool. Who wants to swim in a pool in the cold AC??? Very nice decor, but need mini fridge in room- a must have.  Don't scrimp on the essentials!My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and before arrival I must admit I was scared of the reviews. Some people are very critical of this hotel. We had a wonderful 5 year anniversary here. The staff was pleasant, the restaurant  on site had excellent food, the singing servers were so talented, the shuttle was extremely convenient, and the beds were really comfortable. We even had an outdoor room and I was very nervous of the noise level...I never really heard outside noise. I also felt extremely safe.. Usually I am a little sketched out by rooms that are on the outside but not in this area, I felt extremely safe. I never tried out the pool but the atrium area was very nice and I did get breakfast there one morning which was very good and reasonably priced. The only one bad thing I would say is that it would be nice if the rooms had a fridge, but we made do and filled a cooler with ice. Thank you so much for such a memorable trip! I will definitely be staying here for my next Nashville trip!There was a yellow liquid on the seat of my toilet as I first arrived! I then went to make a cup of coffee and found a very long hair hanging from the shelf above the coffee pot! My door had to be forced shut and my neighbors were very loud! I went to the front desk with my concerns and asked to be moved to another room or even be moved across the street to their parent property and I would pay the difference. The guy at the front desk told me that the only thing available was a ""parlor"" room, meaning there was no bed just a sleeper sofa. I then called across the street to their parent property to see if they had any rooms. I was told by them that they had no rooms available and they would connect me with Marriot's customer service. After being connected with them I explained my situation to the lady on the phone and she rudely told me that this was a situation for the hotel and she could not help me but she would connect me to the hotel. I was then connected with a manager and she informed me that they had 5 rooms available! So the first person that I spoke to blatently lied to me! We were then transferred to another room. The bed was a sleep number bed which did not work so we had to get maintanence to come and repair the bed and the pillows were very flimsy! The next day as I went to get on the shuttle I asked the driver if he could wait on my wife who was currently walking through the lobby on her way outside. Maybe a 15 second walk. He proceeded to yell at me and told me that she better hurry! He even threatened me by telling me: ""Don't look at me like that!""! When we arrived at our stop he opened the door without warning me and wedged me behind the door! During one of my conversations I was asked if we had stayed at a Marriot recently. We have not and now I remember why! Needless to say I will never stay at this hotel and will think twice before ever staying at a Marriot property again. I'm only giving one star because I am required to rate. This property is not worthy of a star!","The worst hotel experience I have ever encountered anywhere! I will give you only the short version of this nightmare. I stayed at this hotel June 2014 which is where our Servpro Convention was held. I had made reservations for a room with a king or 2 queen beds. Upon arrival, after a long flight from the West Coast, I was informed by the reservation clerk that they did not have a regular room for me, but a Parlor Room. A Parlor Room consists of a sofa bed with the worst mattress. I explained this wasn't an option due to a medical problem I have with my spine. I was advised that it is ""hotel policy"" to overbook by 20% due to ""no shows"". After speaking with several supervisors though out the night, I had no choice but to sleep on this mattress. Needless to say, I could hardly move the next day. I called a supervisor again at 6AM  and was assured I would have a regular room sometime that day.  At 3PM, I had not heard from the hotel, so I proceeded back to my room. The maid that been in to straighten up for my next night's stay! I knew I could not physically stay in this room another night. I proceeded down to the Lobby and asked to speak to the hotel manager. I spoke to Eric, the manager and within 10 minutes I a regular room assigned to me. Unfortunately, the damage to my back was already done. Due to extreme pain, I could not enjoy the convention let alone the resort itself. Even though I was grateful for Eric's assistance, the rest of my trip was still a disaster. Once I returned home to the West Coast, I had to seek medical attention for my back and have missed a few days of work and am still dealing with the pain. I would not recommend staying at this hotel to anyone. While the grounds are beautiful, the customer service was extremely poor.Great location.  Complimentary shuttle service will take you to/from Gaylord Opryland, Grand Ole Opry, and Opry Mills Mall.  Several restaurant options in walking distance (Opry Backstage and Caney Fork to name a few).  Rooms are clean and the staff is nice and helpful.  It's probably not worth the price on their website, but it's considerably cheaper than other options in that area and if you do a little searching, you may just find a better deal like me!",,,"['end',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-indigo-nashville-nashville,Hotel Indigo Nashville,3.5,$$,82,"Came here for a conference for work.  It was a nice place.  Nice location.  Nice view to the city on the 10th floor.  However, it all depends on what side of the building you're at.  I was able to see downtown.  The hotel reminded me of NYC rough city edge, but gave that Frisco feel to it.  There was a nice river where I ran in the mornings.I enjoyed my stay.  Clean.Rating:Price:  3 (Expensive, but every hotel in Nashville is expensive.)Cleaniness:  4Ambience:  4Service:  4Overall:  4Loved it here.Let me start off by saying nice property, friendly staff and well within walking distance to broadway and almost everything you'd like to see in the surrounding area of downtown Nashville. However, when it comes to this hotel you pay for location. PERIOD. The bathroom was modern and updated. That's great until it comes time to shower or use the sink. Then you have a flood in your bathroom. The shower leaked uncontrollably during a shower. Had to layer the floor w multiple towels only for them to get completely drenched. Sink had to be turned off while brushing teeth otherwise the same thing would happen. Water everywhere! If you're going to charge higher prices like the other downtown hotels maybe don't cut corners when it comes to renovations and updating. Housekeeping was very friendly and polite however dreadfully slow. We would leave at 7am and by 3pm the room still wouldn't be turned over and I would just change out my used soaking wet towels at the door w one of the housekeepers. In the end this hotel is just OK. When I stay at a super expensive downtown boutique hotel, I have higher expectations. I've stayed at the Clarion across the river and I'd go back there before staying at this hotel again. I was just trying to impress my mom since we were celebrating her 70th birthday for the weekend. Loved our trip not our hotel.I love this hotel. I stayed here for a night with some friends who were visiting Nashville. It reminds me of a hotel that should be in NYC - so modern, beautiful, and elegant! Our room was very clean, beds were cozy (we didn't want to get out of them), and the room was so pretty. It's located downtown so you are pretty much in walking distance to everything that you want/need. The staff was great - helpful if we had any questions/needs. Definitely one of my favorite hotels in Nashville!My friends and I stayed here for a bachelorette weekend. As soon as we walked in, we were taken aback by everyone's politeness, the colorful and modern decor, and live music performances. We had 2 rooms for 2 nights - the rooms were spacious, had comfortable beds, and nice bathrooms. Every time we called concierge with a question or request, the hotel staff was courteous and offered prompt help. Also, after my trip, Calvin was very pleasant to work with while resolving some queries. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxury getaway, in the heart of the downtown area!I was back at this hotel again in May, 2015.  Had another good experience.  Good value for the experience and I've stayed at a lot of Nashville hotels.  Rooms are well-appointed, mattresses allow a good nights sleep.  Good location.  Staff are not as well trained as you would find in an upscale hotel but they are well-meaning and helpful.  Ate breakfast--steel cut oatmeal--it was fine.  Bathrooms are modern; the hotel is clean.IHG has really stepped  up their game with the Indigo chain.  Interestingly, right after buying Kimpton Hotels, IHG made another splash with Indigo, and the two are pretty similar.  This is probably the best example of a luxury-boutique style hotel in the Kimpton framework that I've seen yet.  Staff was very friendly and helpful, rooms were large and spacious with great wi-fi access and workspaces, and the location is top-notch for getting anywhere in the greater Nashville area.  When I come back to Nashville, this will be my first choice for lodging from now on.First and foremost the Property is nice and located downtown right next to the outside concert events (its a little park - I forget what its called)Check-in was efficient - I was greeted a s a Platinum member, and received bonus points. The room was nice - comfy beds, and very clean room. The shower was cool one of the open concept showers with great water pressure. Nice restaurant and bar on-site. They had a free outdoor concert when I stayed here and I had a great time at the park across the street. Now the reason for 3 stars... Getting there was a bitch! The road the hotel was on was closed due to the events downtown. The traffic was a bitch as well. There was no way to get to the hotel. I called them and told them where I was at and asked if they could have valet just come get my car on the corner because I have been driving around the block and sitting in traffic for 90 minutes.. They couldn't they said tell the police officers who are blocking the street that you are staying here. I did and they said I couldn't go there.  So finally after 2 hours someone met me on the corner and moved the roadblock and let me in.. Staff was caring in the situation but they could have done this 90 minutes prior to avoid the stress and frustration. There resolution... 2 free drinks at the bar... Ummmmm ok.. better than nothing I guess.Nice older building and very nice upscale hotel in walking distance to everything downtown.Under $160 a nightParking was hard to find. We had to walk up a alley that smelled of old beer and piss. The lobby had that smell floating in. The lobby looks nice, hope the hotel room is better.Overall a nice hotel, but if you're going to charge 4-5 star rates, you need to get the details right. The location is great - walking distance to everything, but in a quiet area so you can sleep at night. Staff was polite and friendly. Rooms and bathrooms were clean. There was a nice wardrobe with hangers and drawers. However...There was no robe or slippers. The floor was uncarpeted, so slippers should have been provided. (Actually, maybe they did have robes &amp; slippers, but because nobody from Housekeeping returned my call requesting some, I assume they just didn't have any.)There was no safe. The clock had not been set. The toiletries were nice, but small. As a solo traveler, it was fine for me. But two people could not have showered and washed their hair, etc with the small bottles provided.I could have paid a lot less and stayed across the street at the Doubletree (where my friend stayed) and been just as comfortable. (Yelp shows the Indigo as $$, when I think it's more like $$$.)The noise of the heating fan in the room is CRAZY LOUD!! Not a monotone humming but a VERY LOUD FAN turning itself on to distribute the heat every 20 min, ALL NIGHT LONG. Not even ear plugs do the trick. It's a hotel, i.e. rent a room to sleep in - GOOD LUCK!SURLY, BRUSQUE BEARDED BARTENDERAn artist friend of mine invited me and friends to his art exhibition in the lobby lounge as part of the hotel's weekly Wednesday evening art events. A different artist is featured each week and the lobby bar offers a $7 special that includes a glass of your selection of house wine and a lovely three-cheese plate with red grapes and pita points. I and two friends sat at the bar, and I ordered the $7 special from the bearded bartender. I waited for my cheeses for what seemed like too long considering the smallish crowd and that another bartender was separately servicing the lobby lounge. The bearded bartender returned from somewhere empty-handed, so I inquired on the status of my cheeses and he curtly answered with a brusk ""I'm getting it right now"". Soon after, one of my friends at the bar ordered his second glass of pinot grigio, and I asked the bearded bartender if my friend was going to get cheeses, as he mysteriously didn't get cheeses with the first glass. The bearded bartender again curtly gave me a brusk ""He didn't ask for it and would have to pay extra."" Confounded, I didn't inquire further as my friend said he wasn't hungry. However, I'm standing on principle here and now. After we left the hotel and were discussing the art event over dinner, another friend volunteered that the bearded bartender was ""cold."" Although I will likely return for the hotel's Wednesday evening art events because they've got a suave vibe with great live entertainment and the $7 wine and cheese offering, I remain confounded by the surly service several of us received from the bearded bartender. I just didn't imagine it possible from Hotel Indigo. Everything else about the event and staff was great.Not a bad joint.  In fact, had I not stayed at the Sheraton Downtown prior to staying here, might give it more props... All very nice staff... They originally wrote the wrong room on the key card slip which caused a little confusion.., especially since we were able to get housekeeping to let us into what ended up being the wrong room.The rooms themselves... Some weird attempt at making cool contemporary space.  The use of stark white walls, expresso colored laminate floors (no carpet), red &amp; brown window treatments &amp; dark graphics consuming one wall are simply uninviting.  Not that most want to hang out in there rooms but I'd expect a $300+ per night room to be geared toward making you feel comfortable &amp; relaxed.Housekeeping staff running around knocking on doors &amp; banging carts on the adjoining walls at 8:55AM was a great way to wake up... Again, something expected at a Motel 6 but not a $300+ room.  This is a party city so one might expect people sleep late &amp; forget to put the D.N.D sign out.All in all; and I know you might not gather this at all by my review; the place is fine... But when I stay at an expensive boutique hotel I have higher expectations... If this was a 90-150 a night Hampton Inn; they'd get a much higher rating &amp; I probably wouldn't mention all the dislikes.Would I stay here again??? Sure.Would this be my first choice??? NoI am a huge fan of this hotel and was incredibly surprised to discover that it is part of a chain, it feels like a locally owned hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly and the receptionist checked us in a little early since our room was ready when we arrived just past noon. She then chatted with us about some of the local hot-spots that were nearby. Being from Austin, we are always happy to hear live music, so we were happy to know that there were plenty of venues nearby. We tend to steer clear of the big tourist attractions when we go on vacation and like to explore some fun local hang outs. Hotel Indigo was a great middle of the city location and we were able to Uber it around easily as well as walk to a few spots. Downstairs has a large seating area and bar. You can also order food (they have a  very tasty Veggie Burger). The bartenders are so nice and were quick to bring food and drinks. Both nights of our stay they hosted a local singer/songwriter, so we were able to also enjoy some live music right at the hotel! I am now a big fan of the Indigo hotel chain and will definitely be staying with them in the future!Beautiful hotel located perfectly, just a few blocks off of the main strip. Friendly staff, free wifi, well maintained building, with secure elevators so people can't just wander throughout the building without a room key. There is live music in the hotel every night night, which makes it feel festive and lively without being too much. Parking garage, conveniently attached to the hotel is way cheaper than the valet (and really easy!)Today is obviously the 7th of Jan 2015; I have yet to receive my refund from Hotel Indigo for charges they billed me, by their admission, incorrectly. I have contacted the corporate offices and was told someone from the hotel would be following up with me within 24hrs; I've done this 3x now. I also contacted the Better Business Bureau; who has attempted to reach the business manager on 2 separate occasions; they also have not been followed up with. It's pathetic to think that legal action is my last option, seriously pathetic. If you value your time and money, stay somewhere else this place is no where near the worth time &amp; stress spent in trying to get ANYTHING handled.Had dinner here. Mediocre at best, not cheap. Had to flag down bar tender several times to get refills on expensive cocktails. Best of all though was walking back inside after taking a stroll around the block after dinner. We wanted to use the restroom, but we were stopped rather rudely by the manager who told us the restrooms were only for guests. Had the same issues of rudeness with the valet who asked us repeatedly about what we were doing there. Apparently, manners and being friendly starts at the top and rolls down to the workers. Here's a hint - The Omni is less money, better style, and greets everyone with a smile. A SMILE ! Remember that. You never know who is walking in to your business. It could be someone who travels the world and doesn't care for 3d rate manners under the pricing structure of 1st rate service. Won't be back. Spend you money at Omni. They know how to smile.I live in town - but if I stay downtown, I stay at the Hotel Indigo. It's my favorite hotel. First of all, their food is absolutely fantastic. I've never had a bad meal there. Second, the staff is SO FRIENDLY. They go above and beyond to help you out, they have great recommendations on what to do around town, and are just absolutely a joy to work with. They also have live music in the lobby (which is so cool btw) and it's always great. I can't say enough great things about this hotel. Stay here - you won't regret it!My husband and I were quite disappointed with this hotel.  Staff was friendly and the hotel was in a good location, but it was nothing special.  The room needed a deep cleaning and the decor was very boring (compared to other boutique hotels).  I expected it to be more like a Kimpton.  The rooms definitely made it feel like it was an old hotel that they had done a few updates to.  Friends staying in nearby hotels had nicer rooms, better amenities and were still within walking distance of Broadway and all the areas that could be walked to.  It was our first and last time at an Indigo hotel.When I booked this hotel, I was under the impression that it was still at the West End location. It took several blinks to realize that things had changed and that HI had moved Downtown. I never went in the old location (I usually stayed across the street) but I think the new digs look good on HI.I am a member of the parent company/group, so points/fast check-in/wifi/etc. was all part of the plan. With the exception of the gentleman working the desk on an early Sunday morning (around 3:30/4), everyone in the front desk group was very helpful, chatty and courteous. I especially had good interactions with Dante, Holly &amp; Brian. The design/decor of the hotel is pretty cool. It's an old bank and the details give a lot of credence to that history. It's charming and adds a nice touch to the hotel experience. The cleaning staff (again, for the most part) went above and beyond to be helpful and make my stay enjoyable. Depending on what time of day it was, look to the lobby for treats. I enjoyed everything from muffins to cookies to infused water to pink lemonade. It's little touches like that which help elevate the hotel stay in to one a traveler wishes to replicates. Additionally, HI is a live music venue and I was stunned to hear the level of talent coming out of a hotel bar. Typically, I thought, I'd have to go to a club to hear such high level of musicianship. It was a good reminder that Nashville is a crazy talented city full of people who deserve big breaks.*As far as the rooms go, that's where I have to ding the hotel a bit. I was, originally, placed on the top floor -- and I appreciated it. Two queen beds, open shower in the bath, large cherry armoire, floating desk, high ceilings, and no real view to speak of. All was well but I was right next to a conference room. The thin walls and screeching people next door made my first night/day pretty unenjoyable. I was moved to a lower floor the following day (and given two comp meals for my troubles). Again, two queens, larger desk, an overstuffed chair, a more complete bathroom, and a slightly better view. Neither room had robes or slippers and, by the end of my stay, I discovered I was surrounded by woo-hoo sorority girls. Yes, that means drunken woo-hoos through thin walls at 2:30 in the morning. Not fun. Not the hotel's fault but just make a note of the thin walls.The Downtown location is much better for tourists than the old West End location. You're close enough to the madness to partake but far away that you're not in the thick of it. HI has a lot going for it and I'd happily stay here again.*Yet the listening public is subjected to being all about that bass, no treble. #epic #notepicStayed here overnight this past weekend. Everything was clean and in good order for our stay. Staff was nice and helpful. Close walking distance to the stadium. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.","I preface my three stars with this - I really did enjoy this hotel, and I would come back again, but there were some things that stood out a took away from a 4 star rating.Let's begin with the positives:1. The decor/Character.  It's awesome - fresh, youthful yet historic, lively, and inviting.  From the main foyer to the room itself.  I liked it - down to the Rochester, NY connection on the old-school mail chutes!2.  Bar/Grill/Live music are a plus. Just walk downstairs and you get to experience Nashville in your own hotel.3.  Staff - AWESOME.  The gentlemen at the front desk were easy on the eyes, attentive, and informative.   The cleaning lady saw us checking out and asked us how things were and if we were satisfied. 4.  Cleanliness - no problems.5.  Location - right downtown! YES!6.  Price - of all the places downtown this was the best deal.7.  Wifi - Free!  Speed and strength were excellent.8. Security - Nifty feature on the elevator allows only people with a room key to access their floor.  I felt safe the entire stay.Ok, now for the needs improvement.I must say that we were placed in a handicap accessible room as all other two-bed rooms were sold out.  I don't know how this compares to what's available in other rooms.1.  Room amenities - LIMITED.  No fridge.  No microwave.  Poor in-room coffee selection for the Keurig.  No real place to set your luggage.  2.  Bathroom - (Bear with me there's a lot to say here)The accessible shower was weird.  Two shower-heads, no shower curtain.  Even if the bathroom door is closed and locked, I WANT A SHOWER CURTAIN.  I reassures me that I have some sense of privacy.  The shower design also led to pooling on the main floor.  The drain dripped and dripped for what seemed like forever afterwards.Towels - they were skinny and weak.Counter space - none.  Women have counter-top needs!Towel bars/hooks - limited.  No place to hang clothes and towels at the same time.  3.  The View - not bad if you enjoying looking at a brick wall.4.  Room size - I can tell that this was a building that had been converted, but the room was small.  There wasn't a lot of space around the beds - just space near the door/entry way.  I suppose this works well for those in a wheelchair, but even for them, I would imagine this room would be a bit cramped.5.  Price - even if this price was the best around town, I feel like we should STILL get more for the price.6.  Parking is in a connected ramp.  Spots can be a tight squeeze, and a little bit pricey.  Better than valet parking, but still a bit of a hassle.  And was there an elevator?  I don't seem to remember one.  Try lugging your over-packed bag down those stairs.I would stay here again, but I would like to see a room with a king bed - something larger.  I'd also like to actually eat in their restaurant, try out their fitness center, and spend more time in the city of Nashville in general.  I'll give it a three stars - but it would probably rank as more of a 3.5, but on not feeling overly generous mainly because of the price.Great place to stay close to downtown. All the staff were really friendly and the restaurant in the hotel was amazing.This is a fabulous hotel.  It's located downtown and an easy walk to Broadway, the Ryman, and great restaurants.  The staff was great.  Special mention for Andrea at the front desk who never steered us wrong when we ask what to see(Hot Chicken Festival was great).  Also Katie, bartender, in the restaurant was exceptional.  She never failed with her friendly demeanor even when slammed.  We decided not to have our room serviced by housekeeping and was pleasantly surprised by a basket of towels and toiletries outside our door.  We were able to see the 4th of July fireworks from our room window since it was downpouring at the time.  We can't wait to come back and visit.This place is a hidden jewel.  So surprised how they treat you from the front desk , dinning, housekeeping. I will return.Very laid back perfect lil place tucked away n downtown Nashville. Had the car valeted and everything you need within walking distance. Went to watch the Titans play at LP field, perfect walking distance from hotel. Relaxing atmosphere. Had room service for breakfast (Music City Breakfast and French Toast) was good. Will visit againHotel Indigo is a gem in the heart of downtown Nashville. I've stayed here multiple times on business and personal trips and have always been made to feel right at home. The valet staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and more than happy to provide directions or suggestions for fun things to do. I'm always greeted with a smile when I walk into the lobby, and it's obvious that the staff truly wants me to enjoy my time at their hotel. On my most recent visit, my housekeeper Nancy was super-friendly and let me know that if there was anything I needed, she'd be happy to help. The hotel is within walking distance of all of Broadway -- Country Music HOF, Bridgestone Arena, Robert's and all the amazing honky tonks. If you're looking for a comfortable stay and good old fashioned hospitality, I recommend Hotel Indigo very highly.I just got back from my stay in Nashville and I really liked this hotel. I found the price to be great for what you got. The building is fabulous, converted old factory and lots of character. I read some reviewers who said their rooms were small. Our room was actually really spacious, as was the bathroom. I guess being a converted building the rooms tend to differ greatly in size so maybe check before you book. The location is really close to the main drag and we were able to walk everywhere, however, it can be a bit desolate at night  so be aware of that. The staff was great, very friendly and they gave us great restaurant recommendations. And we were able to check in early. All in all for the price I was really happy with this place!A beautiful facility and great location is the platform for, what could be, one of Nashville's top value hotel properties - Hotel Indigo. If only....The room was great; comfortable bed, nice bathroom, etc.  However, the customer service needs some polish. The morning of my big meeting which brought me to Nashville, I attempt to take a shower.  No shampoo, just two conditioners.  I called the housekeeping:  ""Yes Sir Mr. M., we will bring it right up!"".  20 minutes later: ""Oh, are you the guy that needed shampoo? Sorry but they cannot locate any in the hotel.  Must have not received our shipment.""  WTF!!!  An IHG hotel in the heart of Nashville does not have one freaking bottle of shampoo for a guest to use??  Then you cannot even call the guest back to tell him (I had to phone them again)?  Check-in was another ordeal.  It was as long as waiting at a car rental counter trying to find a mid-size vehicle other than the purple one with white top and 17"" mag-rims. Hotel Indigo has work to do if they ever expect to be a 4 or 5 star rated hotel.  IHG social media team:  Are you listening?Love the Indigo! My nr 1 hotel in style , service and location.!! i stayed there during my first trip to Nashville and got impressed about the nice room, excellent bed and live music in the hotel lobby at night... awsome!!Love love this hotel. The staff is awesome. So accommodating and sweet. Very helpful. The rooms are nice. Updated and modern. My only complaint is that they don't seem to deep clean the bathrooms. Edges of the shower are kind of gross and just all the books and crannies (floors, walls, etc) could use a good wipe down. Overall the room was clean though. The thermostat in the room is ridiculous. Makes no sense. I am an intelligent woman with graduate degrees and couldn't figure it out without an engineer coming to the room. He said that every day he visits rooms to show people how to use it. And apparently ours was set incorrectly so he had to remove the frame from the wall and mess with it. Not a huge deal but irritating!The hotel is beautiful. I loved the lobby and restaurant areas. I could spend a few relaxing hours there easily. The food is really lovely as well and well priced. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. The staff is great, the location is perfect - a great trip to Nashville!Hubby and I spend a weekend each December in downtown Nashville.  It gives us the opportunity to become reacquainted with our city and explore some of the nooks and crannies that you only get by strolling around on foot.  Where we stay depends upon where we have points and what is available.  This year's locale was the Hotel Indigo on Union.We had stayed at the Hotel Indigo on West End (before it became an Aloft I believe) and we stayed at this Union Street location last year too.  Last year the hotel was going through a major renovation.  There was scaffolding on the outside and lots of work going on in the lobby.  This year, with renovations complete, the look is fresh, sleek and modern.  On the opposite spectrum, since this is an older building, the elevators are small and creaky.  Let's just say about four people with very little luggage can fit on one at any given time.The entirety of the staff was warm, welcoming and very accommodating.  We were greeted and well received by all.  Our needs were met with courtesy and professionalism.Since my husband has so many points with the parent company of this hotel, we were given a corner suite.  Again, the room was modern and was appointed in a very contemporary, stream-lined fashion.  The hardship with such is that there were not any drawers for us to unpack.  So we quite literally lived out of our suitcases.  My only other qualm was that there was not a fan in the bathroom.  After we each showered, it was a hot mess in there and was as humid as a July afternoon.  Both those issues aside, everything else was quite agreeable.I cannot tell you anything about the bar or food services here as we did all our dining and drinking elsewhere.  I can also tell you it is a very short walk to Printer's Alley and many other amenities in the lovely downtown district of Music City.**WARNING**  This hotel is under complete renovation.  There is no lobby, bar or restaurant.  There is a temporary check-in desk w/ a 15 foot wide path to the elevators.  This is essentially a flop house until it is completed.  Of course you won't find that disclosure anywhere.Service is awful - waited for the valet.  Unpacked my own car and drug my own luggage cart to the desk.  No one offered to take my bags up to my room for me - just pointed me to the elevator.  These are one of those experiences where the 'Indigo' brand name will be off my list most likely forever.The Hotel Indigo was absolutely perfect for my needs. Close enough to the convention center and even closer to the awesome Nashville night life - I am definitely a fan. Very modern decor, super friendly staff. Great bar on site and room service (try the shrimp and crab dip - you'll like it!) Free Wi-Fi, huge TV. Awesome toiletries and HUGE bathroom. K-cup coffee maker in room and Starbucks downstairs. Nice and functional business center. Couldn't ask for more - it was a great experience staying here.My ONLY suggestion - set the alarm on your clock and/or cell phone - I requested 2 wake up calls (and unless there was something wrong with the phone in my room) I never received them! Luckily I was up anyway... Still would for sure stay here again if I'm in the area.We stayed in the Hotel Indigo this past weekend for my wife and I's 15 year wedding anniversary.  We wanted to experience a bit of the nightlife downtown had to offer.  The hotel was good for that, being adjacent to the capital complex and just a very short cab ride down to all of the hustle and bustle on Broadway.  Valet parking was expensive at $28, but very quick and convenient.  We arrived about 20 minutes before check in time into a modern lobby with restaurant and bar.  Our room was not ready so we went for a drink at the bar.  We were pleased to find a full bar with several local bears on tap.  We had just raised our drinks when the manager came over just a couple minutes later saying they had a room for us and we were upgraded.  We were allowed to take our drinks with us so we headed up the brass elevator.  The room was small but nicely decorated.  I am not sure what the upgrade was, maybe since it was a corner room with two windows it was considered an upgrade?  No matter we were well treated and happy to have the room a few minutes early.  The bedding was nice.  An oversized flat screen TV was there for the viewing.  The hotel should score 4 stars.  The reason I gave it only three was because of some cleaning issues in the room.  One of the pillows had fuzz and hairs all over it where it was dropped on the floor by housekeeping when they made the bed.  There was one pubic and two long hairs that were plainly visible in the all white walk in shower, and the caulk joints were moldy.  We also found an alligator hair clip was on the tray left waiting for us on the bed with two hospitality waters and ice bucket.  If we had a cleaner room, it would get a four star review.  It was otherwise a nice place to stay.Love this hotel. Comfy room and bed. Great design. I would definitely stay here again. Front desk staff are very helpful and super friendly. Thanks for a great stay!!!I reserved a room for my parents on December 26th. I paid for the room along with valet parking. My parents arrived, valet parked their car, and checked into the hotel. During the course of the evening, their car was severely damaged while parked. The valet company is refusing to take responsibility and pay for the damages.BUYER BEWARE!!!  Yelp says Businesses can't take down reviews..but mine was taken down.  I'm posting again and we'll see how long it will stay.   I booked a room on 6-19-15 and due to a family member being diagnosed with a serious illness I had to cancel the next day.   I booked what they call 'Book early &amp; Save'  Apparently in the VERY small print if you cancel they keep THE ENTIRE booking charge and will not refund a penny of it!!  I called on the 20th (the date I cancelled) and the woman I spoke to said she could refund all but one night but it would take 5-10 days to show up on my card.  After 12 days there was no refund.  I called the hotel and they are saying they will not refund the amount which was $1500!!!  A $1500 CANCELLATION FEE is the most outrageous thing I've ever experienced.  The most restrictive fee I've seen is cancelling within 72 hours NOT 19 days prior notice.  This is criminal. I ran an additional reservation for August for the same dates and the difference in rate for this criminal non-cancelable rate and a 'FREE cancelable rate if you cancel the day before arrival is $25.20.  I would be more than happy and find it fair..to pay the difference for each day.  But they say no..they are keep my $1500.   And I don't see how the hotel benefits from such a policy.  I will NEVER go there and will continue to write about this in every social media site I can find.  Oh...I'm also in their rewards program.  So I won't be staying at this chain ever again which includes Holiday Inn, Intercontinental, Hotel Indigo, Staybridge, Candlewood &amp; Crowne Plaza.Now the end of Nov and I've contacted corp 3x with a promise that the hotel would be following up with me, have my case with the Better Business Bureau filed and I hope to get my money refunded. If not I feel small claims court is my only option.Recently stayed here - hotel said we had queen beds but they were full beds. Wonderful cookies in the lobby - trying them is a must! Valet is helpful -(Trace) was kind. Walking to Broadway is easy.walking distance from all the downtown bars, very clean, accommodating staff and a great lobby bar with live music!","Cheap for a reason! They're located next to a jail bond place? And the people who work here are incredibly rude. The ""manager"" told us we were delusional when we told them the room looked bigger on the website, etc and they couldn't bring us a cot even though the website had promised us that. The area is horrible with homeless walking around everywhere... Just don't stay here. Pick somewhere closet to Downtown.Pluses:1. Location- short walk to Broadway and even shorter to Printer's Row.2. Staff- everyone we encountered was just plain NICE! 3. Decor- room and lobby were great...bring flip flops, the floors are original stone which looks cool, but I just prefer carpet when I get out of bed. 4. Live music- came home on Friday night to some really mellow singer/songwriter music after being in a smokey/crazy bar on printers row. It was the perfect way to end the night.Minuses-1. Bathroom noises ECHO throughout the room so beware...you might want to run the water while you're working in the bathroom. Also, the drain in the shower drips for a LONG time after you're out. 2. Squeaky bed/felt the springs...I didn't notice the noise too much while in bed, but just enough to mention it. Overall great experience and would come back to Hotel Indigo.My girlfriend Julie &amp; I stayed here from July 3-5. Overall the hotel was beautiful and we really liked our room. The service was exceptional and we never had to wait very long to get our car that we valeted. At night they have singer songwriters who play in the bar area. While enjoying this great free music be sure to sit at one of the tables at the back of the room and check under the recharging ports that are hidden beneath the ""covers"" on the table.When we go back to Nashville we will stay at this hotel again. It comes very highly recommended.Get the hot chicken appetizer. You will die. Happy. Decent music on Friday night.I liked my stay here and it was updated. I didn't think it was anything special but the bar area in the lobby was I thought the best part with comfortable seating with a few different up coming country artist that performed each night.The elevators were a bit of a pain. You had to press your floor with one hand and scan your room key with your other. The scanner seemed weak and after trying it a few times the elevator finally worked. Can be a hastily with things in your hand trying to operate their security.Overall a good experience.Loved this hotel. Good location. Loved the keureg in the room and the aveda bath products. Easy check in and no hassles during the stay. The rooms have a very trendy, modern, loft feel. The shower in our room was huge. Only thing I would have liked would be a small fridge in the room for our dinner left overs. And despite what other reviews say, there is no starbucks here. All the construction is finished now, also. Would definitely go back.I'll start off by saying that I stay in hotels every week around the country. It's pretty hard to surprise me or make me dissatisfied, as MOST hotels are pretty much the same and have their trade offs. With that said... The room itself is pretty decent. It seems mostly clean (my #1 concern) and the bathroom is spacious. The rooms are cheaper than probably 90% of other hotels downtown.If you're coming to Nashville to party downtown and see music for a few nights, then this hotel might be for you. However, if you are traveling here for work and expect to sleep at all, this is not the hotel for you-- which is the main reason why this hotel gets a crappy score from me. I was in a corner room with 3 windows facing an alley, in what seems like the area right above their music lounge or something. Music was blaring into my room well after midnight. I have never heard so many harmonicas in my life.Aside from that, this hotel fulfilled a few nit picky  peeves: they put a table and chair right next to the end corner of the bed so you can't walk past it without putting the chair somewhere else. There are hardly any outlets in obvious places, so you have to crawl under the furniture and unplug lights.If the Doubletree right down the street or the Sheraton hadn't been completely booked because of the CMAs coming up this week, I would have stayed there instead. If price isn't an issue, I'd recommend going there instead.We were on our way to having a wonderful weekend, however we had items stolen while our bags were at the hotel.  Both my work computer and my friend's iPad were stolen either while our bags were being held by the valet before check in (as we arrived early) or by the housekeeping staff on Saturday.  Unfortunately, another family was filing a police report for stolen items before we filed ours.  There needs to be some serious reflection by the Hotel Indigo staff.  We were incredibly disappointed, as this isn't a hotel where you'd ever expect something like this.  Also, there are no safes in the individual rooms - guests must go to the front desk to leave items in the safe manned by them.  I wouldn't trust this staff with any valuable items.  This is immensely disappointing as the rest of the weekend was wonderful.My wife and I tend to spend long stays when we are on vacation so we get to know the area and see a lot. We just spent 9 nights in Nashville at the Hotel Indigo downtown and it was one of our best vacations ever.The location is great; just outside of the craziness on Broadway but close enough to walk to all the bars, restaurants, shops, the Ryman, Country Music Hall of Fame, etc.The rooms are decent size and clean. Shower and the bathroom were very good. The housekeepers were friendly and always responsive to our needs.The food in the lounge area is surprisingly GREAT! Full dinners, appetizers, breakfast and desserts are the quality of a fine restaurant and a bit of a break from the heavy ""comfort"" food in most of the local eateries.The live music ranged from good to outstanding, and it was great to have a place to enjoy the local talent without fighting raucous crowds.Best thing: the Indigo staff is the best of any hotel we have stayed at anywhere. Pam, Dante, Ben and the front desk crew were friendly and very helpful (Pam even went upstairs and helped clean our room when we checked in early).The crew in the District Bar and Kitchen (the lounge area) made us feel at home. Specifically, Anastasia and Joe were the epitome of customer service and helped make our vacation special. They are the kind of assets that a great hotel needs to keep people coming back, and we will!I stayed there for a bachelorette weekend and both my iPad and my friends computer were stolen either from my hotel room or the valet and we weren't the only ones! People were lines up to at the front desk complaining! It was a horrible experience!!!!!Stopped to see if they had any rooms available on a whim because this is one of the closest hotels to the Nashville night life. The hotel staff was extremely helpful and courteous which, sadly, you don't seem to find anymore. Room rates are slightly higher than other options but still priced right for the location. The decor is trendy and all the rooms have keurig coffee makers which is a great touch. I even found myself doing valet parking because the valet had such a great attitude and seemed genuinely interested in where we were from and what we were doing in Nashville.  Definitely would recommend this to anyone in for a night or two.This hotel is terrible.  They were still under renovation when I was there and no one on staff knew what was going on - nor did they have any desire to figure it out for you.  The maid service is virtually non-existant.  They would leave cleaning products in my room, they wouldn't change the sheets, trash was left in baskets.  Guests would leave room service plates in the hallways and they'd sit there for DAYS.  The people at the front desk and valet were friendly but they didn't have a clue what was going on, where the business center was in their own hotel, etc.  Also my room card didn't work almost every day.There was one bright spot.  John who is at the counter of the cafe on weekends is probably the most friendly, helpful and wonderful people I've ever met in the service industry.  A+ for him.I had to switch between a couple of hotels when I was in town as rooms were booked solid everywhere. As far as the room goes, this hotel was number 1. I was very impressed. Modern/new feel to it. Excellent service. I worked out at the small gym, which was good enough to get the job done. Location is in the middle of downtown, walking distance to everything.We stayed here after their renovation, and we loved it!  The lobby and restaurant/bar area has a contemporary look and feel, but yet a comfortable appeal to it. They have live music, and the food was excellent!  The room itself was clean with the same contemporary decor as the lobby area.  It also had free wi-fi, a huge mirror on the closet (sorry, probably more important for a female), a Kurig, and perfect sized bathroom.  Overall, this hotel had everything you needed.  Snack area, ATM, full restaurant, bar, office area, and VERY accommodating staff.  The location was also perfect if you're interested in spending time around Broadway.  I had nothing but a very positive experience, and I will stay here again when I'm back in Nashville.This hotel had a modern feel to it. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.  The location of this hotel is close to a lot. My only scwobble was with the elevator, which was a little scary at times.I stay at a lot of hotels and usually keep it within the Hilton brands but I had to stay here for a work meeting and paid a $189 rate. Getting here is simple with a flat $25 cab rate from airport and it's a good location about half block from Printers Alley, 1 block to Walgreens and maybe 5 blocks to Broadway (touristy, Vegas-feel area of Nashville). The front desk and concierge staff were friendly and great but I got a super sketchy feeling about nearly all housekeeping. To add to that, there was some drama (room entered, money taken) with another guest, which the hotel took accountability for, repaid the person and eliminated that employee. The hotel is nice and clean. (Note: some of the photos here do not represent the current state.) I especially liked that my room in Tower 1 had flooring throughout. The only carpeting was the rug under the bed. My shower was huge and lovely and the beds were nicely plush with some firmness and great linens. The one thing I can say about the room is that it was LOUD between them. I could hear the lady in the room next to me as if she was in my room while she was talking/fighting with her significant other. I turned my a/c on (instead of automatic) to drown out some of that. Mostly, i felt badly for her since I'm a snorer. Internet was free and very good (speed) for hotel but it kept kicking me off so I repeatedly had to re-enter the code. No biggie really.I wanted to send my best friend two bottles of champagne for her bachelorette party because I was unable to attend. The bachelorette party was staying at this hotel, so I called the front desk about ordering champagne and sending a personal note. Both times I talked to women at the front desk who seemed rather annoyed, and the first time I called they had no champagne and the second time they only had one bottle. I was assured multiple times that the bottle cost $40, but after the transaction went through I was charged $60. When I called to complain they transferred me to the head of catering, who I left a message for, and never hear back from. Luckily they did in fact deliver the bottle of champagne and the note I sent, but overall I'm pretty disappointed in the customer service at The Hotel Indigo.Great location. Staff was very nice!  Good bar with great entertainment. Rooms are nice size, clean and quiet.I ck in here on Yelp for the Starbucks coffee.  Guess I can't really comment on the hotel.  I've never stayed her.  However, I would like to ck out their bar one day soon after work or heck maybe even sneak away on my lunch break lol. The Starbucks staff are AWESOME!We recently stayed at Hotel Indigo (downtown) for an extended weekend and reserved 2 rooms since there were 2 couples.  Both rooms were very well appointed with modern and trendy decor that offered a nice break from the typical boring, corporate hotel decor -- perfect for a birthday weekend/celebration. The location is great, just a few blocks and walking distrance to all of the downtown restaurants, bars, honky tonks, museums, the Ryman, etc.  The hotel offers valet parking, for $22/day, but we were lucky enough to find street parking the entire weekend.  Street parking is free after 6pm and all day on Sundays.  There is also a garage nearby but I'm unsure of the price.  Both rooms were clean, bright and cheery with comfy beds and down pillows.  The rooms were also a good size and included a flat screen tv, free wifi, a lounge chair &amp; ottoman and a desk.  The bathrooms were amazing, recently renovated, clean and featured Aveda bath products.  The bathrooms don't have tubs but they do offer a generous sized shower -- I'm not sure if this is the case in all rooms.  It was a scorcher weekend, with temps in the upper 90s and we experienced no issues with the AC.  I'm hot natured and was comfortable, even while blow drying my hair and getting ready.  The water pressure also was fine, we stayed on the 8th floor.We didn't have a lot of interaction with the hotel staff, besides the usual check-in; however, everyone seemed friendly and helpful and the bellman religiously opened the door for us on our way in and out.  In addition, the bartender was extremely nice to fill up our nalgenes with ice and water since the temps outside were brutal -- a nice gesture, especially since Starbucks charged us! The only semi-negative was we attempted to check in a little early, a little after 2pm, but the rooms weren't ready. Not a big deal but it would've been nice.Speaking of, there is a nice and spacious Starbucks adjoining the hotel that has 2 levels.  The upper level features local paintings and artwork.  One downside to Starbucks, while they do offer their typical breakfast breads and muffins, they do not offer the artisan breakfast sandwiches.  If you're staying at Indigo and are looking for a superb brunch that won't break the bank, do yourself a favor and grab a cab and head to the Garden Brunch Cafe, about a mile away.  It is well worth the short drive.Overall our stay was excellent.  No issues and we didn't experience any noise or paper thin walls either. An added bonus, they offer a military discount.  Our room, with tax ended up being $110/night. We will definintely stay here again.","I give this hotel 3 stars but I feel it could be a 4 star once the renovation is complete.  For the positives, the room was very nice and large for such an inexpensive hotel.  The bathroom was also large and chic.  I like the modern decor, art, tv--everything.  And, like I wrote above, the rooms and bathrooms are quite large.The negative is only that the place is doing a revamp so there is no lobby.  Everything other than your bedroom is pretty shabby.  I would definitely give this place a try once it is fixed up.Staff is nice but not wonderful or particularly professional.I never knew it was possible to ""catch"" insomnia in a hotel room. That, and freeze your tush off each and every shower. For being part of the Indigo chain, this is a major disappointment.I hardly slept here. And it had nothing to do with the street noise. It was just a really hard room to feel comfortable in. Oh, and don't be surprised if your door key fails each day. I had to visit the front desk once a day after realizing my key card failed. Le sigh. The one perk (literally) about this place is being right next door to a Starbucks. And it is a good location if you want to stay near downtown without emptying your bank account at the Hilton.I stayed at the downtown location of the Hotel Indigo on Monday night. I was excited when I checked in to hear live music in the lounge. The girl that checked me in was friendly. I got to my room and I was very happy with the bright colors and the large bed. The bathroom was fantastic. The walk - in shower was fantastic - the hot steamy shower with the Aveda Rosemary and Mint bath amenities made it perfect. I loved the location.The restaurant was good. I had french toast for breakfast which was delicious. I stayed at the Sheraton a couple nights before (downtown Nashville) it was near double the price and not as nice as the Hotel Indigo. I will definitely look for this brand next time I'm in need of a room.They ruined my vacation....I booked three rooms  for four nights under three different last names and got three different confirmation #'s.  Asked that the 3 rooms be near each other and that they each be paid for separately upon arrival....Before I even left New York on Friday....they charged my credit card for the three rooms for the entire four night stay....My credit card was now overdrawn....and I was unable to use it....my personal bill payments were now bouncing....they could not release the funds (my money) to me until Monday.... I spent hours on the phone trying to do damage control with my bank.Ok...mistakes happen....I leave Nashville on Tuesday....try to use my credit card at the airport....it's declined...Hotel Indigo did it again....they charged my credit card for three rooms for four nights....even after being paid by us upon arrival at the hotel.Spent another day cleaning up my credit card mess created by them.  Hotel personal were great except for the invisible manager Mindy ( telephone attitude)....who saw this as know big deal.Called Hotel Indigo/Intercontinental Hotel Customer Care....told me there was nothing they could do it was handled by the invisible manager Mindy.Still trying to get tim to at least pay for all of my bounced payment fees.And just to mention: Hotel has a good location, but that's it. There is a area that is one room which is used as a combination Lobby/Bar/Lounge/Restaurant all disappointing because none of it works and is nothing special....food, nothing special...rooms pretty basic. Walls paper thin you can hear people just having a normal conversation in the room next door.The request for our three rooms to be near each other:   We were on the 8th, 13th and 15th floors.BTW...I got nothing for my credit card trouble or the fees that were incurred...oh yes they told me to call my bank and work it out with them. Gee...why didn't I think of that!I booked this hotel for a bachelorette party, which required me to have multiple rooms for different amounts of days and have girls checking in at different times.  The staff at this hotel were AMAZING.  They handled each of my requests with politeness and friendliness, and made our stay so so easy.  They even put us all on the same floor without us asking!  We were able to check into each room much earlier than the 3 pm check in time which was so fantastic.  The property itself is amazing - very close to Broadway, but far enough away that the foot traffic and noise doesn't bother you at ALL.  Close to a Wells Fargo and a Starbucks.  The property is beautiful - hardwood floors in each room!  And beautifully designed bathrooms with subway tile.  Not to mention the rooms were HUGE.    I just can't say enough nice things about this place.  If I come back to Nashville I will definitely be staying there again.This place is so modern and beautiful on the inside and out! I like to come here for songwriters night whenever I can and sometimes end up staying just for fun. My room was gorgeous and overlooked the court house. The decor in the rooms is fantastic. Also, there is a Starbucks downstairs. Kudos.The hotel looks nice and modern. My room was clean, staff friendly, and internet access was included in the room. I stayed here during a Monday evening and there was a live performance in the hotel lobby. There are live performances in many restaurants and bars throughout Broadway which is the main street with all the activity and is approximately 4 blocks away. The hotel does charge $22 for valet parking service or you can park for free on the street between the hours of 6PM - 8AM. There is a parking garage attached to the hotel, not sure what the rates are. My room rate for a Monday evening was $144 total tax included. The area of improvement for this hotel was the water pressure for the shower. It was not very strong and made the shower time longer because of LACK of WATER PRESSURE.Good location, and the room was perfectly fine.  However, the air was SUPER muggy just about everywhere in the building (including in the room), so staying there wasn't particularly refreshing after a long day of work.  Perhaps the old ventilation/AC system just can't hack it when it is as hot and humid as Nashville gets in the summer.My husband and I decided to stay a night in our own city to celebrate our anniversary.  We usually don't take time to see the sights locally.  We chose the Hotel Indigo for its location, modern decor and we liked the fact it is a renovated older building.  It really was a disappointment.  Upon check in we were ""greeted"" by a nice, but ambivalent, desk clerk.  We were asked if we used valet parking.  We told him we did not.  He asked me to initial a form stating we parked ourselves, which I did.  We were checked into a wheelchair accessible room, which was fine but not necessary.  The room was very clean and well appointed.  But the shower had no door or curtain.  I thought they certainly designed it so that water would not end up all over the floor.  Wrong!  Despite the fact I tried everything I could to keep water from going everywhere, I still ended up with and inch or more of water ALL over the floor.  I used every clean towel (save for 1 to dry off with) to mop it up.  Not the end of the world, but very very irritating.  After getting ready, I attempted to call the front desk to ask for more towels so my husband could take a shower in the morning.  No answer...after calling several times.  We decided to ask the front desk clerk in person for more towels as we left for the evening.  We went downstairs and I told the same clerk who checked us in about the disaster of a shower.  He nodded as if he'd heard this problem many times before.  He told us he would contact someone to bring more towels up while we were out for the evening.  We went out for several hours and came back to the hotel.  I went into the room and straight to the bathroom to see if towels were brought as promised.  They were not!  And the soppy wet towels were still piled on the floor (no place to hang towels anywhere in the bathroom).  Oh...and when I took my shower earlier it was lukewarm at best.  NO hot water.  I didn't bother calling the front desk again (about the towels) since i was sure nobody would answer and my husband had to skip his morning shower.  Other irritations were the TV never worked properly and the wi-fi was very slow.  In the morning we noticed the bill had been slipped under the door and we took a look at it.  Even though we hadn't used valet, we had been charged $28 for valet parking.  Great.  When we checked out, the front desk clerk (a woman this time) actually thought we were lying about the valet.  I told her I had  initialed a document stating we didn't use valet and she obviously didn't believe we had done that.  After some convincing, we finally did get a credit.  But to make a guest feel like a liar...especially after the service we'd gotten since checking in....was ridiculous.  We won't be back.Pros:  Good location, clean rooms, nice toiletries (Aveda products), modern decor, nice linensCons:  Terrible customer service, no shower doors or curtains in wheelchair accessible rooms, slow wi-fi, no hot waterThis hotel could be great.  What a disapointment.We stayed at this hotel for Vanderbilt graduation, and found it to be appalling.  Looks like a social services room, with no shower door, mildew along sink back, and a bad odor throughout.  We had expected so much better, considering the price.  Would never stay here again, esp. with so many nicer options in Nashville.  My husband says it probably began as a holiday inn and got bought out and is going on reputation.  Stay away!!!We took an overnight vacation to Nashville from KY and stayed here.  The hotel itself is beautiful and the room was very nice, great design, colors, and a comfortable bed.  The only thing I will say is that they were doing some kind of construction above us which began at around 8:00am on a Saturday morning....so much for sleeping in on vacation.  It is within walking distance to Broadway and the employees were very professional and nice.  Would have given it a 3 for the lack of sleeping in but the design, cleanliness &amp; friendliness kept it a 4.Very modern looking decor. The room was clean, beds were comfortable and the staff was friendly and accommodating. Great location!I didn't stay at the hotel - just had drinks at the bar last night with five of the smartest women in Nashville, which of course made the experience better.  But the hotel bar made the experience better - it is not a small dark room like a lot of hotel bars - it is right out in the middle of the lobby, well-lit with high ceilings (a great environment for some meetings, not so conducive to others.....)  John, our bartender, was outstanding.  He was very attentive, very sweet, and fixed my manhattan immediately when I suggested it could use a bit more vermouth.  The live writer's night started just as we were ending the meeting, but we could have kept going.  The sound was not turned up so loud you couldn't hear yourself think, which is so often the case.  And the writers were great.  I recommend it for a great, classy, after work drink meetup!will probably be better when it's not under construction.We stayed here for a week. This is our second time staying in a Hotel Indigo - last year we stayed for a week in the West End location. I very very (very very, very very) very much prefer the downtown location (NOT West End) - we were on the 12th floor here and had no complaints about water pressure. The W.E. location had poor pressure, lukewarm water, toilets that refused to flush, sinks that drained slowly/not at all.. We had none of those issues here. The room was beautiful, modern and clean, our floor was quiet. The hotel restaurant was OK. I had a yogurt ""parfait"" which consisted of about a quarter cup of yogurt with two small pieces of pineapple topping .... .... ....  and how much did we pay for it? argh!  ..... But the drinks in the bar were tasty and they have nice desserts. The bar hosts writer's rounds nightly, which is a great Nashville touch. The staff is super friendly, attentive and quick.I did wish that we had a fridge/microwave in room, especially since we stayed for a longer period of time. No bathtub either, but I don't mind that so much. The bed was very comfortable (firm, not cushy, which is what I like) and the linens were very clean and fresh. This is a very insignificant thing to complain about, but is a pet peeve of mine: the in-room coffee came with powdered creamer. Not that the in-room coffee was that great to begin with, but powdered creamer just makes my eyeball twitch. A minor complaint, but it makes a difference to have the good liquid stuff, even if the good stuff is still fake chemical-ly milk. TV was fine, lots of channels.The parking blows, 22 bucks a day for valet or 20 for self-park. There is no street parking. They comped us on valet parking, maybe since we were staying with them for a decent length of time, but I'm not sure if that's the official policy or not. Our room was on Union Street, and traffic rarely was noisy enough to be distracting, although there were a couple of ambulances/fire trucks that would scream down the street. We had a nice view of the pretty new City Hall building. The hotel adjoins a somewhat mediocre Starbucks, but there are some decent dining options within walking distance - Varallo's and Provence are reasonably closeby, and then you have some tasties on 2nd avenue (nachos at Buffalo Billiards are my favorite on earth. Also, try the wings at Piranha's or the cozy Beer Sellar.. if you venture down to B'way, there's the BBQ at Jack's.. I could go on forever : ) We lived in Nashville for years before moving to Oregon and I miss the food more than I can communicate in words.) The walk to Broadway for touristy fun is quick and easy.Great experience at the Hotel Indigo downtown!!Awesome location with a very modern feel. Very close to Printer's Alley which I believe has the best bars in Nashville.The hotel is still under construction and only 1 of the 2 elevators to our tower was working. We only stayed one night so this wasn't a big deal for us. Great location and staff seemed friendly. Rooms have mini-fridge and Keurig. Bed was firm but very comfortable and the hotel was very quiet when we went to bed. Nice bar downstairs. There is also a restaurant but we didn't eat there, was a bit too stuffy for us. Overall: clean, comfy, centrally located, and felt safe. Would stay here again.The renovation on the hotel was wonderful. Great location. However there was only one elevator working at the time and during or second day it was not working. All the guests had to walk the stairs to their rooms. Nobody at the hotel ever told us about it or acknowledged the inconvenience. I have also written the hotel and the response I received never included any sort of acknowledgment of the problem. Bad customer service! I will not go back.This hotel was in a perfect location for us travelers.  It was close to all the bars and action.  Inside it was very open and lively.  It's a very nicely designed hotel.  Once again, we were stuck with a king sized bed thru our hotwire booking but we were thankfully able to get another cot.  Air conditioning was controlled by a thermostat which worked well.  The room was very nice and had an expensive feel to it.  What ruins this place was the shower water pressure.  I would rate it 1 star.  Wifi is free here.  Parking is by valet and 20 dollars.Horrible. Do NOT stay here. The toilet ran all night, we couldn't sleep. I called early at 6 am and the desk clerk couldn't do anything except take the information. I had to call back twice for the GM Mindy who when we finally spoke, scolded me for not calling to have our room changed. At 2 am, lady, I'm not really inclined to change rooms. Why couldn't you just apologize that your housekeeper/maintenance staff hadn't heard what you could hear every three minutes: a rush of water in the toilet? Also the impression I got from the overwhelmed waitstaff in the restaurant, and lacksidasical valet and desk clerks, that they were full, and overwhelmed. The nicest, most helpful person there was Miss Donna, a housekeeper.","We were in Nashville for 6 nights, and stayed here the entire time.  We had a very nice stay here, everything was very clean and our rooms were quiet.   John, one of the hotel bartenders, pours the best bloody mary's we had ever had, and those alone would be reason to come back!  If you're looking for a hotel downtown, I would highly recommend it, it is walking distance to most of the attractions.  After visiting all the different parts of the city though, we decided that for our next trip there we would probably stay in the Bellmont/Hillsboro neighborhood, so their Westend location would probably suit that a little better.I stayed here one night to attend a show at the nearby theater. The bar was very nice, the price as expected, the decor, plumbing, bed quality all good. Nice boutique feel, BUT! When I checked out and had driven a couple of hundred miles away I realized I had left an inexpensive but unique ring on the nightstand. I called to ask them to recover and send it. I did not get to speak to a live person except the receptionist. I got no call back. Called again, left message, no call back. Called again, demanded to speak to manager, redirected to housekeeper who basically treated me like a liar looking to chisel on the hotel. I am a 56 year old management professional and I do not intend to get used to such behavior. I emailed and called the chain's headquarters and registered and documented my loss and my complaint over my treatment. Two weeks now, and not a word of apology. These folks have a serious problem with customer service. I cannot recommend them, even though I really rather liked the place. Their cavalier behavior in response to my issue is unforgivable.","['came', 'conference', 'work', 'nice', 'place', 'nice', 'location', 'nice', 'view', 'city', '10th', 'floor', 'however', 'depends',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/loews-vanderbilt-hotel-nashville,Loews Vanderbilt Hotel,3.5,$$$,94,"A phenomenal hotel in a great area of Nashville, right near Vanderbilt University.Check in was easy and pleasant, all the employees were beyond friendly.Rooms were extremely clean and nicely appointed, bathrooms as well were pristine. There are plenty of outlets and a nice, big flatscreen TV.The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in! I felt surrounded and cocooned, and didn't want to wake up! I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to the concierge level and I'll tell you, the amenities this room provides is like from a by-gone era. Fantastic experience all the way around. Easily a 5 star hotel, but my final grade is a 4.5 due to the fact that the one and ONLY detriment to this place are the woefully outdated and SLOW elevators. An upgrade is definitely needed there!Our stay at Lowes was wonderful. The front desk staff really set the tone and we had a great conversation with them. We opted for self parking and it was super easy. The garage was never full and the parking decks have elevators that take you right to the lobby. Our room was nice and clean with a great view of the city. I loved the decor and furnishings in the room. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom and products  (shampoo, soap, etc) were very nice as well. The vanity mirror light in the bathroom was a little dim so I couldn't use it and the carpet and door don't really get along. You essentially have to slam the door shut which, with people coming and going at all times of the night, was a bit of an annoyance. All in all, I would definitely stay at the Lowes again. This is a wonderful place to stay in Nashville.I was surprised to see the 3.5 star overall rating on this hotel.  It was more 4.5 Stars from my last experience...and only losing a star for incredibly slow elevators...like, if you're in a hurry, you're going to be late, slow!We were there for a wedding weekend, and elevators-aside this is a great hotel.  Rooms are large, and nicely appointed.  The staff is incredibly friendly...I mean FRIENDLY!  I can't say this enough.  They really seem genuinely excited you are staying at their hotel.The bar was a pretty happening place, and the restaurant, although expensive (though no different than any other hotel of this caliber), served very good food. I would recommend this Loews to anyone!I arranged a trip to Nashville last minute and the town was busy for the Predators playoff game, marathon and other events that I couldn't get a king sized bed but rather 2 they called queen beds. They could tell I wasn't thrilled and they offered me free appetizers and drinks while I was visiting to help me sleep at night lol. They still can't get their menu together for room service as they changed the menus about a year ago but haven't changed the room menus which I find to be poorly done.The room service was great since I all but trashed the place each night but I put a note and a nice tip to apologize.Overall a great trip and nice stay there.Love this pet-friendly hotel! The staff are so nice and helpful, and the rooms are big and gorgeous.Worked for me. Great service, clean rooms with a good amount of room space and countertop space in the bathroom. The blackout shades worked well for a late night and having Mason's downstairs (which is a step above some hotel restaurant experiences) is a huge plus.Reese Witherspoon stayed in the room next to mine while I was here. That alone is worth 5 stars because OMG Legally Blonde!  She also smiled at my dog, so I know she's just as cool in real life as she seems in the movies, and she seems pretty damn cool in the movies. The hotel staff must have been inspired by her presence because they did a phenomenal job. They were probably the most impressive hotel staff I've ever dealt with. Everyone was incredibly friendly and handled every request very quickly. The room was spacious and comfortable, and the view was great. The evening wine/beer/snacks were also very appreciated, especially the beer. I would definitely stay here again, but preferably not next to Ms. Witherspoon next time. She smelled kinda weird.Good hotel on the Vanderbilt campus. Room was nicely done and the concierge level breakfast was delightful. We ended up hanging out for a few hours waiting for a flight. Lobby was a little noisy, but overall a great experience at the Loews.This hotel is just beautiful. The rooms are clean and spacious. The bathrooms are very upscale. The amenities are very nice. The concierge room is huge and they offer wonderful breakfast and evening appetizers and full bar. The staff are extremely friendly. They go above and beyond. They are extremely dog friendly. I would love to come back anytime.Loews love fest! Last week it was the Atlanta Loews, not the Loews Vanderbilt. Dog friendly, which I loved. Made me wish I still had my little Eastman!Beautifully decorated, great common area to get work done and eat Twizzlers and M&amp;Ms. Received a newly renovated room - sweeeet!Front desk remembered my name, which was nice as I scurried by on my way to a presentation, juiced up on sugar from candy.You must eat  at Mason's, the cool lobby bar. It is wonderful and the food is simply...fantastic! Kudos to the chef and the creative Southern style food choices. Great hospitality and fantastic stay!Loews vandy is..... Heaven. They welcome me and my pit doggie like we are royalty.:). EVERY time this hotel is spot on.I was in Nashville recently to celebrate my birthday and attend a movie premiere and we stayed at this hotel. I had a lovely experience. Everyone was super friendly, helpful, and conversational. I felt welcome and I felt everyone went out of their way to give us the information we needed and to make sure we were happy. Self-parking was accessible and easy. The rooms were clean and comfortable. It was quick and non-problematic to get an elevator in a timely manner. I'd stay there during my next visit to Nashville (and probably will)!If you stay here, WEAR THE ROBE!!! It is SO worth it!! This hotel was GREAT!!! The service was amazing! Everyone from the desk clerks to the housekeepers were so friendly and helpful, I really enjoyed my stay here. When I start making the amount of money it makes to stay here without financially crippling myself, I'm totally going to stay here whenever I can &amp; whenever I go anywhere!!! They even had a Keurig coffee maker with K-cups for you to easily make a nice cup of coffee. This was amazing for me because I was there for interviewing, so it helped to be able to grab a cup of coffee and run to my interviews. It has a great view too!! depending on what side of the building you're on, you could see the top of downtown Nashville or you can see the outskirts of town ! Overall, a very nice hotel. I can't wait to stay here again!!Excellent service, amenities, ambiance, LIES!  We stayed here with our dogs and two nights in a row I saw hotel patrons arrive at a the hotel bar with their dogs.  We decided to watch a football game with our dogs (two well-mannered, geriatric beagles) and were promptly told to leave.  We were informed that the other dogs were service animals.  Upon leaving I approached one of the ""service animals"" and was told by the owner that it was NOT a working dog (which was obvious to me), and informed the manager of the restaurant.  He shrugged at me like I was an idiot.  I called the desk to tell them what happened.  They called me me back to let me know that the manager ""thought it was a service dog"" and that the error has been corrected.  Liars.  Cute.  Integrity matters, Loews.Not impressed by this 4 star- for several reasons1- the hotel is under construction.  We were woken up each morning at 7am with hammering from above.  Not the relaxing weekend we were hoping to have. 2-1-2 of the 3 elevators were down/not working throughout our stay3-we found blood stains on our sheets- housekeeping came immediately to change... But....4- our 400$/night view overlooked a wall with workers ladder &amp; tools5- this is small, but trim was recently painted in our room and the blue trim tape was left up. The positive?  Free shuttle within 3 mile radiusStayed at the Loews for a few days. Service was impeccable. Everyone was nice there and the room service food was good too. The bar that they have in there has a great atmosphere as well. Will stay again here next time I'm in Nashville.Enjoyed my stay here so much! The staff are so very friendly and helpful. You are warmly greeted at the curb and helped inside. The rooms are clean and inviting. The bed and pillows are the most comfortable I've ever slept on in any hotel. I will most definitely be staying here again the next time I'm in Nashville. I highly recommend it.We had a number of issues during our stay; however, I must give the highest praise to the manager, Jenny,  who was extremely gracious when I spoke with her and offered a sincere apology.  She also made every effort to remedy my dissatisfaction. I am very grateful to Jenny and she is the only positive that we encountered at this hotel.The hotel staff is, by and large, very attentive.  The facility is lovely and very accommodating.If you have a social function, business meeting, or convention there, please pray that you do not have to deal with the loading dock and the head of security.  He doesn't care how much money your event is spending at the hotel, or what you need to do to accomplish your delivery, he wants you out of his dock space when he thinks you should be done.Nice hotel and relatively friendly staff.  They've done some renovations which are quite nice.  Great location if you don't want to be in the thick of tourists downtown, but close enough to be there in a matter of minutes.  Directly across the street from Vanderbilt University.  A lot of good choices for eating, getting a drink or listening to music.  I recommend the hotel and would definitely go back.","If I hadn't paid a premium for staying over CMAfest weekend, this place would be getting 4 stars.  Being I paid a ridiculous amount for the weekend I can't rightfully love on it.The location of the hotel is awesome if you prefer not to be downtown in the hustle and bustle.  My sister and I easily walked to drinks at South Street before dinner at Bound'ry and at Tavern the following evening.  There is a bellman driven shuttle that will take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius (downtown is roughly 1.5 miles and not a bad walk, maybe a little hilly).The rooms are pretty standard, though I prefer the eclectic Loews look over the generic Hilton rooms I've been in as of late.  Our room was clean and kept up.Fitness facility.  No.  The facility is on the second floor and was once two hotel rooms.  Yes, it is tiny.  New equipment but only our treadmills, four elliptical, two free weight benches, a cable machine, maybe something else, TINY.  No room to move around and you're right on top of the gym user next to you.   That facility needs to be expanded immediately.My sister and I used the self-serve parking for $26/day, and on the second night wondered if we could have found street parking nearby..  You may want to check the street signs before you park in the garage.Not worth the price... Check in was poorly handled. Waited 2 hours for a room with a king bed, but when I opened the door, it was a room with two small beds. My room was not clean and trash was left behind from previous guest.Construction workers left large piles of trash on the roof, which was just outside of my window. This should have been cleared daily, but was left day after day. After the second day, I just kept the curtains closed.Conference rooms smelled musty and others that I was with complained about this as well.I left my business card for management to either call or send me an email so that I could respond with my concerns. No call and no email. Not the customer service that I would expect for such a highly rated hotel.On a positive note, the wait staff in the restaurant and meeting rooms were very nice.Nice hotel and amazing staff!  Picked the hotel because it was pet friendly and sounded like they really cater to our furry family.  Unfortunately, all these goody bags other people were talking about weren't shared with our kitty.  Also, I wish there was a reference system so really clean pets would get one type of room and others would get other rooms.  Ours smelled like a pet friendly room.  The beds were super comfy though and the hotel was in a great location!Hotels are for sleeping....or should be.  At 5:30 am I received a call from security waking me up.  I hadn't requested it.  Went back to sleep and at 5:45 received another call.  Still calling the wrong room and obviously not waking up the right person.   The security officer said there must be a problem with their PBX. I called the front desk and they said they were sorry. Ok---At 6:15 I get another call from a guest that called the wrong room. I call the front desk and ask that all calls be blocked. They told me my only option is to unplug the phone.  That's it. Unplug the phone.Gorgeous hotel.  Was greeted promptly at the entrance by friendly valets (you can choose to valet or self park, I chose valet...both options do cost $).  I was efficiently checked in at one of the three sleek minimal check-in desks.  The entire lobby staff is friendly and very helpful.I was on the club level, and there are the most delicious chocolate croissants available for breakfast in the morning in the two floor club lounge. The room itself was sleek and felt luxurious- comfy king bed with great linens, large desk, and handy plugs with USB ports for easy charging for electronics.  Bathroom was also fairly spacious with a great glass wall shower with big showerhead.  I also liked the Loews hotel toiletries.  Free wifi available throughout the hotel is a bonus, and so was the gorgeous view of downtown Nashville from the huge windows.  The hotel, near Vanderbilt, was just a few miles from downtown Nashville, and was also very convenient to the highway.There's also a lounge on the first floor, along with Ruth's Chris on the lower level.  The lobby is spacious and well appointed, with cushy chairs to hang out on.The Loews Vanderbilt is a great place to stay. It's right across the street from Vanderbilt University, within walking distance of Midtown or Hillsboro Village, and a very brief cab ride (~5-8 minutes) from downtown Nashville. If you're flying in, the hotel is about 20 minutes from the airport and it's a flat $25 fare.Upon arrival, you'll find that the staff are incredibly helpful and polite. During my stay, the lobby employees were frequently happy to go the extra step, whether that meant having the cab ready by the time I completed checkout, or providing detailed directions on what to do in Nashville.The lobby area is nicely laid out; lots of space to hang out or gather with other guests. As other reviews have cited, the multi-screen TV in the lobby bar is great if there's a big game on, and the dimmed bar lighting creates a laid-back ambience. Rooms are well-maintained, comfortable, and plenty spacious; I was especially happy to have a very nice view of downtown Nashville with lots of ambient light. With all that (plus the free wi-fi!) you definitely get the above-average experience and amenities that you pay for at this hotel.Overall, this is a great hotel, and I have no complaints or constructive feedback. As a final note, I'd recommend that if you're coming here to visit Vanderbilt or head downtown, you should check out a few of the other hotels down West End Ave. which also give you walking access to campus for a possibly cheaper rate. Loews is a nice hotel, for sure, but you may want to look elsewhere if you're looking to save.Our association hosted a week-long convention at this Loews. It's a beautiful little hotel. Great ambience, friendly staff. Rooms are updated and CLEAN. I would definitely stay here again given the opportunity. Mason's (the hotel restaurant/bar) is GREAT.The hotel is not as appealing from the outside as it is on the in. First, valet is quick to approach and make sure your vehicular needs are met. The concierge was inviting and incredibly friendly to my dog who may not have taken a liking to them at first. They gave my pup a complimentary gift bag with a bone, bowl and toy, not to mention menu selection for the four legged companions as well. Stayed on the 11th floor which has a social hour section with complimentary beer, wine and hors d' oeuvres . We had nice conversation with other travelers that flocked to Nashville to see the #2 ranked firework display for 2014, just under New York City's display and our hardworking wait staff Joe!   The halls were very clean and fresh, as well as the spacious room. I'm a fan of the modern and eclectic design including the stone tiled stand showers with glass doors. Had a pretty view of Vanderbilt from the window. Two issues I ran into were... if you're going to park on any floors higher than lobby level, anticipate having to take the garage elevator to Lobby level (no further) and hauling your things to the main lobby elevator. Secondly, you always need your room key to make the elevator ride to the 10-11 floors, after a while I got the hang of it. Otherwise, great Hotel in West End Village connected to Ruth Chris with wonderful amenities and walking distance to Vanderbilt, other eateries like Five Guys or Jasons Deli and just a few minutes/10 min walk to downtown. I would suggest staying here any day !There is a lot to like about this hotel.  First, the location is ideal; directly across from the Vanderbilt University campus, accessible to the interstate and great restaurant choices. We are traveling with our 100 lb. dog and guess what?  They allow pets (for an additional fee).  This is very convenient for us, especially since there are many places to walk him around for a little ""relief"".  The room itself is clean, modern and comfortable.  The beds are VERY comfy and the mattresses feel new.  Look for deals and you can end up with a free breakfast to enjoy as well.The staff was very helpful and friendly.  I will definitely stay here again when the situation requires me to be in Nashville.We stayed here as participants in the Rock and Roll Country Music Half Marathon and it was satisfactory for what we needed and for the price we paid. This is a west end hotel - (NOT downtown) and the walk from the hotel to downtown is separated by approximately 2 miles and a questionable part of town. Thankfully they do have a shuttle that is available on a first come first served basis. This worked out great for us on a couple of occasions and not so well as the hotel got busier. The staff at this hotel were really nice and very accommodating - no complaints in that department! The hotel made available a ""carb load"" meal (pasta, bread, etc) the night before the event at a reasonable price.  This enabled us to relax and eat in our room so we could rest and ready ourselves for the early morning start of the race on Saturday.  They also made available a choice of a few items on the morning of  the race (bagels, cereal, juice, etc) as well as free water.  This was also a nice touch and appreciated by all runners, I'm sureLastly I would like to mention the beds - really comfortable and the room was very nice.  The entire hotel is well kept and very appealing. The only real complaint I have is the limited amount of coffee they provide for free (once it's gone you have to pay) and the only bottled water they have in the room is at a cost of $7.00 each! $7.00...REALLY? Be sure to stop and get water and snacks or you will pay a hefty price if you get stuck without at the hotel. All in all I would recommend this hotel.The hotel is very nice, but I gave it 3 stars as I recently received my statement from them and found several billing errors - as did several of my coworkers. We were there for a work event a few weeks ago. Several of us were charged for mini bar charges (an $8 cookie, etc) and charged double for valet parking and self parking on the same day. The hotel was nice when I called back and removed the charges, but if you stay here, be sure to check your statement carefully.Nice hotel. There is no governor on the AC so you can make icecubes in your room if you want. The rooms are nice and well appointed. However, they do have a bit of a dated look. I wasn't able to determine why I think that. It could be the room doors that lead to other rooms or the furniture. Not a big deal, just an observation.The lobby is beautiful. You can tell this is where they spend their money. The bar uses fresh ingredients for their drinks. That is a definite plus. The restaurant was pretty good. No complaints there. They have covered parking and the employees are very pleasant. No complaints.This place was great, friendly staff, restaurants withing walking distance.HOTEL IS PET FRIENDLY.  Great to see all the other dogs in the hotel. they do charge a pet fee, but they gave a lowes food bowl, food, water etc for  our dogs.nice extra touchEverybody can't be this nice in Nashville is what I thought, but everyone in the service industry that we encountered was that nice and helpful and accommodating to our needs. We were here for a conference and had the pleasure of staying here. The rooms were very nice and clean. The bathrooms were as well. The service was wonderful. The concierges were always beyond helpful and kind. They have a great shuttle service that will take you and pick you up, up to 3 miles away (to 10 pm) for free. That was great for us. Downtown isn't too far from this hotel so that was a great perk. In summary, this was a great hotel!Undergoing significant renovations but kudos to the hotel for providing perks to hotel stayers as a consolation for renovation inconveniences such as a free in-room movie, discounted dinner room service and half-price parking fees. The room was spacious and well-appointed. The parking garage is tight!!! Big cars/trucks beware!  They're extremely pet friendly.  Your doggies get a complimentary gift bag delivered to the room with a tiny bag of gourmet dry dog food, a food and water bowl, two dog chew/bone treats, a dog tag, water, and city pet magazine! They even have free pet beds you can request for your dogs to sleep on. You can tell that they wash the pet beds regularly. They even have a pet menu!We were fortunate enough to stay on the 10th floor. The service was impeccable. Miguel working the concierge lounge was one of a kind. He was so attentive and very good at his job. This hotel was lovely. We cannot say enough positive things!!!!Great hotel with a reasonable rate.Condition - 4 starsThe room was nicely furnished.  It was clean and overall in great condition.  Didn't eat at the restaurant/use the bar but the common areas were all in great condition and looked very nice.Overall the hotel looked and felt luxurious.Service - 4 starsEveryone was friendly.  Bell desk was efficient, room service (breakfast) was efficient, check-in/out was rather slow with only one out of three desks open.Free use of computer at the business center to print out boarding pass is always appreciated.Price - 3 stars$200/night 'regular' (refundable) rate, which I think was fair for a hotel of this level.Overall this is a great option if you need to visit the Vanderbilt university.I want to take a few minutes to rave about this hotel. The staff was very friendly and professional and genuinely seemed to care about our stay/visit to their hotel. My sister and I attended a concert at The Wildhorse Saloon and upon arrival at the hotel the concierge helped us with directions, transportation and information about the venue. The room and amenities were excellent as well as the location and layout. The morning of our departure we asked for a recommendation for breakfast. The concierge gave us some knowledgeable answers, directions and then went on to suggest that we store our bags and make use of the hotels Mercedes SUV. The driver took us to a local cafe called Noshville and then returned to pick us up. The effort put forth by every member of this staff will not go unnoticed and I fully intend to use this chain again in the future as well as tell everyone else that visits this area. Wonderful staff and excellent hotel!!!!Trust me-- do NOT stay at the Loews Vanderbilt!I was in town for my friend's wedding and she reserved a block of rooms for bridesmaids and folks coming in from out of town. I happily reserved a room for my boyfriend and I at a reduced rate of $149/night. The room was nice...$7 for a bottle of Fiji water, but hey, no surprise there. The room was clean, spacious, and the brunch was spectacular. Got my receipt when I checked out...no surprises at $555 and some change.HOWEVER.I checked my bank account this morning-- pending charge of $732 from Loews!Que?So I called...apparently, they charge $70 a day for ""incidentals"" if you pay with a debit card. Now, is this an instance of ""I'm young and should've known better"" or ""The hotel should've told me""? When I called to ask about the charges, the hotel acted like I should've known that it was common to charge a fee when one pays with a debit card. However, I personally think that good business practice is to inform your client *whenever you will charge them more than the price you've confirmed.* It's just courtesy to remind people, even if it IS common to charge for ""incidentals."" Sorry, Loews. Plenty of other hotels in that area to stay if I ever find myself in Nashville again.Loews is happily situated near down-town Nashville, offering shuttle service to nearby attractions.From our arrival on location, the staff were friendly and accommodating. Our bellboy, Rocco, cheerfully offered suggestions regarding local activities for our toddlers.The hotel design aesthetics are bold and attractive, featuring a rustic industrial motif. The lobby bar is fantastic for busy work or mixers--the grid-style television display sells the ambience. The room was well-appointed and basic wifi provided at no additional cost.If you are traveling with children, the ""kid menu"" food selection from the lobby restaurant is fairly diverse. My own toddlers, who typically share with me, loved their breakfast of bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, and arugula.","I really didn't know what to expect from this hotel because the reviews are a bit up and down. I had won a trip to Nashville from a songwriting competition and asked that they book me at decent hotel because I'd be traveling solo for the week. I arrived at the Loews  at about 3:30 pm and the front desk informed me that my room was not ready. After flying all night/day from Honolulu I was very tired so this was not the greatest news. I hung out in the lobby bar which had free wi-fi and a man playing beautiful music on a grand piano.An hour later I headed up to my room which was located on the 11th floor at the very end of the hallway. I'm not sure if all the rooms are this spacious, but my room was pimpadocious! I liked the modern decor and the bed was very comfy. The bathroom was not spectacular and I wasn't stoked on the low shower pressure, but the Keurig coffee maker more than made up for it. I've never used one before and boy did I put it to good use! Every day I made a fantastic cup of coffee for myself and wrote music in my cozy hotel room. I don't have very moments to myself and I soaked up every hour of alone time in my hotel robe.Each day I'd venture out to explore the city and would call my car around from my room. I decided to valet for $26 a day rather than self-park for $21 because I hate walking by myself from parking lots. It's the after effects of watching way too many horror movies while a teenager methinks. The valet were so nice and always quick to bring my car. Before I'd depart they'd ask me if I need directions and wished me a wonderful day. In the afternoons I'd partake in the complimentary sweet tea station set-up in the lobby. I would think to myself ""Why don't we drink sweet tea more in Honolulu?!"" And as I waited for my elevator back to my room I was always greeted by the men at the shoe shine station. Southern hospitality is alive and well at Loews, and I know that this is where I'll be staying on my next visit to the music city!Yelp 365 Challenge: #215/365 (The Home Away From Home)I didn't stay in a room, but from what I could tell the room was clean and comfy. The snack bar/lounge thing is cool and the snacks are good. I had a drink and some food at the bar for happy hour before going to a show in town. The food is very tasty, and the drink was good too. I had the Patron XO Cafe beverage. I believe our food consisted of wings, deviled eggs, and two other items from the menu. It was all good. My friend ended up paying, so I'm not sure how everything came out price wise. Parking is not bad if you are just there for happy hour. Find a friend to use their room key to let you out of the garage instead:)Overrated! Very expensive for an average hotel.  Staffing was horrible with a long line to check in and only two stations manned at the front desk.  Too bad they don't pay attention to their business.Im giving this hotel 5 stars because I feel like I can get a bit nasty with my reviews sometimes so when I have a good experience I have to be generous.   I'm a BIG believer in customer service and some hotels really just don't make the cut with me based purely on how I am treated by their staff.  However, the employees at THIS hotel go out of their way to help you out and make sure you enjoy your stay, so here's a big thumbs up to them!  The staff here is friendly, helpful, and quick, you will feel well taken care of at this hotel.  Highly recommended if good customer service is as important to you as it is to me.  Side note:Also a great location to run as its located near centennial park.  The concierge will also give you a map for a nice 3 mile loop if you need some extra miles!Drawbacks:No pool and normally they charge for wifi in the room (we got a free pass so this wasn't an issue for me, but looks like it's usually about 10 bucks a day).As some people said, there are a few things that could be updated, but overall, I had a good experience with the Loews, particularly because of the great service we got.  My workplace held a large, week long conference here, and the staff was accommodating and went out of their way to be helpful to our 250ish members and their families.  Marina was the best and was really on top of everything.  Plus she left little presents for us in our rooms.  The food was above average for hotel food and the continental breakfast included some really nice fruit.  Though we did eventually tire of eating in the hotel restaurant, it took a lot longer for that to happen than at many other hotels.  The cobb salad was delish.  I was happy with my room, and even happier with all the puppywatching that comes with staying in a dog friendly hotel.Southern hospitality at its best! Each hotel employee with whom we interacted could not have been nicer. I recommend staying on the 10th or 11th floor for the lounge access. Convenient location directly across from Vanderbilt University.Tennies and faded jeans make me stick out at this mostly fashionistadressedObama victory party in the main Vanderbilt Plaza Hotel ballroom. It wasn't whatit was at the casualdress Cannery Mercy Lounge Obama party four year ago. Adifferent culture and a different time, from the masses to the classes. You knowthe first time is always the best!!! But the Vanderbilt Plaza Hotel has somethinggoing for it as the office home of our environmental leader Al Gore. If its good nufffor Al . . . .  The Vanderbilt Plaza Hotel piano lounge near the ballroom is a primesample of what this hotel is all about. Pianist Bill Ferrari plunks the keys with safevanilla tunes. Waiters are flawlessly uniformed and its scent is one of properupscale southern manners and flora. The victory results are about in and the evening is climaxing at the Plaza. Excuse me while I get another drink and party!!! 4more!!!I have no idea how to rate this place because I didn't pay for it, but I'll give my 2 cents because I have them. We got this room because my dad was playing a private show for a friend and he covered travel expenses. The hotel was definitely much more than I'm used to (my dad too) and we were surprised by some of the perks. I only have a couple complaints, but that's probably because this isn't my normal hotel choice.  I realize this is a luxury hotel and not a business type deal, so there's no gym.  But, at the same time, I was disappointed to find that I couldn't work out there.  Also, the internet restriction struck me, but it wasn't that big of a deal to walk downstairs and use the free wifi. I can understand why you would have to pay for room access...ahem.The location was great and not too bad of a ride or walk to Broadway where we chose to spend all of our nights. Overall, good experience, though a bit of culture-shock at the same time.This is the hotel for anyone who hasn't been to Nashville and is looking for a budget friendly and nice hotel to stay and wants to be close to the Broadway street where all the bars are located.If it weren't for the hotel's construction during the time I was there I would probably give 5 stars. The gym was clean, the staff was friendly and the rooms were great. The hotel even offered a shuttle which was really an SUV to take us wherever we wanted.The location was super convenient for me and my friends. A cab ride costs about $7 to take us to Broadway where the bars are located and if the hotel shuttle was available we just had to pay for gratuity. Would definitely stay here again when I'm in Nashville.The hotel lobby is large and very nice. There are two restaurants and plenty of comfortable seating. The two star rating comes from the fact you pay $27 in parking per night, and the hotel lacks basic amenities. No pool or sauna, no patio or outdoor seating area. The hotel also charges for wifi which was also pretty annoying. The room was clean and looked nice, but was no different than any other hotel that charges much less. Definitely not enough bang for your buck.The rooms are nothing spectacular, but most of all the chef takes absolutely NO PRIDE in his dishes or the food he/she prepares. I stayed here for about 1 month while my house was being remodeled and ordered room service quite a bit. The first couple times, I just ignored that fact that their breakfast is scrambled or fried in some kind of disgusting vegetable oil, instead of butter, and picked through the edible parts out of sheer hunger.  Instead of the pancakes coming with a dollop of butter on top, they had an indentation in the middle where the butter was supposed to be except is was a POOL OF OIL ON TOP OF THE PANCAKES. Really? To make matters worse I had specifically asked them not to use that oil anymore and room service assured me they would not. This just pissed me off and showed me that the chef really does not care about taste or presentation. Even the eggs came SOAKING WET IN OIL. How disgusting! I can't believe they would even serve this kind of food here. What a disgrace. Other than that what more is there to boast about? Food is crap. Room is below average. I even encountered an employee at the front desk who was instructed to leave a room key to another party that was staying here... I told her my first and last name 5 different times, and after trying to call the person who's name the room was under she FINALLY looked at her notes in the system and apparently could not sound out my name. Idiot. What the hell Loews? It's the little things that count so much that make a hotel great! Hospitality is one thing, but it is not going to make up for idiots who waste one's time and crappy food that I would like to see the chef eat himself. Do better please.I was looking forward to staying here after a great experience at the Loews property in Santa Monica, but was very much let down.  This place was probably nice once upon a time, but now feels grubby and looks shopworn.  Room wasn't too bad, but common areas were pretty beaten up: stained carpets, and lots of chips and nicks on the walls in the hallways and elevators.Parking was $22/day-ridiculous!  I parked at the meters across the street, more out of spite and general principles than for economic reasons.Was disappointed to see a CD player rather than an iPod dock in the room.  Who travels with CDs anymore????   Certainly the industry standard for hotels of any reasonable quality is an iPod dock.Staff were nice enough, but the place isn't worth the prices they charge.  Avoid.I stayed here with my wife for a night and loved it. The valet was quick reliable and personable. Check in was very fast even though our card wasn't properly activated the first time. Our room was very nice. The decor was very nice and all the staff was very attentive to all of our needs. Other reviews have mentioned extra fees or charges. There are PLENTY of fees to go around if you do not read. Everything in the room that you want you can buy. Prices are clearly listed and if you don't read and use them you will be charged. There are items such as an umbrella for $30, robs for $85, bottled water for $7, and candy that also cost. It is ALL OPTIONAL! We paid a total of $67 extra at checkout for valet and a room upgrade. The price for valet wasn't listed but I was going to do it either way (valet was $30/night). We had breakfast in bed from Mason's which was great and brought in a timely manner. Also from what we noticed this hotel was VERY pretty friendly my wife didn't like it much but other people did...oh well. There hotel is pricey but definitely worth it. I'd stay there again!My wife and I chose Loews Vanderbilt Hotel as our hotel for our wedding weekend in Nashville.  From the moment we came into contact the the amazing people at the hotel we had a great experience.  The team coordinating the block of rooms was friendly, helpful and very patient with the many requests for additions to the room block.  We were greeted upon arrival and the customer service got even better as the weekend progressed.  The valet team went above and beyond, helping with both loading and unloading of our 'stuffed to the brim' vehicles.  They always had the vehicle ready when I called down for it.  The rooms were comfortable and kept clean. The beds are amazing!  The staff went out of their way to offer congratulations to us on our upcoming wedding.  I felt like a 'high roller' all weekend and it was due to the fine staff.  My wife and I had an incredible weekend in Nashville and the Loews Venderbilt Hotel helped make the experience great.Bed bug complaint!! Do not stay here! I spoke to management, including the General manager of the hotel Tony Phillips and he was beyond rude. I strongly believe I had bed bugs in the hotel and have brought them back to my home. We didn't get them through an airport or taxi. I didn't take any! I asked for a refund of the $300 for the night I stayed with my son so I could recoup some of the huge extermination fees in order to combat this problem early. Tony Phillips was beyond rude and never called me back after saying he would investigate. I was beyond nice and reasonable about this issue and this is the way I was treated. What a huge mistake staying here.The four stars is for their staff--they were awesome, very friendly and did everything right to make our stay wonderful.  This made up for the hotel's lack of amenities (pool, game room for kids, video game you can borrow like the other Loews, better bathrooms, etc.).  The only thing they need to improve on is getting rid of their fleas.  Yup, you read right.  They are pet friendly, so it is not surprising, but I walked away with a few bug bites.  It is probably from the lobby because I did not feel itchy in the room.  The hotel accommodations is probably 2-1/2 to 3 stars.Beds are amazing.  Staff friendly.  I'd come back.Walking in on Friday night, tired from a long day of travel, the Loews was like a glass of sweet tea.  Alex, at the front desk, was incredibly kind and helpful during check-in.  The room was great.  The AC was cranking (and I could have changed it if I wanted to...but I didn't) and the bed was so comfortable.  Little details, like having song lyrics in the elevator, having really great smelling bath products, and providing icy peach water in the lobby made my stay there a treat.Nice hotel was there on business and they took care of us. The beds are comfy and love the huge shower! Only bad thing was they was filming the show Nashville and made getting in and out of the hotel a pain. But nice place to stay little bars and eateries around it within walking distance.I had a very nice experience at this Hotel.  What a nice surprise.  The room service was delicious, the room was clean and up to date, and the bathroom was in very good shape...will stay there again.","I didn't stay here, but I took a nap in their bed while I waited for my mom to finish packing from her trip!  Super comfy bed!The only encounter with staff that I had personally was with the valet staff, who was always right at my wheels and ready to park my car, although I never did need their services.My mom received a $50 credit to spend at the hotel, which I thought was great.  So after humming and ha-ing over the gift shop to find items to total to $50, she made some purchases for friends and family, and charged it to the room.  When she went to check out, they informed her that the credit did not include items from the gift shop, so not only did she have to pay for those items, but she still had this $50 that was going to go to waste!She ended up spending it on a fruit/cheese plate and some flat breads from the hotel kitchen, which was really for me (since she was headed to the airport).  So boyfriend and I feasted that night on the hotel, but overall, I'd say my mom got duped out of $50.Kind of a high price to pay for some bread, cheese &amp; fruit.  Not to mention that it didn't seem like the hotel was living up to the standard, considering the cost of a room.  Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends/family.  I felt it was generally overpriced, and you could get more bang for your buck at one of the many other hotels in the area.We stayed here during construction and they took good care of us.  Free continental breakfast if you stay on the 9th floor or higher.  Its a nice lounge over looking the college.  Rooms were very clean the people very nice.  Cabs ready to take you anywhere in Nashville.  We will go back.Comfy and clean but would probably stay downtown next time due to hassle of not being able to walk anywhere. Plus had to pay for wi-fi in room.THIS HOTEL WAS A TOTAL DUMP WITH HORRIFIC CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I made a reservation two months in advance for double beds. I showed up and the manager said they only had a king reserved. Then she said she didnt give the room away.  I asked her how she didnt give the room away if it is not reserved now. No response. Then she said she will give a discount, which of course I said I need the night free. Hallways were really dirty.  Overpriced garbage. DO NOT stay here. For the money, stay at the Hutton. It is a much better place. That's where I moved over to.Beautiful luxury hotel. Best benefits besides Pravda filled store on the lobby level is the accommodations for traveling pets. As a tour manager for a number of years, I often travel with my babies as well as clients' furry children and the Loews never disappoints. They feature special accommodations for furry visitors, I.e. furry guest food room service and special maid and valet services -- not to mention the in-room bar also houses treats for the wary little furry traveler. All room service items are also served on the finest China and Waterford crystal water bowls. How can any furry visitor ever complain. Of the thousands of hotels and motels visited, this one is far more accommodating to the other road warriors besides the human variety.For humans, there is luxurious accommodations which features spa tubs, big and fluffy robes, as well as a bed that can make one sleep for a decade without interruption. The rooms are a good size, clean, well maintained and house an expensive mini-bar. The views (on upper floors) of Nashville are amazing. One caveat for travelers was the expensive phone charges; however, with cell phones, it is possible to never use that expensive item. All in all, the Loews is a good bet especially when traveling with pets.This rating should be more of a 3.5. One of my friends was holding her wedding at this hotel, which is why we ended up staying here.  They gave us a really good rate for such a large group. Overall my experience at the hotel had been positive. Very friendly service, clean rooms, comfortable beds, This hotel would of gotten 4.5 stars from me if it wasn't for the fact that we came back to our room and it wasn't cleaned. (We had been gone from the room from 10am to 3pm... and we didn't forget to take out the do not disturb sign) I personally think that's unacceptable for a higher end hotel. Then the maid shows up at 4pm and was asking to clean the room. I told her to come back at 6pm because we were getting ready for the wedding and she said 6pm was too late. What? Seriously?! Eventually she agreed and when we came back later that evening, our room had been cleaned. Needless to say I was surprised and not very happy by that particular incident.Hotel is beautiful and the staff is beyond amazing and super friendly.  The southern style food is delicious and comforting. Great place to have a conference!Absolutely hideous hotel.  Overpriced, horrific service.  For my first 24 hours I had to be let into my room by the valet.  My room key never worked.  We went through 6 sets of new keys.  I spent all my time riding up and down the elevator and standing at the desk!  No manager contact ever.  THEN FiNALLY they switched my room....we went up and the key didn't work!,  I missed the dinner that I had come to town for and I couldn't get into my room to shower and change!  Still no manager!!  Nothing!!  So they switched me to yet another room.  I had to pack up and drag everything to the new room, all while I was supposed to be at a dinner! That had begun an hour earlier. Just silly. Never seen anything like it.  All in we made 8 different attempts to get into my room.....8!  I was told earlier that engineering had come and fixed the lock....got new keys....rode the elevator....again....keys didn't work!  Unbelievable. Still no manager!  One star is too many.Very nice hotel --  BUT very surprised that the add $70.00 per night to the charges for potential amenities - assume it is refunded if you do not use them?   Also $21.00 per day for parking was a huge surprise.  Entry from 2nd floor garage is really not up to the standards of the rest of the hotelSpacious room!  Wonderful bed!  Friendly service!  $10 cab ride (with tip) to Broadway bar scene. $30/night self park was a bit expensive.  Right across the street from the beautiful Vanderbilt campus. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Very easy to get to, right off interstate 40. Would stay at Loews again!I had a great stay, but that was because I was staying in an executive suite that I wasn't paying for. It was spacious, with two bathrooms, and had a kitchen tucked away on the end. We especially loved the soft bathrobes that were hanging in the closet. Their rates are on the high side and they do charge you for extras like the internet. My room included access to the Concierge Lounge, where they serve a continental breakfast and evening hors d'ouvres. Breakfast was okay, but the hors d'ouvres were just greasy little sandwiches, some olives, and fried pickle slices.My best friend and I were traveling across country and decided to stay at the Vanderbilt on our way through Nashville. We were amazed at how great of a hotel it was; from their staff, to their dining, to the bar. We checked in with a dog, and their pet friendliness was superior to anywhere else I've stayed. 5 minutes after getting into our room, a member of the staff dropped off a doggie welcome bag. The bellman who brought up our bags (no easy fete) got me ice for my stow-away coors lights, and proceeded to help me make room in the fridge as well. The bad tending staff downstairs was exceptional, and helpful. He helped to provide with information about the city and transportation. The best part is everyone who works there is knowledgable about the hotel, not seeming to not be helpful. It makes for such an easy stay when everyone is on the same team in terms of customer service. Definitely will be staying nowhere else other than the Loews when in Nashville, as well as look forward to seeing their brand elsewhere!As many other reviews point out, the amenities are dated, the restaurant is awful (see their menu online; I feel I was warned about this), the prices are inflated, and ongoing construction is a problem. Wireless internet is often too slow to use; I generally gave up trying. The fitness center lacks a pool. The rooms are comfortable and reasonably well-appointed, but not for the price. The breakfast and happy hour available if you stay above the 9th floor are nice touches, and the staff is generally friendly and helpful. It's a comfortable night's sleep. The location is convenient to downtown or west Nashville, and especially to Vanderbilt. It just isn't worth nearly $500/night with parking, internet, and various fees included. There is no gift shop. Need some Tylenol? Feminine hygiene products? A snack? A toothbrush? The front desk will cheerfully direct you to the pharmacy at the far end of campus - hope you drove here, never forget to pack anything, or like long walks. They have plenty of empty space that could be used for a shop, but that was not one of their choices in the indefinitely-ongoing renovations. The concierge service was cheerful but iffy. I called down for directions back to the airport and was told I could come down and look at a map - they couldn't tell me over the phone to take I-40 to which exit, or about how long it took. They gave me incorrect information about how to print boarding passes before leaving, telling me I had to pay for it (the front desk straightened that out). They had shockingly few suggestions for fine dining or live music.  The places they recommended were not very good, in a city with lots of great food and music.  You may want to do your research before traveling.I'd rate the hotel reasonably highly if it were $150 or $200/night. For that price, all I want is a clean room and a bed, a TV, and no frills are required. At these prices, though, one expects the very best in accommodations and service. You won't get that here. If you aren't paying for your stay, want to be in the Vanderbilt area, and nearby hotels are booked (my problem), this wouldn't be a bad place to stay. If you're going to be busy all day and just want a comfy place to sleep, this is fine. But if you're paying, you deserve much more bang for your buck.Came here on a recommendation and a deal from my sister (she knows people) ; ) Overall, I was very happy with the hotel. After my 6.5 hr drive from Chicago, I was able to check in early without hassle. The location is great  -- awesome proximity to downtown, nice accommodations (i.e. comfortable bed and linens, yummy coffee, nice decor), friendly staff members. Also, we had a beautiful view of Vandy's campus from our 7th floor room.  My only complaint is the up charging of EVERYTHING. Parking - $21/day!, Wifi - additional up charge and to top it all off... the room was stocked with treats and bottles of water that I didn't dare open - $5 a for a bottle. I was scared to take the postcards provided on the desk, in fear that I would get an extra $100 charge on my CC. If I'm ever in Nashville again, I'll stay here -- but this time, I hope I'm not paying.I stayed here this weekend with a group of friends while visiting Nashville. While we can say I didn't spend too much time in the room, the accommodations were excellent. We always had fresh towels made readily available, maid service came at a reasonable time while we were out of the room, and everything was left in perfect order. Also, we were able to reserve on the 10th floor which gave us a nice view of the city. Every afternoon, they serve free hours d'ouevres in the 10th floor lounge from 5pm to 7pm and complimentary sodas and water.   The parking was right next to the building and everything connects to the hotel. You can even open and close the garage gates with the room key. If you don't feel like taking the car out for the day, they offer a complimentary shuttle that will take you pretty much wherever you want to go and pick you up as well.I definitely enjoyed staying at this hotel. The pros are that the staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is great; across the street from Vanderbilt. The rooms are nice without being plush. The workout room is large for a hotel, and towels were provided, as well as lemon water. (Watch out though, it's really strong lemon water.)The cons are that the workout room had several broken machines in it. The room wasn't super-clean, although it was overall clean. And there is not free internet in the rooms. I wasn't staying long enough to need it, so it didn't matter anyway.We loved this hotel. It was under construction during our stay which made it tough but it didn't impact us that much. We took advantage of their free 3-mile shuttle service which was great! The staff was friendly and accommodating. There is also a free bus that can take you around town although we didn't use it.I got a great deal on Priceline and was able to stay at this 4-star hotel for less than $100.  That said, there are some add-ons that you need to include, even if you do get a deal on Priceline.Internet is $9.95/day.The connection is pretty good, but could be slow at times.  I had trouble connecting to the server, but I called the Tech Help Hotline and they fixed the issue in a matter of minutes.  The manager sent up his business card, a free small bottle of single malt whiskey, and some chocolate to apologize for the inconvenience.  Classy.  Valet parking is $24/day.If you call down for your car 5 minutes before you go downstairs, they will have the car waiting for you.  Very friendly, quick, and efficient.The hotel is conveniently located near Vanderbilt University.  We had a quiet corner room on the 2nd floor.  The bed was excellent, as were the pillows.  The room was a little on the smaller side, but well furnished.  The shower could stand to be updated, but was clean and functional.I'd say this hotel is somewhere between a Marriott and a JW Marriott in terms of amenities.  There is no pool, but that didn't bother me.  I would stay here again because the room was comfy and the service was EXCELLENT.  I can't say enough good things about the friendliness and professionalism of the staff.We arrived not realizing that the hotel was under rehabilitation. I was nervous. But, from the moment we walked up to the front desk, everyone couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating. Construction is only 9 a.m - 6 p.m. - not when most people would be sleeping. And they give free wifi to guests, discounted dinners and a free movie each night in the room just to make you feel good. The room as spacious, clean and the hotel was much quieter than I could have even hoped. The bed was heavenly. These folks know how to treat guest well!I like the Loews Vanderbilt.  Overall, I'm a fan of Loews hotels, and this was no exception.  I'm giving it a four star, when it could be 3.5 or 3.75, simply because they were smart enough to create a ""living social"" group coupon deal that made a visit to Nashville worth it.  Two nights, valet parking, and two tickets to the Country Music Hall of Fame for something like $200.  Great deal, good job team Loews.  The amenities were updated (flat screen, big comfy bed, desk and good furniture).  Bathroom was so-so, and overall the room a bit toight.  That said, they've got a Ruth's Chris in the bottom floor, and are within walking distance of some great locations (i.e. Vanderbilt is across the street, plenty of restaurants in the area, etc.).  Speaking of great locations... walk down West End ave to the Hutton Hotel, go into Grill 1808... and get the burger.  It's the greatest burger I've ever had. There ya go... two reviews in one.  Enjoy your stay.","We just checked out of the Loews Vanderbilt and would not choose to stay there again....ever. Our connecting rooms had views of a concrete wall, there was a tylenol left on the bathroom room floor and a can of cleaning spray by the tv. Not so great when you are traveling with a 2 year old. Mold on the ceiling fans, dirty doors, and shower heads that were really more like a sprinkler system. Breakfast was a disaster. Cold english muffins, soupy oatmeal, unrecognizable meat on the egg dish and it took forever. Ick. The bellman never showed up to help all 5 of us with our luggage so we ended up thunder gunning it down ourselves. The front desk staff...rude and the concierge was clueless. Extremely disappointing. Next time we are in Nashville we'll stay at  Union Station. For the $$$$, Loews IS NOT worth it. It felt more like a motel 6. Boo!!!!Excellent service. Friendly staff. great location Right across street from Vanderbilt. The room was large. Had a comfortable king size bed.  The bar downstairs had live music.  Overall quite pleased.I stayed here for a conference last year.  The lobby is very pretty and rooms were nice - the beds were super comfortable. Since I wasn't paying, I wasn't too concerned with the price, but I do think it's a bit much for what you get. The conference facilities were nice, but I had a horrible meal in the restuarant (crappy, overpriced food and horrobel service). The workout room is pretty small and basic, and the hotel itself is kind of far from the main drag with most of the bars and resturants. If I come back to Nashville, I would look elsewhere for a place to stay.Before I moved to Music City, I stayed in the Loews for a weekend.  (Lucky me, I know) It is probably one of the best hotels in town.  Conveniently located across the street from Vanderbilt, it is usually frequented by Vandy parents during game weekends and parent weekends.  CAUTION! Don't even try to book a room during Vanderbilt move in weekend or graduation.  Typically, the rooms are booked a year in advance. When I stayed there (several years ago), they had offered some smoking rooms, however the laws have changed in Nashville, so they may not offer them anymore!Obviously I ordered a Vanderbilt Sunday from room service, and obviously it was awesome!Hotel was really nice and clean.  The lobby was nice, the staff was helpful and friendly.  I enjoyed my stay here and will stay here again.  The location is great as it is right opposite Vanderbilt University as well.We had a very arroyos issue while staying here. I originally made my reservations through a manager named Doug. Upon arrival I left him two message to call my room or my cell, he never did. When I asked I was informed her was on site but ""busy"". However I got to meet Eli who not only immediately took care of my issue but continued to tell me she understood why I was so upset. Her reaction and her instant response to the very serious situation is what make me give this place a good review.Sometimes you judge a place based on how well they deal with an issue. I got to the hotel late (10PM), but wasn't worried as I had a guaranteed reservation. Of course they were overbooked and didn't have a room. I was ""walked"" (new industry term I learned) to the ""brand new"" Hotel Indigo (see my review on that on) 3 blocks away. The front desk was really apologetic, but asked ""do you need a ride?"" 10 pm. Not from Nashville. Do I need a ride??? I didn't answer.Someone else in our party had been ""walked"" as well and they were given a rash of hell for this by our CEO. They comped both of our rooms at the Indigo, picked up dinner for 7 Thurs night, sent a nice gift basket to our rooms and issues 3-4 personal apologies. They recovered well.The room was small and a little dated (especially after staying at the Indigo with 2 (two) flat screens in the room). The rest of the facilities (save the restaurant...don't go) were fine. They know how to host meetings well. Bartender downstairs fixed a pretty good martini (gin selection needs work).1 star without the good recovery. 3 for handling it well and addressing it directly.This may have been my favorite hotel that I have been to. The staff was awesome. There was a nice fitness room. I am used to staying in roach motels, so this was a welcome change. It is a very cheap cab ride downtown with plenty of food options surrounding the hotel.We stayed here for convenience; close to children's hospital. Arrived about 4am and didn't want to look around for hotel.  Location and hotel are very nice.  The room was small and expensive, even with discount.  Hooray that wi-fi and parking were free...maybe because it was Saturday? Probably won't stay again.I stayed here on my first ever visit to Nashville, and I can't say i was that impressed. My first reaction based on the price i was shocked at how small the rooms are, and the hotel itself just is nothing to great. I'm not that hard to please I tend to stay at W hotels, or boutique hotels but I have also been in my share of less expensive hotels/motels across our fine country. My feeling is if you are going to spend the big bucks you better get what you pay for.. As for location if you want to be next to Vanderbilt you don't get much closer, if you want to be downtown and hit the strip well there are plenty of hotels down there and I would suggest looking into those. Now the real reason i write this review: Be warned. I got a call from someone claiming to be the front desk at this hotel asking for my credit card number while i was in my room and they knew my name. If this ever happens to you just tell them no and go to the front desk. I was caught off guard, the person who called said my card was not accepted I thought that was odd and at their request i went ahead and gave the card number again, they claimed it still did not work and wanted another card, so i gave them another card number. The second card number I gave was of a card that was new and never used before or since. The following day i got a call from my card company telling me i had about $10,000 worth of charges to my personal card, one charge from a domino's pizza in Nashville (i don't eat domino's) and the rest from different Internet sites. I then checked the other card, the one that I only used once at that hotel, I had an additional $8,000 worth of charges on that card - all from the same Internet sites as my personal card. I called the hotel to explain what happened, they were not very accommodating. Obviously my credit card company will take care of these charges, i just wanted to let the hotel know that they either had someone on their staff stealing card info or more likely someone on the staff was selling the guest info to someone - all they needed to give was name and room number since I'm the one who gave my card number. When i got through to someone at the hotel, this took days, they told me they had no record of my card not being accepted, no record of any of the staff calling me. The person who called knew my room number and name for sure, and with the kind of charges they made they would also need to have billing address- all info the hotel had, and the reason again i have no doubt it was this that caused the charges. 1. I never used that one card anywhere else. 2. the first charge was a local domino's, 3. the person who called me had my room number and name. 3, The hotel says they have no record of the front desk ever calling me. My only reason for calling the hotel to tell them this was so they knew there was a problem, and so this would not happen to others. You would think the hotel would have at least given me some kind of comp, or maybe just an apology - I got neither. I will not be staying here again and I will be more careful when ""front desks employees call me""I just got back from spending the weekend of the 4th at the Loews Vanderbilt.  My husband and I decided to take a roadtrip and get out of town last-minute for fun.  But we didn't have arrangments for our dog so our options were limited when searching for dog-friendly hotels.  We found the Loews and quickly made a reservation.  I was hoping they would treat guests with dogs decently but wasn't sure what to expect.I could not believe the service that my pet (as well as us!) received.  As soon as we checked in, a doggy welcome gift basket was sent to our room.  It was filled with dog treats and cookies, gourmet dog food, a food dish and welcome mat.  It was way over the top and beyond what I would have expected.  We valet parked the car for the weekend which concerned me becuase at other hotels, it seems to take a year to get your car any time you need it.  Not at Loews--our car was brought to us consistently in minutes, which really impressed me.  Every time we stopped in or out of the hotel, they were nice to us and asked us how our dog was doing in the hotel.Late on the 4th of July, I needed to do something for work on a computer, but the concierge facility was closed.  They let me use the business center computer at no charge for over an hour.  It's this kind of service I really appreciate above any facilities.  I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it--especially to anyone traveling with pets!If you believe in getting what you paid for, do not visit this hotel. The hotel is a dump for a ""4 1/2 star"" or whatever you want to believe based on your research.  I don't know where the good reviews come from but if you come in during the PM shift, from my experience,  you will be treated like dirt. The front desk staff was extremely rude. The valet driver's were nice until they realized I didn't want to pay $78 for 33 hrs worth of parking (plus expected tips I suppose). Loews brands themselves as ""kid friendly""...I had a 2 1/2 yrd old along and they didn't once mention anything special. There is not even a pool at this location. There was a hair in the bathroom and hair on the bed comforter we did not place there. The building is falling apart. It looks like they did a recent renovation but it was incomplete. The light switch covers are stained and there is wear and tear everywhere. The ice machines are from the 80's maybe and you have to go to an ""even"" floor to get ice. Some of the ceiling tiles are not placed properly and the elevators smell like mold. This place needs help and I need a refund. Dissatisfied completely. I should have read the reviews before staying - bed bugs....doesn't surprise me. What a ripoff.Yeah, I'm bumping the Loews Vanderbilt Hotel up to four stars... SUPER comfy pillows on the bed, a Keurig coffee machine in my room, and nice smelling travel sized shampoos, etc. Helpful and friendly front desk/valet hotel staff and complimentary candy corns at check-in.If this place wasn't a luxury hotel with fairly expensive rates I would have considered giving it a higher rating.  The hotel staff was very friendly, but after a very tiring day of of traveling (full of delays) we arrived at 3pm (the time of check-in) only to discover that they wouldn't have a room for us until 4:30pm.  Not to mention I had requested early check-in!  Our room was a bit on the small side with 2 full size beds, and the bathroom didn't have a fan, making the whole room foggy and hot and hard to get ready.  And internet was expensive ($10 per day). All that aside, the conference rooms were nice (aside from a time or two when our electronic equipment was not ready), the lobby is beautiful, and their in-house restaurant nice for lunch.","['phenomenal', 'hotel', 'great', 'area', 'right', 'near', 'university', 'check', 'easy', 'pleasant', 'employees', 'beyond', 'friendly', 'rooms', 'extremely', 'clean', 'nicely', 'appointed',
