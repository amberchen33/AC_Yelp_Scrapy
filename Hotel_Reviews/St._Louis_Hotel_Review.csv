http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-st-louis-brentwood-brentwood,Springhill Suites St. Louis - Brentwood,4.0,$$,29,"Our biggest hassle was tracking down our confirmation. We booked ours through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotelPlanner.com&amp;s=3eefff646d9c25f8f047fc872f1750fbb053c7b4b3998968feb1dffa5ffa48f6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">HotelPlanner.com</a>--would not recommend! Cut the middle man and go straight to the site and call to make the reservation. I just assumed that the site would automatically send you a confirmation notice via email like all other courteous, intelligent, place would--not this. I waited until the day of to check my inbox and spam--nothing. We had to look at our search history to identify the hotel and call the number on our credit card charges to receive the confirmation email with itinerary. The overall hotel room is clean. I was expecting the queen bed suite to be bigger, but it's still roomy enough for a family of five. The pool, however, was itty bitty!! Big enough for our three kids under twelve, but as soon three random, overly lonely, and awkward guys in their twenties stepped in and decided to wrestle with each other, it was time to take our kids out. They were like little twigs in a kiddy pool with three elephants. Luckily the hotel ha a partnership with The Heights, a fitness club, that's less than 3 minutes away. There's open swim and a splash area. The front desk gals there were ultra nice! Given the convenience and free access to this beautiful place, gotta give this experience a four-star rating.Beds okPillows okRoom coffee goodDon't stay on the highway side of the building if white noise all night will bother youReasonable breakfastFree faxingDecent, unexceptional Springhill location.I'm generally a fan of this iteration of the Marriott brand. They tend to have clean, modern decor and reasonable prices. This location (in comparison to others I've stayed at) was just okay.First, the staff is really nice - there are a lot of other reviews mentioning that, and they're right. From the front desk to the breakfast staff - everyone is friendly and welcoming. It's also a new-ish property so the decor is updated. Another nice feature is the fact that there are multiple restaurants and retail establishments within walking distance which is ideal if you don't have a car.In terns of the room/experience - wasn't a huge fan. No outlets at ALL near the bed. None. Nada. WTF - it is 2015 and people have stuff to charge and laptops to work from. Outlets, stat - please! The wifi is free but I had issues getting it to work/not drop, which is a bummer when you're trying to get stuff done.Also not a fan of the lighting situation - everything is florescent, and there are no bedside lights. Just a huge fixture over the bed that shines with the light of 10,000 suns. Someone else described it as ""bright enough to perform surgery by"" which is fairly accurate. Not restful. My bathroom was ""meh"" in terms of cleanliness, particularly the walk in shower stall which reeked of mildew. The room rate I paid was $189/night which I thought was WAY overpriced.Overall, this is a decent, but not great, place to stay for a single business traveler. I would be leery of reserving if you're expecting people to share rooms as there is not much privacy. For example, the bathroom doors are frosted glass so if you were forced to room with a co-worker or something, it would be SUPER awkward.Nice hotel located right off of Brentwood in St. Louis. This place has pretty much everything that a business traveller could hope for, decent amenities, nice and modern, friendly staff and a very convenient location. The room itself was typical for a Springhill property, nice and clean and fairly modern, with bright colors and a good size. Parking is pretty easy with a structure adjacent to the property. The lobby and reception desk is a bit on the small side but really not anything to complain about here. Overall, highly recommended for business travelers. Pros-Marriott propertyParking Free wifi Light breakfast QuietModern Spacious rooms Cons-Cheaper decor Small lobby Not many snack optionsGreat hotel for the area.  We always stay here when we visit St Louis.  It is out of the way, but close to everything.  Rooms are clean.  Breakfast is standard.  Alcohol drinks can be purchased in the lobby.  Staff are friendly.  There's also lots of parking.Easy access to many amenities and free parking with great service. I loved how clean and big the rooms were. They also have free breakfast. I also liked how I could get tea at any time of the day for free. The employees were all very friendly and helpful. There is s parking garage next to it that is free and essily accessible from the hotel. One other bonus was that their standard free wifi worked so well. I hate when wifi is slow or cuts you off and this never happened to us during our stay.I have returned several times since my last review, and while not perfect, there have been improvements. I choose to stay here because it is a Marriott property and it's location.Excellent greeting by JC. Huge room, comfortable bed with office/living room area. Microwave and fridge are provided. The parking lot is spacious but could use a little more lighting for safety. Close to I64 and Washington University. Plenty of chain restaurants next to the hotel, along with a Lowe's across the street. The complimentary breakfast was excellent and it led to this high rating. Fresh strawberries and sliced pineapple along with hard boiled and scrambled eggs are all provided. There's also an abundance of toppings for your oatmeal and ham and cheeses to select from.it was cool....nice location especially for business travelers....not the best Springhill that i've been.  Judy the house maid is a mental patient....  The TV channels here move super slow..... TNT doesn't even have sound...Why the hell don't they have VH1 and BET??  makes you wonder hmmm......(racist perhaps?) for 139+ tax per night? then again how many black people do you see in Brentwood, MIssouri.....lolEnjoyed our stay! Nice room for a Priceline bid of $80/night on a Saturday. Plenty of parking that's just walking distance from the lobby. A good variety of restaurants within walking distance or very short drive.I would love to give five stars to this nicely furnished and suite filled hotel but I can't. The rooms themselves are fairly recently updated and look clean and fresh. That's about where the happy ends. Upon returning late in the evening the employee behind the counter never looked up to see who had entered and was going to the elevator. This was an employee that I hadn't seen when I checked in and would have expected them to ask for the the room key or a photo ID. The walls are so thin that while I was asleep the guy in the bathroom that was on the wall where the headboard was woke me up every time he peed. The sound of your neighbors pee isn't the way to wake up. Yuck. When the night staff slid the bill under the door at 4am they lost balance and fell in to the door. I guess that is likely a one time mistake but it didn't add to my happiness. And I normally like the breakfast available but on this day the eggs smelled like fish. Old fish. And I wasn't the only one who thought so.I've stayed here three times in the last few months but will be trying a different location on my next visit.Cons: Found a hair (that did not belong to me) in what was supposed to be a clean towel. No complimentary bottled water. Heater was so loud it sounded like there was a blizzard inside the room.  No shower cap. Cheap soap left a grimy film on skin. Pros: Quick check in/out. Free WiFi.  Free breakfast (though not a very good selection so maybe this should be a con). Close to restaurants.Whenever I see a Springhill near where I'm going- I stay there.  In today's day in and age, there are a few perks that have now become necessity.  Free wi-fi is a must and though the internet speeds are not the best, it gets the job done.  Free parking, because nothing annoys me more than seeing a decent hotel price online only to pull-in and pay a huge fee just to park.  Free breakfast, because...well who doesn't love free breakfast?  And it's a decent spread too: bagels, toast, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, pork sausage, coffee and other drinks, and a waffle station, among others.The rooms are incredibly comfortable with feather pillows and a soft bed.  There are several outlets in the room so you can connect your electronics and like other reviewers have stated, a fairly large walk-in shower.  An empty mini-fridge to keep your left-overs in and a microwave to heat them up.Within range of most must-see St. Louis neighborhoods by car and near the highway.  I definitely would stay again.Clean hotelGood serviceAffordableFree breakfast+parking+Wi-FiI forgot my clothes in the lobby and they ship them to me for free.If I go to st. Louis next time I will stay in the same hotel.This is a fine hotel with nice staff and an above-average hot breakfast. However, I have concerns over the cleanliness. When I arrived (at 2AM) there were bottles of cleaning supplies in my bathroom. During my stay I found hair that was not mine and the towels often had weird dryer fuzz on them. The refrigerator was really dirty and smelled bad. When I called the front desk, the manager came up to my room and cleaned it himself. I was very impressed but I will not choose to come back.Nice place to hang my hat.Comfy bed. Fluffy white linens. A shower large enough to be featured on MTV cribs: orgy edition. There's so much to like about this place. Really, I could go on- and I will...Lots of clean lines, large rooms, in room microwave and mini fridge, flat screen, free parking, wifi, diy waffle (and more) breakfast in lobby, nice pool, 24 hour gym, divider separated area w/ pull out sofa bed should you have company, ipod dock/radio/alarm, check out wasn't until noon, and so much more. The lobby doors are locked at night for safety so if you're checking in late like us, you might have to wait outside until the desk clerk lady determines you aren't a threat... I don't blame her for not immediately letting us in though. It was a long drive and I had no make-up on and I'm sure I was looking all kinds of toe up in her upper mid-level all suite hotel. I would defo stay here again if in the STL area. It's reasonably priced at around a hundo a night + taxes and sh*t; and it's less than a mile from Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Nordstrom Rack, Target, Walmart, basically all the necessity providers in life. And a short 10-15 minute drive into the heart of STL.Oh, one last thing- FREE CHUPA CHUPS IN THE LOBBY CANDY DISH!!!My 14 year old son recently traveled to St. Louis with his school for the World  Robotics Competition in mid April.  Upon returning home, he realized he had left his glasses and case behind.  We called the hotel and honestly,  I was not very optimistic they would turn up during the room cleaning.  Well, two weeks later I received a call that they had indeed found his glasses and were going to mail them back to us.  I know this doesn't sound like a big deal but it really shows the level of customer service the Operations Supervisor, Kevin Juilfs, delivers.  It would have been much easier to toss the glasses or ignore our request but he went above and beyond and actually kept my contact information and sent them back to us in Tennessee.  We received them in the mail yesterday and just wanted to show our appreciation to the Springhill Suites Marriott for their kindness and professionalism.  Excellent job!This Springhill Suites is as nice an urban hotel as I have seen in a long time.  The design of the hotel is very European (reminds me of London) and the staff was very helpful with getting me around.The free breakfast was about what I expected, coffee was good and available 24x7, and the room was very large with lots of room to spread out and get some work done.They also were helpful in letting me check out late.  Used my Marriott points so not sure how the cost is, but I am going to be staying at more Marriott properties in the future, based on my experience with this hotel.Large rooms with separate seating area. L shaped sofa and desk, micro and fridge, clean and comfortable. Good location. Close to shopping and food. Close to Washington University. Pool, breakfast, free wifi, gym, computer stations available. Not expensive. Lots of perks.Very similar to any of the other newly built or renovated Sprinhill Suites that are out there, and this is a very good thing. These places are always clean, usually has a shower (NO TUB!), free breakfast, nice atmosphere, free Internet, HDTV, good AC, parking garage and nice staff. This place is right off the highway so it is easily accessed. It is in an area with a bunch of shops and restaurants so you can get the stuff you want quickly and easily. The rooms are very fairly priced for the quality of experience you will get. I will definitely stay here again when I visit STL and need to stay west of downtown.","I wish every hotel was at least this nice. Newer hotel with big rooms. Separate work, sleeping, and lounge are in each room. Wet bar with microwave, refrigerator etc. Nice touch is including paper plates and plastic utensils for those eat-in nights. Super clean and very nice staff.This hotel was very nice! It was centered in my opinion to St Louis. Not a far drive to downtown. The rooms were nice and very clean had a king size bed, a big screen TV bedroom was separated by the entry which had a couch, table, fridge, microwave and sink. Kinda like a studio apartment in my eyes. It had a free breakfast, covered parking and nice location. Store's near by were: Walmart, Starbucks, Qdoba and easy access to highway. I was able to get a room right around last minute so I cant complain. The staff was friendly and helped us out of towners find our way to local shopping and restaurants. I would stay here again with my next visit.Nice hotel. Friendly staff.  Breakfast setup is nice with large high table with single chairs surrounding.We decided to stay at Springhill Suites for the weekend to accommodate our desire for a little haven away from the bustle of things we were in St. Louis to do.  It met our requirements in spades.  One of the things I hate about most hotels is the patent ugly 80's mauve floral decor is that is so prevalent.  Well, no ugly mauve here.  No floral either.  The decor is quite refreshing and modern, actually.  The king memory foam bed is separated from a living room space by a nice translucent wall that emits soft light from the other area. The bed itself was extremely comfortable with plentiful pillows, soft white linens all around and OMG a FITTED SHEET!!! I marvel at this only because the rates for the suite we booked were comparable rates to those hotels that do sport scratchy mauve floraly nastiness.  The shower was also a surprise.  Very roomy and modern.  Bonus points.  The only down side is that we were by the stairwell and could easily hear all the activity outside our room.  But this seemed pretty minor in comparison to the good points. All in all, given the room, the accompanying breakfast, the rates and the convenient location, I'd definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.Just got back from June trip to St. Louis.Pros - location, free parking, amazingly friendly staff.Cons - Very ODD room and bath.  We had our grandson with us and he wanted to sleep on the couch.  The mattress had no bottom sheet, and the bedding only contained a top sheet and heavy blanket.  Called for a top sheet and got it almost immediately.  Room had HUGE desk and full-size office chair - great for business person but not so much for a family.  Took up way too much floor space.  The 3-drawer dresser had tiny drawers that were only 8 inches deep.  Dresser held very a nice TV that could be turned to face living or bedroom area.   Beds were separated from living room by large translucent panel in the wall.  Let in light if someone wanted to sit up and read.  The lights over the beds were strong enough to perform surgery, and the small area next to the single sink gave no privacy to someone getting ready in the morning.  The bathtub and toilet were in a huge room with only one hook for towels or clothes, and there was no place to set anything down while you bathed, unless you wanted to put it on the floor.  This room also had a translucent door that let light filter into the sleeping area.  The tub had a grab bar installed for safety, but the location was wrong because it was right next the shower head and not in the middle of the tub where it was needed.The tiny closet was placed at the end of the room next to one of the queen beds.  The space between the closet and the bed was about 10 inches.  Awkward when moving luggage into the room.  The bedside table between the two beds was huge - and the alarm clock made an annoying buzzing sound during the night.The walls were incredibly thin and we could also hear the people passing through the parking lot in front of the hotel.  This lot was shared by a Houlihan's, Wood-Fired Pizza, and a condominium.  Very busy.We ate breakfast one day out of our 3 days at the hotel.  It was OK.  Coffee was good.  It would be a great room for one business person, but for our family of 3 it was not a good fit.Arriving at Springhill Suites for a wedding weekend I was excited.  The staff at the front desk was incredibly friendly and helpful.  Entering into my room I witnessed a classic case of American over-abundance.  Two queen sized bed, fold out sofa, big screen HDTV, and my oh my, a walk-in shower larger than bedrooms in apartments past.All that being said, what a let down.  For a bed with seven (yes seven!) pillows on it, not one was remotely comfortable, I woke up every morning with neck pain no matter which one I chose.  As for breakfast, at such a seemingly nice hotel, it was not up to bar.  A stale bagel and a cold sausage &amp; egg patty to put on top--come on Springhill Suites, you can do better.Overall my gut really says to give this place 2 stars, but I feel as if that would be an injustice to the great staff.  Just get some better pillows and breakfast, a good nights sleep and a good breakfast are the key to a good day after all!Clean hotel, quiet rooms and a friendly staff. Great place to stay if you a business in the Brentwood area.Being my first trip to the St. Louis area, this hotel was very easy to locate.  Check-in was simple.  Free parking in the garage was nice.  The hotel is on the new side, so the rooms are well thought out and decorated simply with a modern touch.  Unlike the previous review, I found the bed to be quite comfortable.  The best part about the room was the shower.  A large walk-in shower with glass doors.  Water pressure was amazing.  The only issue I had with the hotel were noisy neighbors.  It sounded as though the upstairs room inhabitants were practicing for a marathon.  They ran back and forth in the room and somehow created large thuds until at least 2am.  I did not call the front desk as I was finally able to fall asleep.   We were also able to hear patrons of the restaurant/bar in front of the hotel walk back and forth to their cars during the night .  Point being, the walls in this hotel are THIN.  But, the amazing shower more than makes up for it.This hotel met my expectations in every way: I recently led a field trip with 8 students and myself, and we stayed for two nights in this hotel. The beds were comfortable, had plenty of pillows, the A/C was divinely cold, the shower had good water pressure, the TV had excellent quality and diverse channels, and the rooms were spacious enough for everyone to not feel cramped. The Chupa Chups downstairs in the lobby were especially nice.  :)Only downsides were that I had to park across the street in the Wal-Mart parking lot...but I doubt this will pertain to anyone else, unless they're driving a bus. I can't really fault them for not having parking options for such an odd situation. Other downside was that the breakfast didn't have bacon (you should have heard the teenage boys on THAT topic), but again, this isn't anything to truly complain about.All in all, if our tournament is in St. Louis next year, I already know where we'll be staying!",,,,"['biggest', 'hassle', 'tracking', 'confirmation', 'booked', 'com', 'amp', 'target', 'rel', 'com', 'recommend', 'cut', 'middle',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-by-hilton-saint-louis-7,Doubletree by Hilton,4.0,$$,29,"I recently spent three nights at this hotel. I am a big fan of the Doubletree and Hilton brands. My expectations for Doubletree properties are high, and this property did not disappoint! From the moment I walked up to the counter to check in until the time I left, everything was exceptional. The staff was vey friendly, the housekeeping was incredible... The food was very good as well. Food quality and service is a hit or miss subject at Hilton properties as far as I am concerned. My only complaint and the reason I cannot give this property five stars - The service at the lobby bar was consistantly slow. For example, on the Tuesday night of my stay, I ordered a dinner to go from the bar. My food was delivered to me in a fair amount of time. The bar area was not crowded, maybe 20-25 people total and there were two other employees helping the bartender deliver drinks and food. I sat at the bar and waited over 30 minutes for the bartender to give me my bill. She walked past me many times. The steel domed plate sitting on the bar in front of me. By the time I got the bill squared and the food up to my room, the food was cold. Other than the slow service at the bar, the hotel is one that I would definitely visit again!Spent 2 nights in this hotel on a recent business trip and it was an alright experience.  The hotel lobby is really nice with very modern decor.  When I checked in, I was somewhat disappointed that I wasn't  welcomed as a diamond member nor offered their signature super delicious warm chocolate chip walnut cookie.  I was so tired from a long day of travel and encountering delays that I didn't notice the cookie situation (or lack thereof) until I got to my room. :-(  At that point I didn't bother going to the lobby to get one.The room was alright, the couch had a questionable stain, which I just covered with  a towel and ignored during my stay.  The bathroom wasn't super clean, but again I didn't feel like asking for another room since I just wanted to sleep.  The comforter was super thin and not very warm, so I had to blast the heat to get a good night's sleep during my stay. The matress was comfortable so that was a plus.On the 2nd night, I went to the restaurant and sat by the bar but after 15 minutes and no service, I left and just ordered a delivery to be sent to my room.  The restaurant was full and the bartender was very overwhelmed and was struggling to keep up with the crowd.The pool and hot tub were great (which is why I gave my review 3 stars instead of 2)! Loved that they were spacious and warm.  My only complaint on that is that in order to get to the pool, upon exiting the elevator you have to walk past the restaurant in your swim wear in plain view of diners. Just seems rather awkward.All in all, I don't think I would stay in this hotel again.  It didn't feel like the usual Hilton experience with warm service, great hospitality and very clean rooms.Exceptional service, big spacious room, fabulous WORKOUT facility and indoor pool - what more can you want!  5 -S T A R S  all around from this globe trotter!This hotel was really good, and this is coming from a guy who stays in a lot of hotels. The classic Doubletree chocolate chip cookie is always a delightful welcome treat. The beds are the absolute best: Serta Perfect Sleepers with a Fairview mattress topper for extra padding. And the pillows are the best, simply the best... This is huge leg up for this hotel over competitors because a good, deep sleep is a primary necessity at a hotel.The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating. They had a good breakfast in the morning: A buffet for about $12 and you could have a tasty omelette made for you for an extra $3. And they have hot sauce!The only qualms with my room and my friend staying in a another room was that the bathroom could have used a little more attention to detail in cleaning. There were some hairs on the floor and the shower. Also, the lining of the toilet and the floor showed some unsightly stains. They need to put a new type of lining there. Inspecting my mattress for the name, because I am going to buy one for myself, I did discover a gross looking stain which I will include in a picture. Overall, you can't really go wrong with a Doubletree. They are up to Hilton standards of guest service and the beds are incredible.Clean rooms and common areas, very comfortable beds, great service, and c'mon, warm cookies of course!Going to hold back just one star for this property due to its age starting to show a little bit. Nothing major, just a little scuffed paint here and there. The staff is absolutely tops like most Hilton properties. Plenty of parking, very easy access, shuttles to the airport. Attractive lobby and bar area. Approved!I was at this hotel to host an event and stayed overnight as well. The service was great. Its not often you experience customer service at this level. From the room to the event everything was great. They did an outstanding job. Highly recommended to everyone.Nice and clean hotel. Beds were not as comfortable as I would have liked, but the staff was friendly and the hotel was pretty nice overall. Free wifi, free cookies, a nice lobby and bar area and plenty of parking. Can't ask for a whole lot more.Will I go back? Yes.  This was an average Double Tree property.  I found the staff to be friendly and the room to be clean.  The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet.  The pool was a bit loud and there was some rough housing going on.  A manager (I'm assuming) came in and told me the pool was closing in 15 minutes and walked away.  It was as if he was expecting me to announce to the rest of the people in the room.  That did not happen and was the only odd thing that happened on the trip.Great service. Example: We ordered a cab but it didn't come for 40 minutes (not the hotel's fault). The front desk employee noticed our long wait and gave us free drink tickets for the hotel bar. Booyah!I love Doubletree.  This was clean and staff very courteous.  I have no complaints.  No Free WiFi, which would have gotten them that last star.  It was a quiet room and I presented there and the conference rooms were well maintained and audio visual was without problems.Ginger in the bar is the best bartender I have ever had serve me drinks or work for me at my former bar. She handled. Full bar of 50 people solo and performed amazingly. Promote her and hire people she can train. The rooms are a little mustyHilton standards always seem to be a little higher than the rest. This hotel has all the standard amenities like fridge, toiletries, lobby bar, business center, ect. However, the staff really seems to be running on all cylinders. They were very helpful, courteous, and efficient. Highly recommended..Spent the weekend here for my bachelorette party and the hotel was ok. They put us in rooms next to each other, which is what we requested and the cookies are good, but the showers had VERY little pressure and the pool is pretty tired. The hot tub was fine until you try to turn on the jets... OMG! it's like it's going to explode. We had to get out of it until the timer went off. Oh and no free breakfast fyi.I was here for a convention of sorts.  We used the conference rooms/banquet rooms.  The staff was all very nice.  The rooms were large and seemed to be maintained very well.  I was not a fan of the food however.  The wings had very little chicken on them.  The wing sauce was passable but not anything to write home about.  The Toasted Ravs kept on coming out cold and tasted frozen (they most likely were).  The fruit all tasted fresh and they had some very large strawberries.  I did not spend the night here so I don't know how the rooms are but the hotel seemed to be very clean and as I said earlier the staff were all very nice.Went to a packed airport on a Friday afternoon and the airline offered me a voucher to fly the next morning. They put me up in this hotel for the night.  The shuttle driver to the hotel was friendly and helpful with his tips about restaurants and things to do around the area. Although, there is nothing in walking distance, there is a shuttle that will take you to the dining options. Shuttle service to the airport is available every half hour. The check-in staff however left much to be desired. Presenting my voucher, I suddenly heard, ""here's another one."" Not sure if the airline voucher was the cause of their confused and somewhat unhelpful attitude but it was disappointing after such a friendly shuttle driver. After asking about a hotel restaurant, they pointed down the hall and when asking about the food voucher given to me by the airline, they actually quipped "" I have no idea."" I wouldn't mind so much, except isn't that your job? 2 Stars for subpar check in staff. The rest of the hotel is nice though, with upscale lobby, bar and the rooms are modern, spacious, and clean. There is free parking and a mini-fridge. Ate at the bar and the bartenders blew the check in staff out of the water. Friendly, fun, helpful and never left me thirsty. They give 2 stars back for a 4 star review. Check out staff in the morning was much nicer and definitely made up for the prior experience.It was a cold, wintry night.  I'm talking it was so cold I nearly tried to work out a deal with the United employees to let me sleep on the plane because I didn't want to even be in the jet bridge of the aircraft.Nonetheless, despite the snow and unrelenting winds, a hotel shuttle picked me up and drove ever so cautiously to our destination.  From the moment I walked in, service was very good.  I was offered warm chocolate chip cookies (which I simultaneously politely declined and bit my tongue at the same time) and told there were two bottle of water waiting for me in the room.  Get to the room and its spacious, clean and comfortable.  Got situated and then went down to the bar/restaurant, Cooperfields.  It was the night of the big game (the one Venu F. went to Pasadena to see) and Cooperfields was packed.  However, the lone server, Ginger G., did such an awesome job of taking care of everyone and handling the orders as best she could.  She did great!  I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and the triple decker club.  That sammich must've been as tall as an encyclopedia.  It was huge and I, not wanting to injure or embarrass myself, had to deconstruct it somewhat just to take a bite of it.  It was very good, though.Breakfast was complimentary for Diamond members and it was a nice spread.  I liked that they had organic foil packs of milk and chocolate milk.  I asked to take an extra chocolate milk to my room as a post jump rope drink and was told to take two if I wanted.  I'd absolutely stay at this hotel again and would hope to have the same people serve me next time as much as the last time; they were really, really professional all the way around.Oh, Doubletree. I wanted to like you, I did. Especially given that I was clearly given some sort of free upgrade at check-in, which was really nice of your people.But... that room upgrade, which was huge - hell, I had a conference table and 3 sofas in my room - wasn't all that. Luckily I was here for a total of 10 hours so I didn't have to deal with this place too terribly long. - The ceiling had really obvious water damage. It was super gross. - One HVAC system was on cold, the other was on warm. I must be a moron, because I saw no buttons (just a blank panel) to adjust the setting and my bed was on the cold side of the room. BRRR. - The TV volume wouldn't go up loud enough for me to actually hear what they were saying. Correction: it went up on the screen, but the actual volume never increased. - The open shower concept was fine, except I spent more time trying not to spray water all over the bathroom floor than I did showering. - Terrible bathroom lighting + no full length mirror = this hotel is clearly geared towards businessMEN and not women. - The bed wasn't that comfy. - The temperature in the fridge was so cold my bottled water turned to ice overnight. Just what I wanted when I woke up freezing thanks to the a/c issue.Free parking. Free WiFi. So, not all is lost.Just okay overall.Pretty standard DT property with downsides:-  A/C wouldn't cool the room past 74 degrees-  Difficult to find off the 270 ramp  -  No restaurants / stores within walking distance-  No Executive Lounge (although they offer free breakfast for Diamonds)That being said, it has a nice bar area with some big screen TVs and the rooms are decent.  The temperature problems were probably the biggest problem, it was only a problem a couple nights but then again it was only hot a couple days I was there.  I ended up staying at the Frontenac after a couple weeks here - nicer location, rooms, and facilities (gym is way bigger), but the rates are higher as well.Nice hotel not so great location.  Good van service to the airport..  Doubletree hotels have always provided good clean rooms in all their hotels I stay in.This place would have gotten 5 stars except that it is not the easiest place to find. Once you are there however, it is a very nice hotel. Great lobby bar, work-out facility, pool and rooms!.","I stayed at this hotel for three nights and enjoyed my time there. It was well kept, and quiet. The rooms were large and up to date. The staff was helpful and the roomservice was quite tasty yet far from cheap. The biggest perk however, were their delicious chocolate chip cookies. I'd stay here again.This place is alright. Nice lobby bar with plenty of TVs to catch whatever game you're interested in. Friendly staff. Good and free breakfast if you've got HHonors status. Same goes with the wifi. They have an omelet bar! It's right next to the freeway but it's deceivingly actually a good few minutes off driving. Yet again at a Hilton property, no upgrades available for me...lame. Nothing to do within walking distance that I saw so make sure you've got a car or be prepared to taxi it.The hotel itself is very convenient to west St. Louis and the airport.  Parking was ample.  The hotel bar was very nice although a little too loud to try and work in. My room rate was very reasonable and the heat worked well.Room service was good and relatively prompt.  The only two issues I had were the fact the maid seemed to clean every other day (I was there for a week) and the high cost of wireless internet access.  Never replaced the water glasses and emptied the trash once.  She did make the bed every day and that was the extent of it. I did not confirm that this wasn't some sort of green initiative on their part, but it made coming back after a long day of training almost a chore.I probably should have said something after the third day, but I didn't want to complain.Typical Doubletree hotel; but the location is horrible if one doesn't have a car and wants to visit the sites and attractions of St. Louis.  There wasn't even a Starbucks or a convenience store anywhere within walking distance of the hotel.  Too isolated..  Going to see the Arch required waiting to take the hotel shuttle to the airport, then catching the light rail and taking it downtown...about an hour-long journey.Hotel itself was just ok but every single person I dealt with was incredibly nice and helpful. Front desk, room service, breakfast staff, everyone was great. Bed very comfy. No central air, the rooms have individual units so that's not great. I was near elevator but very quiet.I found a room in this hotel for $86 on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkayak.com&amp;s=98da2cde76c138de7757db93d60105febfaf42f08ccacc62bf5b11fb0e987f05"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">kayak.com</a> and was very happy with it. For the price and 3 star status, it's an exceptionally nice hotel. The location wasn't very good for our purposes, though. We had to drive 15-30 minutes to get anywhere we wanted to go. Still, I would consider staying there again, if the price were right.Very nice hotel. Very clean, great staff, very helpful. I got a room for $54 a night so it was a steal. Housekeeping was not the best, they forgot to leave a plastic liner for the ice bucket but thats nothing major. Its a really quiet place to unwind. I highly recommend it and will be booking again.real nice place. i live in hotels, at least 15 nites out of the month. service here was AWESOME, the bartender was real nice as well. this is a popular spot for a lot of airline emp's, and customers/employees for the many businesses aroundthey run a 24 hour shuttle to the airport, and since they're owned by the same group that owns the Sheraton at Westpoint, run that shuttle 24hrs too!got the room at corporate rate, so price was super good.they also gave me a breakfast coupon (but i lost it).room was comfy, kinda trendy/modern/boutiqey decor...the only mismatch in the room was the 1992 TV...LCD on the wall would have made it even better.definitely be staying here the next time im in town...What's that you say?  Warm cookies upon arrival?  Oh yes, it's true.  And while that fact alone is enough to keep me coming back, there is also an indoor pool, spa, and a small fitness center. (Perfect for working off the multitude of hot dogs and beer inevitably consumed at a Cardinals' game!)     Another handy fact: the rooms are almost assuredly sound proof.  I know this after hosting a fairly loud private dance party (invitees: myself), then hosting an entire band/party later that night until sometime after 4:30 in the morning.  I'm talking guitars and self-written tunes belted through the commotion usually associated with a hotel party.  For fear of tainting my pristine reputation, all I'll say is that very acrobatic extracurricluar activites also went uninterrupted at all hours.     The night shift staff was very cool about the assortment of characters I brought through; they have to be the most good natured tired people I've ever met.  In fact, the entire staff was really helpful from cabs to late-night delivery, to dealing with 4 AM drunken ramblings......I think I love it here.  You should go.  No, really.  Get into your car, drive to the airport and get on a St. Louie-bound flight RIGHT THIS INSTANT!!",,,,"['recently', 'spent', 'three', 'nights', 'hotel', 'big', 'fan', 'brands', 'expectations',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-st-louis-forest-pk-hampton-ave-st-louis-2,Holiday Inn St Louis-Forest Pk/Hampton Ave,3.0,$$,28,"This is a decently priced hotel if booked on Expedia. It isn't necessarily close to anything but it is very close to the interstate and easy to call a taxi. Edit: it is close to things. I realize I don't know the area well enough to make that kind of call and that we did book it to be close to the zoo, which I forgot because we didn't end up going. It was about a $15 taxi ride to the arch. The room didn't seem to be as clean beforehand - there were Cheetos on the floor by the bed and in the bathroom. There was a note left in our lock asking if we needed anything, which was nice.  We didn't know they had a pool and it isn't very well advertised. The air conditioner is super loud! No mini fridge. The bed is really hard (if you like soft beds). The TV is slow and there doesn't seem to be a guide channel. Overall we wanted a simple, cheaper place to stay and that's what we got so don't regret staying here.I like the IHG family of brands, and have spent a lot of time in HIE, HI and Crowne Plazas. I didn't know much about this property except from the reviews.This isn't the worst place I've stayed -- not by a mile -- but it needs major work.Let's start with the good stuff: Good location (right on the freeway), good pricing (I think I know why, though), friendly staff. Relatively speedy wifi for free.The cons:* The room's door didn't seem to ever shut correctly. It did, but I had to make an effort to close it and pull it closed. From inside the room, there was a gap where I could push the door back and forth, which meant that there was a gap in the seal. Translation: I could hear everything in the hall, and they could hear me. Bigger con: Someone (another guest) actually walked into my room one day. It was probably my fault for not pulling the door shut hard enough.* Related: The room had a balcony with a sliding glass door... which had one of those metal security bars across it. Kinda shabby to start with. But seeing how the frame of the glass door was actually cracking the pain and pulling away... not cool. Hearing the wind rattle the glass door: Not cool.* Further related: I could hear everything from the guy and his ""escort""/special friend from the room next door. I mean EVERYTHING.* The hotel was obviously built WAY before the advent of electronic devices. The hotel has tried some neat tricks to accommodate these; they had a device on the nightstand that functioned like a power strip, with four outlets and two USB charging slots. Way cool. Not so cool: That device itself was attached to a power strip behind the bed, against the wall, on top of the box spring. On the power strip was the device, the lamp, the alarm clock and another lamp. I'm not saying it was a fire hazard... but I'm saying I would never do this at home because it's a little scary.I do appreciate that they have taken an older property and tried to modernize it. However, I won't be back here just because there's a general feeling of neglect. Some TLC could turn this into a much nicer property... but as it stands, I'm moving on.Note: This review is about the meeting rooms - no overnight stay was done by me. My work was having a special training class and the size of attendees exceeded the capacity of our in house conference room. We shopped around for a meeting room and since when we have employees from out-of-town visiting STL, we use this Holiday Inn, they gave us a good deal. The table and chairs they provided were comfortable and accommodating to our needs. Most importantly, was the sound. With all the meeting rooms in the hallway being in use, there was no distractions of hearing what was going on in the other rooms. My co-workers who came in from other cities and had to stay over-night in the rooms - I heard no complainants. If you work in the area and need a small to larger meeting room for your business or organization, this HI can fill your needs.As I was scheduled for major surgery at Barnes Jewish Hospital, we needed a place to stay for about a week. Since I didn't want to drop a ton of money on a hotel for what was decidedly not a pleasure trip, we went to Priceline and plugged in $70 and came out with this hotel. I wish we would have splurged for more, as it was certainly an unpleasant trip. First, the good: Free parking and wifi, which definitely saved us some money. Also, the location is pretty convenient to the 44, which made getting around Saint Louis quite easy. Finally, the shower had awesome water pressure. There, I'm out of good.Our first issue was with housekeeping. After our first night there, we left the room at a bright and early 830 AM. When we returned at 5PM, the room still hadn't been cleaned! I called down and they said it was because when they came by to clean the sign was up! Was 830 some sort of cutoff? After I insisted that somebody come and clean the room they obliged and we had to sit in the lobby for half an hour while somebody came and fixed the room. It was all quite awkward, but they were friendly enough and I was ready to just get on with our stay. Then this happened.My father and stepmother were in a different room and were very unhappy with the hotel and I couldn't figure out why, but they were unhappy enough to cut their trip short. Finally we learned they were switching rooms and I got it out of them: their original room was COVERED in mold. I went to see for myself and the entire A/C unit and the wall panel above it was flecked with mold. Lots of mold. This is a serious health concern! The room was rank and uninhabitable, only my poor parents HAD inhabited it for days. This will not stand. I ask my parents what the hotel has done to accommodate and they confessed that beyond the room switch, they had simply been offered a complimentary breakfast the next morning.I hightailed it to the front desk with the family in tow. A bit more aggressive than my parents, I wanted to make sure the manager understood that housing people in a petri dish is unacceptable.I laid out to the gentleman how I saw the situation, that breakfast wasn't fair compensation for keeping people in an unhealthy environment and suggested they comp the entire stay. To his credit, he didn't argue and did it right away. That right there is the sole reason for a 2nd star. Unfortunately for me, this place isn't the worst hotel into which I've ever stepped foot. But because of their cleanliness issues, I cannot in good conscious recommend to anybody a stay at the Holiday Inn Forest Park.I filmed a TV pilot in St. Louis in June of 2013. My crew and I got a great deal on a group deal at this hotel. The Pros:Spacious rooms and comfortable beds.Wonderful staff - They were efficient and kind with every request. They threw in one of their conference rooms with our deal and it became our production office. Location - Not far from downtown and in a quiet area.Cons:Air conditioning unit was so so. It either worked and was loud or did not work and we roasted.The layout is kind of cumbersome. It is a long walk from the entrance to the main elevators. The decor is straight out of the 70's and sometimes the hotel has a musty smell.Overall, it was a comfortable place to rest my tired bones for a week. The staff is really the main selling point. Because I travel for work,  I find myself really relying on hotel staff much more then I do when I'm traveling for leisure.I stayed 5 days. The location was very convenient but the property itself is lacking. My room was musty smelling with a small 70s concrete block balcony with view of the parking lot. I spent a lot of time in my room working and one day I waived off Housekeeping when they knocked on my door. The next day I personally asked Housekeeping to vacuum my room as there was debris along one wall. I don't think she knew what ""debris"" meant as I had to show her where I thought I spied a chunk of cat poo/kitty litter along the wall. When I returned afterward, the chunky bit remained as well as other bits that told me there was no vacuuming done... My white socks were yucky after a day working in my room. The Housekeeper the next day took care of my concerns. Really, is that too much to ask? Ugh, sticky carpeting... It was cheap though, less than $90 a night. But I think I'll go back to Home Suites.Stayed here for 5 days, staff was very friendly and housekeeping was very accomdating to us with extra towels and a lot of extra coffee. Really love that the bath products are bath and body works. Bed is comfortable,relatively clean, if you walk around without shoes beware of your feet turning black. Wish there were more outlets. Delicious FREE cookies made daily at the front desk. Elevator is slow and the carpeting throughout are dated with stains but a lot of seating one the first floor. Gym has 4 cardio machines and weights rack. Pool is nice and fast food in walking distanceIt is a Holiday Inn so I didn't expect the Taj Mahal. Great value. It felt like a boutique hotel. The front end staff were professional and baked chocolate chip cookies for all the guests. They called me in my room to see if I needed anything. Great place to stay.It was a good stay if you're traveling for business.  Not sure if is take my family.The staff were nice and explained the hotels amenities.  The a/c worked great.All in all a good place to stay on a business trip.We stayed for an overnight and while the hotel was clean and had just been updated, we were supposed to have a queen bed and we didn't.  Also there was a dirty towel on the back of the bathroom door and the bottom sheet was inside out which made me a little worried. We were put on the side of the hotel facing the interstate which didn't make much sense seeing as how there were only a few rooms that were booked. Even after we came back after dinner there was only 12 cars in the parking lot. The a/c was SO LOUD that every time it would turn on I'd wake up although it did drown out the interstate noise.Front desk was very personable and welcoming, did all he could to welcome us in and be accommodating. The place is decked out for the holidays and looks pretty nice. Has a security guard at night to watch the vehicles, not sure of the neighborhood, but front desk said there should not be any problems.Room was decent, lower end fixtures and carpet but it was in good shape. Only real complaint was the hair. There was what appeared to be dog hair all over the bed spread and sheets of both beds. They do allow pets for a $25 charge, but apparently they don't use the extra $25 to clean up the bedding.The hotel smells like wet dog and old cigarettes. My ""fresh towels"" had blood spatter on them that wasn't mine. Bed frame was broken.  Key card reader never works on the first go. Highway noise in the room. Stay somewhere else...We asked for a double when we reserved the room. When we checked in we were told they did not have any doubles available and the hotel was sold out. We had to settle for a single. They did offer a roll-a-way but that's not the same. The elevators are old, small and slow. The room itself was decent and clean with a comfortable bed. The staff was friendly as well so that helped.Convenient location, nice staff but I think the common areas need to be upgraded. It's a good hotel for the price I got from Priceline.Great room - great service - didn't use the amenities because it was such a short stay.The staff and location were both great. Other than that : mediocre. Nothing special. I've stayed at holiday inns before and was expecting the fountains and the indoor pools and hottubs and spas... This place had a ""gym"" and an outdoor pool which didn't help me in November. The room was standard, clean. The heat is motion activated so I kept waking up freezing. And there was random little things that were frustrating: I had to swipe my card three times every time for door to open, the side door didn't close you had to pull it with all your might to shut it, the elevator door closed almost beside you were in it. My wifi stopped working and I had to call their customer service department which is a teenager that answers phones with great ideas like ""have you tried turning it off and on again?"" But the worst part , the walls were paper thin. And there was a crying baby next door. And they were replacing Carpet above me until like 10 pm. I could even hear this person drop soap in the shower and the baby sneeze. I can never usually hear anything from other rooms. Doors opening and slamming shut all night. If you book through Priceline idk how much it is maybe it would be an okay deal if you don't want to sleep but going straight through hotel, WAY over priced.Stayed in this hole multiple times on visits to St. Louis. Excellent front desk service, nice and clean rooms, and overall a quiet neighborhood. Quick access to highway makes it easy to get where I wanted to go around town. Would gladly recommend this hotel to friends and family that I know need a place to stay while in town.I stayed here again and they have been amazing. It was really clean, comfortable beds, and the staff has been great. We booked through a third party for a discounted rate. We needed to extend our stay because of being snowed in and they booked us an extra night and matched the discounted rate. On top of that, they upgraded us to a room with 2 queens instead of 1 (which came standard with our third party booking). The hotel has a lounge and a restaurant, so being snowed in was not terrible. Awesome place. I HIGHLY recommend it.Good stay for the road warrior. Nice staff and convenient for where I needed to be.Booked here because of cheap cost. Won't book again due to 3 main issues. 1. First arrived and TV did not work for a day. 2. They try to save money by having air conditioning that shuts itself off after a time period. 3. Needs upgrades (ex. elevator claustrophobic, slow, and makes odd noises). Tolerable for a overnight stay but not as much for an extended business trip.","If I had paid full price I might feel ripped of, but seeing as I got a deal from Hotwire I'm fine with staying here. Over all I'm not impressed, this place could really use updating.The room itself was clean and everything worked, but a good example of the lack of updating would be the old-school, non-HD TV.Government rate allowed a $10 kickback for breakfast at on-site restaurant per day, but there were two of us; no continental breakfast even.  Bathroom was sadly out-dated and with no exhaust fan, although beds were comfortable.  Expected better for the price we paid.After party at the Holiday Inn. Despite the brand image, this place was actually pretty decent. Big room and clean.* Location poor - not in Clayton or near Forest Park as I expected* Elevator doors made scary rubber band sound when opening/shutting.  Management posted permanent sign to indicate safety inspection was on file.* Toilet not fully attached to the wall* Toilet seat not fully attached to the toilet* Shower had two temps:  scalding or freezing* Room had two temps:  sweaty or freezingWhat broke the camel's back?  Coming home after ten pm to an unmade bed, upon which I had left ONE JACKET, written on 'Stay Thoughtful' notepaper which read:""Personal Belongings on bed!!!  Couldn't make Bed""I tried to post a photo of the note on the Holiday Inn Facebook page and they wouldn't let me post the photo, so I came here.This was the last stop on a long family road trip.   We did the DSM-KC-STL triangle before heading back to the Chicago area.    It's a Holiday Inn.   It appeared to be updated recently with new linens, wallpaper, but the smell of smoke lingered in some areas of the hotel.  The exterior is an old stucco which was not very appealing and it's not exactly cheap.  What it is - a place to sleep with free wifi close to the Zoo.  The staff is generally friendly and willing to help out with recommendations.WOW!  A 5 star review for a hotel like the Holiday Inn?!  Yes, it's quite accurate!  And picky Yelper Richie is here to explain why:-They manager upgraded me to a double occupancy room for free at check-in.-Since I was staying 12 days (on a business trip), they brought in a microwave and refrigerator.-The staff was always really friendly and willing to serve you to their best abilities.-Even though the hotel is a bit older, it is kept up and clean (I found not even one hair on the bathroom floor at the entrance glance!  Hard to find!)-Gifts would always be left for me when I arrived back at the hotel after a long day of training.  Popcorn, snacks, a Happy Mardi Gras basket with a bunch of goodies and bead necklaces...-They give you a menu of pillows to choose from (in addition to the 4 mini pillows already on your bed).  I personally loved the Firm Pillow &amp; U-Neck Pillow.-FREE WI-FI!!!!!! (Hence how I'm writing this review).-Automated wake-up call system that wakes you up 3 minutes before when you set it.-The room service is prompt.  I would order my to-go breakfast in the morning and it would be waiting for me at 7:45, along with the check to run out.-I left my phone charger in my room and they had it there are the desk.  They seem to learn who their clients are which makes it more personalized.-One of the managers told me that they're trying to become ""green"".  We'll see what happens but they'll have to get rid of smoking to begin.-The best for last...It was my 1.5 year anniversary with my boyfriend who secretly sent me an Edible Arrangement of chocolate-dipped strawberries.  They left a voicemail in my room and then called again later to let me know that something was in the lobby for me.  The desk worker handed over the gift, wished me a Happy Anniversary and winked.  Gay friendly staff plus.I was a bit concerned making the reservation at first due to:-Only an outdoor pool-Location far from MetroLink and only close to The Hill Italian neighborhood-There are smoking rooms still.  BE SURE to request the 3rd floor if you're allergic to smoke or are just not a smoker because the other floors are either every other room or the far end of the hall is smoking.-Simply it's a Holiday InnEverything worked out after all and it was a pleasant stay!Disappointing.  Understaffed front desk, small rooms, no hot water for several hours, sink nearly clogged/slow drain, bathtub faucet wouldn't shut off, heater would cycle on for brief periods, and light rain in the morning killed the TV's satellite signal.  It's definitely below the standard for what I expect in a Holiday Inn.A 5 star review? I must be crazy right? Well, maybe but certainly not for giving this particular hotel 5 stars. I stayed at this location for one evening and while the building is older and not at all flashy the staff is really what made the stay a 5 star stay. I really have never dealt with such a friendly front desk staff both at check in and check out and to top it off I received a really delicious chocolate chunk cookie. Chocolate, friendly staff and super quiet/private room....just what I love and just what I needed.",,,,"['decently', 'priced', 'hotel', 'booked', 'necessarily', 'close', 'anything', 'close',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/magnolia-hotel-st-louis-saint-louis,Magnolia Hotel - St Louis,4.0,$$,36,"I did not know what to expect from the Hotel Magnolia as St Louis was a new destination, and we were traveling with our pooch.   Located in the heart of downtown, a stone's throw from the convention center, the Magnolia offers boutique, customized service in this bustling area.  From the moment we pulled up until our departure, service was accommodating, warm and helpful.  Bobby, at the front desk, is a master of customer service.Our suite on the 12th floor was huge with comfortable and attractive furnishings.  However, the bathroom layout is a bit weird and takes some adjustment. The sink is in the same space as the closet, which is in a seperate space from the toilet and tub/shower room.  Odd at best and a victim to the refurbishment of an older building. The Magnolia's bar, restaurant, and common areas are very cool and work well within a boutique concept.For the price, location, room size, and gracious service, I cannot imagine any better choice for lodging in the city of St. Louis, Missouri.DO NOT STAY HERE. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND RACIALLY PROFILES GUEST...The hotel is nice in the inside. However the people in the inside are terrible. I came to this hotel a week prior to checking in and informed the staff I was having an engagement party and I wanted to view the room. I bought the gateway corner suite because it seem secluded. They never once said I couldn't have a party. Never once said I had a particular time that I couldn't have the party. I checked in and the room was filthy. The manager didn't take my word for it had to come to my room to approve if I needed a new room. Was granted a new room said he'd give me a credit but didnt. Then once the gathering started the men were just watching the basketball game and the ladies were just talking. Around 10pm I got a knock on the door the manager was mean and on edge and told us we needed to get out. He never gave us a warning. I spent over $300 for this gathering and would have gladly had it somewhere else if I knew I'd be treated so poorly. I wish I'd gotten some type of warning. I wish someone would have told me a party was not recommended there. The manager then called the police on my room! Which was totally unnecessary because we coroporated with him. We had to leave the hotel to go to a bar which I could have did that without spending close to $200 on a room! I called corporate and apparently this is a small company and they knew the manager... was not sympathetic to the fact that I was treated so poorly. No one warned me a party was not something that I could have after I informed them multiple times... I feel like they just took my money and stuck their middle fingers up to me. They didn't try to offer me a new room, a refund, or partial refund. They do not value their customers. They don't try to accommodate anyone that spends their money. They didn't try to help my situation. They didn't care that now I have to sit and plan another engagment party because they were thirsty for a sale. This whole situation could have been avoided! Again do not have any gatherings, parties here. Don't stay here period because there are a ton of hotels that would treat you 10 times better and appreciate you spending your money and time there. I couldn't go into great detail but I am telling you I wouldn't be writing this long review if I didn't get treated the worse I've ever have been at an hotel. Save your money go somewhere where they will treat you nicely.This is a review for the hotel bar, because I'll review the hotel itself separately.This bar is great.  Janice is a terrific bartender, she's absolutely great.  Really easy to talk to and pleasant.  Mixed up a great drink for me when I wanted a variation of a cosmo-type drink with grapefruit, and she hit it spot on, it was a great drink!  And she is really attentive to when you need another drink.The bar itself is really cool, it has a nice fluorescent bartop with changing colors.    Very pleasant atmosphere to have a drink in this nice hotel bar.  They have a TV if you do want a little distraction, but the sound isn't on if you don't want to be bombarded by it, I like that.Plenty of good selection of drinks and wines, great ambiance, and great service. But it doesn't stop there.  The food at the hotel restaurant is very good too, apparently, because we ordered the macaroni and cheese, and it was absolutely fabulous -- I mean just outstanding - not in an I've been drinking and I'm hungry way, but in a legit foodie way.  First of all, the macaroni was actually macaroni, not penne or fusill, good old fashioned elbow macaroni.  Secondly, the cheese sauce, which was gouda-based, was the absolute perfect consistency - smooth, creamy, not chalky, not chunky.  And it had delicious pieces of bacon in it, which added flavor, but without overwhelming the dish.  I mean, this mac and cheese blows away all the others I've ever tasted.Anyway, this bar is great, lots of fun, great drinks, great food, great service.  Come see for yourself!From the moment we walked in we knew we made a good choice on the hotel. The valet gentlemen were very welcoming every time we went in and out for our car. The front desk staff as well were very accommodating and always greeted us. ROOMS: The rooms are large in size and the suites with the extra room really did make a huge difference with a bigger group of people. 4 girls getting ready appreciated the extra room and the fact that the sink was separate from the toilet/shower. The only thing was that I wished there was in the room was a fridge. BREAKFAST: Such a great variety of food. I also like the a la cart option so that you can have fresh eggs and other hot items. DINNER: We also had dinner in the hotel and the ONLY aspect of our entire stay that I can complain about is that the tables are cute for happy hour but WAYYY to small for dinner. We had a party of 7 and it was really tight and a little uncomfortable trying to eat on them. Other than that the food, drink, waiter was fabulous.I would definitely recommend this hotel the location is a perfect walk to restaurants, the ball field and many tourist attractions.Four stars because I can't rate the hotel as a paying guest just yet.  I went in to try the restaurant (Robie's) and couldn't help but take-in this beautiful hotel's decor.This building has undergone a major face-lift and it looks absolutely amazing; what a well done renovation!  The contractors were able to keep a lot of the original features.  My observations:Stained glass windowsBeautiful furniture throughoutSpaciousGorgeous Chandeliers Well litLots of private seating areas Restaurant Friendly staff Clean restroomsTrip Advisor Award AAA 4 Diamond Award Starbucks next door Bissinger's Chocolate at the front desk!!!!! What more do you want???My next staycation will be booked right here.Who cares how good the hotel is when they bump prepaid reservations due to ""a situation.""Oh, Magnolia... you seemed so nice... We stayed here on Labor Day weekend and overall had a lovely time. The employees were all friendly and helpful. You can tell they've been well trained and are striving to be a proper 4*. Where Magnolia suffers is that it even though it looks completely renovated, they only put lipstick on the pig. The walls are so incredibly thin you'll here everything your neighbor does... and, I mean, EVERYTHING! I spent most of the night laying awake wondering if they'd ever go to sleep.Loooooove this hotel!!! Im here once to twice a month. You can not beat the price for what you get. Rooms are amazing!!! Dog friendly!!! Its very gorgeous! Staff is amazing besides one brat of a manager. She was only rude one. Rest of staff is great! Food is amazing! They serve free warm cookies and milk every night. I cant help but have one, or five. Ha The gym here is one of the best. Very new and clean, with enough to get all my workouts done. I tell everyone about this hotel. Great location! Their shuttle is a Tesla car... I mean awesome!!!! This hotel is very unique and different than any I've ever stayed in and I have stayed in several hotels. This one is a must!!!I have had family and friends stay here on multiple occasions as I live next door.  The rooms are cute, though the standard rooms are very small and most don't have good views.  However, the beds and linens are comfortable.  The Suites are much more spacious and seem to have more light.  The building itself is beautiful and the renovations they have done so far really maintain the charm of the former Mayfair.The restaurant has a wonderful staff, particularly Rob who I often join at the bar for lunch.  There's another woman who works with him who is also lovely.  Additionally, Cyrus and the younger hispanic gentleman that works with him are friendly and attentive.  Really, Robie's has an all around great staff!The breakfast is a limited cold continental breakfast, but enough to get you through to lunch.  Milk and cookies in the evening are a nice touch, especially if you have kids.Check in is easy, although I've run into a few discrepancies about overcharges that took months to clear up.  The manager nor the corporate contacts never returned my emails.  Finally, I had to go in person months later to get everything cleared up.  Luckily, a former employee of theirs, Iman, took care of it like he did with everything.  I miss having him around! The new front desk staff is pleasant.Valet is for the most part friendly and efficient.  They put up with my dirty car so I can't complain!  They have complimentary car service in their company Tesla within a couple miles of the hotel, which is a nice touch.One thing I'd like to see, as well as all my neighbors at the Tower, is discounts for the residents.  It would bring me, as well as many other people in a lot more, which would only increase sales!  We have our family and friends stay with the Magnolia, giving priority to them as the go to hotel, and certainly would be more inclined to frequent the bar and restaurant more often if there was a discount.  Come on management, you know we've been asking for this for a while...please!?!?Found the Magnolia hotel on the Expedia app! They were 25% off for the night and they were close to the wedding reception we had to go to, so let do it!  101 bucks after taxes and extras!  Not bad!  Downtown! Let's do it! Now this is not a review of the Expedia app but if it was I would say 1 star because they had not sent the info for our room yet!  They sent me a confirmation but not the hotel!  Lucky for us, the front desk man got it figured out and we were in!  I appreciated it! The rooms are cool, very sleek and modern, nice couches, comfy beds, great tv, nice bathrooms!  These rooms have been re-designed and awesome!  There is a free hot breakfast! Free drink happy hour, and free cookies and milk from 8 to 10! The lobby is pretty small, but the restaurant bar was great! And the staff was top notch! No parking lot here, but they do have valet parking for 25 bucks, not bad for downtown St. Lou in a safe spot and you can just send them a text and they have your car ready in 10 minutes!   Good stuff here! I would stay here again for this price!Easy 4 star experience.  Was tempted to rate 3...due to terrible valet service.  If you can avoid using valet...you should.  It was so bad in fact...it almost overtook the great experience of everything else.  Management:  please work on this aspect of things.Bar was fantastic, spacious and well-appointed.  Recommend suite instead of standard...gets you a better master bedroom and bathroom set up is improved.Great location within walking distance of anything you need:  Cardinals, Rams, restaurants, Arch, etc.It's a lovely looking place and right in the heart of the city, but looks and location can only go so far. The service was friendly but woefully slow, and the continental breakfast was lacking variety and protein. Not somewhere I'd go again.Wow. Thank you so much for ruining my wedding weekend and putting me in tears the day before. I booked the best room Magnolia has 5 months in advance so that I could take pictures with my mom/grandma (who came in from Croatia ... No big deal) and bridesmaids while getting ready. Our wedding starts at 5PM on Saturday so I decided to book it for Saturday night with check in at 3. I decided to change my reservation to Friday night with late check out and was told by Brian that it was just a $15 dollar fee for late check out. Confirmed my change with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> to Friday night. Called Magnolia to be charged that $15 and the new person told me I wasn't allowed to have a late check out. Seriously? Spoke to Jason who is the manager there and he absolutely had no intention of making their mistake work in my favor. He kept calling it ""miscommunication"" and refused to help me out. Now I'm stuck in another hotel because all of the other suites are sold out. Awesome way to start my wedding weekendAmazing hotel!  Loved all the chandeliers! Loved everything about the stay except when iI left there was a $28 fee for valet parking.  Which you really have no choice but to do that.  Kind of got upset because when I checked in noone told me that was the fee.  Other than that hotel was amazing.  I will be back but just not to valet.Best boutique hotel ever. Check in was fantastic- valet? Yes - free happy hour? Oh yes - cookies and milk before bed? Heavenly! Free car service? Did they say TESLA??? Bad azz. The room is huge. The decor and renovation is stunning. The bed feels like I died and went to the A-list part of heaven. The service is incredible. The ladies at check in are awesome, bartender Amy is fantastic and driver Kevin is the iron man of drivers. This is just day 1. I can't imagine the epic day two. This place is not haunted at all. I just woke and haven't even tried their free breakfast or fancy coffee.   I woke up in afterglow.Day 2: the breakfast is great and the staff is nice. I ordered a scrambled eggs breakfast and it was perfect. The hotel was even better on day 2.  We never had to use a taxi because the super incredible staff reserved the tesla for us and we could plan our day. The driver, Kevin, was on time and very nice. I don't want to leave. I'm so happy here I wish I could stay forever.   Laying in bed while I write this review, it's so comfortable.OMG! I LOVED this HOTEL!!! I recently relocated to Scottsdale AZ from IL and decided to 'Roadtrip It'. St. Louis was my first stop along the way and I booked my room on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>. Got a super deal, under $100, and it was worth EVERY penny!GREAT location, close to the Arch, and from the moment you walk in it SCREAMS 'Elegance'!! Very friendly desk staff told me that I had '3 minutes' until Happy Hour ended which was a 'free' glass of wine, so I high-tailed it to the spectacular bar where I met some fabulous and friendly people (shout out to Dayna and Bartender Stephanie!:-)). Stayed for more than 1 glass and, by then, it was time for Cookies &amp; Milk! Yum!!When I went to my room, I was astonished! It was a SUITE including a full living room and walk-thru bathroom with a separate Vanity counter and private shower/toilet. The bed was a King and SO comfortable I slept like a BABY!The next morning I went to the Fitness Room for my daily workout and found it well-maintained and functional with enough equipment to get in a good workout before I hit the road to Oklahoma City (I'm a Personal Trainer and a good workout is how I start EVERY day:-))Breakfast was included and FABULOUS! A wonderful variety to choose from and Modi, the waitress, was a HOOT! If I had 1 'negative' thing to say, it would be that the Valet service was outrageously priced ($28/night) for guests. My recommendation, park at the Renaissance garage on 9th St. It's covered and costs only $16 and is a quick 1-block walk to the Magnolia:-)If I ever find myself in St. Louis, there is only 1 place I will stay..The Magnolia!I am arriving tomorrow and have started out with a terrible experience so far.I emailed to request a crib (or pack n play) and a mini fridge. I'm breastfeeding and have to pump and bottle feed. I received an email back stating the location only has a couple so to give them a call. The gentleman I spoke with on the phone this afternoon was terribly rude. He said there was no way to reserve a crib and I probably wouldn't get one. He did explain they can store my milk in a staff fridge, however, a. That makes me really uncomfortable bc I don't know who is in and out of it and b. That doesn't help at 2 am when she wakes up and is screaming for milk. I asked if he had a cooler I could use with ice and he said no. I told him I have no clue what to do since I won't be able to feed my daughter efficiently and it will wake up other guests bc she will be screaming for several minutes while we wait for staff to bring milk and since she won't have a place to sleep I don't know what to do. His response was to not travel with children. I asked to speak to the manager and he said Jason would be there shortly (this was at 11:10) and that ""I can talk to him all I want, but no one will be willing to help me"". Jason never called back. I called back a second time and still never received a call back.I wasn't rude to this gentleman, I didn't say anything short or mean, yet he was so unkind and awful. I'm now dreading what is supposed to be a family Christmas and birthday celebration bc I won't be able to feed my child and neither one of us will sleep.Seems kind of nice, haven't even gotten to my room before having regret for staying here, the parking situation here is terrible, no in/out parking anywhere...moving cross country and not fond of leaving al my belongings in my car on the street in STL or in the hands of a valetHousekeeping stole my laptop!Do not stay here! Customer service is non existent. its a shame...made me hate St. Louis.Lessons learned..smh. Matt the manager is a dick and didnt even care i lost personal property. He rude and should be demoted. He doesnt smile and is not friendly. The rest of the staff is alright..Please do not stay here. This place sucks!This place was amazing. The staff were so helpful and nice. The rooms were up to date modern looks. The pictures are exactly the way it looks. They gave us a fruit and cheese tray in our room when we arrived, it was quite big. We also received two complimentary drinks upon arrival. The front desk staff was very helpful in helping us find some good late night food and giving directions. Our room ended up being close to construction and when we told the front desk, the immediately moved us and gave us an upgraded room for the inconvenience. The next day we forgot to set a wake up call or alarm and we called down and they said it was okay and to take our time leaving. They were very accommodating and helpful. I will defiantly be staying here in the future.","Nice boutique hotel. Great price for the location. Within walking distance to Busch stadium. Elevators were tiny and can only fit approximately 4 people, but there are three. Newly painted rooms with modern decor. 1 complaint is that our shower obviously wasn't cleaned from the last persons stay as there were multiple long black hairs stuck on the inside of the shower wall (gross)! Free wifi... Cocktail hour... Cookies, milk, and coffee hour...Continental breakfast. One recommendation is there was not a mini fridge provided, so if you have beverages or snacks make sure to bring your own cooler.Beautiful. And ... Above and beyond service here. I left my cell phone at a restaurant down the street (yes I'm embarrassed) but they went to get it and bring to me. THAT'S Service!!!!!!I really like this boutique hotel in downtown St. Louis. They have a beautiful modern lobby and bar, while keeping the old stained glass. A very nice mix of the new and old that really represents St. Louis today. It's in a great location, too, for downtown sightseeing. I'm impressed with their very large posh rooms, which is not commonly found in old hotel remodels. Everyone has been very friendly and helpful here, and I love the late-nite cookies and milk in the bar. I'm super impressed! And highly recommend!! Found absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel.Beautiful Hotel and so comfy and accommodating . Everyone is super friendly . There was a small hiccup in my reservation and they took care of me right away ! I would definitely stay here again on my next tripBest experience at a hotel ever! Not only was the place gorgeous and full of historical charm, the staff were absolutely amazing. So kind and friendly. Our suit was beautiful and clean, the food we had was delicious. Not a single complaint. Will stay here in the future and highly recommend for anyone wanting to have a stress free weekend! :)We were not familiar with Magnolia, but found it on a groupon &amp; decided to check it out.  We really, really enjoyed it &amp; are glad we got to stay here before everyone else discovers it too!  The decor is beautiful, the rooms are clean, the drinks are good, and the staff is extremely friendly, not to mention is right near a lot of activity downtown.  I have no doubt Magnolia's popularity is going to catch on fast &amp; soon enough it will be hard to get a room, but as of now we were very pleased with our experience &amp; very happy with the price we got.  Thanks Magnolia!My friend and I, along with our husbands stayed at this hotel for a baseball game. We were hooked by the idea of free cookies and milk. While the facility is beautiful, that is about all it has going for it. When we arrived late at night, there were three bell hops standing outside the door. We unloaded the car and carried our bags in on our own. I am not above carrying my own bags but I was under the impression they would help us as  that is in fact their job. When we were checking in, we were met with confusion when we were told our reservation was lost. After driving 6 hours we were tired and not prepared for this information. While they located our reservations, we were informed that 2 of the 3 elevators were down and we had to wait over 10 mins for the only available elevator to show up. This went on through the entire weekend. The manager suggested we take the stairs at one point. We were on the 12 floor. The rooms were very well decorated and nice. The beds were comfortable and new. The walls however were paper thin and we could hear every move through out the night. All of these factors could be ignored, however, the staff was not at all accommodating or flexible, much less polite. My husband was fussed at by management when he leaned up against a table and placed his beer on the top. There was a car service that was available - a brand new Tesla - which was nice but was never available for service.  This hotel while beautiful and has potential lacks in service. They have seemed to have invested their money in furniture and $200,000 cars but not in well trained staff and management.  Because of this experience my friends and I will not be at the Magnolia the next time we are in St. Louis and we would not suggest the hotel to anyoneSuch a BEAUTIFUL hotel! I travel quite a bit for work and ended up getting stuck in St Louis for a night, I was able to get a room last minute and was very well taken care of. I LOVE a good turn down service, which Magnolia does well. They have a great bar/lounge area with friendly staff and really yummy food! It was a pleasant, unexpected stay in St. Louis. Also- the beds are SO SO SO comfortable! I will definitely be staying here the next time I am in the area.Liked almost everything about this place.  The staff was very friendly, the rooms are big, and you can't complain with free beer and wine for happy hour.  Our only complaint was the plumbing.  Whenever someone would shower, a very loud vibrating noise would come from the walls.  We thought this was an isolated thing until someone on the elevator said the same thing happened to him.We got there late but check in was easy.  The room didn't have a working phone.  We went down to the front desk.  They sent some one up.  He said you are right and said I'll be back in a moment.  He was and said the room down the hall was available.  We check the phone and it was fine.  He said he would be right back with new key cards.  He was and we realized that we were in a suite at no extra cost.  We went down to have a drink and something to eat.  The food was quite good.  On check out we ask if we could leave out bags, No problem, we had 3 hrs. before the train.  When we got back from the walk we got some water at the bar.  I learned the old name of the hotel.  My grandparents had stayed there.  My grandmother talked about how grand it was.  Well it still is.This hotel was mentioned by a coworker who stumbled upon it and, after years of staying at one of two other hotels in St Louis, I decided to give it a try. I don't think those other two hotels will see much of me anymore (and they were great). Magnolia has such a charm about it. They kept the beautiful elements of the prior Mayfair hotel, adding in contemporary touches to make it sleek and cool. The rooms are amazing and so nice for my work travel away from home, giving me a bit more room and an at home feel. And most importantly the staff has been amazing. Rare do I find an aesthetically pleasing hotel with nice staff and similar people also staying there to enjoy wine with at the hotel bar before retreating to my comfortable room. Kudos, Magnolia.As a business traveler it is not often that I am pleasantly surprised by a hotel experience. Exceptional staff, a recent remodel that is just stunning and wonderful rooms. We were there for 4 nights. It was walking distance to the america center and way better than the other hotels in the area. This is a great hotel run by super friendly people who go out of their way to make your stay a good one. Genuinely refreshing.Yes, I am a fan. It was my first stay in St. Louis -- a two night stay -- and I'm happy with my choice of hotel. Why? The staff. And well-thought out service. My fifth floor king suite was spacious, updated, well-appointed, and clean, and the food was very good, but it was staff -- and how they did what they did -- who made my experience an excellent one. Valet, front door, bartender, room service, and front desk. Everyone. Including the kitchen. (Thank you, kitchen folks, for a cooking up an excellent ""minutes before we close"" late night meal after a long day of traveling! And love your coffee, btw.) The management should be commended for doing such a good job hiring and training their staff. And the kitchen and room-service teams should be commended for putting together a strong breakfast and dinner menu, good service hours, excellent and reliable service, and an easy to use system for ordering breakfast. Well done. There is a strong, team commitment to serving guests well at The Magnolia, and it shows. I docked a star for the reason mentioned at the end of this review and because I find the bar area layout, decor, and sound level obnoxious and not in keeping with the rest of the place (to be honest -- I like a nice hotel bar that ""fits"" and is comfortable to park myself in; I just really didn't like it and kept to my quiet, comfortable room, instead), but the rest of my experience was top notch. A minor issue was also handled very professionally by the front desk. The bartender is one of the best -- don't let her go! I recommend staying here when in St. Louis. Easy self parking one block over, as well. ** ONE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE HOTEL: Please(!) provide magnifying mirrors in the bathrooms or, at the least, have some available on request. It's pretty standard these days and a necessity for many of us. Better lighting for makeup application would be appreciated, too. :)This hotel met my expectations over on beyond. Everyone was so nice and friendly will definetly stay here again.I stayed at the Magnolia for three nights and experienced the best service with the daytime front desk staff! Extremely accommodating! The hotel itself is super cute and they have an amazing happy hour! The bartenders at the hotel were also fantastic!What a nice, cute boutique hotel!  My friend and I went up for a baseball game and chose this hotel for its great location!  The hotel is in walking distance of the ball park which is another plus!  The hotel has newly opened and it is gorgeous!  The staff is helpful and friendly and Wendy the bartender was great!  She was so friendly and made our evening after the game even more fun.   I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting St. Louis!",,,,"['know', 'expect', 'hotel', 'magnolia', 'new', 'destination', 'traveling', 'pooch', 'located', 'heart', 'downtown', 'stone', 'throw',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-st-louis-airport-bridgeton-2,Embassy Suites St. Louis - Airport,3.0,$$,33,"Last time staying here. Bummer. They need help with how they run this front desk. Nice people. Very respectful. Complete chaos. 3pm check in is notional. Chaos. Just chaos.Embassy Suites is usually a top notch hotel and we've stayed at different ones in different cities. I was expecting the same caliber of quality service however this hotel did not live up to the service you'd expect from Embassy Suites. When I called the day before our check in to confirm how to request the airport shuttle, the lady who answered the phone sounded irritated and bothered by my phone call. She had a condescending tone and was short with her answers. We are at the airport and try to call the hotel to request the shuttle. It rings a few times then it disconnects- like someone picked up the phone and then hung it up. That happened twice! All the while we are waiting with our luggage on the curb. I finally get through to the hotel and again get the sassy tone  when I confirm that we are waiting at the right spot. The shuttle arrived about 20 minutes later- other hotel shuttles passed us by twice before ours finally came. The check in was slow- one person handling the front desk. Check in is at 3:00 and we arrived at 6:30 yet we had to wait for a room to be ready. Luckily we were able to enjoy snacks (pita chips, hummus, crudites, and cheese) and soft drinks at the managers reception while we waited.The room was a little smaller than other embassy suites we've stayed at but it was fine. The decor and furniture were modern and tidy. Our room did not have a chair for the desk but our friends room down the hall did. The bathroom was large and spacious. The beds were soft and comfortable. We found a large piece of glass on the carpet. Luckily when we tripped on it we were wearing shoes but it was unnerving to find such a large chunk and it made me wonder if the floor was even vacuumed.Also I did not realize that the front door would not lock shut. I was in the bath room giving my daughter a bath when my son walked in. I had both room keys so I was shocked when he walked in and said the front door was unlocked. I checked it and sure enough you could just push it open. My husband had to jiggle and mess with it for awhile before it locked properly. The pool room felt like a sauna- no air movement or ventilation. Lots of chairs but towels run out quickly. The pool is not very large but that made it easier to supervise the kids playing. We checked out at very early so we missed the breakfast. When we checked in I asked about what time the shuttle leaves for the airport and if I needed to put in a reservation/request. I was told to just come to the lobby. I asked if there were specific times for the shuttle- again I was told to just come down in the morning. So at 4:25 we go down expecting to catch the shuttle and get to the airport at 5:00. We are told that the shuttle just left 2 minutes ago so the next one will be at 5:00. Overall if you just need a place to stay close to the airport this is a good deal. Just wish their staff would be more personable and helpful.This Embassy Suites is recently renovated and looks amazing. From the lobby to the room you will feel like luxury in this hotel. I stayed in their one bedroom suite which has a small kitchen area,  dining table,  combined with the living room which had a let out couch, and  television. The bedroom has a large closet, television,  en-suite bathroom with walk in shower. The hotel is conveniently located off the express which allows you access to a very short commute to the city. The staff were friendly and my check in process was swift. I did e-check in which means your keys are ready for you when you arrive; however I was informed when I arrived the e-check in malfunctioned and my keys were not ready. The front desk attendant apologized and quickly made keys to my room which took like 30 seconds.  The all you can eat breakfast was included and was great. There is a chef that makes omelettes and pancakes fresh and hot for guests. I would strongly recommend this hotel for those who are looking for a nice hotel in the St. Louis area. I will definitely stay here again when I'm in the area. Also,  it's a Hilton honors affiliated hotel so you can rack up hotel points.I work in aviation and am very familiar with hotels of all types.  I was very disappointed by the staff and service at this hotel.  The breakfast bar was filthy.  I was forced to eat at a table with another family's dishes at it.  The food was food in the same way that particle board is technically still wood.  I arrived in the morning for a two week stay after a tiring AM flight.  I was eager to get into my room and get some sleep.  The lobby was filled with people checking out.  After initially being told that they would knock out a room for me, I was basically told over the course of the next 6 hours that the room wasn't ready.  I was willing to pay for an extra day if it meant getting some sleep.  Instead I napped in the lobby for nearly 6 hours.  In that 6 hours, not a single staff member offered a Wifi pass, or a pass key to use the gym or pool.  I was treated like a piece of furniture.So I get to my room and no wash cloths and the room was not cleaned well. Then I look and there's no lotion or shampoo. So I call down and and am told well they are busy so it was missed. Umm. Ok. Can I have a wash cloth?  So they called maid service said she will bring. An hour later nine. The managers reception is going down hill. My spare blanket looked like someone had sex on it and put it back. I left a note but no extra blanket. Been staying here for years. Probably not going to again. It's really going down hill. Staff are great and friendly but man the rooms. Place needs some tender loving help.I stayed here with my cousin on Fourth of July weekend. We encountered filthy glasses in our room. One which had hard crust on it and a bug inside. We also tried to take a shower and when the towel was open an open condom flew out. We were totally disgusted. When we went to the front desk we were given a free nights stay and two free alcoholic drinks at the bar (each). We requested fresh additional towels. When housekeeping brought the towels they put them on the floor outside our room. This really was an awful stay. I recommended this  hotel to my cousin and I was embarrassed for my city. I love embassy suites I always pick them but this makes me think twice next time I refer a hotel or visit myself. I am currently on hold as we speak with guest services it had been 40 mins. They are refusing to accommodate us.I am a Hilton Diamond member who travels to this location to conduct meetings onsite at this Embassy Suites every 6 to 10 weeks.  I stay here because it is convenient.  I will say that Katherine (sales/catering manager) and Larry (who takes care of the meeting rooms) are fantastic.  Jackie and the other shuttle bus drivers are wonderful, as well.  However, this hotel is in dire need of an upgrade, renovation and/or thorough cleaning.  Half of the time when I check in, there is a problem with my room (e.g. plumbing issue, flooded bathroom, dirty sheets, dirty commode, no hot water, etc.)  The front desk always seems to be understaffed and although they are doing their best to accommodate the guests, their helpfulness does not resolve the underlying problems (lack of attention to cleanliness, poor food quality, etc.) Just this evening alone, I witnessed several guests needing to change their rooms due to standing water in the bathrooms and other problems.  I wish that I could rate this hotel higher for the sales/catering staff, Jackie, Lewis and a few of the front desk staff, but I feel that would be misleading given the numerous problems at this property.I love all embassy suites, and this was my first stay after the company did renovations on all of their properties' lobby areas with modern color scheme and fountain wall.Room was spacious and clean.Due to flight delays, I arrived very late, yet they were gracious enough to keep the kitchen open long enough for me to get in my late-night order. So I'd say service was great.2 downsides to this property:I had a room at the very end of the hall. The pipes must've been close to the exterior because it took a whole 5 minutes to run my water before it started getting warm. I actually had to call front desk to ask them if there was a water broiler issue on the property, but apparently the problem was just isolated to me.The other downside is that I was craving made-to-order omelettes each morning, and neither morning had an omelette chef. (I guess I'm spoiled by other embassy suites morning breakfast service). Even though the Ferguson riots were going on a few miles away, I still felt very safe on this property.Super disappointed.  My first stay a couple months ago was good. Room was pretty good, food was good &amp; service was good. This time, room was awful (dirty, noisy &amp; service did not replace any towels or shampoo for me) &amp; it seems there's a frat party in the bar. I will definitely look for other places to stay in the future!Adventure and good food awaits!Bad news.  They had a fire before I arrived last night.  More bad news, the lobby was a crisp 28 degrees or so.  And...you guessed it, slow service from the kitchen and bells and sirens (ongoing alarm issues) kept going and going.  BUT!  The ice cold shower made all the memories of last night go away.The breakfast was delicious though.  So was my California Chicken Club from last night.  Hey folks, you have to find the good things in life and focus on them.  Great to know even a major business can bounce back from adversity.worst experience in 40 yrs.!!!  Love Embassy Suites, but this one is extremely dirty, cob webs, carpet not vacuumed, dusty and lights that don't work.  Felt as if our lives were in danger, if you complained they would follow you around.  This location needs to be closed.  For lots of reasons: I don't think they even changed the linens on the beds!!, nonsmoking smelled like somebody had just smoked in the room.  The employees act like they are being put out having to work!!  As omlettes go, not even cooked.  And when they are within closing time, don't bother.  Sticky, dirty tables, crumbs, crap all over!  I think that it is even a health concern.  Go to another location if you need Embassy SUites, this location is scary and needs to be closed.I have been in more pleasant funeral homes. Right now am waiting 50 minutes for food. Drinks were good but the rest is not.It's almost 5am and I can't get a good nights' sleep.  Why? the mattress in my hotel room is old and springy! It's been a miserable night so far. I'm a business traveller who has stayed at many Embassy suites/hiltons across the country and never written a yelp review let alone a poor one.  This is unacceptable. I do not recommend this hotel. A very uncomfortable experience with one more night to go. The only pro about this hotel is the proximity to STL Intl Airport.Update:  The hotel Mgr did apologize and switch me out of the uncomfortable King bed suite to a 2 queen bed suite for the remainder of my stay.  So far these queen beds are more comfortable.I've been at this hotel for years. Today I arrive at the airport and wait for a shuttle. After waiting quite some time. Nada. I call and ask if they have a shuttle,... Response ""Yes, but you need to call to have us drive to the airport"". Whaaaat?Hotels by the airport typically run every 30 min. Right? Not this one anymore.This hotel was nice. The staff were friendly. The bar was filled with middle-aged businessmen who quite literally monopolized every table and space at the bar. I was not interested in being wedged between some douchey-enamored-with-himself senior manager from Boeing. So I ate in the restaurant by myself. Glad I did. It was quiet, I got to have a nice conversation with the server and the food was delicious...this was the best part. My room was a mini-suite and was okay, however, the bed was NOT comfortable at all.Sadly, when I got up the next morning, I literally could not stand straight. I had to get into the shower for 15 minutes and let hot water run on my back. (When I got home, I had to have xrays and it turns out my SI-Joint was completely twisted, which forced my L5 out and to pinch two nerves...in summary, their beds are NOT good). Yes, I blame it on the crappy bed. The other main complaint I have is the ice maker was not working on my floor and there was no change machine to get a soda. I was pissed. If there is one thing I cannot stand when staying at a hotel, it is when the accommodations that you would expect are broken down. A guest should not have to 'hoof' it to the main lobby in her pajamas for ice and/or a soda. I was too tired off of my flight to check out the pool or get in the hot tub, but you could definitely smell the wafting aroma of chlorine immediately when you enter the main lobby. They really should deal with that issue.Unlike the last few ES's we've been in, this one doesn't have the open out to the center atrium have people walk past your ""front"" window model going on.  It is set up more like a traditional hotel with hallways, etc.  Worked for me!Room was comfy enough as was the bed, they didn't have a mat for the shower so I threw a towel down everyday and the house cleaning staff never emptied the trash cans unless they were chocked full of stuff.  Eh, no big deal.Their offering for happy hour snacks were typical (fruit, chips and dip, chex mix) and thank goodness for breakfast they knew the meaning of putting out meat in the buffet line!!!  They even had a make your own waffle section.I would readily stay here again, the location isn't bad it's just getting in and out of it if you want to be on 70 requires you going down to the Rock Rd. and turning around.  Plus, if you aren't aware of the street to turn down to get to it when you get off of 70 you can zip right past it.I notice all of the other reviews were pre-renovation, so this is the first post-renovation.  I have stayed here twice in the past so I know how tired the hotel had been.  The hotel is much much nicer than before, including the lobby, bar area, and rooms.  I didn't have time to check out the fitness center or poolLobby - Stylish, contemporary, with sofas and chairs that still have that brand new look and feel.  The front desk with the long counter has been replaced with shorter, stand alone counters 3 or 4 across.Bar - A true bar, not the drink counter that many Embassy Suites offer during the free happy hour.  And usually the ""manager's reception"" offers one or two standard domestic beers only; this location has about a half dozen on draft including some foreign and microbrews I had never heard of.  I didn't try anything stronger than beer so I cannot say if the free happy hour features name brand liquor or if they offer just the generic booze.Rooms - My room was so nice.  The bed was very comfortable with soft plushy pillows.  Each room had a large flat screen TV although I didn't have time to watch anything.  I had a room that did not have a bath but a large shower stall with sliding glass doors.  Free wifi too.The money that Embassy Suites has put into the hotel has been well worth it.P.S. The hotel has a free airport shuttle too.This was the worst Hilton Hotel I ever stayed at. Terrible breakfast Buffett, very poor service, food all over the floor. Coffee stopped working in the middle of breakfast. No fruit, long lines for food. Cream ran out, undercooked food. When things ran out it took half an hour to refill, this includes forks and knives. The room was nice but short of towels and it took an hour to get them up to me. Had to wait to check in even though there were lots of people at the front desk. Most stood around talking while one person worked. Skip this place. Not worth it.While the stay, accommodation and staff were pleasant enough, please don't leave any items behind.  When I checked out of my room in the morning, I left a pair of shoes by the bed.  I called back to housekeeping and they advised no shoes were turned in.  While I blame myself for forgetting the shoes to begin with, there is no way the shoes would have been overlooked by housekeeping when they cleaned the room.  Someone is walking around in my $150 shoes and I am out of luck.  I called the Manager to request that he inquire with the staff.  He said he would and call me back by the end of the day.  He didn't call back so I called him back and had to leave a message.  We are all forgetful from time to time.  But an honest hotel staff would have turned in the shoes to lost and found.  I have left items behind before at another hotel and they logged in the item to the room and date so when you called back in to claim the property, it was easily located.  Moral of the story is don't leave things behind, especially at this hotel.Great staff    very clean.  Love the bartender.  Food is pretty good.  Its nice sometimes to not have to go out to ear.  This is why I only stay here when in stl.  My only gripe is that salmon is the only fish on the menu. How about some haddock. Bass.","Even after renovations the Embassy is still an Embassy. So with expectations not very high, me and the family stayed here for one night this past weekend. The beds were decent and the cable options were good. Nothing spectacular though and the area is dead, but for visiting family it worked. Breakfast buffet remains the best thing this property has going for itself. They also offer a happy hour, but we didn't partake in it.The hotel was beautiful! My problem, I'm a Hilton honors member. My credit card is always available. Whenever I stay at the Hilton hotels, I always pay in cash when I arrive. This hotel DO NOT take cash when you arrive only when you leave. The front office manager REFUSED to help me....But she was very nice, The hotel manager allowed me to pay in CASH! A very nice man.Here's the kicker...once I checked out, she had to come and check our room to make sure their were no damages! I was livid and humiliated. We stayed one night. Arrived at 6 pm and check out at 8am. My credit card was on file...she still placed a hold on my card! I paid in CASH and she still had to view my room.Never again will I stay at this hotel! Not everyone want to put a hotel on credit...if you have cash. We were on vacation! every vacationer usually have cash to spend!We are in a use your credit card LESS society and pay in CASH.I expected the hotel to be ok, but it was much better than expected! We stayed there for one night while visiting st. louis. It was about a 20 minute drive from downtown St. Louis, but we chose to stay by the airport because the prices were more affordable.The price was decent and the hotel was clean. The hotel looked like it was just renovated... you could tell because there were some areas that looked brand new and other areas that looked a little on the old side. The room was very spacious... In the living room area, there was a little kitchenette, desk, and a tv/couch. The bedroom was a good size and the bathroom was huge. Breakfast was included in the price, but it was kind of a mess in the morning. When we got downstairs for breakfast, there were lots of dirty tables and no plates at the buffet. We finally got our hands on some plates, but the selection was limited. It took awhile before they filled up the empty chafing dishes with fresh food.Overall, the experience was good. My only complaint would probably be that they were understaffed and/or underprepared for breakfast service.Nicely renovated, and very clean and neat.  The bar can make almost anything you want (a plus for a hotel bar), and the restaurant inside is pretty good.Unfortunately, I've yet to find much to do in the area (you're basically at the airport). I've stayed 2x's, and I'm sure I'll be back....I have stayed at several Embassy Suites and the ambiance of this one definitely caters to business travelers.  The decor is very masculine and cold, so you don't get a very relaxed feeling when walking in.  The first room we got had cockroaches, yes COCKROACHES which is just grody to the max.  When we told the front desk, they were very apologetic and gave us another room.  I thoroughly inspected the second room and thankfully there were no roaches.  The room was clean and it had two separate areas, a living room with a television and desk with chairs, and a bedroom with a bathroom.  The crib they provided was better then a standard pack and play, it had sturdy metal bars, and a mattress pad.  The hotel was very quiet for being so close to the airport, because we never had problems with noise.  When we checked out, our room was comped because of the cockroach incident.  I appreciate the comp, however I would never come back.POST RENOVATION REVIEWJust had to get that out of the way - some of the old reviews are snarky and I don't want them confused with reviews of the new, improved Embassy Suites - St. Louis Airport!So, pretty much this hotel was gorgeous! Upon entering you immediately see a legitimate bar area complete with jazzy (purple-ish!) decor and waterfall.  Off to the side of the lobby there are what they called little ""interviewing"" rooms - which upon further inspection looked like little mini living rooms where you could hang out for a more private convo with colleagues or the fam.After check-in, which was a smooth process - Stacey handed me a brochure and told me that an evening reception was available at the bar *every night* beginning at 5:30pm and that made to order breakfast (omelets, oatmeal, etc.) was available in the early morning. Score! That's what I love about Embassy Suites in general though...What I was really pleased to find; however, was that the rooms were not all centered around the atrium with windows that looked out onto the hallway. For some reason - those ""inside"" windows freak me out a little bit, just not a fan.  Instead this Embassy Suites had the traditional atrium (you look down onto the bar) with three hallways of rooms leading away from the central point. My room was on the very end of the front hallway and upon entering was greeted with the traditional wet bar area (sink, microwave, and 'fridge) and the seating area - complete with desk work space, two additional chairs, a couch, a pull out bench, and a flat screen TV.  I can't really describe the layout of my Suite - but it wasn't the traditional walk straight through the first room to get to the next - it was more like they were side by side.  The decor in the room was super modern - different patterns, shades of brown, blue, silver - just gorgeous in my opinion. The bed was the traditional white plush bedding that you would expect. Complete with a selection of five pillows that I got allllll to myself! There was a flat screen in the bedroom and a vanity area with tiny block seat. Very cute.  The bathroom had a sliding glass door shower and a large vanity area.The evening reception was very nice and busy! It was definitely good for socializing with my teammates.  The bartenders were nice and even crafted me ""something sweet"" upon my request - which the bartender ended up dubbing a ""ghetto iced tea"" - pretty much a long island but made with lemonade only. It was strong. There were also evening treats - which I did not partake in; however, on the first night I noted they had taco dip, hummus, and an additional Mediterranean dip.Breakfast in the morning was pleasant (except the tables filled up quick!). They offered a breakfast bar - with scrambled eggs, breakfast meats, potatoes, fruit, pastries, bagels, toast, yogurt, and fruit as well as a ""made-to-order"" area where you could get omelets (I got mine with egg white, spinach, and tomatoes - yum!) and oatmeal. There was also a refreshments selection - apple, cranberry, and orange juices, coffee, and sodas.The outside doors lock between 10pm and 7am - and even the front door said this - so I'm not sure what you do if you come in after that, but I wasn't up or out late enough to find out!Express checkout was easy - they slipped the folio under my door during the night and I just dropped my keys at the counter on my way out.The only complaints I have about the hotel are the fact that its ONLY entrance from the road is literally off of a highway and it's an ABRUPT turn and immediately after you need to merge with an on ramp. Definitely flew right by the first time. And the fact that there's not too much within walking distance.  There's a TGI Friday's, a grocery store, an IHOP, and a Home Depot near by - so take your pick.  Without a rental car, this trip kind of would have sucked. But! Within a 20-25 minute ride there are nice shopping areas, an ALL Spray Tan tanning salon (in Brentwood) and a Nordstrom &amp; more shopping, Cheesecake Factory, and a Maggiano's in Clayton. Finally, the location is close to the airport - so it was convenient.  If I'm ever in St. Louis for work again - I would be a repeat customer!As a Hilton Diamond member, I get to stay at a lot of Embassy Suites.  This is clearly one of the best I have been to.  Both the rooms and public areas are modern and extensively renovated. The service is excellent - they knew what I wanted before I asked after only 1 day stay.  The atmosphere is decisively masculine and caters to the business traveler (showers-no tub), and the manager's reception is one of the best (marinated clams in the shell, cheese and deli tray, chips and black bean hummus), plus free drinks. It is very close to the airport with a free shuttle.  Parking is ample with easy access to I-70 and Lindbergh Blvd. Highly recommendedClean rooms, the doors were a bit confusing and they seemed to be in the way a lot for me.  The beds were comfortable, but I could not adjust the heat in my room. It wouldn't turn down and I had to turn the air on to get some relief. The hotel is very close to cypress parking too!Nice rooms that typically have a lounge area and a bedroom. Everything is clean and modern. I will never give an Embassy above three stars though because they charge you for Internet.Mostly good. Channel 70 Productions was in town to subcontract work to other video production companies. The shuttle came quick to pick us up at the airport and check-in was fast. Nice rooms as usual for ES. Good drinks and food at the restaurant. Friendly staff. Free wi-fi. However, it took FOREVER for outside callers to get the hotel operator to answer the phone. The little meeting areas downstairs were perfect for interviewing prospective contractors. We'd give higher marks, but someone needs to start answering the phones first.If you don't have anything good to say...come sit next to me!This is a tired hotel sorely in need of an Extreme Hotel Makeover. 80's wallpaper, can you say mauve? Big old TV's, at least there's two and bad housekeeping. How many hotels rooms do you walk into that after being cleaned have the toilet seat left up? Yes, I'm nit-picky, but this is just wrong and I experienced it twice. Then upon returning to my room today I found they ""made it up"" but didn't leave fresh towels. YES, I wanted FRESH towels. They collected the used towels, but didn't leave any fresh ones. On my way out to dinner I requested clean towels and when I got back I had clean towels...enough for the whole hotel. I'm one person in one room, I'll use 3-4 towels between tonight and tomorrow. I got 14 fresh towels. Talk about overkill! From none to 14.If you can, stay somewhere else. There are many better places to stay right in the immediate vicinity.booked in to here while on a business trip and they were in the middle of their $6,000,000 renovation.  the hotel was definitely in need of the renovation and i am sure it will be great once it is done.  however, i was in an old room which was very outdated.while there was nothing really wrong with the hotel i did have lot of allergy problems due to all the dust from their renovation.  i was reassured that everything would be complete by july but that didn't help my visit in april.staff at the hotel were all extremely friendly and apologetic for the state of the rooms and hotel in general.  rooms were clean and free wifi was definitely a plus.someone else mentioned the free happy hour, unfortunately it sounds like that will go away once the renovation is over.  they had bad food (pretzels, salsa, chips) and even worse beer (bud light) but at least it was free, hopefully the renovation will make up for that loss.breakfasts were definitely the highlight of the hotel.  massive omelettes, waffles, yogurts, juice, tea/coffee, etc... couldn't really ask for more.stayed there in April while it was under serious rehab.  the first night I didn't have hot water.  the phone didn't work, and the wall outlets did not function.  Parking was a mess because of the construction.  Hopefully by the time you stay there, the renovation will be complete.  Until then, I recommend taking a pass on this one.",,,,"['last', 'time', 'staying', 'bummer', 'need', 'help', 'run', 'front', 'desk', 'nice', 'people', 'respectful', 'complete', 'chaos', 'check',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-parkway-hotel-saint-louis,The Parkway Hotel,3.5,$$,37,"Great hotel. Very clean and the staff was incredibly professional. Free parking included with your stay. It's nothing fancy, but great for a night out in CWE or if you have family at the nearby medical centers.Freezing cold rooms and hallways! ATM never worked and the front desk refuses to call cabs for guests. There is one guy who is in charge of cabs and if he's not there they make you call one yourself.Rooms are clean and spacious. Great TV channel selection!Nice old hotel. Always clean and neet. Fantastic staff.  Very professional and oh so polite.  BUT the lame ass breakfast food needs a major change.  Served the same items every day. Would stay here again in a heart beat. But I will walk across the street to Panera Bread for breakfast next time.Service is very good and the place looks clean and neat. Also,complementary hot breakfast was a good surprise. One person in special made the stay very memorable.  We had just driven for 11 hours and KAVITA went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and accomodate us while we were there.Great little hotel for what it is. Nothing fancy, but nothing skeezy either. Within walking distance to Forest Park and all the great little restaurants in CWE. Our room was clean and our bed was comfortable. That's all we really asked for.This used to be an ok place to stay when I had business in the area. Very disappointed to see they have put up signs they are now a free killing zone. The ""good guys"" are not be permitted to bring a gun. so the bad guys can have their way.Stayed here one night on our way from Fort Leonard Wood to NYC.  We were pleased with how fast and easy it was to get a room on short notice.  Parking is available through the garage at a small fee per night.  They honored our military discount as well.  The room was a nice size, clean and the bed was super comfy.  The view we had (on the 3rd floor) was the parking garage, not sure if there are better ones available, but you MAY want to specify on that.  The night person who does the billing screwed it up and noted a 2 night stay on our express check-out, so THAT had to be addressed, but it was fixed immediately.  The bathroom had an odd set-up where the door swung right in front of the toilet...someone did NOT think that one out.  The lighting in the bathroom sucked...like ONE really bright one...but - hardly something to complain about, and maybe it was just our room.  There are a few bars/rest. within walking distance too.   A nice option, only about a block or two, but it worked for us!!I stayed here on a visit to Wash U. School of Medicine - it's very convenient to the whole complex. On the plus side: very friendly and helpful staff, free and yummy cookies in the evening, free and okay breakfast in the morning, free internet, and reasonably priced overall. On the negative side: the room was a little shabby, uncomfortable, and poorly lit, the ""window"" offered a view of the indoor parking garage, the heating unit was loud and constantly on, and apparently its air intake was poorly placed (from time to time cigarette or more suspect odors would waft through the room). If you decide to stay here, request a room on an upper floor and/or with an exterior view.Stayed here one night for an interview in St.  Louis. Conveniently located half a block away from St. Louis Children's Hospital and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. There is an attached Applebee's which is open until 11 pm on most nights, if you're coming in late and are looking for a quick bite to eat. There are also many restaurants and cafe patios within walking distance. I guess the hospital employment provides a big lunch crowd.A room with a single King sized bed was $129 per night. It was paid for by my interviewers, so that was nice. Garage parking is an additional $5 per night. Within walking distance to the Central West End Metrolink and adjacent to Forest Park. It's also aboutt 2.5 miles from SLU. Complimentary breakfast provided in the lobby. I checked out early, but saw them setting up and it looked pretty basic: coffee, cereal, bagels,etc. The room itself was clean and spacious. The furnishings were a little dated, but that's nitpicking. I don't really have much to add. My only gripe is that there's no free or even pay wifi. I believe there's free wifi in the lobby and also free ethernet internet in the rooms. Overall a convenient place to stay if you're visiting the hospitals or SLU.This is an OK hotel in a great location. Keep that in mind: you're paying for the location. I loved how close it was to Forest Park. The room was surprisingly quiet and the bed was comfortable. Now the negatives. The free breakfast was TERRIBLE. It was the worst breakfast I've ever had. The wi-fi worked in the evening but not the next morning. Bottom line: stay here if you get a good deal and want quick access to the hospital or Forest Park, otherwise don't bother.The wifi does not work at all in the rooms here. It only works in the lobby...convenient. Stayed here for three weeks and never had Internet. Especially when you're working at the hospital and your work requires you to use Internet to do your job, but the hotel has none...Thanks a lotThis hotel is a gem. It's located in the medical district and is close to the metro which can take you anywhere in St. Louis. Parking is cheap and easy and the staff are fast and efficient.  Most importantly, the rooms are clean, spacious (even the bathrooms) and the bed is comfortable with nice sized pillows. It's new remodeled and it's a great place to stay if you're staying there for a medical reason or a weekend trip to the city.  Also, free cookies in the lobby in the afternoon. We've stayed there twice and plan to anytime we're in town.Terrible customer service. We stayed here for a wedding and were incredibly disappointed by hotel staff throughout the entire weekend. (The staff was even rude to the bride &amp; groom.) Stay somewhere else! Many other great places in St. Louis that are more client-oriented.This is a good solid three star restaurant. It looks like all of the rooms for ungraded in the last 5 years. The beds were a little hard, but comfortable. Each room comes with a flat screen, microwave, and mini-fridge which was nice considering the portion sizes at St Louis restaurants.There is freshly cooked popcorn (burnt and salty) and cookies (disappear in 5 minutes flat) in the lobby, which is nice, but they need to take a cue from Doubletree and have these available all the time for their guests if they're going to offer it. Otherwise it's just a tease to step into an elevator that smells like chocolate chip cookies, only to have an empty tray waiting for you in the lobby.There is an Applebee's attached for convenient meals if you don't want to leave the hotel, but I'm too much a food snob to eat here.Convenient to all of Forest Park and a shuttle is available (just tip your driver if you use the service).While planning a trip to Barnes Jewish Hospital for surgery, we decided that the Parkway was the best option because of the skyway connecting to the hospital.  I called to make reservations.  I waited on hold for a long length of time.  Started to make the reservation, then again was put on hold.  Finally the reservation was completed and he was going to give me the confirmation number only to be placed on hold again.  I was on hold 12 minutes of a 15 minute conversation.  For this quality a hotel this is absurd.  I gave up and figured I'd get the e-mail confirmation faster.  When it hadn't arrived after 3 days I called back.  No reservation had ever been made!!!  The gal told me there were no rooms for those dates.  No apology. No offer to try to help in any way.Never again.  We're staying at Residence Inn where for less we get a kitchen and real bedroom.1. No toothbrushes, not even for sale in their ""store.""  Nearest convenience store a mile walk away.2. No bathmat.3. Stole one of my razors.4. Horrendous coffee.5. Hidden ice bucket.6. Had to try room key a half-dozen times each time to get it to work.7. Illegally tried to charge state taxes on official federal government business.I live in the same neighborhood as this hotel and it's the place I have my out of town guests stay if they're not in the mood to couch surf or inflate my air mattress.The Parkway has a great location and is Metrolink accessible (meaning you can get there from the airport very easily).  The price is always good (ask them about their AAA discount, it's something like $10 off a room) and the hotel is always clean.  It's still relatively new and in great shape.  The last room my guest stayed in had a flat screen TV as well as microwave and mini fridge, discretely hidden in the furniture.  The Parkway includes breakfast in the price of your room and has afternoon snacks.  It's not as fancy as the Chase Park Plaza, but for the price it is a really solid, clean, new-ish hotel.  If you're looking for a place to stay in the Central West End, I highly recommend it.Acceptable staying accomodations. This is a pet hotel though so make sure you request a room that is not pet friendly lest your room smell like doggie pee.Nice clean hotel with easy parking for $5. Right next to the Central West End with multiple unique bars/food. Not walking distance to Forest Park, but a short trip on the Metrolink.I've stayed here a number of times on business trips. I've always found the staff friendly and helpful. Rooms are always clean and comfortable and have free internet. The parking garage is a bit funky but is perfectly serviceable. The free breakfast is OK, not exceptional, but good and it's FREE.If I have to make a criticism, it would be that there never seem to be enough outlets to plug in all of the assorted phone and computer chargers that follow me around, but that is really a minor thing. The Applebee's off of the lobby is not so good, service stinks, but that is not the fault if the hotel. Fortunately there are lots of great places to eat just a few minutes walk away. Close to lots of other stuff to see as well. Great place to stay if you are in St. Louis.","My bff's parents rescued the two of us by getting us an extra night at this hotel instead of leaving us to our own devices and the horrible whims associated with sleeping over at the apartment of a college aged boy, mid move-out, as he plays computer games and does other unsavory activities instead of cleaning.  Thank you Parkway for keeping me and my New Kids pillowcase clean.  The rooms were clean and pretty standard and the service was friendly.  We definitely took advantage of the free continental breakfast, or more specifically, the free juice.  They also have free, freshly popped popcorn in the lobby.  I was sad there was no pool and the parking garage is laid out in such a way that you may never find your way back to your room, your car, or anywhere else for that matter, though I think that's because of construction mostly.  Also, you cannot take your firearms into the hotel.  See photo.We stayed here for a wedding and had a good experience.  The parking lot is a little goofy is the only beef I have with the place.The rooms were nice and clean.  Free breakfast in the morning which consisted of  Biscuits and gravy !!Cute area with a nice St Louis Bread right across the street!Front desk staff was really nice and accommodated our early check in.Short and sweet is my style. These days, I am only compelled to review a place only if I disagree with other ppl's reviews, just so that everyone can see that there's always two sides of a coin.The current reviews do not do this place justice. What more can you ask for besides a clean room, lots of free amenities including free wifi in the lobby, free internet via ethernet cable in the rooms, a free ""business center"" where i printed my boarding pass for my flight out, a decent small gym with all the essentials, and friendly customer service? I've gone to 5 star hotels in NY and Chicago that didn't offer free internet.I prefer creature comforts and necessities over bling and this place has done a fine job of making me feel comfortable away from home. They even have a small convenience store where I bought a stick of deodorant, which I forgot at home.Thank you Parkway HotelNot the best stay! Getting into Parking garage was a fiasco. Had to wait 10 minutes for someone to come lift gate. The bed was extremely hard. We were woken up at 6:00 am on sunday by an alarm going off in a vacant room. Took 20 minutes for hotel to get it turned off. Overall disappointing visit.stayed here for 5 days for a conference so had the opportunity to get to know the hotel well and definitely highly recommend! friendly service with complimentary shuttle service to local area spots (except doesn't go to/from airport), great location (basically on campus, a short walk to the metrolink station, easy to get to cute restaurants on euclid). there's complimentary breakfast (cereals, oatmeal, biscuits and gravy, OJ, milk, and apple juice) along with all-day coffee, tea, and apples and fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies in the evening. they also have an exercise room (but no pool) and a computer with printer in the main lobby. wifi downstairs but unfortunately only ethernet cord in the rooms (but complimentary - sweet!). rooms are clean and i REALLY appreciated that the air conditioner works efficiently and isn't too noisy. beds are comfy with goose down comforters and plenty of pillows, coffee maker, microwave, and fridge in the room (along with the usual iron and board, hair dryer, robes, and shampoo/conditioner/body wash/soap).Complimentary snacks!!  sunchips, granola bars, nutrigrain bars, bottles of water.  Coffee.  First time I have ever encountered this at a hotel!and FREE INTERNET!!  (wireless in lobby, ethernet in room) annnd they have conditioner!  (some hotels don't have this and I am seriously unhappy with my tangled hair)Also, very friendly staff with a hotel shuttle that will take you to local places free of charge.Stayed here a part of a group of 11 for work.  Everything was fine.  Nothing was awesome, but nothing was terrible either.  It was a perfectly acceptable hotel.  The continental breakfast was not great, but the included breakfasts at hotels rarely are.  Beds were okay, rooms and common spaces were clean, staff were friendly when you could find one, shuttle service was nice, though one driver we had obviously didn't know the area very well.  Overall three stars - its nothing fancy, but completely acceptable.Great hotel - location is incredibly convenient to the Washington University medical campus and Central West End. Room was nice and bed very comfy. The free cookies and popcorn in the lobby were a nice touch. I would definitely stay here again.For what this hotel does, it does pretty well.The Parkway Hotel is conveniently located near the Central West End metrolink stop in a fun part of town.  Unfortunately the staff is not readily knowledgeable about a lot of things, fortunately they will happily do what it takes to get you answers.There's always coffee, tea, and popcorn in the spacious, marbled lobby and rooms are big and comfortable.  There are loads of channels on the television and the thermostat is fast and functional.  Cleaning staff is very friendly and approachable and consistently thorough.This hotel does not have a pool and it's fitness center consists of two treadmills in a teeny tiny room.  But I guess it does the job, right?  Hilariously, the hotel restaurant is an Applebee's, but a NICE NEW Applebee's.  I'm no snob, it also does the job.  Fortunately continental breakfast included lots of single serving bottles/cartons of water, various juices, and milk so were great for stashing in your bag on the way out.  Unfortunately, the bagels were bags of Lender's emptied onto trays (I have visual proof!)I was between a three and a four on this review.  I guess it all boils down to the fact that for the essentials, this hotel was lovely.Awesome hotel, I spend 2-3 nights a month here.  Always clean, ALWAYS!Free internet, amaaazingly comfy beds, great location. The walls were thin, but once I was asleep I didn't hear a thing.I dont really know too much about hotels, but this one gives you free cookies and popcorn at the front desk and their staff (the ones I bumped into) are really friendly. Theres also a cute lounging area downstairs that looks perfect for a tea party (theres a fireplace!!)My only qualm with the place is that the lobby smells (minus when theres freshly popped popcorn) very sterile; I think it may be due to its location next to Barnes Jewish though. I think many of the long-term patients end up staying here if not in the apartment complex across the street.I have stayed here in the past and received a military discount since I'm a retired U.S Army Combat Veteran and the place was great.  I recently reserved a room like I normally do and a reservation agent named Christina e-mailed me advising me they only offer Government Rates to Government employees with papers showing them to be working in the area of the hotel during their stay in St. Louis and the front desk manager confirmed this ridiculous policy. I can understand being careful of people claiming to be Military to get the discount (genuine Veterans never do this) but this is why we all have ID cards showing we are Veterans and Active Duty Military.  Everyone may not feel the same as I but, I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND NEITHER WILL ANY OF MY VETERAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS!!My husband had surgery at the hospital and since we were from out of town we needed a place to recover before we were cleared to fly home.  The Parkway hotel is the closest you can get to the doctors and hospital.  We elected to go for a larger room that gave a bit more space for us to move around in.  The hotel was clean and quiet.  Location was perfect.  We made use of the shuttle multiple times - drug store, food shopping and a drop off at the balloon festival.  The driver was so nice and made it very easy.  Great cookies in the evening.  The room only had one internet connection so I brought a splitter plus some extra long cables so both of us could connect if needed.  Wi-FI in the lobby. The coffee maker was your typical hotel room coffee maker so if your picky about your coffee you will need to bring your own (coffee maker + coffee).  They do have coffee in the hotel lobby.  The Barnes and Nobel bookstore serves Starbucks coffee if you really need strong coffee.  The staff was very nice and the entire two weeks could not have been better given the stressful situation.A terrible experience.  If you are staying in St. Louis and have any other options, take them.  When I had problem with breaking out into hives everywhere my skin touched their bed linen (I know... I'm such a complainer) The staff and management were rude and combative.  If you have reservations here, my advice is cancel them immediately.I recently stayed three nights at the Parkway and can't say enough good about it. My room was spacious, immaculate, and silent.  It had refrigerator, microwave,  clock-radio, large TV, coffee pot, iron and ironing board,  extra blanket,  good reading lights, room-darkening draperies, an easy chair, and a desk for work.  My king-size bed had eight pillows, plenty for propping up to read. The bathroom was perfect with very hot water, a tub drain that worked, a great shower, large thick towels, and complimentary toiletries. The toilet flushed with a mighty swish. There was an actual closet, not just an overhead bar a la chain motel,  and it had plenty of hangers, including pants and skirt hangers. An (included) full hot breakfast is served in the lobby, where guests are also (all day long) offered complimentary hot coffee, fresh fruit, cookies, and popcorn.  There is a 24-hour mini mart that supplies a few groceries, toiletries, and personal items. A complimentary van takes guests anywhere the the Central West End. The staff was gracious and efficient---they've thought of everything. And the price was more than fair.   I would definitely go back to the Parkway and will recommend it to friends.The view isn't great. I looks out over the highway, or the hospital. Now that I've got that out of the way... The rest of the hotel was a pleasure. I really think that they care about the guests. I felt special at least. They suggested great places to eat and shop and visit. Their roomservice included the Appleby's downstairs. Their beds were devine. Their a part of the Starwood group, so you can get points for staying there. Also, did I mention the beds were excellent. I was nervous enough my first time there, being in town for an interview. But the sleeps that I got were wonderful. Smack in the middle of the Central West End, it's probably the safest walking citified neighborhood in St. Louis.",,,,"['great', 'hotel', 'clean', 'staff', 'incredibly', 'professional', 'free',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/pear-tree-inn-by-drury-union-station-saint-louis,Pear Tree Inn by Drury - Union Station,4.0,$$,40,"We attended a wedding in the area for a nephew. The wedding couple reserved a block of room in this hotel because it was near to where the reception was to be. Calling in to reserve a room was very pleasant. The person on the other line--I wish I could remember her name--gave us different options for us to make an informed decision. The information she gave included room options, hotel amenities, credit card requirements, breakfast, etc. She answered all my questions before I could ask them.Check in was very swift. It took less than 5 minutes. The gentleman behind the counter was very pleasant, informing us of amenities--like gym, afternoon beverages, breakfast, etc--along with his 'Thank You' for staying at Pear Tree Inn. The breakfast area was just adjacent and I saw a coffee machine. He informed me that coffee was on 24-hours a day and coffee was always available.The room was really nice. Pleasantly decorated and updated. There was a fridge, microwave, iron, ironing board, and a coffee pot. All table lamps had outlets for charging electronic devices. And the lamps were not bolted down to the table. I saw only two towels on the rack but there were more under the sink. Instead of little bottles of shampoo, conditioner and gel, there was a dispenser for such glued just under the shower head.Parking is a little cumbersome, as one has to go through a bunch of hoops to find a spot. The parking deck is gated with a numeric touch pad. When you put in the number, you stare at a camera right in front of you. Once the correct number is plugged in, the railing goes up AND afterwards, the swinging arm goes up too.Breakfast is heaven! Although in the two days that we stayed, the breakfast menu did not change, it was still nice to get hot breakfast. Scrambled eggs, sausage, biscuit and gravy, lots of fruits and danish. It was something to look forward to.There is an indoor pool which I did not use. My wife worked out in the gym one morning, complained about the age and the sounds of the equipment. There is a door that goes to an adjacent restaurant/bar. We poked our heads in one late evening and it was packed.The one black mark of our stay was a fight that occurred in the hallway one early morning. I am sure it was an isolated incident but it rattled our nerves a little bit.The view from the hallway was magnificent. One could see the skyline of downtown St. Louis. It was right in the middle goings on in the city. One morning, we saw a whole bunch of young girls planting and gardening in a small gardening patch just outside of the hotel premises. I didn't know what group that was but it was nice to see on a beautiful October morning.Will I go back? You betcha I would. It was really one of the best hotel stays we've had, even with the $129 nightly cost.We stayed at this hotel earlier this year. While our stay was nice enough, we selected this hotel for its St Louis Blues hockey package - which included signed hockey pucks. My kids are huge hockey fans and were looking forward to the fun souvenir. At check in, we were told that none were available but they'd be getting some in before the end of our 5 day stay. At check out, we were told they would mail us 2 pucks. Since leaving, I've called and emailed the hotel as well as emailing the corporate Drury offices. The emails go with no response. The calls are left with empty promises of mailing the items. I'd hoped to be able to surprise the kids with the picks for Christmas...no luck.UPDATE - Following this review, I was contacted by the management of the hotel.  The manager apologized for the service that we received.  He offered several options to remedy the situation and immediately sent the hockey puck to us.  We were impressed and surprised by how quickly this review resulted in action.  Thanks, Pear Tree!Place appears cleaner than when I was here last. My room was nice and clean and did not have any odor. I love that they use a dispenser for shampoo and soap. This concept cuts down on waste and I'm sure has a huge impact on expenditures.Great price, free snacks and drinks at night, hot breakfast, clean and modern rooms, nice sports bar that is attached and very friendly staff. It's what I have come to expect from Drury Hotels and this place didn't disappoint. I think I have found a new place to stay when I come to St.Louis!It's a basic hotel. A basic Drury Hotel. Wifi and breakfast is included with the room rate. It is convenient to Scottrade Center if in town for a concert. The room seems clean and for a $10 a night fee I could even bring my small dog. Parking is secured in a gated garage. They have snacks and drinks after 5:30pm but we missed those. The ice maker, cups, hot water (maybe coffee) and vending machines on the first floor were all accessible for a cheap late night, after concert snack. Total side note but there is a beautiful community garden facing the parking lot. Lovely. The downside is the bar across the street appears to be rocking every night. Here on a Sunday and you could hear the music from anywhere inside the hotel until well after 1am. The cool thing was Pear Tree had security out to make sure the bar crowd was not parking in the hotel lot! The breakfast is pretty much exactly what the website said, eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy. Not much else. Cereals and breads. I was down by 7:30am and it was crowded and the food, in steamers was cold. :-( I found the hotel staff to be friendly and accommodating. The front desk staff who had checked my sister in over an hour before I arrived remembered her and was on the lookout for me and my dog! :-) I've stayed in a few St Louis hotels and for the rate I would return. Oh and they have lots of available discounts if you book online (paid at the hotel). The senior rate starts at 50yrs old (which is NOT a senior but who am I to argue with discounts).We stayed here two nights for our sons enlistment to the Navy.Pros: Nice, clean and comfortable hotel. Every employee, and I mean every employee, I encountered had a smile on their faces. They were so helpful and truly seemed to enjoy their jobs. The managers attended breakfast by helping the costumers, asking how our stay has been, and even cleaning the tables. This morning an employee coming in for the day passed us and said ""Good Morning."" Just nice people.The rooms were a little small but very comfortable and clean. The breakfast has a nice selection and it's free. Coffee and sodas in the lobby are free and available at all times. Parking, breakfast, wi-fi, sodas, coffee, popcorn, nightly drinks are all free!!Cons: It's a nice walk to the arch and Busch stadium. However, the hotel is in a shady part of town so we didn't feel comfortable walking back after dark. A cab from the stadium was just under $10. Not bad considering parking by the stadium can run you $20 or more.All in all, I would DEFINITELY stay here again!!!Do you need an affordable place to stay?  This is it!  Even if you are going to save $10, just say no.The staff is friendly and most of them are knowledgeable. You have a bad apple in every bunch. There is free parking, in/out, for the duration of your stay. Checking in is quick and simple. However, there are only TWO elevators for the entire place. I stayed on the ninth floor and found myself taking the stairs often.The pool area is small but it is nice. The hot tub is ALWAYS overrun with children. There are tons of children left unattended at the pool. The hotel could offer some sort of attendant. It would be nice to enjoy a hot tub as an adult.The breakfast is phenomenal. Eggs, sausage, yogurt, biscuits and gravy, waffles, donuts, muffins and cereal. This is complimentary. There is also soda and popcorn offered free throughout the day. In addition to all of this, there is happy hour which gives each adult in the room three free drinks. Wine or Beer. But hey, free is free. There is a restaurant in the hotel but it is ok. The staff is not knowledgeable and gave me misinformation. Something the hotel should keep tabs on. Their guests will be affected.So the restaurant runs a shuttle to the game. $2. Fantastic, right? Well it is but there is NO organization, no line...so it is a giant pile of chaos and there is lots of bad blood between guests. The rooms are clean and everyone comes with a fridge and microwave. The hotel provides shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Overall, I would definitely stay there again.We had a nice stay for the price we paid.  Location was great for seeing the Arch.  The on site restaurant was good and parking was free and secure.  Hotel was clean, beds were comfortable, shower worked good and they had a nice hot breakfast in the morning.  BUT the walls and towels are thin  (Motel 6 kind of thin).Well...several things made this hotel not so comfortable:1) If you are facing the street, maybe you noticed Harry's bar and restaurant, which turns into a night club at on the weekends, with lines out the door at midnight and beyond, and booming bass-y music that can be heard even in our 10th floor room. I awoke several times during the night hearing the latest jams blasted from our next door neighbors. 2) There were college-aged women going in and out of the hotel lobby in miniskirts around midnight when we arrived, presumably taking a break from the club next door, but doesn't positively add to the ambiance of the hotel check-in area. 3) There was a security guard patrolling the hallway who perched right next to our room door. I guess it's meant to make you feel safer, but somehow this did not provide a peace of mind, and certainly not a lot of privacy.How could you not give this hotel 5 stars? Free beer/wine/soda &amp; snacks like nachos and popcorn during happy hour???? Awesome.If your headed to St. Louis for baseball or football, this definitely was the more affordable way to stay in comfort, giving you the ability to walk or cab it to the stadium.We had a very clean room, a great bed, and a nice view of St. Louis the entire visit.The employee's all showed great enthusiasm in trying to assist with anything needed, and offered nice suggestions for dinner/desert choices.We had completely FREE parking the entire stay for 2 cars with a gated parking structure. Not having to pay for parking is always an added bonus!The pool was small, but still added that little bit of extra enjoyment. The hot tub could have been a little hotter....and by no the fault of the hotel, was completely packed with 5 and 6 year olds....What the heck parents!!!!!The soda fountain station is only ON during limited hours...but it's free soda, so I'm not complaining.Breakfast was GGGGGGGGRRREAT!Large spread of eggs, sausage, waffles, biscuits/gravy, bacon, toast, muffins, yogurt, fruit.....One of the better hotel breakfast's I've seen offered. Over all a great hotel. If...I mean when I head back to St. Louis I'll definitely be staying at the hotel again. 5 stars!!!!!!!My choices were the Double Tree or the Pear Tree Union Station.  My first time in Saint Louis (I'm from Alaska), I chose the hotel where I could walk a little outside but was still close to the conference.  With their free wi-if, free drinks in the evening, popcorn after the drinks, and free breakfast I am 100% sure I made the right choice.  (I'm talking full hot breakfast here!) Right at this moment, I am sitting in the lobby while families play cribbage, military guys cheer on the Cards, and the smell of popcorn wafts throughout the lobb, as I drink my free glass of winey.  The staff has been stellar, I travel all over the country and this staff at this hotel has, BY FAR, outshined the places I've stayed in the last couple months:  Portland, Seattle, Anchorage, DC.  They're friendly, helpful, always smiling, and ready to help.  And don't get me started on the view.  We are right next to a community garden, with full view of the downtown and Saint Louis Arch.  This may not be too important, but for me, the garden has been my place of refuge.  I am in love with this hotel!  If I ever make it back to STL, this will definitely be the place I stay.  Thank you Pear Tree, I appreciate it.  (PS, the room is not too shabby, clean, fridge and microwave, king size bed, lots of space!)First off let me start by saying that overall this hotel is fairly nice at first glance.  However, once I made it to my room I noticed the bathtub was dirty while  the room appeared like it hadn't been dusted in weeks!!  Also I was put in a room with double twin beds when I asked for a single king.    Then I find out that you are charged 18 dollars in taxes per day!!!  I've never been charged like that before to my knowledge.   The Drurys have outstanding hotels throughout the U.S.   This one however left a lot to be desired.Very nice and helpful staff! Indoor pool with hot tube was very clean.  Free hot breakfast that was nice from 6:30 to 9:30.  Also free parking.   Rooms were dated but clean.  One person who stood out was Cathy who seemed to be everywhere.  Working the front desk one evening and then the buffet the next morning with a nice smile and great attitude! She was friendly and easy to talk to.   Will be back Thanks!When booking a hotel in a city you've never been too sometimes a lack of pictures or an accurate review can leave you &amp; the family wishing you booked another hotel or even worse, wish you could just live in the minivan for a week. Pear Tree Inn by Drury has positive reviews &amp; for good reasons.  The staff was at the top of their game.  From the lady at the front desk who spent all of two minutes to check us in &amp; give us our key, to Reggie who worked the bar &amp; kept the snack area filled.  The rooms were clean, the bathroom was clean and the pool &amp; surrounding areas were well kept.  No matter what time of day the cleaning crew were sweeping up the community dinning area where they had a free breakfast buffet every morning &amp; free snacks and pop from 6 until 10.  One thing I thought was cool is adults receive 3 free beer or wine tickets each day from 6-830.  This helped keep costs down when going out to dinner.  I've never stayed at a hotel that offers free fountain pop &amp; snacks for the kids every night and created a feeling like we were at home, they even had a cart full of board games.  Laundry services were an area that could use some attention, 2 washers &amp; four dryers.  The dryers didn't work that well &amp; we had to use extra quarters to dry them twice.  This hotel is showing its age but what this hotel lacks in curb appeal it makes up with hospitality &amp; convenience.  My only complaint was the private parking garage.  It was very narrow, lots of giant pillars, full on weekends &amp; if you see oil spots on the ground, the odds are you'll have a giant rainbow stain on your hood in the morning.  The hotel is located in the middle of everything we wanted to do, minutes from downtown and not to far from the Hill and other parts of the city.  If you don't feel like going out they have a nice bar &amp; restaurant (Sybergs) located next to the pool.  The cost to stay here is hard to beat!  Throw in the free morning buffet, beers, pops &amp; snacks and a stay at this hotel is a no brainer.  I wish they had more hotels in the cities I plan to visit because they have an awesome award program that rewards with you with several free nights.  I enjoyed my stay &amp; if I was to return to St. Louis a stay here would be probable.Great hotel.  The hotel staff was very friendly.  Front desk awesome.   Great at giving directions.  I can see what others had said about kids,  but I had 3 older kids of my own, so the younger ones didn't bother me. Loved the wine in the evening.  That may have been my favorite part.  After days of traveling it was nice to sit and enjoy some wine.  Pool and hot tub were very clean!!  Breakfast was good.  I had to take one star off because as I was down at breakfast house keeping came in to clean my room and and taken my purse and belongings to the front desk.  Not cool to touch my stuff when I had not checked out.best sleep i have ever had not at home, wifi was good shower was good parking was ok but what was great was i was able to talk to allot of what i need to do hereWe stayed here over the Memorial Day Weekend and had some pretty high expectations for the $163 a night price tag. Our expectations plummeted at check in. The gentleman at the front desk swiped our credit card multiple times, causing it to eventually decline. He had somehow missed that it had been accepted prior to declining. We were rather confused when he said our credit card had declined and ended up using much of our vacation cash to pay for the room. We spent nearly a half an hour on the phone with out bank, which confirmed that the card had been run several times and had processed. We went back in and talked to the front desk staff, who continued to insisted it had never processed. Finally the front desk manager said he would call his IT department and look into it. Some time later called us and said that we were correct and he would give our cash back, making the comment that ""we are only as good as our computers"". When he did meet us, during dinner at the on site restaurant (Sybergs), to return our cash, he continued to make light of the event. After a very long day of driving, the last thing I expected was to be embarrassed at check with an unexpected credit card decline and the ensuing stress of ""figuring it out"" and then trying to convince them to take a closer look at the transaction. There was no offer to make up for the stress/anxiety that they had caused. As far as the amenities:Parking was free. It was a small parking garage just behind the hotel. If you are not unloading/loading your luggage at the drive up overhang, it will be a pain to walk through the garage with your luggage. Rooms were clean and average. In our room, their was no vanity/sink outside the bathroom (it was in the bathroom, like at home). Hair dryer, shower gel, shampoo, conditioner provided. No plastic laundry bag. Towels were some of the thinnest I have seen at a hotel. Beds were comfy. The view wasn't spectacular, but it was better than the backside of a parking lot. I liked that the windows were tinted, so you could keep the windows open and without being seen from the outside.Manager's reception was sparse...pretzels, tortilla chips and salsa along with your drink card, good for three drinks within the time frame. Choices: Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Zinfandel and Budweiser (maybe it Bud Lite, I can't remember). I had Merlot for two drinks, but they ran out of it and I had the Cabernet for my last drink. Both were okay. Watching other people, I learned that they did not let you get your drink and someone else's, nor could you use someone else's card after exhausting yours, each person had to redeem their own card. The pool are was nice enough and our 10 year old niece had a blast swimming in the three feet/four feet and five feet sections. We had hoped to get in the whirlpool, but it had been overtaken by a group of kids splashing around in it and running out other users. Pool towels were provided.The morning breakfast was great. Scrambled eggs, sausage patties, biscuits, gravy, bagels, toast, muffins, doughnuts, waffle station (in a separate room just to the side of the breakfast area), grits packets, oatmeal packet, hot chocolate packet, bananas, oranges, coffee, soda and juice. The morning dining room staff (Pearline, I think) was super; genuinely sweet.The only drawback to breakfast is that the dining room tables are tiny.All in all there were some great things (breakfast and free parking) and some average things (the room) and some disappointing things (whirlpool, manager reception snacks). For the price, there should have been much more great things. *Our check in experience took this review from a 3 star review to 2. Mistakes happen, but to dismiss us, then make light of it when we are right and blame ""the computer"" wasn't the proper response. Especially without offering to make up for it in any way.Not at all what I was expecting based on website and some of the reviews. Poor customer service, the assistant during check-in was not friendly and I had the feeling he was quite put off by working. The lobby is in major need of renovations. The website said there was a business center, great breakfast, drinks, pool.. All if these things were in one small area. When I went to get the drinks I had assumed it would be a bar. Instead it was like a cafeteria with people eating KFC at the table next to us, children running around screaming, scantily clad individuals walking through to the pool. I was just very shocked at the reality of the place. However the rooms are quite nice, parking is free. It's a decent location but you could spend the same amount on a better hotel located just as nicely and likely to have similar amenities.Ok the staff gets the 3 stars, the hotel, MAYBE two. Dig the location, dig the sports bar being attached with shuttle to the Cards game. Breakfast is no better than and Comfort INN, the refreshments at night were ho hum, and the beer flat. The Rooms were nice, you get a view of the dog kennel or the bar across the street. Got to point out the soap dispensers, keep in mind this is a DRURY hotel and they have soap dispensers, EW. Loved the dispenser that was dripping onto the shower handle, good times. All in the name of going green, no they are not, they are cutting corners. The towels, I highly suggest you bring your own, they are well worn and not sure if they ever saw a dryer! Better towels at resale shops. I did email Drury Inn and of course they are sorry and of course they will speak with the manager. Place is going down hill.I stayed in this hotel a few weeks ago as part of a wedding.  I saw the reviews and didn't expect much, but this place could use some updating.The staff were really friendly throughout our stay, but our room was kinda scummy.  On the second day we realized the ceiling of our bathroom leaked every time the person above us took a shower.  We notified the front desk, who sent someone from maintenance to look at it.  Nothing was done about it, but he did come to look.  This was clearly not a new leak, as the ceiling was bowing.On the plus side, the free breakfast is actually halfway decent.  The scrambled eggs and the biscuits were good.I probably would have given the hotel 3 stars if I hadn't been hit with gross ceiling water while trying to pee.  I wouldn't stay here again.","We came to St Louis for a family vacation. We stayed here through a priceline deal and we were not disappointed. Clean comfortable rooms, an evening beverage reception and a friendly staff. One of the big bonuses to this hotel is how close it is to everything! Union station is a block away. Gateway arch a mile and a half and so on. Free parking, central location and lots more. By tues night we couldn't park in the covered parking but the weather was good so that was ok.I stayed here for business, so I didn't make the reservation and don't know how much the rooms cost.  However, I would not pay 3-digits for a room here.  Reasons:1.  There are lots of high school/college age students hanging around, in their party buses, being loud.  I was awakened several times past midnight.  As a result of all that partying, there were broken alcohol bottles in the parking lot that I drove over with my car the next morning.2.  The building is dated.  Another guest and I were temporarily trapped in an elevator when the door failed to open and then the lighted buttons all went dark.  Fortunately, we were able to get off on another floor and hop into a different elevator.Andy Samberg as Mark Wahlberg:""Hey partridge! How's it hanging? Where's your pear tree!? ... Oh! There it is.""A reasonably short walk from the expansive Union Station, though it could be a bit troublesome if you don't pack light!Best complimentary breakfast spread I've seen: scrambled eggs, sausage patties, biscuits and gravy (see photo)... Belgian waffles, muffins, mini donuts and fresh fruit.  Nice, even if I suspected the eggs were those ""egg beaters"" you pour from a box.  Plenty of seating (and a TV), with side rooms for overflow.The furnished lobby has two PCs (with internet of course), plus couches around a big TV.The booking page lets you choose between ""King Bed"" and ""Two Beds"".  The ""Two Beds"" are double beds (a.k.a. full-size, 75"" x 54"")... not a lot of space if they're to be shared.  The room did include a big lounge chair with ottoman and the usual amenities (TV, dresser, nightstand, desk, chair, hair dryer).There's a heater in the room, controlled by a thermostat.  This was turning on and off (noisily) throughout the winter night.  Should have looked into disabling this.Housecleaning did a really good job, though there was no service on New Year's Eve*.  The breakfast staff was great too, and the front desk service was fine.  A good experience overall.*:  NYE, hotel residents were issued wristbands, and there was extra lobby security to keep... unsavory characters and sketchy guests out.There's an adjoining sports-bar-type restaurant that stays open until 10 or 11.  The hotel's popcorn machine and soda/juice dispenser are also available until about that time.  There were cookies too.  Yum.Good times in the STL!3.5 starsAgree with previous reviews that this hotel offers a lot of amenities with the downside of being somewhat run down at least from the outside and traditional in the decor. Arrived early and they let me checkin early without any problems which was a major plus.The cost is reasonable and the lobby area is quite nice for lounging and offers a nice flat screen TV as well as computers for use. Free wifi. Mini-fridge in room. Bathrooms are a little outdated but clean. Breakfast is by far one of the most varied of all hotels I've been to. Juices, coffee, Sausage, scrambled eggs, biscuits and gravy, donuts, apples, muffins, cereal, waffles etc. Definitely a filling breakfast worthy of keeping you full until lunch time.Parking garage is covered with a code key. There's a restaurant/bar attached to the hotel which I did not try.We stayed here from August 12-15th, and what a great stay it was!  The hotel was clean and orderly, our room was nice, and the staff was excellent.  Our first night we arrived during happy hour and after 4 hours on the road were more than ready to take advantage of the 3 free drinks a piece.  The bartender informed me that we could get larges, which counted as two drinks, and saved us from having to keep getting up to refill our glasses. :)Our three daughters don't drink pop, which is what is offered for those that don't drink wine or beer, and the manager, James, was so kind and accommodating.  He got three glasses of milk for them, and the next day, when we came down for happy hour he had their milk ready and waiting for them.  What service!   If there is an award given for great service, he should definitely be getting one.  The free breakfast in the morning was great, the kids loved the waffle makers, and Nelson did a great job, along with the rest of the staff.  Whatever method they use to hire or train their employees, they are doing a great job! Everyone seemed to go above and beyond.We were able to use the pool a few times, and every time we went it was clean and orderly and well stocked with towels.  The front desk people were always friendly and efficient, especially Nicole.  She has such a great voice and demeanor, and was able to multitask without making any customers feel like they were getting anything less than the best service.  This was my first stay in a Drury Hotel, and it will not be my last.  I highly recommend it to anyone traveling to the St. Louis area.When I fly to my old hometown, this is generally my base of operations.  Always helpful, the only complaints I have is when they have large groups of high school kids staying there.  One time they started rehabbing the room next to mine at six am, but the made it better by knocking a day off my bill.  Last time I was here in September,  I finally tried out the resturant, Sybergs, that is also on site and found it was pretty good.  In all its a decent place to crash.Great hotel. Excellent prices w complimentary pop, popcorn, and breakfast. Free parking and nice pool to top it off. My family stayed here 2 nights and the staff was very friendly. My parents had an issue w their ac in their room which Darren promptly fixed. He had a great attitude and upbeat personality. Jason one of the managers was also great.  These two gentlemen made our stay even better by their excellent customer service. We will be back!This hotel was an absolute nightmare.  We had been traveling across the country with and decided to stop in St Louis.  This seemed like a good deal with the military rate.  I am 8 months pregnant and we have a 2 yr old.  When we walked in there seemed to be an AC issue.  It just didn't feel cool.  It was completely packed with families running around.  We were so tired that we just wanted to get our stuff to the our room and go get something to eat quick.  Once we got to our room it was HOT!!  Clearly the AC wasn't working.  We turned it way down and just hoped that our room would be cool by the time we returned.  We went to the hotel restaurant and it had a very foul smell.  Something just wasn't right.  We decided to get back in the car and go grab something else.  There is nothing in this area for food.  We ended up doing carry out from the Hard Rock Cafe down the street.  It was just as run down and smelly.  We finally got back to our room and it was still HOT!!!  (80 degrees).  We called the front desk and maintenance came up and had to reset our AC.  It finally got cooler, but then it never shut off the entire night on the auto setting!!  It was so loud and uncomfortable.  We ended up going to bed after midnight and waking up at 4am.  We just wanted out of there!  To top it all off as we were leaving our room only one elevator was running and it wouldn't stop at our floor!!  We had to carry all of our stuff, 2 yr old and my pregnant self down 10 flights of stairs!!  It was horrible.  I'm only giving this hotel one star because of the staff was extremely nice.  I felt sorry for them that they have to work in such a shitty building.  We couldn't wait to get out of St. Louis!I picked this hotel based on cost, but knowing what I know now I would have gladly spent more money and stayed elsewhere.I received the poorest customer service EVER at the front desk.  Leslie tried to send me to the other Drury down the street AND the MARRIOTT. Wow. Room was clean and I was left extra towels after I left a little note in the room.Breakfast was decent and almost compensated for the other issues since I could grab breakfast before my 2 days of meetings.I made an emergency trip to St Louis as a result of a family member being transported 5 hrs to Barnes Jewish hospital.  I did not know the extent of my stay and it ended up being 2 weeks from Mar 18-Apr 1, 2014. Unfortunately, this was during the College basketball tourney and spring break.  The hotel staff knew our situation and found accommodations for us even thou every room was booked-they allowed us to all as a group stay in an executive room with cots-this saved us traveling an hour away to find a hotel.  Additionally, they gave us a better rate since we had someone in the hospital.  Despite all the additional people, the staff was extremely helpful and nicer than any people I have ever met.  The beds were very comfortable, staff was Amazing-Nelson Bay, Jason Medina, Nicole, Bryianna, Reggie, Rocky, Earline just to name a few we encountered daily and were generally concerned for our well being.  Our rooms (which we moved several times) were all neat and clean. The free breakfast was a nice treat and the snacks in the evening-a welcome pleasure to a long and stressful day.  We also enjoyed not having to leave to enjoy a meal so we ate at the Sybergs restaurant every night and they would fix us anything we needed.  Many blessings to the staff.  We will come back again on a more pleasurable trip next time.I had to go back here.  It was not my choice, it was for business.  Here's the deal.  The staff here is so nice and awesome, I hate writing a bad review.. I really do.  BUT, if I were coming here on vacation, I'd want to know.  This time I stayed on the 13 floor, I was as far away from the elevator as you could get.  No big deal.  The big deal was this: I had to pass by a room that stunk soooo bad it literally made me sick.  I don't know what the hell went on in there, but it was nasty.  There are also a couple of full time residents that are just plain creepy.  Christopher Walken and Old Facebook Dude.This time I stayed away from the eggs and didn't find the place as depressing.  Apparently something about freeze dried soggy eggs depresses me..??So I just arrived in MO after a 5 hour drive from KY. I get to my hotel. The room is fabulously comfy and CLEAN!!! Three pillows per bed AND they're soft just the way I like 'em. At check-in, I received a drink card. That's right people. Each guest 21+ gets 3 free drinks (beer &amp; wine) each night of their stay. They also offer free hot breakfast every morning. The hotel staff are pleasantly polite. I recommend PTI by Drury to anyone : )We Stayed at Pear Tree inn at Union station, The people that work there are the kindest people, So Helpful and Careing,  Reggie , Nicole, ARE THE GREATest! even the Girls with housekeeping very sweet people!We found the Pear Tree Inn In a booklet at the hospital! My Brother was in Barns Jewish,Between the website and <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>, it was difficult to tell whether the rooms available were smoking or non-smoking.  The truth is that they are non-smoking rooms that use to be smoking.  Don't let it fool you depending on where you look.  The continental breakfast was rather good and definitely made it worth it.  The location is only about a mile from downtown, so if you want to be walking distance to the arch or to any of the stadiums, this may not be hotel for you.My first time to St Louis and I was quite pleased with the Pear Tree Inn. They were very helpful with me when I asked a million questions about places in the area. They also have a happy hour and give you 2 free drinks during it. Also there is free breakfast that is actually pretty good and has a variety of food to choose from. I thought my room was clean and they have free wireless.The hotel is nice, and I got a great deal through priceline. Parking is free, which is a nice bonus. The room was very quiet.On our last night in St. Louis, we decided to stay downtown instead of with the friend we had been visiting. We did a bit of research, and the Pear Tree Inn near Union Station seemed to have some of the best reviews for the money. ($114 a night after taxes).PROS:-EXTREMELY friendly &amp; helpful staff. From the time we checked in, until the time we checked out, every single person on the staff that I came across was extremely friendly. And not that fake ""this is my job, so I'll smile and act happy"" friendly. Genuinely friendly people. Always a bonus! Our room had a bit of a problem with the toilet...it kept running for about 15 mins after flushed. I called down to the front desk, and they had us into a new room within 5 minutes!-Free wine/beer and snacks. We didn't have to get anything out of the vending machine to munch on in the evening hours. There was chips &amp; salsa, Pretzels, and Movie Theatre Style Popcorn, along with about 5 varieties of wine to choose from.-Continental Breakfast. WARM and very tasty food. Eggs, sausage, biscuits &amp; gravy, juice, cereal, donuts, &amp; muffins. It was all good, and we were able to grab a couple of muffins for our drive home. -Visually appealing. From the breakfast area, to the rooms, it was beautifully decorated &amp; furnished. -Fantastically fluffy pillows!-FREE PARKING.-Random...but the shower head was amazing. CONS:-The beds were a bit firm for my liking. My husband slept great, but I woke up with a sore back.-The hotel is downtown on Market street, but pretty far down. To get to the Arch, or downtown to visit the courthouses or Union Station, it would be a bit of a hike.-We were awoken at 7am by construction workers. Although I spoke to the front desk, and they gave us a free stay, even though the construction workers were actually renovating next door, thus they had no control over them. Overall, it was a great hotel for the money, and we would definitely stay there again if we visit St. Louis!By far excellent value. We were in town for a couple of days, and this place was great! Free Parking, Free Wi-Fi, and they have a small business area if you need it.  Continental breakfast was great. They really had a nice spread of fruit, cereal, eggs, biscuits and gravy, sausage patties, waffle station. Juice, Milk, Coffee. Pretty much something for everyone.  There is a pool, a bar/restaurant which we didn't  check out but the pool looked clean and was a pretty happening spot. They also have Happy hour and free popcorn and pop in the lobby. Our room was very comfortable and clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. You are within in walking distance to the Arch (maybe 20-30 minutes) and Union Station is just about a block or two away, there is a bus route that will take you directly to there as well. We wanted to just leave our car parked in their fairly secure garage (they give you a code to get in and out) and then walk and sight see as much as we could.  Overall we were very pleased with our stay here.I am normally a huge fan of the Drury Inns, but didn't have the best experience at this one.  Made reservations for the wrong weekend and didn't realize it until we showed up a week early.  The man at the front desk did try to help us find a room at another Drury but it was further out from downtown that we wanted it to be.  We then told the front desk to please cancel our reservations for the next weekend since we would not be in town.  The next week, the charge came off our credit card.  When I called to have the charges reversed, I was put on hold for about 5 minutes, then taken off hold (as if the receiver was just laying there) and had to listen to a 15 minute conversation with the front desk and a guest about beauty supply stores.  I called back and was transferred to the front desk again.  The lady I spoke with the 2nd time said she would reverse the charges but would have to call me back.  They did reverse the charges but they shouldn't have been charged to begin with.This place is probably one of the greatest values for your money.  I stayed at the Pear Tree Inn just this past weekend (2/6-2/7).  I believe I paid $70 for my room.  The staff was super friendly.  The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable.  What makes this one of the best values for your money is they have a happy hour at night and you get three free drinks.  Also they have this outstanding breakfast buffet in the morning which is all complimentary.  Not to mention you can make free phone calls.  What hotel does that.  Well I am staying here for sure on my next visit down to St. Louis.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-ignacio-saint-louis,Hotel Ignacio,4.0,$$,31,"We used Hotel Ignacio for our room block, and I also used their conference space while getting ready on my wedding day. They turned this space into the perfect room! They brought in couches, tables, chairs, etc. and made sure we had everything we needed. We could fit so many people in this room and were also able to order food (and mimosas!) from Triumph Grill--the restaurant connects to the hotel. If you're getting married in the city, I would strongly recommend Hotel Ignacio!If you know me, you know how much of a pain in the ass I am and how much I hate to travel. Hate it. I hate hotels, even good ones. I never feel like I can truly relax. That's why my praise of the Hotel Ignacio is so strong. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did.The Hotel Ignacio was right around the corner from an event I absolutely had to attend, so the location really worked for me. There isn't a lot of hustle and bustle in this neighborhood, though several decent restaurants and theaters are in walking distance. If you want a true downtown feel, this might not be the place for you.I am a person who places a high value on silence. This can make it hard for me to relax in even a super-nice chain hotel. But I've never experienced a hotel as quiet as this one.The staff was wonderful. Never too busy to greet guests, but never too chatty either. The night counter person was witty and gracious. The decor was charming. I appreciate the attention to details, like the original art on the walls, the bedding, the nice (but not over-the-top) bath products, and the memory foam mattresses.Lovely boutique hotel, friendly staff, convenient to major roadways and to the famous Pappy's barbeque -- but not much else (of interest) walkable nearby, just FYI. It is a quick and easy drive east to downtown, or west to the Forest Park/Delmar Loop area.We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Ignacio, which offered free wifi, inexpensive parking with in-and-out-privileges, and a decent cafe/restaurant attached. The rooms were modern and stylish, clean and comfortable. Gorgeous materials (like the tiles and light fixtures) with quirky touches of personality. Definitely pleased my sense of aesthetics and impressed me with the attention to details. The Tempurpedic beds were quite good, but I would have appreciated a flat pillow in addition to all the poofy down ones. I loved the shower head (but not everyone will) as well as the Philosophy bathroom products. Free water and coffee by the elevators was a nice touch -- helped us stay alert and keep hydrated over the busy holiday weekend.I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, but I do think you get a different impression of St. Louis than you would if you stayed downtown. Hotel Ignacio is in a quiet neighborhood in a corner of St. Louis University, so you're not seeing any city bustle. Nor the Arch. But on the plus side, we weren't assaulted by July 4th fireworks all weekend. Also the area might be different when school is in session.Tip: Hotel Ignacio sits right at the place where Olive St. and Lindell Ave. fork. Both cars in our party did not see the driveway, went right past, and had to turn around (and I was even using GPS!). The sign for Cafe Pinxtos is easier to see than the sign for the hotel itself.Went to a concert at The Pageant and found this cute little hotel on SLU campus. While the hotel only has about 50 rooms the experience is like staying in an art museum. The beds are the BEST! We felt like we were in a city condo. Very inexpensive and the staff is well informed about city recommendations.I have never written a yelp review but because this place was so poorly staffed and poorly ran, I am sharing this in order that it might help other people from the same experience--or even better--that it might give a clue to this hotel to make some major improvements. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone or waste my money here if you understand quality and expect it at a certain price.. I wish I would have paid the extra 100 to stay at the Westin where at least they understand what it means to be in the hospitality industry, even if their decor is more traditional.Amazing! Beautiful beautiful rooms with such a modern flair. This is the most I've spent on a hotel room but it was well worth it. The sheets are the softest I've ever been on in the memory foam mattress was great! There is a motorcycle museum within The hotel that was staffed with knowledgeable people. We didn't have a chance to try the restaurant but it was really cool looking. Everything is visually stimulating and the art is incredible.Beautiful decor in a fantastically fun hotel providing the alternative to mass cattle hotels.  Close distance to great coffee shops, local cuisine, the brewery, the Zoo, and shares space with a motorcycle store ... thank you.Not feature rich, but a wonderful hotel when going to or driving through St. Louis.Rooms are very modern, minimalist, and hi tech. The beds were Tempurpedic, that was a treat.  Everyone we met was cordial and helpful, just like it should be in a boutique hotel.  Wireless is strong, free, and consistent.  Shower stall is on large side, with rain style shower head.  Parking is self serve, we got the 12$ rate comped for our group.  Nice breakfast in the lobby, but service was slow as the kitchen is next door in the pub.  Pub is nice, and busy.  We'd return.Four stars, but someday they'll be five stars, double their rates, and will outprice me. Until then though, I'll keep going back because this place really is a stand-out in St. Louis and many other cities I've been to. Hotel Ignacio is a boutique hotel that offers a contemporary decor in a decades old brick building. Super modern in-room communication systems connect you with the hotel staff, local weather, restaurants, and more via a digital display like a small computer monitor.Flat screen tvs are ""hidden"" in picture frames on the wall, making them apparent only if you want them to be, if your not a tv watcher, they pretty much seem invisible.The memory foam beds are amazing, enormous tile showers with ceiling ""rain"" fixtures are thoughtful and swanky, the lobby his/her bathroom is fantastic (don't worry, it still offers all the privacy you'll need - only the wash area is shared.), the lobby lounge area reminds me of the W in Chicago, and the hotel restaurant and bar is really a restaurant of it's own. All this for a price in the low $100's but I have to believe this will go up as they build a fan base. Go now while you can get a boutique hotel experience for the price of a Courtyard by Marriott.The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly, not an overall bad experience so i'll list why I'm deducting stars. Not a hotel i would have picked but we were staying with a wedding party and it was within walking distance of the church. It's one of my pet-peeves to go places that don't have attached parking lots. This place has a lot across the street. Luckily it's not a very busy street, but you do have to pay to park there. I know a lot of hotels do this, but it still irritates me. Next there was a strong rotten fish smell right by the entrance. Not sure what was causing it, but it would deter me from eating at the sushi restaurant in the hotel. Next, this place is CREEPY. Walking down the hall alone is unnerving and the fitness center is dark with red uplighting. Not very inviting. It wasn't just me. Two other people in our party got the same impression. The building is not well sound-proofed. You can hear people talking and toilets in other rooms flushing. The bed was ok and the pillows were actually very nice. My biggest annoyance was the thermostat. I have to be cold to sleep. The thermostat will not go below 68. This seems reasonable except it feels hotter than that. I had to sleep with the blankets off and i was still very hot. So hot that it actually woke me up in the middle of the night and i couldn't go back to sleep. Next con is check out is 11 and check in isn't until 4. Both slightly inconvenient for us. Overall I've stayed in nicer hotels in the same area that weren't as expensive. And we didn't eat breakfast, but i don't remember seeing anywhere that breakfast was provided as most places generally do.It looks nice and cosy, but the service and staff are awful. Don't expect a smooth relaxing stay at this place. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.Checked into this hotel on a whim and it's an interesting and different type of hotel I normally stay in. Would categorize as a hip type of hotel. Room was nice, bed was a foam mattress and I slept like a rock. Bathroom was large with walk in shower and shower head above you. Was very comfortable in the room. Prob not a place to bring your kids. Negatives were the coffee was cold in the morning, I don't think you get free breakfast, and it took me 20 minutes to check in at midnight. May or may not stay here again.  Trendy type of place for younger adult crowd.The overnight service at this hotel was extraordinarily rude and unprofessional.  There was no phone in the room and the computer device that was supposed to act as a phone and room service menu was broken so I called the front desk on my cell phone to ask for the room service menu.  The night clerk told me the only way to get breakfast was to come downstairs at 7am. I asked if he could bring me a room service menu.  Instead of saying sorry, or I can bring one up right now, he simply hung up on me. I then called back and he screamed and then hung up. I have never been treated this way. I will never return to this hotel.Loved this hotel! We stayed here for a friend's wedding for 1 night in March. The hotel has a very resort-like modern feel. The temper-pedic bed and pillows were AMAZING and the lighting was fun and dimmed usefully. They had tablets in each room for room service, checkout, weather info, and more. I would definitely stay here again!I'd gone to St. Louis to visit with a friend who's daughter was appearing in BIlly Elliot at the Fox theatre and tried to find a hotel close by.  In searching online, the closest place was Hotel Ignacio.  At first they were booked but I tried back and was able to get a room.  Boy am I glad a room opened up.  This place is fantastic!  It's very artsy as it's in the arts district but what's even better is that it's not snooty.  All of the staff that we encountered were super nice and courteous.   The room that we had was very tastefully furnished, up to date and high end.  If I'm ever in St Louis again, I'll only stay at Hotel Ignacio.I loved the very large rooms with great art work above each bed and throughout the halls and lobby.  I am handicapped and front desk staff personally assisted me with my luggage and politely refused my over tipping.  I enjoyed my hotel stay even more than the Book of Mormon play I saw during my visit to St Louis.A nice boutique hotel with high quality amenities and art you might even hang in your own home! The wedding we were attending had essentially taken over the entire hotel for the weekend (40 of 48 rooms!) , so we shared with my boyfriend's twin brother and girlfriend. Our room was perfectly suitable for 4 people - two comfortable tempurpedic beds, enough space for luggage, plenty of towels in the bathroom. And while the bathroom itself was quite enjoyable with a rainfall shower head and good bath products, I have to talk about the door. The door, you say? Yes. The door. While It fits with the modern feel of the hotel, but having a slide door for the loo is probably the worst idea ever. No sound insulation, a smallish gap between the door and the wall, Hotel Ignacio was trying to bring this group waaaay closer than we ever intended. We resorted to the very un-green method of turning on the shower for a little #2 privacy. All in all, a good place to stay while in STL, but maybe we think about adding earplugs to your suitcase - unless you and your partner are into each others fart sounds. No judgments.What a find!  Staying here while interviewing at SLU for a job.  Looks like a quiet little on campus spot that would be great to stay at if you are seeing a show at the Fox (just around the corner).  The whole place is a refurbished older building with lots of character updated to a modern style.  I really loved the decor and use of the old character pieces like the exposed brick.  My room was lovely, looked brand new.  Very clean.  Minor complaints:  the shower is a rainshower head, looks very pretty, kind of not the best water pressure.  I survived though.  the room is not huge.  It was perfectly fine for just me.  Might be tight for more than one or two people. Philosophy bath products, very nice.  some sort of super tech phone system in the room that had my name on it.  I left that baby alone before I accidentally broke it!  :)Parking is just across the street behind the hotel in a lot held for guests, worked fine, about $9 a night.  Desk staff very welcoming and easy to talk to.  Free internet!  connect to the slu system.  Love that.I recently attended a concert at the Chaifetz Arena on the campus of St. Louis University. Having no knowledge of the area, I googled mapped the closes hotel to the arena. I wanted something within walking distance so I wouldn't have to rent a car. Hotel Ignacio was the closest, and at reasonable $169 (for a boutique hotel), I booked it immediately.Check-in is at 4:00 p.m., but my flight was to land in St. Louis at 10:30 a.m., so I called ahead to see if early check-in was a possibility. The front desk agent was very friendly, and assured me it would be no problem. Sure enough, when I arrived the day of check-in at 11:30 a.m., my room was ready.The hotel is beautiful. Very modern, with great art and stylish furnishings. My room was spacious, and I was happy that my particular room was decorated with paintings of guitars and other music-themed pieces. Very rock n roll. :)The room was spotless. Nice, large flat screen television on the wall. Super modern iPad-type phone system with hotel and area information. Philosophy bath products!!!I ordered room service for breakfast the morning I departed. The food was great (and surprisingly reasonably priced) and service was fast. Check-out was a breeze.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough if you are looking to stay in downtown St. Louis. I wish there were more across the country!Beautiful and unique, excellent value for the price, but glitches:  poor soundproofing meant loud neighbors had us awake, took a loooong time for the front desk to answer the phone let alone quiet the party; coffee maker didn't work ; really dirty air filter in a cabinet that fell open when passed.  I wanted to love it! But I liked it a lot and will try again.","Great rooms and I love the lobby bathroom.  I mean its so serene like sitting in a victorian era cave while a baby deer laps guava nectar from your shoulder blades.  I withhold my constitution and then fortnightly I visit these green pastures and unleash my ""harvest"".  Nothing compares to my six hour otherworldy adventure in the annals of the hotel lobby where sweet vessels of relief venture up from my bowels to my spine and break like sweet waves in the form of goosebumps on my jawline.  Great customer service too!   Would reccomend!WOW!  This hotel is amazing.  Olive Street used to be a spotty locale.  But its become much more uppity in the past couple of years and that's a good thing.  Located right across the street from SLU, Hotel Ignacio is an amazing boutique hotel.  It's trendy and has a ton of character for being a new place.  I got a suite with a shower that had 5 shower heads...I felt like I was in a car wash, and my bathroom had a tv in its mirror.  Plus the living room had a mirror that alas is an LED TV too.  AND, its pretty cool to throw on a swank fireplace with a flip of a remote.  Oh and my bedroom has automatic shades, a 42"" LED TV and a temperpedic bed.This hotel gets it right.  At breakfast, they have Kindles you can borrow with the news on it.  And the lounge/attached restaurant are pretty trendy.  Plus you can go work out at SLU for free.I'd definitely go back.What an incredible experience we had here. All of the previous reviews are correct. The decor is beautiful, the tempurpedic bed is awesome, the rain shower is cool, etc. From the minute we got to the hotel until the moment we departed, it was a great experience. Kate at the front desk was super helpful and friendly. Dmitry took over for her later and was awesome. Kentucky was at the front bar and is the nicest person EVER. We really hit it off with her...she is funny, helpful, and nice. Normally, I like to move around and experience other hotels, restaurants, etc., but I think we found a winner and won't risk staying anywhere else. We highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again when we are in town.In STL for one night for a concert at The Fabulous Fox Theatre. Stayed at Hotel Ignacio because it is walking distance from the venue. Customer service was excellent. Guest services made me feel very welcome and appreciated. However, the room itself was a little disappointing. The carpet was quite stained and the furniture was obviously worn in spots. The chair at the desk still had crumbs in it from the prior guest - so I imagine the room wasn't cleaned well enough. I did like the funky embellishments and artsy decor of the room itself. The bed was very comfortable, however, the bed/box spring did not fit correctly on the bed frame. The bathroom was snazzy, but far too small; and I might be nitpicking, but the toilet paper was the kind you get from the dollar store. There was no mini-fridge or coffee maker in the room. You can request them. I expect more for $200 a night ...and I rightfully should.Amazing staff, cool rooms, great locationOne of the best hotels in the St. Louis Area by far. A bit pricier than most, but it was new, nice and clean. They had Philosophy bath products when I was there not L'Occitane, but I love Philosophy. The beds were Tempurpedic or that style. The room had character and I certain would stay there again.Clean spacious bathrooms, heated flooring, fully stocked FREE mini fridge, artistic, and the staff is helpful and friendly. One word UNIQUE! God BlessWhat an adorable hotel! My stay here was a Vday surprise from J since it is connected to Triumph which happens to be where we met. I was impressed from the moment we walked in with the modern decor, everywhere I turned there was something else cool to look at. I was also very impressed with the rooms, they were simple but very modern. I loved that all of the room service menus, activities, etc were on a tablet instead of having books lying around with the information. They are a pet friendly hotel and that made things a whole lot easier so we did not have to find a pet sitter for the evening. Our dog made himself at home and enjoyed exploring our home for the night. Really my only complaint is that in the middle of the night I woke up and could hear EVERYTHING from the room right above me and the room below me. One of the rooms was having an argument and the other room just the opposite, it made it a little difficult to get back to sleep. Besides the noise, it was definitely a cute, modern place to stay away from home.This was our Hotel for our Wedding which was held at The Sheldon Concert Hall. The location is awesome, the staff is amazing and the Director of Sales, Rachel, that we worked with, was great. They were so accommodating and sweet, all of our guests were impressed with the hotel which represented St. Louis well.Great Boutique Hotel in center of SLU! Checkout the Moto Museum and Moto Europa! And the Triumph Grill all under one roof! Ask for PeteThis place was top of the line.   It had amazing staff very helpful and nice.  It is very trendy and has some awesome decor.   There is a outside fireplace in which we spent some time at.  The price is very affordable, located right next to SLU, When I go back to STL I will Be staying here!",,,,"['used', 'hotel', 'room', 'block', 'also', 'used', 'conference', 'space', 'getting',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-st-louis-at-forest-park-saint-louis,Hampton Inn & Suites St. Louis at Forest Park,4.0,$$,37,"Its hard to imagine a better find than the Hampton Inn at Forest Park. Easy access to the interstates, walking distance to the Zoo and Forest Park, and a short drive from The Hill, downtown, the Loop, and Clayton.My family of 5 slept, ate, played, and opened Christmas gifts comfortably in our queen suite. We were so pleased with the spacious room, our view of the arch from the 6th floor, and the sparkling, comfortable heated pool and hot tub.We didn't try the fitness room or use the business center, but we loved the free internet, parking, coffee, and of course breakfast. The staff were lovely; friendly, professional and accommodating. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we're already looking forward to our stay here next time.We stayed recently during the Thanksgiving holiday.  Due to the early arrival of our grandson, we were guests for 8 nights!  What a great home away from home!  The facility is convenient, clean and well appointed.  Breakfast (complimentary) each day was top notch.  Food bar had a variety for all tastes, and it was kept clean and replenished often.  Coffee available in the spacious lobby 24/7..and cookies and milk in the evening.Rooms are beautiful and spotlessly clean.  Well appointed with toiletries, and plenty of outlets for chargers, etc.  Staff was exceptional!  From our first interaction to the last, we always encountered friendly,  accommodating service.  In fact, since our grandchild arrived during our stay, staff always inquired about us, and even left a card and small gift in our room as congratulations!!Thanks to Cherece, Mary, Brooklyn, Lawrence, and others who I can't name, but definitely remember!This was a perfectly solid mid-range experience -- easy on/off the highway, a clean room of a reasonable size, a nice warm non-""continental"" breakfast (who likes the word continental anymore, since being associated with cold eggs and crappy toast?) -- bacon and fresh eggs were passable. The pool and hot tub were both clean and well-maintained, thus taking the edge off of a long car ride.The staff was very friendly and attentive. We got a wonderful view of the pre-July 4th fireworks from the street just outside of our hotel -- it was nice to see that the staff provided a schedule of events at the park for the holiday weekend, and we were able to plan our trip accordingly. The staff gets another gold star for providing us with a realistic viewpoint on getting good BBQ in STL after noon or so -- that we'd most likely run into no brisket and no ribs, and this was true -- we just moved on to pulled pork and came back the next day for the rest.That said, the sleeping security guard in his car did not inspire any confidence about the safety of my car or the belongings stored therein. Actually, I think the first time we passed he was reading -- but then definitely sleeping. It doesn't look like a bad part of town, more like a business park, but he was a funny fixture on our way in-and-out of the complex.And who doesn't love a swan made out of a hand towel anyway???I expect a good experience when staying at a Hampton Inn and this hotel definitely met my expectations. I was in town with friends for a Cardinals game and since we're all recently out of college and not rolling in the dough, we figured staying a little further away from Busch Stadium instead of right downtown might save us a dollar or two. Hotel was a little bit difficult to find, but the free, gated parking lot in the back was nice. The front desk was extremely helpful - called us a cab when we asked for one and gave us information about the brewery tour. Room was standard - nice and clean and almost seemed brand new. The towel and washcloth in a swan shape in the bathroom was a cute touch. I think the best part of the stay might have been the breakfast - great eggs, sausage, waffles, oatmeal, lots of pastries. Would definitely consider staying here again if I was in St. Louis. Location seemed safe and overall a great and comfortable experience.Had a family emergency in the middle of the night and had to book a room over the phone all the way from Oregon for a family member there in St. Louis. The gentleman I talked to (sorry I forgot your name - Cornelius maybe?) was so kind, helpful, and made the experience so much easier! Thank you for great customer service at 4am! Five stars for Cornelius :)Wow, our room was very spacious since it was handicapped accessible.  Unfortunately, there was no fridge nor microwave.  The parking situation was the same as Home 2 Suites in St. Louis.  There is an automatic gate that opens when you pull up your car.  Others who come early get the ideal parking spot right in front of lobby.  The breakfast was typical fare but had mangos and papaya in their fruit cocktail.  There is both the USA Today and Wall Street Journal so this is perfect for those who need to be still in touch with national news.  We mentioned that we were on honeymoon and the front desk clerk got us gift certificate for restaurant next door and Starbucks gift card.Great staff. They certainly make you fell as though they really want you to feel at home here. Modern clean facility. Comfortable beds. I can't really come up with anything that should be different. We stayed two nights and felt comfortable during our stay. Highly recommendedEasy on and off I 64. Has a nice bar/restaurant next door. The rooms are clean. The fitness center was awful. 1 bike, 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical. The treadmill kept shutting down for errors. They never recognized my diamond status nor even offered a bottle of water. Breakfast was OK. Had a hard time sleeping due to the huge bulky pillows. Does anyone really use pillows that look like sofa cushions? Do I really need 6 on my bed? Only stayed there because the team was staying there. For now it will be back to the Chase Park Plaza or the Hilton at the Ballpark.decent location, not impressive by any means.The rooms are clean, spacious and well decorated. The service is pretty good, but the breakfast was a bit lacking than some of the other locations. Parking is free on the property, and hotel is very close to major freeways.Stayed here a few nights with our young kids. Yes, I am that parent who wipes down surfaces in a hotel room. The room was exceptionally clean and I didn't wipe up a single speck of dust or dirt and I cleaned a majority of all surfaces any 2 year old would touch. The staff was friendly and helpful and very attentive. Loved having a fridge and microwave in room. Pool was clean and heated to a great temperature. Breakfast was fine, coffee was hot, and kids were satisfied. They even had someone walking around passing out coloring books, small balls or bracelets to the kids. The hotel is very close to the zoo. I'm sure you could walk there. We'd stay here again when visiting STL.Great pool for the kids. Small but clean. Breakfast was well stocked. Friendly and helpful staff. Perfect location to walk to the Science Center. Free hot coffee and tea all day long.I have been here off an on for business but mostly on for the past 3 months.  The hotel itself is small and clean.  I am consistently greeted by the professional staff at the front desk each time I walk in the door.  What's more is that they even remember my name and speed through the check in process every week.  I am rather picky when it comes to my room and its location and they always try to accommodate my lists of requirements.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the following experience from last week.  It was my birthday and in conversation it came up with the staff.  When I returned from dinner I was met with a birthday card and gift certificate to a local restaurant at my door.  I was totally blown away at their thoughtfulness.  All I have to say is big props to Marlyn  and the rest of the hardworking staff at this Hampton location!The front desk ladies were not friendly at all. They dont look sincere when they said they are here to make your stay more enjoyable.:::Talking Points:::Hotel/Room-Large-Clean-Comfortable-Large breakfast-Hilton points baybeeeStaff-Friendly-HelpfulLocation-Convenient-Has a crappy ""pub"" attached to it.-Near handfuls of delicious eateries-Walking distance to a BOMB ASS coffee shop (comet coffee)Very clean and quiet Hampton Inn. New building and furnishings.Staff is extremely friendly. Typical hot Hampton Inn breakfast in a large room off the foyer.There is a sports bar adjacent to the building for beverages and meals.I stayed at this location for four days and I can easily say it was not a pleasant experience.  Apparently I was lucky enough to be staying during a time when some huge pee wee hockey event was going on and my room was smack dab in the middle of this group.  Needless to say there were kids running up and down the halls at all hours of the day and night bouncing balls all over the place.  By the time I realized this I was already unpacked and didn't feel like getting my room changed.  I maned up and dealt with it.On top of that the hotel was going through renovations and I have to say the lowest bidder truly won this bid.  My room was newly redone but when it was wired the outlets were never moved so there was cords running everywhere on the floor against the walls.  The charging station on my wall where I plugged my iPhone into was held on by two screws not even using anchors so it fell off the wall when unplugging my phone cable.  The bathroom shower was not working correctly, I needed to turn into the hulk to pull the stopper up to start the shower mode.The biggest kicker was the room where the ice machine used to be.  The wall was totally covered with mold and I ventured in there because I saw a room off to the side and what was in that room?  Our towels!  Nothing like moldy towels to start the day off.  What is even worse two days later I walked by the mold room and noticed that the contractor painted over the obviously water damaged wall instead of replacing the sheetrock.  Insane!!!!I would not stay here again.  Only reason I even put up with the place is that I got a good deal and it would have been too expensive to get another hotel.  The staff was nice at least and the people staying at the hotel was also very friendly.  I do enjoy the mid wast.Side note*  My last day there the fire alarm went off and I had to grab all my stuff and head out of there.  I didn't want to chance not being able to get back in the building and missing my flight.Ok, so this isn't the absolute best in the world, but I think it deserves five starts for its amazing combination of factors.1.  Super nice staff.  Usually I go to hotels, and the front desk staff are perfectly nice, but not really friendly.  The staff here were super polite, smiled, were friendly, and were extremely helpful.2.  The front desk had things you're likely to forget, including.... ponytail holders!  YES!  I forgot ponytail holders, and the front desk actually had some for guests!  It's a small thing, but it saved my entire day.3.  Surprisingly well stocked mini store.  Got some chips and popsicles.  I'm sure I'm not the only person to ever wish they had milk there as well, but whatever, the prices weren't extortionary, and it satisfied my ""It's-2-am-and-i-didn't-have-dinner"" hunger.4.  Pool and fitness center.  They exist and are clean.  I didn't use them due to time constraints, but I appreciate hotels having them.5.  Nice sized bathtub that can actually be stopped up for the taking of bubble baths.6.  FREE HOT BREAKFAST!  I never got to take advantage of this, but people they have FREE WAFFLES.  They leave the fruit out, and keep coffee refreshed throughout the day, which is also SUPER nice touch.7.  Comfy beds, sheets, and pillows.  well, I hated my pillow, but that's because I use a special pillow, but my husband assured me the pillows were great.8.  Good price.  Not too spendy.  9.  Extremely convenient location.  Near the park/zoo, next to an awesome coffee shop, and only a nine dollar cab ride away from a lot of awesome restaurants and bars!AThis review is for customer service at the front desk of this hotel, we did not get a chance to stay there and we had to cancel last minute due to an emergency, we talked to different staff members a couple of time and they were very nice and understanding and they talked to the billing department and even called us back, very impressedThis is a really nice place to stay if you're visiting St. Louis. I've stayed here a few times with my parents during those awkward dorm-closing-but-still-needed-to-be-at-school times. (e.g. I wasn't sure if I needed to retake a math class or not back when I was a freshman so we had to wait to see what I got in the class and of course they didn't upload the grades until after they made us move out of the dorms, lol wtf.)Relatively affordable rooms. Ample and easy parking. Very very clean. Nicely decorated hotel rooms--simple yet practical. The bathrooms have nifty little Saint Louis themed drawings and sketches like old World's Fair flyer type of stuff. They have a continental/cold breakfast in the lobby during the mornings but they also have a cooler of Jimmy Dean's sandwiches which you can heat up in the microwave which is a nice touch as well as stuff like cereal, milk, juice, coffee, fruit, and instant oatmeal. Staff is very friendly and polite and they actually clean your room/make the bed for you when you put the card on your door. I think most of the newer Hampton Inns must be like this one because I also stayed at a Hampton in Fort Leonardwood once and it was almost identical to this one on Oakland Ave.The only major snafu was one night, at like 2:30am, the fire alarm went off RANDOMLY. I think it was due to their system just being installed or repaired and it was glitchy. So it woke up everyone in the entire hotel and we were all standing outside in the concrete at 2something in the morning, kinda pissed off. It scared the crap out of me! But the hotel people were really apologetic about the whole ordeal and offered my dad a free night on them, which was a nice touch! I would recommend this place. It's not as ""trendy"" or ""cool"" as Hotel Ignacio or Moonrise but it's definitely worth the money you pay. It's slightly more expensive than the Water Tower Inn but I'd rather stay here since it's not a creepy renovated hospital. LOL.","I am not a fan of sleeping in beds other than my own at all, however, friends were kind and paid for a room at the Hampton Inn and insisted that we stay over for the weekend for a baptism; rather drive back all within 24 hours - something I would have gladly done, (rather than sleep in a different bed other than my very own). We arrived after a long drive and a full day of work. I was tried, but stressed about sleeping in a bed other than my own!I had to check the room out thoroughly, before even going to bed. It was clean, (not perfect - but clean for the normal eye), and the lobby and the initial check-in went well. The personnel were friendly and tried to put me at ease. The only problem I had were the BIG windows that overlooked the highway and of course the highway noises, that really weren't that bad. In the morning we joined the other guest in the common dining area for breakfast, which was really top notch. The cheese omelets were great as was everything I ate. The coffee was not strong - from over brewing - everything was fresh. Seeing the grounds in the daylight, of course, made for a better impression as well. The only down-side to our stay, was  returning after visiting with our friends and having the key card not work. It took three visits to the front desk, (we were on the top floor). I thought a desk person should have returned with me after my second visit to the desk, and after the second card didn't work. There was someone else working with the young lady, so I was a bit put out, (no pun intended).My husband broke a glass bottle of soda just before we left, so we told housekeeping, who happened to be in the hall; and cleaned things up quickly.Overall, it was a fair stay for someone such as myself. The room and bed was comfortable and clean - even though I didn't sleep under the covers.Very clean hotel. Front desk is friendly and helpful. The rooms are quiet and clean. Checkin and checkout are fast. Free wifi is fast and always available. Breakfast is pretty good and items vary day to day, I like the fresh waffles.I went with this hotel because I was planning some activities in nearby Forest Park. Overall, I was pleased. It's a short, easy drive from the hotel to Forest Park. You can walk, although they told me at the hotel that it's about a mile to the zoo. The hotel room was clean and quiet. View was of the freeway and an apartment building. I was concerned about noise from the freeway (I'm a light sleeper) so I turned the fan up to high, and slept like a baby. The free continental breakfast was just standard fare. Employees were friendly.Overall, I was happy with my stay at Hampton Inn, although I think the price is a bit high. You're definitely paying extra for proximity to Forest Park. If I could do it all over again, I'd stay elsewhere, even if it meant driving an extra 10 minutes.I needed to get out of town and St Louis is a great place to go with kids.  We decided to book the Hampton because of it's central location.  We got a suite since we were going to be there for 3 nights and I would be sharing a room with my SO and 2 kids 4 and 6.  The suite is spacious!  Very clean, trendy furniture- Including a fridge and sink in the front entry - which is kind of a bar area that I used as a makeshift kitchen/pantry.  The beds were comfy but smaller and harder than we were used to.  The kids did fine but my SO ended up sleeping the last night on the couch, which he found more comfortable.The staff was super nice and very helpful.  The first morning they were slammed during the breakfast rush and so they were out of a lot of stuff, but the other two mornings were fine.  They have the waffle maker in addtion to hot suff which changes.  One day was scrambled eggs, potatoes and bacon.  Another was cheese omelets ( not good - bad cheese) sausage and waffle sticks ( over done).  But what do you expect?  If you don't have time for breakfast, they have a brown bag packed with fruit, water and a cereal bar you can take to go on a shelf at the front desk.The pool was excellent, clean, not too much chlorine and there were a bunch of noodles and kick boards for the kids- which I thought was a nice touch.  The hot tub was big.  We swam a lot.Free cookies available at the front desk in the evenings.They had old photos of Forest park when it was an amusement park all over the hotel which was a nice change from the usual hotel crap art.I used the internet a few times and didn't seem to have any problems with speed.  We never had a problem with parking.Only drawback was that they missed cleaning up the room after the first night but that wasn't a big deal to me and they cleaned up the rest of the time we were there.I will stay here again and would definitely recommend it.It was either here or the Moonrise.  While for visiting friends at Washington University the Moonrise would have been a better option for a carless traveler - the Hampton met all my needs very well.The standard king room is spacious, and the bed is very comfortable. The heated pool and hot tub were great for relaxing my muscles after an undergrad/alumni football game, and the free hot breakfast was nice.  The best part was that the hotel staff never turned off the juice machines, which I have never seen before.  I know that juice is just soda with a better reputation, but the generosity was great.Definitely check out the Highlander next door.  Great food, funny and engaging staff, and the food was yummy.My only complaint is the location.  If you are traveling with a car, it's ok, but being right between Clayton/U City and Central West End seems a bit odd.  It is about a $10 cab ride to either neighborhood.  If the Hampton gets a shuttle, it gets five stars from me.Great room, great price, great service, cheap cab to / from bars, RIGHT across from the zoo and VERY CLOSE to museums. Stayed in King non smoking. Check in/out super simple!!This was a great Hampton, and close to a lot of stuff!Very clean, friendly, and had a nice little food pantry, as well as a decent pub right next door (not attached, but practically).The rest was standard (read: good) Hampton Inn.  The 1-star off is because of location, and the signage for navigating INTO the parking lot.  It was confusing to me, especially in low light, and it took me 2 tries to find how to get into the place!  The turn-in is just BEFORE the Hampton - yes, they have a sign, but it is quite small.Otherwise, great Hampton.This hotel gets a two-thumbs-up recommendation from me.  The location is a little weird, on Oakland just south of I-64 and Forest Park, but once you can find it, it's well located for whatever you might find yourself wanting to do in St. Louis proper.There's just something about Hampton Inns that I like, and this one is no exception.  The impeccable cleanliness, the delicious hot breakfasts, the sack meals to go, the courteous staff -- you definitely can't go wrong here if you're looking for an option that isn't in downtown St. Louis.A little anecdote: late at night I was working on an unoccupied conference room when the head of security (or maybe the janitorial staff) came in.  I started packing up my stuff, expecting to be kicked out, but he chuckled and said, ""No, I was coming to see if I could do anything for you, bring you a water or something.""  What a nice guy!I can't speak to the Highlander restaurant next door, but I feel like I've heard good things about it.This is definitely a family-friendly hotel, too, if you've got younger ones that are along for the travel.  I'm sure they'll be just as excited about their stay as I was in Hampton Inns growing up.Stayed at this hotel during St. Patty's Day one year. The place is packed. The rate was about $100 for the night. You get free wifi and a free breakfast buffet. During St. Patty's Day, you need a wrist band to get in so you can't actually bring more people back. You're actually given an additional 2 wrist bands for other people too. The room was nice and clean. The bed was very comfortable.A very well-maintained business hotel in the St. Louis area. I've stayed here four or five times and I've had a pleasant stay each time.The rooms are pretty standard Hampton Inn accommodations, with comfortable beds, large bathrooms and some neat posters from old (mid-20th century) St. Louis in the rooms and hallways. Front desk staff are efficient and helpful, and I've never had a problem with a reservation. Free Wi-Fi in the lobby and wired access in the rooms (you'll get a login code from the desk when you check in), and there's a tiny business center with one computer if you don't have your laptop.Standard breakfast buffet, too, but everything is hot and replenished frequently. And for those of us who need a caffeine fix, the 24/7 coffee in the lobby is a nice bonus. (It's also good coffee, too.)If all of your business is in downtown St. Louis, the location (Forest Park, right off I-64) doesn't make much sense. But it's a good halfway point between the city and the western suburbs. Oakland Avenue is more or less a service road on 64, so the hotel is two minutes from the Oakland Ave. exit.Oh, and if you're in town visiting Washington University -- or, at least, if you tell the front desk as much -- there's a 10% discount on your bill. (I've made two or three such ""visits."")I usually try to stay at a hotel in the Hilton family, and this particular Hampton Inn is located across the street from Forest Park.  Forest Park was the location of the 1904 world's fair, and today contains the St. Louis zoo, the botanical gardens, and the science museum.  The hotel is also not that far from Washington University and Barnes Jewish Hospital.Hampton Inns are usually clean and the staff is courteous.  It is not quite as nice as an actual HIlton hotel, but it is not as expensive either.My sheets had cookies crumbs on them, but they apologized, waved the charge for one night,  and brought new linens to the room.This is a convenient place to stay, but there is also a Homewood suites (owned by Hilton) that just opened a little ways down Clayton Rd.  This would be an option as well, but not as close to the hotel or the park.Very nice Hampton inn. Very clean and feels brand new. Cozy, clean rooms. Great service. Free Internet. Adjacent to hospital. Bar/grill attached. Parking is limited...over-sized vehicles beware.They forgot to clean my room, and the internet (both wired and wireless was horribly sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow.  The customer service was fine, but those two issues were big issues with me.Perfect location for my first visit to St.Louis. Everything was very clean and the staff was extremely accommodating. The free breakfast was really sweet! Much better than average hotel ""free"" breakfast. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any kind of traveler. Two thumbs up!I was pleasantly surprised by this Hampton Inn.  It's a new building.  It's fresh and clean, and the staff are very personable and friendly.  I stayed here for three nights, and I was happy with the size of the room, the air conditioning, the flat screen television, and everything.  They offer a free breakfast, which includes eggs, sausage, home fries, waffles, yogurt, pastries, bagels, cereals, and fruits.  The sausage on two of the mornings I stayed was dried out and over cooked, but a small price to pay for the value here.My husband and I have put my 80-something parents up here off and on for the last few years. The place is fine and the Highlander next door is awesome.  Tonight, despite the fact that I made a reservation online almost a month ago, my husband drove my parents to the hotel, gave them the credit card, but because we have different last names, they wouldn't honor the reservation!  We were obviously treating my parents to a $500+ hotel stay, and now it's on my mother's credit card despite the fact that I talked to the front desk and the customer service people.  I stayed at a Hampton two nights ago in Kansas and no one asked for my ID.  Last time we put them up there.Prompt service. Very nice rooms. Good location, especially for families.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-inn-and-suites-saint-louis-4,Drury Inn & Suites,4.5,$$,31,"I don't usually stay at Drury's as my past experience at them has not  been good but this place is AWESOME!!! Quiet, clean rooms, incredibly friendly staff in all areas, a great breakfast in the AM and a surprisingly good selection of foods in the evening that guests can gorge on, lol! There are also drinks on the ""house"" from the hotel and the person pouring them is NOT stingy on the pours! All in all, I'd definitely stay here again.Came into St. Louis for a family wedding. The wedding party decided to block off a group of rooms at this hotel, which was a 5 minute ride from the reception.There's nothing overwhelming about this hotel. An issues I had: I hate when hotel bathrooms don't have fans... come on, now! Not that it's a deal breaker, but I just think that's weird.I did enjoy how the shower in each room had pump shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner. Really cool!!!! The water pressure on the shower was good, too!The lobby area is nice. The free breakfast is always a nice touch. They also feature a drink/snack option during the early evening hours. I did not utilize this, but I thought it was cool.There is a parking lot on site, with a garage underneath the hotel as well. They have a bare bones fitness room, along with a pool and hot tub, too.No frills here! No real complaints, either. It's not luxury, but it's far from scummy!Stayed here for a wedding. If you are a family of 4 there is free breakfast, free popcorn, a pool, and even cheap hot dogs and weird St. Louis stuff. Like the McDonald's of hotels, it's good value. Hardee's, Wendy's, and a Shell gas station all walking distance.We stayed at this hotel last night. It was an easy check -in. The employees were very friendly. The room was nice and clean. The bed was soft and comfortable. The morning breakfast was very good &amp; there was plenty to choose from. We highly recommend this location.amazing hotel and amazing staff. food was decent and was mostly centralized with the museums. if you are planning on staying in st louis, id pick this hotel. just be aware of packages and other discounts that are available to youI stay here semi-frequently when I am in town for work, and this hotel hits all the marks a hotel needs, in my opinion.1) The staff is always extremely welcoming and friendly.2) The free food is always a big plus, and lately, the offerings at night have increased in quality. They had a cheddar potato soup a few nights ago!3) Free, reliable wi-fi throughout. I highly recommend Drury for the budget-minded folks like me.I've never heard of Drury Inn until I visited Missouri.I stayed here while I was house hunting and in the process of moving to St. Louis. I would say my wife and I probably stayed at this location for about 2 weeks total.Since everyone seems to like lists, I'm going to list out my pros and cons.Pros- Great price for a quality hotel- The shower had a nice showerhead and great water pressure (yes, I think this is important)- Customer service: A+- Free breakfast and a hot late afternoon meal- Free alcoholic beverages (I think you get like 2 or 3)- Laundry area- No additional charges for parking, no valet- Free internet- Internet is fast (sometimes). First time we went, we stayed in a room closer to the center of the building and the internet was the fastest and most consistent I have seen in any hotel. The next time we stayed, we were in a room that was much further out from the center of the hotel. The internet was very spotty (this was a pain).- Nice pool area and hot tub- Located next to a major highwayCons- Breakfast is always exactly the same. Not a huge deal if you aren't staying there for an extended period of time.- Possible spotty internet (see above)I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone staying around the area. Great hotel for a great price!This is an exceptional hotel. We got in late. Scott, the overnight employee was incredibly helpful and wonderfully accommodating. The room was incredibly clean, which was my biggest concern.Clean, comfortable, great service, good breakfast.  Highly recommend this hotel.  Just wish the name wasn't so depressing...Drury?We were driving through Illinois from Colorado and decided to stay the night here on a (tired) whim. I was truly stunned at the incredible service and super friendly staff. They are there to serve and cater to their guests. Very kind and full of smiles. It was awesome. In addition, the decor was very nice in both the lobby, breakfast area, and the rooms. Modern, clean lines, bright and open. And pet friendly!Excellent hotel for this price point. Kudos to the staff and management.We have been staying in hotels all across the US for work and drury has been one of my favorite hotel chains. It seems the pricier you go the less likely you are to have a microwave, fridge, and free breakfast. Unless you are getting a more expensive rooms in the hotel. We have stayed at radisons, hyatts, Hilton's, wyndams, and many more. So far the drury inns have been the best. Free breakfast, fridge, microwave, 3 free alcoholic drinks a day and a free evening entree buffet, which can easily be dinner. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in town. Also they are dog friendly.So we stayed for one night and it was good.The location is easy to get to, parking is okay.  The room was clean, though outdated.  They offer the free cocktail hour and breakfast.  That is almost worth staying here over other places.  The snacks that come with cocktail hour are pretty good.  And the same for breakfast.  They have a very nice selection of foods.All of the staff was friendly and we had no problems.  If I am back in the area I would stay here again.Five-star, all the way. Arrived here after midnight while on the way home from PA. John at the front desk was incredibly nice - quickly found us two rooms and called the security guard out front to help us park our trailer.Rooms are well-appointed, clean and spacious. And the free hot breakfast buffet is a major plus, as well. Will definitely stop over here again when we're in the area!I had never stayed in a Drury Inn prior to this trip.  We headed to STL for my brothers wedding and booked a room where they had reserved a room block.  It was a great location, the rooms were clean and reasonably comfortable and the staff was nice.  The breakfast was ample and the only thing I was really missing was a mixed fruit bowl... though they did have bananas or apples.    One night there was an incident with a fire alarm at 2:00am, where the guests all had to go into the parking lot to wait while fire trucks came and then left without passing along much, if any, information to the bedraggled bunch in the parking lot.  While I completely respect that the hotel had no control over the fire alarm, a bit more information would have been greatly appreciated!  After all your guests were awakened in the middle of the night, ran outside with little to no belongings (in one case a father came out with his wife and two kids wearing just his boxers!  I totally applaud that guy for responding the way we all should, though I did take time to throw on some clothes), waited outside for about 30 minutes and then were told we could reenter.  Upon reentering, we found that the alarms were still going off in all the rooms, so we camped in the hallway for an additional 20 minutes or so.  However, I feel the collective questions the guests had were, ""Why did the fire alarm go off?  Was there a fire?!? Will breakfast be extended the following morning, since we all got a less that ideal night sleep?  Will there be a credit for the inconvenience?""   All of my questions were answered the next morning after talking with the GM at breakfast.  There was a faulty pull station in the restaurant that set the alarm off.  They did take my suggestion and extended breakfast 1/2 hour and we were given a one night credit (though you had to ask for that).  With that being said, the hotel responded to a bizarre situation well, after the fact.  However, it would have been great to have more information provided without asking and while the incident was occurring.  Over all it is not a Sheraton, but I really liked the Drury for what it was!I've stayed in very expensive hotels, very cheap hotels, boutique hotels, resort hotels and everything in between. This Drury location has the feel and decor of a mid-range hotel, the free amenities of an all-inclusive hotel, the service of a luxury hotel and the price of a cheap hotel. The staff made every effort to make our stay welcome and comfortable. They even bought me a half gallon of soy milk that they kept in the kitchen refrigerator for me to use at my convenience. I am so grateful for this small attention to detail. I am now a fan of the chain and will definitely scout out other locations.My grandparents stay here every time they visit. It's an easy exit right off HWY44 and it's a nice central location right off of Hampton. The rooms seem a tad pricey ($100+/night) but did you know they include free breakfast buffet, free dinner buffet, and 3 free alcoholic drinks each night of your stay?!? I mean, COME ON, those things would seriously add up if you were eating and drinking at a restaurant. It's not five-star restaurant food but its good! Not to mention people with kids can save some serious dough while staying here. Above all else even the staff is super friendly and the place always has a clean, elegant feeling to it.This Drury Inn is the best one I've stayed at so far. The staff was very accommodating to us. They blocked off a large parking area for our full size truck and trailer, so we were set when we pulled into the busy parking lot. The staff was very friendly and helpful when we asked for directions to surrounding attractions. Our room was huge and comfortable. If we ever find ourselves back in St. Louis, we will definitely be staying here.Nice rooms, free snacks, free drinks. What more could you want from a hotel.Great place to stay!We chose this location because of it's location to the zoo.  Turns out it's pretty close to everything.We got 3 free Safari Passes to the zoo ($21 value).The snack and breakfast were great surprises.  Lot's of great extras and the rooms were very nice.We will stay there again.Ya know I have always liked this chain of hotels. They feed you well, the rooms are clean however I think it's frugal to not offer free amenities like other hotels do.","THIS PLACE!!!This place was an incredible experience for my great grandma (92 years old), grandparents with health problems (in their early 70s), and great uncle. I booked this hotel for them on my wedding night since they were coming in from out of town. It was important to find a hotel with recliners.  I needed two in one room since my grandparents must sleep sitting up.  I also needed the room to be handicap accessible as we were unsure of the mobility of the guests during the stay.  The hotel services had no problem getting them all set up and the room was perfect (I requested to see it and sit in the recliners to assure that all would work out well for my family. This was not a problem and they seemed happy to have someone so interested and invested in family members' stay.) My family raved about the hotel over and over.  Then they raved about the delicious breakfast and the many choices they were given. The extras weren't extra and my family was very happy! Thankful that they had such an amazing stay!Excellent room and  excellent service. The room was pristine and the staff was all very helpful!  Three free drink along with some great snacks made socializing before dinner supper comfortable.Hotel staff is great and very friendly. stayed there for a weekend for a non profit function with a bunch of friends and the hotel was very accommodating. The rooms were nice but the pillows sucked! just your standard everyday hotel room, it was clean at least.. the showers had low pressure and the maids knock on the door toooooooo early. 8:30 for housekeeping OUCH!I have stayed here several times and will every time when working in the area. The happy hour every night is a great plus and the breakfast is better than you could expect for the price of the room. They have an indoor pool and exercise room. I book at Drury Hotels whenever possible for my work travels just bacause I can count on a great stay. there are lots of places to have dinner very close by.Nice room, large size. We like Embasy Suites and found the Drury room even larger, great for traveling with teens. The staff did above job taking care of the breakfast and evening meals. The front desk staff was very freindly &amp; helpful. The pool &amp; fitness center are a bit small bur we spent our time at the zoo &amp; downtown.The hotel was very nice. Great location, within minutes of downtown, the zoo, museums, Grant's Farm, etc. Right off I-44. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Great breakfast and 5:30 snacks. The first night we stayed, ate this as our supper. Soda, juice, milk and popcorn available till  10 pm. The only real drawback was the pool. Very small. Half indoor and half outdoor, not sure how this works in the winter. They also have a small indoor parking garage which was nice to keep our car cool so it wasn't burning hot in the morning. However when you came back at night, it was hard to find a parking spot. I think some people had to park on the street.We stayed here while attending a wedding-had never heard of it before.  We found out it is family owned-soon there will be one in Florida. There is a tricky corner getting into this hotel but this is the worst thing I can say about it. We loved the underground parking at no cost to us. We had a refreidgerator and microwave in the room as well as free wifi. The bathroom area was huge. There was free breakfast including biscuits, gravy, sausage, bacon, eggs, etc.  There was also a time during 5:30-7:00 when you could get nachos hots dogs,chicken fingers, macaroni and cheese, baked potato, etc. We also got drink tickets we could use daily. While we did not use the pool, we saw many families taking advantage of it.  It was close to the zoo and botanical garden as well as a GREAT restaurant nearby (Joey B's). If I was traveling in the area in a family group-this is a GREAT place.  Families could get their kids a full breakfast, go out for the day, and have dinner easily in the evening free of cost (small children eat so little).  All employess were genuinely friendly and attentive and willing to help when asked for suggestions.  I loved the place!We took our Robotics team to Championships and stayed here. It was an excellent experience. The rooms were great for 4 kids, the free food was great, the pool and exercise rooms were helpful to keep kids entertained, the adjacent restaurant had yummy food, and the staff was so friendly and accomodating. I have never given a hotel 5 stars, but this one deserves it. We will definitely stay there again if we make it to Championships again.This hotel makes me happy, plain and simple. Nice accomodations, and they give you free food all day long which is a definite plus. It's definitely worth grabbing a plate and taking it up to your room, just sit on the couch, turn on TV, and get fat. Also, they have a free business center, which is nice. I hate it when hotels charge for that shit, that's just mean. And the lobby is classy looking, not lame and Hampton-inn-ish. So I'm definitely looking forward to having a reason to visit some city with a Drury location in the future.i have never staid at this particular location but i think the drury inn is great. they offer free beverages, food, and a happy hour after a certain time with free food. the breakfast says ""quickstart"" breakfast but its really good. the prices are reasonable and with the additions of the free food, beverages, and free breakfast, its well worth the money. when I travel, I always try to find a drury inn. its a great hotel. they havent disappointed me yet.Stayed here on the way to Branson for a night's rest with my two sons. The hotel was very impressive. It is a fairly new hotel and was very very nice! The room was perfectly clean and very upscale for a lower star hotel; the floors were solid and the walls very thick since we could not hear any noise from the other rooms nor could we hear any noise from the freeway that was only a few yards away. The evening reception and breakfast were a nice bonus.....can't complain about a bonus; just don't expect the food on the posters to be served; the posters had chicken nuggets, but only chili dogs were served; not a big deal and was better than not having any food like a lot of hotels.  Plus, the dining room was very large and very relaxing; it was packed that night but still accomodated everyone. The pool was very small, but was nicely heated; almost like a hot tub, and you could swim under a wall to lead to the outdoor pool; very nice touch. There was plenty of parking; indoor and outdoor. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay again when passing through St. Louis!",,,,"['usually', 'past', 'experience', 'good', 'place', 'awesome', 'quiet', 'clean', 'rooms', 'incredibly',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-inn-st-louis-union-station-saint-louis,Drury Inn St. Louis Union Station,4.5,$$,38,"I decided to take a break and get away from Chicago for the weekend. St. Louis was the closest option that has some things to offer.I was little skeptical before booking this hotel. This hotel definitely made my weekend trip.What you get for the price is really good, and can not be beaten by other places. I always Airbnb where I travel somewhere but this place offers way more than Airbnb hosts in St.Louis.- Free parking in the down town of STL, right next to the Union Station.- Free hot breakfast and it was good! (Eggs, biscuits, yogurts, cereal, waffles, cupcakes etc...)- Free evening snacks with 3 drinks! Wow- Free wifi- A small swimming pool...All included in the price. I will be back.Hallways and elevators needed some cleaning but I will not cut a start off for that.Oh, the Drury. I have many NYE memories from oh, 15 years ago, but fast forward to today &amp; I'm doing more adult things like going to weddings &amp; not passing out in bathtubs (what?). We stayed here on a recent trip to STL for a wedding at NEO on Locust. Drury is still one of my favorite hotel chains, the rooms are always in decent condition &amp; the customer service is great. This location was no different, though the room we were in could've used a little bit of updating. We were also in one of the interior rooms, so our only window looked out into the hotel, instead of outside... if we were staying for more than 1 night I would've asked to be moved because that always makes me a smidge claustrophobic. Pros: Comfy bed, afternoon food/booze freebies, free parking, reasonable price, free wifi.Cons: The dream my fiance had about a ghost being in our bed, of which I am now convinced was real, due to me having a legit feeling of a ghost in the room before he ever told me about said dream. Not to mention the noise app I have on my cell phone kept turning itself off inexplicably? So.... yeah. We also somehow could not find our way out of the stairwell &amp; onto the first floor, but that could've been the amount of booze we drank the night before.Other than that, I'll probably stay again, but I will most definitely request a room with a real window!This place has good solid mid American values and offers a really great value proposition for the budget traveler. The food for the buffet dinner and breakfast is good, you get a beer and wine ticket when you check in good for three, yes THREE happy hour drinks and the rooms are very nice with extremely comfortable beds. This hotel made a pretty ghastly flying experience over two days completely saved.Great, clean hotel with hospitable staff that answered all our questions &amp; offered to print us maps, itineraries, etc.- Free Parking- Pool &amp; Hot Tub- Police station in hotel (safe)- Good location (10 min to Soulard, 10 min to Arch, 10 min to the hill)- Free drinks &amp; food from 5pm-7pm- Free warm breakfast- AAA DiscountWishing this chain of hotels could expand nation wide but looking forward to our next Drury stay!Very clean. Friendly and helpful staff. Any staff you would see always said hi asked if your stay is Ok if you need anything.The room was nice. Clean,quiet. Beds were comfy. Wish the pillows were a tad fluffy. The maids were quick and very nice made our kids beds with their blankets and pillows.The pool was Ok temp could be a tad warmer. Hot tub was good. Was busy after 6. Lots of towels they were always bringing in more.The food was great. We had dinner twice each night was a tad different. And breakfast. As for the dinner it was amazing and nice to come back and kickback like the signs say and that's what we did. The food isn't anything special but we liked it all. The bonus to dinner the drinks and the late snack of popcorn that was awesome. Thank you. Breakfast was good. I would like to see hard boiled eggs. The eggs were good and biscuits and gravy yumm. This is a great hotel.This is very nice hotel and great location ,superb service and like they say the extras aren't extra in The Drury's Inn and suites !This hotel is great! MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE...+FREE (COVERED) PARKING: OMG. This is why I am writing a review of this hotel on Yelp. The garage is FREE and  EXTREMELY SAFE. You need a hotel room card to park inside the garage, AND  there is limited entrance into the garage from 7 PM to 7 AM if you don't have your hotel card. At night time, the garage is completely closed to the outside; they even have those metal chain dividers, IN ADDITION to the room key activated bars. I felt SO safe leaving my car in the garage, and even if I did leave any valuables in my car, I would be able to sleep soundlessly through the night because I know they will still be there the next morning! I don't see how any intruders will be able to get in. The extra's: +Complimentary, HOT breakfast: No worries. You won't find the continental type of breakfast here where all they serve is dry cereal...there are sausages, tater tots, cereal, bread, juices, waffles, oatmeal, etc -you name it! There are also PLENTY of tables to situate everyone, so you don't have to worry about arriving too late to breakfast and scrambling to find seats. +Complimentary, DINNER &amp; DRINKS: It's a rarity that hotels serve dinner, but this Drury Inn does! The menu can be found on their website, but it's pretty much a rotating selection of pasta and chicken tenders, along with soup, potatoes, etc. They also provide free alcoholic beverages!! Sit back and relax! +Clean Rooms: The rooms smell great; beds were comfortable; HD TV; free wi-fi. +Friendly Staff: Staff were extremely friendly in providing directions to attractions, numbers to rental cars, and anything you need help with.THANK YOU DRURY INN UNION STATION for providing these impeccable services! Money well spent.My husband and I used the Drury for our May 2014 wedding. They were more than accommodating to us and our guests, especially given that we had to keep enlarging the number of rooms in our 'block'. Breakfast, FREE PARKING and location were great amenities for our guests and we were able to rent a room the morning after our wedding for gifts. We heard no complaints about the rooms as all were cleaned well regularly and the suites were all spacious (be cautious of the one in the basement though - while it's great that you have privacy because it's the only room down there, there are no windows). The hotel is also historical and a good change of pace from the usual hotel feel. The staff were professional and easy to get ahold of with any concerns - I would definitely recommend them for any stay in St. Louis or bridal party.Absolutely the best hotel stay the family has ever had.  The beds we're very comfortable and the service was superior.  For the cost you couldn't beat it.  Free breakfast and dinner that is way more than the simple appetizers you get at other hotels.  The hotel under promises but over delivers which is unusual in this day and age.  The location was close to everything.  The building itself had a ton of character.  The only negative was the towels were sort of rough.The place is beautiful. They offer great service and clean rooms!!! Plus, they offer breakfast, dinner, and 3 drinks for free. The only down fall is the gym is real small with very little equipment. But other than that they have a awesome pool!!! Trust me guys its a great stay!!!What an awesome place to stay!! My boyfriend and I made a last minute decision to visit STL for a concert that happened to be the same weekend as Mardi Gras. While the rest of the hotels in the area were either sold out or way over priced, we found this one for $130 a night. The man who checked us in was very welcoming, he joked with us and didn't seem stressed by how busy it was. Fortunately we arrived during happy hour so we sat down and had some snacks and drinks, all for free. They had a pretty good variety of snacks- popcorn, hotdogs, nachos and to drink I had a cranberry &amp; vodka and a tequilla sunrise. It took us a while to find our room.. This hotel is HUGE. Our room was clean, beds were comfy. My only complaint was the noise, we were woken up the next morning by kids running around and screaming. I think there may have been a ball tournament because kids were EVERYWHERE, I know it's hard for the hotel staff to control so it wasn't a big deal! Overall, our stay was very nice. Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the pool and more happy hours :) Thinking of visiting STL again in July and definitely will stay here!Great place to stay. Clean and cozy. Great area walking distance to downtown. Great happy hour food and drinks and breakfast.!Clarifier - this is only a review of their breakfast buffet. This might be my favorite breakfast in St. Louis. My sister, mom, aunts, and grandparents were in town visiting and I had the buffet twice. The service was amazing - their staff was friendly, conscious to filling your cups and catering to your needs without obtruding. The buffet costs $15 and comes with complimentary, unlimited great coffee and fresh orange juice. I'm a snob for both beverages and was absolutely pleased. On top of this there is a fresh fruit bar (watermelon, melon, strawberries, and blueberries that had a Whole Foods quality measure about them), micro smoothies next to that,And an oatmeal station with all the fixings (pecans, walnuts, apricots, golden raisins, dried cranberries, brown sugar, honey, dot dot dot). And then their are croissants, pastries, donuts, bagels, bread...And an omelet bar...And a prosciutto, cheese, I never seen this at a buffet but I love that it is here kinda station...And And And And when are you going?Drury Inn will throw your ass out in the cold at 3:30 in the morning in the middle of one of the most dangerous cities in the country when all you're doing is standing right inside the front door waiting for a cab (not even in the lobby). F U, Drury InnAny hotel that does this: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcountercurrentnews.com%2F2014%2F11%2Fferguson-protesters-call-for-boycott-of-drury-hotel-chain%2F&amp;s=880f80d041bdbcae327ae24681f0ee0dbdedb284c8b444e9f4a19647da01cec6"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">countercurrentnews.com/2...</a> should have no business given to them.  Please find an alternative placeThis is by far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The beds were comfortable and the staff was very friendly. The pool is large and there is free parking! It is right across from union station and the Hard Rock Cafe. This is an overall great hotel and I would definitely recommend this to anyone!Best hotel experience I've ever had. Staff is super friendly but not fake. Room was clean and comfy. Lots of free food and drinks. Excellent value!!This Drury Inn is just like many other Drury hotels. We try as hard as we can to stay in only Drury hotels. They are so clean and the food is so good! You guys please me! Keep up the good work! Overall GREAT place to stay!Whaaaat? This place is AWESOME! And I'm a Four Seasons kinda girl. I actually considered cancelling my upcoming Four Seasons STL stay for Drury Inn because IT WAS THAT GOOD. (I didn't cancel... I mean, it's the Four Seasons... but I did consider it!)This was the perfect spot for a Blues Game because it is so close to Scottrade. The parking is free, I loved the free popcorn and soda, the ""kickback"" and breakfast in the morning was a pretty solid selection. The pantry closet with all sorts of treats was a nice touch. Reasonable pricing. The pool and hot tub looked so inviting after being out in the cold but I didn't bring my suit. Fail. The decor in the lobby is lovely... dark but grand and very clean. Everyone was happy; guests and staff alike. I smile thinking about my stay here.We woke up at 9:45 (long night) and asked for late check out because I didn't feel like getting out of bed anytime soon. They pushed back checkout 2 hours, to 1pm, no questions asked. Oh the little things make such an impact on an experience. I left that hotel with a smile on my face, mentally planning my next trip. All of this for around 110/night. Seriously affordable vs other options in the area, and you get SO MUCH MORE. I snagged a Drury Inn at the Arch stay for 3 days for the Opening Day Cards series and I'm thrilled. Can't wait to try another location.I never never write reviews, but this hotel's accommodations are horrible! The hotel was full, so I was put in a smoking room, even thought reservations had been well in advance by the organizers of the convention. The front desk was rude and even annoyed that asked to be switched out of the room, if they didn't have enough rooms to accommodate everyone in a clean smoking free room they shouldn't have hosted the convention.","This is a great place to stay.  1 block from Union Station.  Free parking.  Evening snacks and beverages and a great hot breakfast.  The Drury's are a great value!I've never stayed at a hotel in 30 years as spectacular as this one. It was almost as if I was warped back in time back to the good old days of the 1980's or better yet, early 1990's. Back then, things and life were complimentary, before greed set in and everyone was nickled and dimed. Several things impressed me about Drury Inn. I would stay here again without even thinking about it. Rooms were clean and big for what I spent for the night. Beds were big and the bathrooms had shampoo dispensers as well. Most impressive was the complimentary service. Free parking, free breakfast buffet. I don't mean the shit breakfast buffet everyone is used to, with bread, processed juice from 18 years ago, and a glass of water. Waffles, toast, bagels, syrup, cereal, you name it, they had it. Customer service was excellent, helping me to navigate around the city. They were excellent. One can only wish others followed Drury's lead, but then again, life is just not that simple.Old but free breakfast buffet. And very nice. I was here for a volleyball tournament and they extended breakfast hours for us. It's a very fun place to play elevator tag!For a weekend trip to St. Louis, this turned out to be the best place. Good: The location is across the street from Union Station, one of the attractions in town I planned to visit. The location is about a two minute walk to an LRT station (at Union Station). Awesome, free, hot breakfast. I've enjoyed many free (included in the price of the room) hotel breakfasts over the years. This is the best I've experienced based on the variety of hot meats, eggs, waffles, cereals, biscuits, gravy... I could go on and on. The style/decor of the hotel is great. It is an older building completely restored and up to date (it was originally a YMCA back in the day). There is plenty of parking in an attached, multi-level garage. Bad: Not much was bad. It wasn't the cheapest price in down, but I felt it was not that expensive and a good value.Dog stays free. Car stays free. Free breakfast. Free happy hour and apps (hot dogs, mac and cheese, nachos). Good location, nice rooms, friendly staff. Indoor pool and hot tub. The freebies saved us a couple hundred dollars for the weekend. If you have a dog and a car, there is no better place.Location is great - close to lots of restaurants, pubs etc., as well as Union Station.The price encompases free parking, breakfast, happy hour (3 free drinks, finger food) - and while not the least expensive hotel, you get value for the money.The staff are fantastic - very friendly, happy to help.The area is safe to walk around in.The rooms are clean, and everything is in good repair.All in all, happy with our choice.The on-site restaurant gets good ratings on yelp (rightly so) which is one more plus.Would I return:  yesWoudl I recommend:  yesThumbs up!  Stayed here the night before the Rock N Roll marathon.  Fantastic location in the historic former Railroad YMCA, very cute lobby, decent pool and nice big whirpool.  Free parking made in and out a breeze.Ditto to what others have said about the breakfast and dinner buffets.  I was very impressed with the friendly staff, and especially grateful the  opening of breakfast an hour early on Sunday to accomodate the runners.  Very cool!Room 419 was a little weird....we had no window at all.  However, the room was spacious with a king bed, large sofa bed and reclining chair.  The bathroom was the tiniest I've been in outside of Hong Kong (and it may be a tie!)We had an easy walk to the starting line and back from the finish line.I will definitely book a room here next year for the race.Nice room. Coming from Chicago, I appreciate free garage parking!Yummy line of free food nightly. Complete with 3 free drinks! Make a meal out of this and spend the rest of your money on drinks. Pool area looks nice.Great location.Great hotel! Free breakfast, free happy hour/dinner, free popcorn, free soda from the soda machine in the lobby! More tv channels than most hotels! Sparking structure that is locked down pretty good. You need your room key to get in or out. The staff is really nice too! We really enjoyed our short stay here!I really like these hotelsnever had a bad exp at any of the ones I stayed in.Nearly choked on the cloud of toxic chemicals they used to clean the room. Sure enough, I woke with a headache the next morning. Glad some people like it. For $109, I expect some attention to this aspect in this day and age.What an absolutely beautiful hotel! The staff are incredible. Included in the price of the hotel are free breakfast &amp; dinner buffets. The hotel is very convenient to the MetroLink. I stayed here when U2 was in town. The hotel was filled &amp; I could not have been happier with where i stayed. I would definitely recommend.The Drury Inn at Union Station is the best hotel in Downtown St. Louis. It's located directly across from Union Station and there's always something to do within waking distance. As with all Drury Inn's, the have the 500pm free happy hour which is really nice considering they pour top shelf drinks. This location also offers free parking which is somewhat of a rarity.Like staying here.  The rooms/baths are always clean. Theres in room refridgerator.  No problems in getting extra towesl or pillows.  Pool also provide towels.  Breakfast is always a hit with waffles and hot items like biscuts and gravy, sausages, eggs, and fresh fruit.  Go early for breakfast because the lines get long for the waffles.  They also have happy hour cocktails one free drink per person per night along with horderves.for what it is, this is seriously the best place i have stayed.  sure, i have stayed in some of the nicest, most hip places around but for a night in st. louis where all we needed was a place to crash, this was it!it was very reasonably priced.the staff was nice and accommodating beyond words.there is free popcorn and fountain soda in the lobby!you get 3 free drinks during happy hour!you also get an hour of long distance calling for free.bottom line, if you are in town for a wedding like we were, or a concert, ballgame or something similar, book your stay here!  they are so nice and great that you will feel right at home.Just stayed here with a Girl Scout troop and the service was awesome! Great location, free food at breakfast and at 5:30pm, self serve soft drinks and popcorn from 3pm-10pm.  Clean rooms, smallish pool but the girls still enjoyed it.  Walk to everything from here and if it's a little too far for you, take the very clean and reliable Metrolink that is located about a block from the front door. Would definetely stay here again!I'm giving this four star rating on the basis that this is the nicest two star hotel I've stayed at. When I first walked in I was nervous because this is an old hotel and everything is dark wood, floral, green marble, etc. Not exactly what I look for in hotel decor. However, what the decor lacks, the hotel staff and amenities makes up for! The room was what I expected with floral decor, green carpet, and older furnishings but the bed was comfortable, there was FREE wifi, and the bathroom was just fine. I checked out both the happy hour and continental breakfast and both were good. They had decent wines at the happy hour (for free) and the breakfast was a hot breakfast which you don't see at too many two star hotels. Finally, what really pushed my rating to four stars, was the hotel staff. EVERYONE was friendly and went out of their way to make your experience as nice as possible. They even called after you checked in to see if there was anything they could do. Nice touch for sure.It's a classy joint.",,,,"['decided', 'take', 'break', 'away', 'weekend', 'closest', 'option', 'things', 'offer', 'little', 'skeptical', 'booking', 'hotel', 'hotel', 'definitely',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-westport-lakeside-chalet-hotel-saint-louis-2,Sheraton Westport Lakeside Chalet Hotel,3.0,$$,41,"Not only was this place beautiful and had great rooms and food, but I have to make a special shout out due to some unforeseen circumstances...I am a flight attendant and when our original hotel caught on fire, the Chalet took us in and gave the whole crew complimentary rooms, food, and drinks. The staff was more than helpful and very welcoming.I just wanted to thank them for all of their hospitality!Our reservations were mysteriously cancelled upon arrival, instead of handling the problem, front desk staff tried to turn us away as the hotel was ""full."" When I demanded we get the rooms that as of two days prior were confirmed, the man behind the counter claimed that was impossible. When I asked to speak to a manager, both gentlemen at the desk claimed to be managers. They then teamed up to make all of this seem like our fault. They kept saying they couldn't help us when we were angry, but what they were really doing was attempting to bully us into leaving through angry and condescending behavior and speech. One was especially bad. He had what seemed to be a violent temper. He had to walk away at one point and compose himself because I wouldn't just accept the fact that our reservations were lost (did I mention my colleague had checked in under the reservation two hours prior?) He was scary, and probably does not need to work with the public. He seemed proud of his behavior, like he could treat me that way because I was powerless. I asked him to call the reservation line to find out what happened. He held the phone to his ear for a while, said he was on hold and that he could call me when he knew what happened. I gave him my cell phone number. I went to our to put down luggage in the rooms they found us that had previously not existed, and when I walked through about ten minutes later to move my car, he was not on the phone nor had I received a call. I asked him what happened and he said they couldn't tell him anything. I told him I didn't appreciate how he had handled the situation, and as I walked away he yelled at me to mention his name when I called to complain. Why would a person say that? No concern or compassion for customers. I think he was mad that made a mistake and had to work to fix it, which is his job. What's really upsetting is that when I called the corporate reservation line later, they said I had had three rooms when the reservation left their system the day before. I would never stay here again. I felt like the staff couldn't handle a mix up that most likely happens on occasion. We were not going to leave after our colleague was already able to check in, with no place to go and no idea what happened, and the hotel must not have been ""full"" if they found us two rooms for the night because we wouldn't leave.The rooms were below average, but the scary staff is the reason to stay away.We stayed here for a couple of nights, and I would recommend it. But, just barely.   First, the staff here is amazing. Anytime we had a question or issue, it was promptly handled. We were offered recommendations on places to see around town, and we even got a map printed for us when we mentioned our GPS apps on our phones were having issues. The staff here are a major asset. When we first checked in, we were given keys to someone else's room. This was a little unsettling, but it was rectified by the front desk immediately. Seeing this pop up in another review makes me think there must be some issue within their computer system that needs to be addressed . . . immediately. The building itself is just alright. From the outside, it's pretty cool, with a European/medieval feel. The inside, however, is a different story. The lobby looks amazing, and I wish they would carry this bright, modern experience to the rooms. Now, don't get me wrong, it's comfortable and clean, but feels cramped, dated, and put through the wringer. A few issues I noticed were chipping paint, stained carpet, curtains, and poor water pressure, especially in the bathroom sink.We both like our room a little cooler and noticed if we lowered the temperature, 30 minutes later it was already reset. I don't understand having a thermostat in a room if the guest can't actually set it to a temperature they feel most comfortable. We were woken up by construction happening by the pool several mornings. I think it would be reasonable to hold off on that until 10:00 or so, but I understand they have a business to run.  Just a small note, these rooms don't have mini fridges or microwaves, so if you're eating out, eat up! The restaurant here is pretty great. Granted, I only tried the buffet ($15 for breakfast and coffee).It's located next to a plaza area with a few restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and a comedy club.  It also has pretty easy access to 270.  So, would I stay here again? I'd actually probably toss a coin. It almost seems like a tale of two hotels. The staff here are worth 5 stars easily, but the overall building and the stay itself, maybe 3 if I'm being kind.We had a great experience here. My wife was sick and called the front desk looking for a place to get some soup. Adrianne at the front desk was so awesome! She took upon herself to try to find the soup for my wife! The entire staff here was great but she was a stand out. The room we stayed in was newly remodeled. The only knock was the fact that they at were remodeling the floor below ours so on Friday it was a little noisy. The plaza has some fun food options. Imos pizza is a must!Yea, it is a bit weird hotel: Swiss style chalet, with strange shaped rooms, and layout of property. Yea, rooms, particularly bathrooms, are dated too, and so is infrastructure. But there was some remodeling, it is clean, staff is friendly, price was right. Major draw for me was location. Westport Plaza is quite nice, with several places worth visiting, good food and entertainment, plus only 15 mins to airport, and free shuttle. Good for short trip.This is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in, and I've stayed at plenty of sketchy motels and felt just fine. I'll start from the beginning... We were given room keys to a room on the fourth floor. When my work roommate and I got up there, I heard a TV blaring from outside the door. Regardless we both tried using our room keys to get in and neither worked.  After a few tries we finally knocked and a haggard voice responded ""Yeah?!"" to which, for some reason, I responded ""Is someone in there?"" which obviously received an affirmative reply.  Anywho, after we told the front desk we got a different room on the first floor, which is 2 floors down from the lobby.Our first night there, I went to drink excessive amounts of wine with some co-workers at the hotel bar (the only good thing about this place) while my roommate went to retire for the night. She later said she couldn't get into the room and when the hotel staff investigated, they had to completely replace our door handle because the battery inside of it that accepts room keys had died.  When I came back to the room a few hours later, my room key didn't work and the front desk had to give me a new one.So, the next day I had set my alarm for 7am.  At about 6am I awoke to EXTREMELY LOUD   sludge hammering outside my back door (we had a back door which opened out yo their ghetto parking lot).  Some doofus was pounding away at the sidewalk a foot away from my door. I asked him what he was doing and said he woke me up, to which he begrudgingly apologized.There was also mold in our shower. My group of like 20 all had terrible things to say about this place (one co-worker said his room was right next to an ice machine that loudly banged against his wall all night).  Bottom line.. Do not stay here!!It's nice. Nothing to write home about the rooms are pretty small. But clean. I'm really having an issue with the Wi-Fi I've tried to get connected to it numerous of times I also called the front desk and numerous of times and they give me different passwords every time and it never works. So that was a big turnoff for me because I love to use my computer. But they were nice about it when I called a numerous of times. Sheets are nice and crisp. And it the room  doesn't smell like smoke, smells pretty fresh. The next  morning when I woke up my back was hurting, didn't sleep well at all. I slept better at the casino queen.I was actually pleasantly surprised by the quality of my stay at the Sheraton Westport Lakeside Chalet.  When I found out that I would be attending a 2-day conference there, I immediately checked out the reviews, and I was a little nervous about the mixed bag that's out there. I booked my room through Priceline's ""Express Deals"" feature, which gave me a much cheaper rate than I would have received if I had booked my room as a part of the conference's block rate.  One of the most impressive aspects of the hotel is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff - from the people at the front desk, to the bar/restaurant workers, to the event/catering folks - the service was truly excellent throughout our entire stay.I was also surprisingly impressed by the quality and cleanliness of the common areas throughout our stay.  The decor of the public spaces is somewhat contemporary, and cleanliness was never an issue during our stay.  The lobby is inviting and comfortable, the fitness room seemed clean and well-equipped, the hotel bar is a really cool space with a decent selection of beer, wine, and liquors to choose from, the meeting rooms and grand ballroom provided a perfect venue for our conference, and the food that was served to us throughout the day was always fantastic and plentiful!My only complaints about the hotel were with our room.  We stayed in a double room on the second floor of the hotel.  The room itself was very large in size, with a small balcony that overlooked the courtyard below, but the furnishings in the room were fairly minimal/basic, which made the room seem way bigger than it needed to be.  The bathroom, on the other hand, seemed somewhat small.  It provided a lot of shelving, but the strangest thing about it was that it didn't offer anyplace to actually hang a towel.  The shower was also a little odd, with a shower head that couldn't have been more than 5.5 feet high.  Not great for a taller guy like me.  The hotel offers a fairly large selection of TV channels in the rooms, but where it matters the most - the beds - I've definitely slept much more comfortably.One last comment - as nice as the downstairs common areas are, the upstairs hallways could definitely use a little facelift.  For me, they just felt too dark and dated, and they left an impression of a much cheaper hotel while walking through.The outside is peaceful. Scenic. House keeping needs to be a bit quicker. I am a tad nervous with the 3 day conference. I am surprised how pleasant the staff has been. Overall nice, I will book again.This is one weird hotel.  From the outside, it looks like an old-fashioned swiss chalet, but on the inside, it is modern.  The rooms are okay, but the heating system never shuts off and was blowing the curtains around all night.  The bathroom is a little tight a well, but the bed was very comfortable.  Staff was very nice and check-in was quick.I also thought it was weird that my room had a door to the outside that would not open, yet I saw someone the next morning exit from theirs.  That would have been extremely helpful to get to my car since parking is at a premium here and you have to walk a mile to get in and out.I only stayed overnight, attending a conference in the adjacent building, so I didn't get to use room-service or see what the housekeeping was like.  Wi-fi was complimentary on my stay, but is normally $9.95 - I would guess it was comp'd as part of the conference package.Lame bar staff but decent rooms.  It's a bit away from anything interesting. Would recommend the Sheraton Plaza before staying here. If it's full this is an okay place to sleep.  Just know you should Uber to any restaurants.Not good. Stayed there 3 nights on the 1st floor. I had cold showers with horrible water pressure, the first floor was musty and damp. I didn't get room service for two days so they could spray freshener in my room, on the third day my room smelled like a boys locker room. I will never book this hotel ever again. At $155 a night, you better have great water pressure and clean rooms and free wifi. Wifi is $9.95 per day for guest service slow use.. Save your self some money, do not go to this hotel.The staff was friendly and great, the hotel is HORRIBLE!Not a bad little hotel, but definitely not the same high-end feel I've felt at other Sheraton locations.Goods:* Extremely friendly and helpful staff. It is unfortunate things like the printer broke while I was there and that the line at the bar for a couple nights was atrocious, but that's no biggie. Everything from check-in, to housekeeping, to asking random staff members random questions, to requesting more towels, or requesting more information about the area was a friendly and professional experience.* Bathroom was clean.* Meeting rooms we used were nice and the gal we worked with to organize our event was very helpful.* Walking distance to a number of little bars and restaurants which meant late night eating and drinking didn't require additional things like taxi fares or rental car gas.Bads:* Didn't seem as high-end as other Sheraton's I've stayed at. I think the quaint chalet, old-style feel is borderline cute. I almost feel it is barely a Category 2, personally. But take what I say with a grain of salt because I don't travel much. Note that I still gave it a ""Yay! I'm a fan."" rating.* Pillows seemed kind of awful. I had 8 total pillows in my room between 2 beds, and none of them were comfortable. And they are just the wrong size where two is too many and one is too few. They were also lumpy. Is what it is.* Walls are thin, or at least the doors are. If you plan to sleep past 8am, expect to be woken time and time again by stairway doors and other room doors opening and closing over and over and over and over and over.* SPG Gold didn't really do anything for me. I wasn't greeted in any particular way, I wasn't offered a room upgrade, and they didn't seem to have any information about the Free In-room WiFi benefit.Other than that, however, I enjoyed my stay and I had fun. The price wasn't bad and I would stay there again (though I'd probably bring my own pillow).On the basis of the friendliness of the entire hotel staff, I would like to give them at least four stars - but there are some major issues that get in the way.  First, the good stuff:- The hotel is cute, chalet- style, with every room having a little wooden balcony with a couple of chairs.- Every single staff member I've had reason personally to connect with has gone out of their way to be helpful and to meet my needs. - The room is adequate - not huge, and the bathroom is a bit squished, but overall it's okay.- If you have their ""frequent guest"" card, there is a little card saying the bottle of water in the room (which otherwise would cost $2) is complimentary.  We'll see when I get my bill.- The large, fluffy pillows are great!The not-so-good:- Accessibility - One of my meetings was on a patio. I enquired about handicap access and was led to an elevator. You take the elevator down the stairs, open a heavy (and unmarked) door, climb several stairs, walk again. Then another heavy door, and a walk to the patio.  NO, this is not ""handicap accessible.""- Security - every day when I come back from meetings, the door to my balcony is wide open. The Front Desk Manager, Adam, and I hypothesized that it was a faulty lock, and the door was pulled open when I open the main room door.  Except that we then closed it tightly, and it has not re-opened. Which brings me back to the housekeeping staff.- Beds - I'm told they do not change the sheets every day (which is okay -- but a whole week?)  Basically, what the housekeeper does every day is just throw the sheets and covers back up, and toss the pillows into an approximation of the right position. If you leave the fitted sheet slightly pulled off the mattress (I mean, if that's how it was when you woke up), that will be how it is when you go to bed. So, the best I can do is  three stars, and most of that is because of the staff's friendly and helpful attitude. Housekeeping not so much.Great price for a short stay! The bathroom is a little tight. We were able to enjoy the outdoor pool but the little man-made creek next to the pool gathers mosquitos. The staff is friendly and check in is quick.Worst experience EVER!  Moved from first room because of musty smell, second room bug in coffee and pubic hair and stains in bed.....third room musty....just happy the sheets were clean! TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!Stayed at the Sheraton Westport Lakeside Chalet Hotel this past weekend.  We were very impressed with the Hotel and our Room.  The room was clean, updated and very spacious for a 2 full-size bed room. It was great to have a balcony.  Adrianne at the front desk was very friendly and helpful.  Her upbeat attitude paved the way for a fantastic overall experience!  Would definitely stay here again.This hotel was my home away from home last weekend. My husband and I, along with several friends, were in town for a friend's wedding. Overall our experience with the hotel and their staff was extremely positive. We opted to pay a bit extra ($16 for the whole weekend) for club lounge access and were to happy we did. The lounge had a refrigerator with pop cans, bottled water, and bottled juices, as well as an expresso machine and regular food (including delicious cookies and crab rangoon). The free breakfast in the club lounge was also nearly the exact same as the one some other friends paid $15 for on Sunday morning in the restaurant on the ground level. Totally worth the $16!!! I honestly didn't spend too much time in our room, but I was quite happy with the comfort level of the beds. The staff was happy to help accomodate our request to move our room near our friends. The rooms seemed to have been recently updated and were quite roomy. The only reason for the missing 5th star is the fact that on our final morning here the hotel room had a strong mildewy smell and the shower spout is strangely short. Not sure what was up with the smell - especially since that was the first time we had experienced it. Also, I'm only 5'5"" and the shower came out of the wall at next level... very strange! Otherwise our stay here was great - I would definitely consider staying here when returning to St. Louis.Ms T's sister, her husband and niece stayed at the Chalet during an October 2010 high school softball tournament.  The teams stay together and this was the place they chose.  I guess it was OK until the final night.Apparently neither the Sheraton nor Westport Plaza is capable of providing security for guest parking.  Ms T's brother-in-law parked their Chevy Avalanche in the surface lot assuming it would be safe.  Sometime in the middle of the night they received a call asking if they meant to park it with only two wheels.  Someone had decided they liked the wheels and helped themselves.  See the photo.The family spent most of a Sunday trying to find replacements so they could drive back home.  If you choose to discount this review, I still suggest you park in the parking ramp.  It might be better.On a late arrival check in,  no one was at the  desk for almost 20 minutes.  Rooms are comfortable and large.  No wifi, in club room area you can request a code but it only lasts one hour.  It was a pain getting wifi dropped.  Next day they never made up my room at all.  Notified front desk.  Following morning no hot water,  hotel folks says it happens often this is unacceptable especially when it is 1degree outside.  Ice cold shower is not a good way to start the day.  Wish I could give zero rating.","This is a standard Sheraton, it seems to have had a recent update of decor but it is an older hotel with Very Slow elevators and some musty areas here and there.  The bathrooms are small but adequate.  What makes the hotel is the staff.  All staff are happy to see you and want to assist you.  Service from reception (really fast check in ) club lounge (I saw them go down to the kitchen to get a child a certain cereal) to housekeeping, you will be impressed.  Food is above average for a Sheraton and again the service in the restaurant was top notch.We had a great experience this past weekend for a wedding.  The rooms in the Chalet were plenty comfortable and roomy, we were upgraded to the lounge level (totally worth it if you're down for free breakfast and appetizers) Plus I may or may have not raided the soda cabinet for at least a 6 pack.  All of the staff was helpful and we never needed anything.  Parked out on the exposed lot and in spite of the weather it was fine.  The  gym is only cardio, didn't get to go swimming, but it made for a very comfortable stay, definitely a great sub 100 dollar value.Horrible hotel.  Filthy rooms.  No hot tub and no pool.  Their website lied and said there was a hot tub and a pool.  For $200 you would expect at least a pool and hot tub.  The staff was rude when we complained.  Reviews on other sites said it was a good hotel but clearly they're paying for fake reviews.  AVOID!Stayed here for work and was not disappointed. Very close to a nice shopping center with good food options. Lucked out and got an upgrade to a suite with a really nice view of town.When you hear ""chalet"" you don't really get the vibe that you are going to be staying in a room that overlooks a dumpster. A room that at 3 am you can hear loading and unloading. no, not really. The area looks like it could have been cool but there are no commercial places in the huge area that surrounds the hotel. The only real bonus was the company I was with and the woman in the parking garage was HILARIOUS. Would never ever stay here again!Um. Our room faced a dumpster. At 3am trucks were unloading goods and dumping trash. Path from garage to hotel involves no elevator if you have hands full. No wifi. Internet was incompatible with VPN. Ugh.Staff was kind enough to refund our stay, but still...will never be returning.At least they validate parking.Stayed here for work. Place is ok. Nice view and looks nice from outside. Inside is a bit rundown but its okThe Chalet is definitely the more down market of the next to each other Sheratons in Westport (the Plaza is recently remodeled and more recommended), but I have enjoyed my stays here- while the outside is dated, the rooms are comfortable and there are good dining options next door in Westport Plaza. There are worse places to stay in West STL.........like the Marriott STL West for instance.The room was comfortable, but the hallway on the fourth floor was very hot and had a smell. The elevator was extremely slow.  The rest of the facilities were very well kept.Sheraton should invest in a ventilation system for the floor or install fans.  They should also increase the speed of the elevator.  This hotel is OK for a one to two night stay.Stayed here for work for four nights and moved 2 times.  First got put on the first floor.  Typical old hotel, not a problem.  The next morning a gigantic spider was crawling around outside the bathroom.  I thought it might be the first floor problem so I asked to move to a higher floor.  The staff was very nice and understanding and moved me to the 4th floor.  So the next morning in the 4th floor...another spider.  This time, it was in my shoe that I was about to put on and just happened to see it.  Later that day, I heard buzzing in the window and found the biggest wasp I'd ever seen.  I was able to kill it with the curtains and I freaked out.  I asked if there was any nicer room...I didn't want to spend my whole time there killing bugs.  They moved me to the ""newer renovated"" part of the hotel to the 6th floor.  I didn't have any further problems there.  Once again, the staff were awesome, they offered free food and stuff, but I felt bad for complaining as it was and only took the room change.  This hotel needs a serious renovation...it's very dingy and they obviously have a bug problem.  Staff I give 5 stars, hotel...I'm being generous with 2...I couldn't wait to check out. If you stay here, ask to stay in the newly renovated part on the left hand side as you walk in the hotel lobby!!!Teenage party in hallway all night :(  Another guest tried to shut them up, failed. Staff or security did not try; although our room was within fifty feet of the front desk &amp; lobby!  Door-slamming started again at 5am.  $60 on priceline but front desk insisted $99.We were supposed to stay at this hotel for two days this week for my husband's business trip.  In fact, he was the speaker for one of the conference events in the hotel, so the room was to be complimentary for us.  When we checked in, I was impressed by the look of the lobby, although the exterior of the hotel looks rather dated.  After being given our room keys, we headed down a long hallway to our room, and I started to wonder if the carpet floors had recently been flooded because I thought I smelled water damage.  The smell got worse the further we walked, and after hearing a few dogs bark from behind closed room doors and seeing signs such as ""Do not open door.  Chow inside"", we realized that we were smelling dogs, and lots of them!Now, I adore dogs, but I do not like sleeping in rooms that smell like a kennel, so we walked back to the front desk to asked to be placed in a room that is not one in which animals are kept, nor near the barking ones. On the way back down the hall, I saw tufts of dog hair on the carpet, and my eyes were watering by the time we made it to the lobby.  The front desk worker informed us that there were no rooms away from dogs, as 300 dogs were attending a ""Chow Convention"" in the hotel!  I said I was amazed that they did not warn guests who might have allergies, and that I could not believe that there were not rooms that are set aside for people who do not want to stay where a dog has stayed.  She said, ""Well, we charge them a cleaning deposit"".  My response was, ""A lot of good that does us right now.""I next asked them to find us a room at a sister property, and she claimed that all king or queen-sized rooms were booked.  So, we had to get on the Hilton site and find a room 10 miles away from this hotel where my husband had to work the next two days.I just went in to see him at the hotel conference room here, and they have done a good job of trying to mask the kennel smell by spraying disinfectant or room deodorizer everywhere, but you can still get a whiff of the tell-tale sign of dogs.Rest assured that if you stay in a room at this hotel, it is a room that a dog has stayed in, too.We stayed here for a recent wedding and reception we attended.  It seemed like a good value for what we paid (group price).  Plus, we got the ""Club Level"" that included free breakfast and a place to hang at happy hour with free apps (alcohol not included).  Visited the pool and it wasn't too full of kids, a nice place to retreat for a few hours.  The staff seemed friendly and rooms were clean.  Reception food was very good, a higher quality than many other hotel receptions I've attended.  Much more updated inside than it looks outside.  I'd stay here again!This hotel is ridiculous... the short description: when you stay here, you're paying for the name of a Sheraton and the 'cleanliness' (which you would receive at most other hotels in the area).Here's the breakdown:1. Water was turned off at 9am until 3:30pm due to ""construction""2. Hammering and drilling started at 8 in the morning (not considerate). Other hotels that have undergone construction while I was staying there at least waited until 10am to begin. This Sheraton's decision to start so early is just a further sign of disrespect to the customer.3. No free breakfast. Just because we spent the money at the Sheraton, do they expect that we LIKE to spend money? Free breakfast is the norm... Sheraton needs to get on the ball4. Staff was irrespective to requests for blankets... it took more than an hour at night to get the blankets, and by that time i was was asleep.5. No free wifi in the rooms. WHAT? are you kidding me? I have to pay for wifi? It's almost as if I got in a time machine and went back to when wi-fi was a new technology reserved for rich people.6. They have the USA today in the lobby (a good thing)... but I can get the USA today in my room if I had an internet connectionI will never stay here again. save yourself the time, empty stomach, lack of attention, and lack of internet connect.Phenomenal hotel, great staff, wonderful facilities.If you reserve, get a room on club level and make sure you take advantage of the club lounge - cheaper drinks than the hotel bar from 5-8pm weeknights!My only complaint would have to be the hotel bartenders... the only one that's really worth the visit is Ryan - the rest are mediocre at best.My new wife and I stayed here the night of our wedding before we left for a Napa, CA honeymoon. The room was perfect and the service was excellent. I wanted to take our luggage to the hotel in morning (before check-in) so we wouldn't have to worry about it that night, and even though the room wasn't ready yet, they held the luggage and let me partially check-in. When we got there, the luggage was in our (apparently very nicely upgraded) room and check-in was super easy. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this place.It's fine for what it is - a Category 2 Starwoods property.  As long as you temper your expectations and realize this is no Taj Mahal it should be fine.  It sits in the middle of a complex with a bunch of restaurant options and has a small lake which makes for a nice little run in the morning.  If you do go on that run around the lake -- Beware of the geese!!I am suprised that i am first person rating this place. However, that is not why i am writing this. I love, love, love this place. I have been here several times in the past few years and have been pleased by both the hotel and the services for other things.I should specify this by saying that i have been here for a few conventions (gaming) and a wedding.Hotel:-The staff were helpful and nice when we needed something for the room.-The rooms were clean, nice and the beds heavenly. I love beds high off the ground, and nice and clean.-Bathrooms were nice, and every time we needed something they were they quickly.-The restaurant and bar onsite were well stocked and drinks and food delicious. Espically the breakfast buffet! yummy!The grounds itself:-Very well maintained, and kept clean.-plenty of outside places to sit.Facilities:-The ballrooms are very beautiful and so nice for both weddings and meetings, or conventions.-Plenty of space to spread out, espically with conventions because you always need a room for meetings, or a party at night. Space is good with more than 500 people comming to do things.-The lobby is wide and spacious and plenty of comfortable places to sit (i loved the little alcoves near some of the windows with window seats!)-i was impressed with how they had weddings, or more to the fact that it was seamless from the wedding, to a cocktail hour and then the reception itself. The grand ballroom was simply beautiful!Good times, Good times.Everything in the room is clean and ""moderately"" up to date. The rooms are, however, not very sound proof - my neighbors have taken many showers... The plumbing is pretty loud. Definitely nothing too disturbing. My biggest complaint would be the lack of free WiFi. They are asking $10 for 24 hours of WiFi. I feel like at this point, WiFi should be a free hotel amenity... Especially since this hotel doesn't offer a lot. Also, the door to the staircase is broken so it slams shut rather than slowly shutting like most doors. This is very loud at night. In addition to the door, the hotel attracts many families with kids. Every night and every morning kids ran down the halls - which is loud enough - but then if we were lucky, they slammed the door. On a more positive note, the bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and you could make the room very cold if you liked. There are also a lot of food choices right outside the hotel and there is only a 15 min drive to a couple of malls. For the price, the hotel was fine.Want to escape to a cottage on the lake complete with ducks and geese? That is also in the midst of a hip plaza with lots of bars? Well, then this is the hotel for you when in St. Louis. I was in a ground room floor within sight of the pool and it was perfect!! It was a patio, just like home, that was surrounded by a lake with a fountain complete with wildlife. Westport is less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel which houses all the eating and drinking imaginable. Just a real, fun great place to stay. Oh, might want to book ahead though. They get busy. The weekend I stayed there, Friday night was an Irish step dancing contest in the banquets and Saturday they were hosting the wheelchair basketball tournament. Provided quite the fodder for my group!!",Smallest bathroom Ive ever seen in a $180 a night room.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-saint-louis-downtown-saint-louis,Hilton Saint Louis Downtown,3.5,$$,74,"I stayed at Hilton at the Arch October 13th thru October 19th. I am writing this to give special acknowledgement to everyone in this hotel especially Mark Sugars the assistant general manager. I  myself am in the hotel industry and work for a Waldorf-Astoria property in Phoenix. We are part of Hilton and receive a generous employee discount at other properties. When I was looking to book my trip there were several days of my stay that were unavailable under my employee rate. I called the property and was helped by Mark. Mark was able to extend my stay during what was a very busy time in Stl since there was the rock and roll marathon and postseason baseball in downtown. His quick response and generosity was above and beyond what I expected. This was very important to me because it allowed me to extend my trip to visit my hometown, family, friends, and i was in the 1/2 marathon. What he did really changed my trip overall by allowing me extra nights. I got the pleasure to meet him in person on my arrival and he was just as courteous as he was on the phone.Everybody I encountered during my 6 nights was more then pleasant. Valet, bellman, housekeeping, bartenders and front desk consistently always acknowledged my presence. One late afternoon I went down for a margarita at the bar. Not knowing it wasn't open until 4 p.m. I asked the front desk where to go. Instead of telling me it would be open at 4 they made a phone call and gentleman came to the bar and made my drinks before they opened. Now that is service!I know what the service standard requirements are for Hilton and this property far surpassed all the other ones I've stayed at. The lobby is beautiful and immaculate. The gym was very clean and had everything I needed. My room was beautifully updated and very comfortable. The location really cant be beat.. especially if you're a baseball fan. Im counting down my days until my next visit home and this will absolutely be my first pick to stay at. So, thank you Hilton at the arch! Thank you to all the service staff for always being on point. And again, thank you Mark you truly made a difference.               AdrienneAs a Hilton honors member I like to stay consistent with my hotel selections during work travel in order to acquire points. This hotel is satisfactory but nothing amazing. I arrived without remembering to bring my travel toothbrush and toothpaste kit. The clerk informed me that they are out of stock and offered no resolution. I had to go out and buy my own which given the location, isn't the easiest to find in this area. This happened when St Louis was particularly cold and rainy so I wasn't happy about this.The rooms are not outfitted with microwaves and the entire hotel shares a single microwave located in the hotel store on the ground floor. The rooms do have a personal fridge which is nice but doesn't make sense to me given that there is no personal microwave. The rooms also do not have a hairdryer, I don't typically use one so this wasn't a problem for me but I imagine would be irritating for others coming out of the shower to realize this. You may be able to ask for one but I did not.The rooms are clean and slightly above average but the halls look dated and smell stale. The entrance is impressive but after that everything is about standard.It's the people that make this place special. I stayed here the night before my wedding and I couldn't be happier with how I was treated from check in to the check out Mark (front entrance Valet/Bellman/Superman) was extremely helpful and I would come back and stay here anytimeArrived to find a sign outside saying valet parking full, with directions to their garage.  Greeted by the valet who asked if I was on their list for valet parking.  He stated I wasn't on their list and refused to take my car.  I have a fundamental issue with a hotel that lacks enough valet parking for all of their anticipated guests.  Look, I don't care if you have to shuttle valets to another location, a hotel offering a valet service should never have to turn a guest away. At the front desk I asked for a room with a king bed.  The front desk agent was adamant that the hotel was sold out and a king bed would not be available for upgrade.When asked if I was parking a car, I explained me situation with the valet, and how poorly he handled himself.  I explained how inappropriate his behavior was, and that no hotel guest should ever be treated with such disregard.The front desk agent asked how she could help.  She suggested two beverage coupons--I don't drink.  She suggested free breakfast--I'd be at work before they even open the restaurant.  Then she suggested a room upgrade.So the same hotel that was sold out, suddenly has rooms available for upgrade.  Not just one, but three different king rooms to choose from.Not only did they insult me, but then they lied to me.As it turns out I returned my rental car to the airport and took a taxi to the hotel.I return to find my room completely dark and extremely hot.  The least they could do is leave on a night light when you check into the room.  As for the temperature the hotel has been kind enough to lock out VIP mode from their Inncom thermostat.  For the guest that means the room won't completely cool to the temperature they want, and the fan won't go to any level above low.  Pure misery in a town that routinely has 90o summer days.The sad part is I've had previous stays at this location that were decent, hope this isn't a downward trend.My boyfriend and I chose this hotel based on its close proximity to the Arch and Busch Stadium. There is another Hilton property closer to the stadium but this one had so much character! The building itself is historic and used to be a bank, so they had actually converted the bank vault into a small gift shop and business center. The decor is modern yet still had it's historic downtown charm. Our first night there, a storm had hit the city so we were stuck inside and decided to have dinner at the hotel bar. The food was delicious and service was decent. We also made use of the jacuzzi spa which was very relaxing after a long day of traveling. The room itself was small but cozy. My only complaint regarding the room was that the door was incredibly hard to open. It seemed as though the hotel had been renovated recently so perhaps new paint made it sticky or it could've been due to humidity. I had to have my boyfriend open it every time we got back to the room. The furniture in the room was in excellent condition. The bathroom is really small but for 2 people, it was fine. I also want to make note that the self parking was great (parking structure across the street). We were provided a key card that opened the door to the structure, so we felt safe going in and out. It was easy and convenient. Overall, we love this property and hope to be back again in a couple of years!Very cool looking place. stayed there for a week. Lobby employees are great. Unfortunately the room cleaning are horrible. They took money from me. I stepped on on earing from the last person that stayed in my room and it went into my foot. They never replaced my dirty towels. And also ate food out of my fridge. The manager just tells me action are being taken but nothing ever happened. I will never stay at a Hilton in my life and thanks for ruining my st Louis stay. The Hilton really made it the worst vacation I ever took.Ideal location, right downtown. There's a larger, cookie cutter Hilton closer to Busch Stadium but this has old school character and charm. We had a large corner room with a view of the Arch and it was perfect. The self-parking lot is in the building across the street. You'll get a key card which will allow you to come and go as you please...there are signs everywhere reminding you to have your key card with you at all times. The price though, being downtown, was a hefty $19+tax/night. Yikes! Easy check-in and easy check-out. Just what I like!The hotel room gets a four stars but the restaurant and bar gets -3 stars. Less than desirable food which was very slow coming out of the kitchen and extremely slow service. The bar is not any better waiting for the bartender to turn around and acknowledge we are there and then can't make the drinks requested because they are out of the mixes. We tried to print tickets at the office and the computer don't work. This was the worst experience I have ever had at a Hilton. So disappointing. They did print our tickets for us at the front desk but I had to give them my usernames and password. I'm changing that now!!!Stayed here the weekend before Thanksgiving 2015. Nice hotel. Clean, decent size, nice view of the arch. Close to a lot of activities and lots of great places to eat. We even forgot some of our luggage when we checked out and the hotel mailed it home to us at no charge. We would defiantly stay here again.Thought we were staying at the other Hilton by the ball park. Booked two days.Arrived around 5pm on a Sunday, waited about 20 minutes for valet to make an appearance. Got checked in. Yes, we are diamond members, yes that makes us have higher expectations.   The room was just okay. The air conditioner sounds like a loud truck is running. We were on the second floor with a view of the alley and building across the street. The sound proofing is non existent, we were woken up a few times by other people staying on our floor. The extra blanket in the closet, was dirty. Staff seemed neither particularly accommodating nor knowledgeable about customer service. There is no club level at this hotel, big drawback.My biggest pet peeve, is when house keeping knockoffs on the door when the DO NOT DISTURB sign is on the door. Can anyone explain this to me? The best part of the stay has been Shonda at the Starbucks bar. The gym/jacuzzi is clean. Next time we will make sure we pick the right Hilton as their level of service is on point.Stayed at this hotel last month for a business meeting, and it was a really nice experience.  Room was comfortable, a little small, but I've stayed in much smaller rooms, so it was manageable.  It had the feel of a boutique hotel, which I really liked.. Comfy bed, nice shower, good blow dryer, free wi-fi, and decent meeting room.Service was good - the person who checked me in seemed a little preoccupied, but other than that, it was good. The location is really good if you want to stay downtown. Also, they have a small Starbucks in the bar area of the lobby, but if you want a real Starbucks, there's one a few blocks away.Clean safe.everything that the HILTON Ballpark location isn't. do yourself a favor and stay here and save the your money!!! Staff is great!I haven't been here in years, but they did a nice job remodeling the rooms. I'm not too crazy about the 'modernization' of the lobby is just OK. I kinda like the old vintage look since this was an old bank. The older photos show the lobby. But it's a very nice hotel, everyone has been super friendly and helpful!Great hotel, nice staff, clean rooms, great local bars in walking distance, but not the safest place in town. If you go sight seeing, go during the day, but always keep your eyes open for shady characters.  Stadium is 2 blocks over, so if your headed to the game the is the perfect spot!WARNING: This place is swanky.Set 1 block form the Arch. Old world construction with a grand entry way. I believe this place used to be a bank? The business center is located inside an Old but HUGE Bank Vault (swanky).Valet only, tips are appreciated but everything else is comp'd. The views from the rooms are decent (assuming you get one facing waterside).Not to be confused with the much larger Hilton-Ballpark, this hotel has a great downtown location with nicely appointed rooms. The gym is also great.Fantastic Hotel in downtown St Louis. We live in St Louis but have tried several of the area hotels for 'date night' out on the town.The lights on the desk having built in USB ports was awesome. The TV was alright, the jetted tub in the suite we stayed in was awesome. Parking was a little bit of a problem, but was sorted out shortly after arriving. This is a great place to stay!Cons: have to pay for wifi, room is a little oddly arranged( bathroom is right next to bed),  no vent in the bathroom, housekeeping came super earlyNeutral: have to pay for parking, pillows on the bed Pros: beds are amazing, nice spa, great location, nice to have restaurant and bar inside, staff super sweet,Pro's;* Nice rooms- comfortable* Nice staff , very attentive* Great breakfast- free continental and 5 dollar upgrade for full* Good location- right downtown* We got free drink tickets every day* Angel at the front desk(really helpful and positive)- Rae at the bar(fast, attentive, friendly)Cons;* Loud- Our room was outside the housekeeping closet and they slam the door about 50 times between 8AM-9:30 AM. I even left them a nice note asking them to be more considerate, this just made them slam the door louder.* Lobby- We tried to have a meeting in the lobby (on a Wednesday morning we were pretty much the only ones down there) and they had 80's rock on volume 10! My wife asked the manager (guy with a red beard) if he could turn it down just a little and he said ""he would see what he could do"" - this is code for NO at that hotel. - We had to go after about 25 minutes because we could not hear each other.* Our room had a view of an alley - which on Mondays and Wednesday had a garbage truck emptying dumpsters, maybe as many as 10 from 615AM-645 AM. I think we all know what that sounds like. All and all the cons outs shine the pros for us at this hotel, so we would probably stay somewhere else next time. They get 3 stars because of the staff.Comfy room--close to everything.  Park the car and walk, for sure. SushiPizzaSteakIt's all downtown. Ballpark, river front, arch, are just a stroll away. This Hilton had a lot of vacancies, but my Gold upgrade was lacking in wow factor (just a corner room--woohoo).  Nice, clean room.  Comfy bed.","Love the old traditional style, especially compared to the sleek modern options nearby with the Hyatt and the Hilton at the Ballpark (though I did love the rooftop bar at the other Hilton)...it was a cheaper option as well.  This old bank building is beautiful, preserving the old safe in the lobby (it's a gift shop, I think) and other features.  Rooms are somewhat featureless, other than the high ceilings and old timey style light fixture.  The bathroom I had in my king room was a little on the small side, but suitable.  Modern conveniences like the flatscreen TV and free wifi made it a very comfortable and productive stay.  The elevators, though non-airconditioned and stuffy, were pretty fast- I never had to wait too long for one.  My room was located next to the service elevator though...some extraneous chatter noise from the hotel staff in the hallways were a constant, but luckily, the elevator noise wasn't too bad.  Very happy with my stay- it was very convenient to the Gateway Arch park a couple blocks away, to the convention center where I was going for work, area restaurants on Washington Ave, and to the ballpark area (to the other Hilton, with the rooftop bar).  For breakfast &amp; lunch, I went to Monty's Sandwich right next door, and to Starbucks at the Hyatt.  Check-in and check-out was a breeze, and the front desk staff was very accommodating.Stay here if you like:History, Architecture (converted bank), Convenience to Gateway Arch &amp; Washington Ave, business (free wifi).Do not stay here if you like:Modern styles, Rooftop bars, pools, Starbucks (none on site, but within walking distance to 2 close by).This is a great location if you are visiting St. Louis and don't have a car. It is close to the Metro link, which runs from the airport.  The Arch, Old Capital and baseball park are all within a very easy walk. The lady at the front desk that checked us in (Angel) did a great job. Our room was not ready, however, she took our mobile number and called us when the room was ready. She made arrangements to store our luggage and sent us on our way with good directions. The rooms are a nice size, clean and well decorated with flat screen TV, coffee maker and refrigerator in the room. Ask for a higher level room, and if you are lucky, you will get a room with a view of most of the Arch. After saying all those good things, I must register one major and one minor complaint. The minor issue was the bar tender. We got a drink one night (would have had more),and  the guy acted like it was a tremendous chore to walk down to our end of the bar to take our order. Then he brings my wife a beer without a glass, and doesn't ask if she would like one. He does bring one after she asks. All the while, he is talking to another lady (maybe he was trying to set something up for later), ignoring us. He never comes back to check on us, never asks if we want another drink or anything else. Does not bring a bill, we just leave the money for the drinks and walk away.  Needless to say, the rest of our drinking was done elsewhere.  The other issue is that in 2015, it is just expected that you stay connected to you social media, even when you travel.  The WiFi service in the room was absolutely terrible. It would connect for a minute or two and then go out.  Then repeat the same action. Oh, it worked fine the lobby, but in the room, forget about it.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay.My Husband and I chose this hotel for our 1 year anniversary. Saint Louis has always been our romantic getaway and Hilton gave us just that. We stayed over Mardi Gras weekend and never once felt like we were in party town. We arrived Friday evening and was immediately greeted by Mark ( who parked our car valet) and Alex the lovely lady at the desk. We had the Romance package and received a complimentary breakfast and two free drinks at the bar. They made us feel like family coming to stay the weekend!When we entered our room, it was NOTHING like what it used to look like. It is a historical bank building with a upscale modern touch. Our room looked brand new. We stayed in the room with a jetted tub and it was fantastic. The water pressure was wonderful and the tub is definitely big enough for two.  There is also a standing shower in there as well. Cleaning-wise everything was spotless! We do a lot of traveling and we always inspect our room top to bottom when we arrive and this passed with A ++!The room was a good size and  the drawers and a closet for our clothes. We had a side chair and desk where we set up our things. We were also greeted with chocolate covered strawberries and champagne! The bed was a queen and very comfortable to sleep on as well. We stayed a total of three nights and would absolutely recommend the Hilton downtown to anybody coming to stay. We walked to many restruants/bars etc and its also a 10 minute cab to the Soulard area where the Mardi Gras events happen. We never waited for a cab because Mark always made sure, when we were ready, he flagged one down so we weren't standing in the show! The only Con that seemed a downside is where this Hiton is downtown and doesn't have good views in there jetted tub rooms. It didn't bother us a bit though because we were out exploring STL anyway! The staff continously, throughout the whole weekend, told us happy anniversary, which felt so personal to me. Great Job!Pros:  The location is really nice.  Everything is a short walk away. The staff is really friendly. The rooms are kept well. The lobby in the rooms have a modern look.Cons:  parking and breakfast is a little pricey unless you get a package. If you are here on business, you can do about the bare minimum with the Wi-Fi that is here. Don't even think about trying to stream TV shows or movies. You don't even have the option to pay for premium Internet bandwidth.No customer service at all. I'm a Hilton guy and this place has no respect for customer care. Definitely not staying here againWe really enjoyed this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The lobby sparkled. The world outside was covered in snow and just murky, but once we walked through the doors, everything was bright and polished. I immediately noticed the large vault doors beyond the reception desk and the bellhop actually told us a little about the building and how it used to be a bank as he took us to our room. Our room was spotless and mostly comfortable. The bed was really lumpy. I realize that doesn't matter to everyone, but it bothered me. Once I fell asleep, I was fine, but it was hard to get comfortable. The bathroom was very clean, but I kept finding long black hairs folded into the towels and, even though I wasn't actually worried about the cleanliness of the towels, there was just something about finding a foreign hair on my towel. And it wasn't just one hair or one towel, it was multiple hairs on every bath towel. Maybe I'm weird. Maybe it's not even worth mentioning. I don't know.The parking was easy and convenient. It's a little pricey, in my opinion, but I guess that's because we're used to parking for free. We had a key card provided by the hotel that gave us in/out privileges for the length of our stay. The garage was right across the street, so we didn't have to go far. It was a little scary (to me) late at night, but we could've used the valet service and we didn't, so obviously we were willing to take our chances. This would have been a five star rating if not for the lumpy bed and stray hairs. That being said, I would absolutely stay here again...and maybe ask for hairless towels.This was a very nice hotel.  Clean, comfortable, courteous staff, great location.  So, why the low rating? Price.  I'm sorry but paying almost $300 for a place to sleep for the night is ridiculous.  Apparently I'm not some jet-setter, travel-savvy, bon vivant.  Just a retiree who wanted to see a hockey game.  If you have such money to throw around, this is a nice place to stay.  Otherwise, it's a lot to spend just for a place to lay your head.I honestly can't speak highly enough of this place. I recently coordinated a work training that required about 40 guest rooms and a meeting space large enough to house this many folks for 3 days. We settled on this hotel because they worked with us on getting our AV costs to line up with our budget. I received an upgrade to a nice corner room (no real view, but great room) that was complete with a little dining room table. My bed was incredibly comfortable and the housekeepers kept the room immaculate. My only issue here was the housekeeper on day one didn't restock my shampoo and conditioner, and as a former housekeeper, I think that's a pretty standard thing to do. But when I asked for more conditioner she gave me 3 bottles, so that more than made up for my minor issue.The conference room we had was large, with floor to ceiling windows and chandeliers. It was absolutely gorgeous and they set it up exactly to our requirements. All of the staff involved with this conference were so helpful and attentive, they really went above and beyond to make sure this went smoothly. I'd like to specifically point out Chris and Jason as two exceedingly helpful staff members.The bar at this place is great, the beer is cheap and the bartenders were attentive. The restaurant in the hotel was pretty mediocre, but I only ate here once so I don't know if it just happened to be an off day or something. I would definitely go back to this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone looking to host a conference, the staff is amazing and you will not be disappointed.PS- the hotel is about a block away from the Arch and if you go to Washington Street you can find a lot of really great restaurants.A pleasant surprise. Wasn't familiar with St. Louis so took my chances and went with Hilton. Great location 2 blocks from the arch. Rooms and hotel have a historic look but all modern amenities. Staff was great and accommodating to needs. Valet was fast and efficient and while I usually don't like paying for parking at a hotel they were upfront about it and didn't pressure me to go with valet. Room service breakfast was great but ended being pricey -- next time I'd go around the corner to Monty's instead. I was upgraded to a larger room but being on the 3rd floor there was still some street noise. Not a big deal but might bother some. All-in-all I really enjoyed my stay here!I stayed here Saturday and they billed me for parking, without my authorization. I had already paid the attendant at the garage when I left the hotel, then saw an additional $19.95 on my credit card. They never even mentioned this or told me they were taking this charge off my card!! Mind you the garage only charged me $11.00. This hotel is scamming people right out of their money. When I called I got transferred 3 times to reservations, I got placed on hold for long periods. Front Desk transferred me to Accounting which didn't answer so I had to leave a voice mail. A couple hours later I told them about the charge, accounting stated that I had no proof that I paid for parking in the garage (even though they don't even own the garage). I then had to request to be transferred to a manager, which also did not answer and I had to leave a voice mail. After finally getting another call back, I spoke with the Manager who simply said he would refund my money and speak with the accounting. After everything I went through he didn't seem to care one bit or say anything else. He did NOT even comment on how the charge was never mentioned and just thrown on the bill, and didn't mention how they overcharge for parking and scam the customers. Completely unsatisfied and will NEVER stay at this Hilton location again. Wasted my entire day playing phone tag.If you choose to stay here check with the parking garage for the price and don't let the hotel know you parked in their unless you want to pay double!The east tower elevators are to small and slow.  You can wait upto 10 mins for a ride.  I often just walked up 10 flights of stairs.  Even in off times, the elevators struggle with the cleaning staff using the guest elevators.  The rooms feel worn with too many parties.  My door was busted in the lower right corner.  I couldn't tell if it was physical damage or water damage.  In the bathroom, the hotel didn't install fan.  It makes it tough for shaving after a shower.   It does have a good location but I would recommend only fit people would enjoy the advantages of location and can walk stairs.The room automatic heating is twitchy.  The thermostat seems to auto reset to 70 degree, and the windows are not double pane.  The heating fan is off sync and very loud.  The room is a little cold in the winter. It might have been a 3 or 4 star hotel, but elevator time and design errors have taken its toll.Overall the hotel is nice and clean with a great location. I'm writing this review because the elevator situation in the hotel is awful. We waited 10-15 minutes on average each trip we took to our room or to the lobby. It may have had to do with the rooftop bar or the electronic touch elevator system but whatever it is I'll think twice about staying here until it's changed.Nice, quiet, charming hotel housed in a former bank in downtown St. Louis on Olive St. Keep in mind, this review is not for the livelier Hilton hotel located few blocks away with the amazing Three Sixty Rooftop bar.  I was able to make it in heels to the Three Sixty bar at the other Hilton in about a 10-15 minute walk. Not bad at all considering we were able to save some $$ by staying at this Hilton instead of the other. We have stayed here multiple times and it has always been a pleasant stay. It is typically the deal we get on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a> when we enter four star, downtown St. Louis. The entrance is beautiful--crystal chandeliers, grand piano, gray white marble floors. The rooms are smaller, but they are comfortable. We also like the noon instead of the regular 11:00am check-out time! Valet parking for $27.00/nt and self-parking for $19.00/nt.If you are staying in St. Louis there are only two hotels I would recommend...this one and the Four Seasons.  As for this one, location location location baby!  It is only an 8 minute walk from a great market, they have a restaurant and bar downstairs, and a horse and carriage ride right outside of the hotel ""something like $40/30 minutes"".  As for the employees, they were helpful enough, nothing special though, although I am always a fan of free wifi which they had :)The views were ok, and it was very central...with the baseball stadium just minutes away, as well as the St. Louis Science Center ""Which had an awesome Star Trek exhibit while I was there :)  A review on that later.And the number one reason I like this hotel...it's a 5 minute walk from the St. Louis Arch which was pretty insane to go to the top of.So again, a fairly typical hotel, but in a not so typical location, boosts it up from what would've been a 3 star to a 3.5 star :)  I give the Hiltion Hotel downtown a 3.5 out of 5 stars.Once they fixed the air-conditioner in the lobby this turned out to be a very nice hotel... especially when you consider how old the hotel is. The rooms are very nice, service and personnel were very fast with requests &amp; friendly (much more that the ball park Hilton), and they appreciate return guests.... especially Lisa at the bar (she remembered me after 15 months without a visit - you will be missed)... I do think they could look at the breakfast that they serve and make some improvements, but you don't book a hotel for the food (or do you)...overall a very nice Hilton property for a building of this age.The lobby is very nice, rich in history and architecture. The rest of the hotel is dated and semi cheap feeling. In my opinion the category five rating Hilton gives this hotel for awards points is drastically skewed. I unfortunately didn't have the pleasure of a great stay for five days on business. My room(#513) had all the amenities one would expect with the higher end Hilton chain hotels but lacked in maintenance. The air conditioner sounded as if you were traveling in a twin prop plane and chug to cool the room at times. The bed and carpeting was worn and looked old. This particular room is cave like, tall windows oddly placed looking directly into a office building and over an alley way with minimum daylight entry. On a plus side my room did have a refrigerator, which comes in very handy while on an extended stay. The service end of my stay was for the most part pleasant, just one hiccup on a room service experience. All the staff I encountered were friendly and accommodating. The location is centrally located with the Arch being two blocks away and the stadiums being within walking distance. There is a grocer/market up the street a few blocks and plenty of eateries in the surrounding area. On my next stay in St. Louis, I will most likely opt for a different chain.It is always nice to see a building re-purposed and this Hilton has successfully accomplished that task.  This old bank has been turned into what appears to be a grande dame of a hotel.  Even the bank vault has found new life as the shop and business center in the lobby.  Rooms and fabrics are starting to look as if they need a re-do as well as some of the mechanicals (somewhat noisy AC unit near my room).  Housekeeping and their supervision need to pay more attention to details.  When walking in my room, I was greeted by a used tissue on the floor and the closet hadn't been resupplied.  Front desk and bell staff were all very courteous and informative.  Federal Reserve, Gateway Arch and convention center are all within easy walking distance.  There's nothing wrong with the hotel but nothing particularly stands out either.This is my go-to hotel in downtown St. Louis. Close to dining, the Arch, ballpark etc. I would give it 5 stars but the dining here has historically held them back. They re-branded themselves with the 400 Olive restaurant so hopefully they can regain some of the downtown dining crowd. Ruths Chris is right down the street at the Hyatt.This is a very nice hotel overall. It was a bank many years ago so the interior and lobby are very nice.Hilton in saint Louis never disappoints!!! We've have beautiful rooms with wonderful views of the city!!! I love it here :)When I lived in Arnold, whenever I wanted to go get annihilated in St. Louis, my friends and I would usually get a room at either this Hilton or the Hilton Ball Park. This Hilton is closer to Laclede's where a lot of nightlife happens around. However, it really isn't that much closer than the ball park one.They do have their own parking lot next door but you have to pay $20 something a night for a pass. If you go across the street to the parking lot there, it's about $3 a night. This is a little secret that not a lot of people know about. The staff there is really helpful and friendly. They have their own bar which is kind of small and their own restaurant for breakfast and dinners. If you get a free breakfast voucher, you can use it at this place and the breakfast is actually really good. They have salmon among other things. The rooms are really clean and the bed is super comfortable. You also get free internet too. A night on the weekend usually comes out to a little over $100.","Stayed here when I came into town for the Thanksgiving holiday, and couldn't have been more pleased with my hotel. Good sized room, king bed, free wifi, and in a downtown location...definitely made up for the few minor drawbacks here. While I loved the location, and the hospitality of the hotel staff, I doubt I'd stay here for more than a night or two on any given visit. There's no real ""on street"" parking, save for the 2 metered spaces opposite the hotel. Valet is $27 a night, and parking in their parking deck on 4th St. is $18 nightly if you self park. I consistently came in after 3am while I was visiting, and both Brian &amp; Tim at the front desk told me that I was welcome to park in their drop off/valet lane out front...no charge. Awesome staff, great housekeeping staff, and the room had most of the comforts of home...4*!I stayed here for a conference that was being held at the Ball Park Hilton which is a much more posh spot, though I think this building is a historic landmark.I was pretty satisfied with the service. The front desk staff was friendly at all hours and gave you good suggestions and directions for downtown St. Louis.A+ for the water temperature And pressure. These things matter people! It was also nice that housekeeping didn't come hounding us at the crack of dawnI stayed here for a week on business.  I believe part of the hotel is an old bank which you can ascertain from the large vault located in the lobby.  The staff was very friendly and I was checked in promptly.  The room itself was a little old world for me in terms of the fixtures and architecture of the building.  It reminded me a little bit of a haunted house but that was just my perception.  The food was decent and the bar had a good selection of drinks.  The only downside to the place was that I ended up getting sick for 2 days and worked from my room.  I had a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the outside of my door but I could hear housekeeping talking loudly which not only disrupted my work but kept me from resting while trying to get rid of my cold.  I would stay here again but it wouldn't be my first choice in the Saint Louis area.Very impressed by the very friendly and accommodating staff. Bartenders, front desk, manager, cleaning/housekeeping....EVERYONE was so friendly and helpful. This hotel will be one of our Go-to hotels to stay at when we revisit St. Louis. There's an asian restaurant across the street and we ordered take out one night because we wanted to to enjoy our room together without being out in public. I would VERY much recommend the garlic chicken wings!! it sounds strange, but they were sooooo good! The hotel also has a nice gym to work out, a bar (small, but nice) and restaurant (not impressed, but still OKAY place to eat) and a hot tub in a separate room next to the gym. (NOT A POOL, which I""m totally ok with) My husband and I went to the whirlpool to relax after and entire day of walking around St. Louis, hiking and going on long outdoor adventures. It was soooooo nice to sit in there and just soak after our long day of fun. Much needed, and almost felt like we were visiting a spa, no one else was around, and it was peaceful. Again, the staff was very helpful with directions on places to find things, places to go and places to eat. They exceeded our 3 star expectations and we were treated like royalty for a whole week! it felt so nice to feel somewhat pampered.  And the housekeeping, cleaned our room every day. Lekita and -------- did such a wonderful job cleaning our room, they were so friendly and helpful with suggestions as to fun things to do and places to visit. And it was nice making small talk with them as we were going in and out all the time.In conclusion, would we stay here again, definitely. Free bottled water chilled in your fridge when you arrive. Very nice and welcoming. The room smelled fresh and crisp and clean when we walked into our room. Free WiFi in rooms while you are staying there. Only downfall I guess would be no microwave in the room. My husband and I go out to eat for all our meals when we vacation...it would be nice to warm up leftovers from going out to eat. I can't say enough good things about how nice the staff was. I would recommend staying there...also great location to the arch! walking distance, a plus.Hyatt's never disappoint and am very satisfied with this one. Outside of building is dated and can be a sore while looking at the magnificence of The Arch.  My pillow case smelled like cigarette smoke but there were plenty of others to use. The gym is fantastic, but wouldn't expect anything less from them. Location is perfect for a visit to the arch or to a ball game.....did both. The Brewhouse is okay. Menu is pretty lame and they don't show soccer, then, you are not a sports bar!!! Breakfast at Red is okay. Omelet lady didn't even acknowledge me for a minute I was there.Awesome atmosphere and roomsOur time at the Hilton was short and sweet, literally less than 24 hrs.  Check in was after 10:30pm but was quick and effortlessly. The room was small but the bed was amazing, I love a great hotel bed with fantastic sheets and tons of pillows. We did not eat in the restaurant but had a few drinks in the hotel bar, which was nice, but small and insanely packed with a large herd of lawyers or stockbrokers, it seemed they were all from an office near by. Good drinks, almost too generous of a pour though, I usually judge a bar or bartender by their ability to make a nice dirty martini, let's just say one martini was enough for me. I would stay here again, the room was a steal as a last minute booking through price line. The hotel seems to cater more to business people, but it is downtown St. Louis.  I believe they do offer valet parking, but it was so late and easier to park at the garage across the street, less expensive as well.As the other reviews have mentioned, this is a restored building and is quite charming.  The lobby and communal area is decorated in an 19th century style (minus the sofas) and has an inviting atmosphere.  Compared to other 4 star hotels, this one doesn't feel as stuffy and the staff is personable.  The room I got was on the narrow side with 2 double beds.  The mattresses were ok, but a but too soft for me.  Being that it was an older building, I was concerned the heating would not be sufficient.  However the thermostat moderated the temperature perfectly and the hot water ran consistently in the bathroom.  Self parking is $18 per day and ins and outs are allowed.  The structure is across the street so you will have to walk outside on a cold/rainy day.  They have a bar and a restaurant inside the hotel as well if you don't want to venture out in the cold for some eats and drink.Nice hotel in a re-purposed bank building.  The staff was very friendly and the space well kept.  Just a minute walk from the arch and a few minutes away from some very tasty restaurants.Great example of what I've come to rely on as a Hilton Honors member.  They have done a great job maintaining this older building in downtown STL.  The lobby is beautiful-- a small bar sits off to the side-- big enough to grab a drink and watch the game.Rooms are of adequate size, especially considering this is a hotel in a large city.  Two free bottles of water are a nice amenity as well.  Parking is around $15/night in the deck across the street-- a steal as compared to the $52/night I usually have to pay while in downtown Chicago.  Nice bathrooms-- strong shower, very clean hotel.  Staff is very friendly.  You can't go wrong with this property-- great location as well.  Oh, and free Wifi!Conveniently located right downtown, aka the name, this hotel was super close to most everything. It is well kept, and moderately decorated. But far from upscale if that is what you were expecting. The Hotel only features 2-queen bedrooms, or 1-king bedrooms. All standard rooms. They feature no Suites at all. Also parking here is not free. You park next door in an adjacent parking garage for $15-18.Breakfast is also not complimentary. The mornign we were there was a Sunday and Breakfast started at $11. WiFi is complimentary tho, a nice added feature not found in many downtown STL hotels. This Hilton also features very upscale shampoo/conditioner/lotions in your bedroom, as well as a complimentary bottle of water.This wasn't decadence, but reasonably priced and nicely furnished and centrally located makes this a good selection for staying in downtown STLOy... Overnight work trip to St. Louis, I decided to stay at the Hilton downtown since my fiance was traveling with me.Not the most pleasant experience, which reflects more of the city than perhaps just the hotel.PSA: Segregation is alive and well in the South (and the ""south"" begins in St. Louis)Now...where do I start with this hotel:At check-in: The lady (and i'm using the term very generously) would uncomfortably stare at my fiance and I.(Perhaps it's because we are ""different"" - read; interracial couple?)(Dear Management, please... consider giving your staff sensitivity training. That will clear up a lot of non verbal cues they give off)The courtesies accorded at hotels upon check-in: Alerting the customer(s) to room number - epic failDirecting the customer(s) to the elevator/how to work the secured elevator (your keycard will have to be inserted prior to selecting your room floor) - non existent(Dear Management, please remind your staff how important customer service is to the Hilton Group. Perhaps you can enforce it better?)So, I'm in St. Louis to see Maps &amp; Atlases. This amazing show lasts well into the early morning of the next day. My dime I've got with me isn't feeling so hot and I'm not wanting to drive the 4 and 1/2 hours back home. On the way out of the venue, I see the Hilton St. Louis Downtown. My first thought is the Motel 6 just to crash for a few, but then I ask myself ""Why shouldn't I be balling hard?"" and don't have a good reason, so, next thing I know I'm in the plush lobby getting us set up. The hotel smells fantastic everywhere and things don't look ""used"". Two things that most hotels can't help but lack. The room was clean, plush, and had all the amenities those who frequent luxury hotels have come to expect. The night time view of the famous arch refused to allow you to close the curtains. Super comfortable beds and bedding. I called the front desk and told them that we had checked in early that morning and were not feeling well. They courteously extended our check out time until late afternoon. The room service breakfast was excellent and brought to the room in a timely manner.Cons: Quoted $89/night on the phone. Paid $120 - they do not inform you about the numerous taxes and fees, NOR are they upfront and honest about the $20 you will pay for parking in the lot across the street. Don't be fooled - this seems like a good price for a hotel, but with extra fees, it is a rip off for the size of room you get.  Pros: Bed is really comfortable. Room was insulated enough that we were never disturbed by neighbors. Cool designs, really like the way they designed it.I really wanted to like this hotel, and for the most part, I did. Let me highlight the things I liked. The location is great.  A quick walk to the Gateway Arch, Laclede's Landing and the Rams stadium. There are great restaurants close by. The staff seemed pretty friendly. The rooms were quite comfortable (especially the beds). It is about a 4-block walk to the metro which isn't that bad (during the day).  Now... the one overwhelming negative about our stay. My wife was in the bathroom washing her face and reached over to grab a hand towel. As she was bringing the towel to her face she noticed 5 or 6 hairs on it. Little black curly hairs. They were apparently placed on the towel at the part that was covered by the rag that overlaps the two hand towels. This was DISGUSTING! Here is a pic: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi45.tinypic.com%2Ft528t3.jpg&amp;s=49e4bc05d83073450f08b753d54cedaaaa87b7fbb3355db694a60751715ac088"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">i45.tinypic.com/t528t3.j...</a> Thankfully she noticed it BEFORE drying her face. My only guess is that some young punks stayed in the room before us, and placed them there thinking it would be a funny prank (it was not funny). Since they were still there when we got the room, that tells us that at least the cleaning staff for this particular room doesn't replace the towels if they look like they haven't been used. GROSS! If they don't replace the towels, what else do they not replace? I spoke with the manager on duty and he was very nice and apologetic. He truly wanted to make things right. I turned down a few offers and reluctantly agreed to ""dinner on the house"" once I realized he was not gonna let us walk out of there without him doing something to say he was sorry. We didn't do the dinner though... I wasn't bringing it to his attention for a comp but was just wanting to make sure that he knew so he could insure this never happened to any other guests.  Besides this, the rest of our stay was fantastic and would have garnered a 5-star rating. As long as I don't see more reviews like this, I will maybe give them a second chance the next time we are in St. Louis. However, not hearing back from Hilton corporate after sharing our experience gives me pause.My husband and I stayed here over a weekend for a wedding in downtown St. Louis. The hotel lobby is gorgeous and the staff was very friendly and helpful upon check-in. I personally felt that the room was small for the price but I imagine this to be typical of a downtown hotel on a weekend when the Cardinals were in town. We loved how central the hotel was to everything (we chose not to rent a car due to to per night fee to park at the hotel). My only compliant was the a/c- by Saturday night the room was 80 degrees and the a/c just couldn't keep up. The front desk offered to bring us a fan but at 3 am I just wanted to sleep and then check out. Overall a nice hotel but I hoped for a bit more for the $.Worst sound proofing in the history of my hotels experience.  You should not be able to hear a telephone ring from the room next door. Or guests just chatting from the hallway.  Very loud+ when I called a manager about the problem, he said it wasn't a room problem but a guest problem.   Lobby was historic looking, but not very encouraging to lounge and hang out.  positive things+ free bottled water in the fridge and coffee maker in room+drappery blocks out the ligtht.+ within walking distance to the archI'm coming back to St. Louis and in November and already have a different hotel booked, the Hyatt which is a block closer to the Arch and looks like it's going to be so much better.This Hilton is a refurbished old-style hotel in the heart of the downtown business district, a stone's throw from the old courthouse and a couple of blocks from the arch.  The rooms are done up pretty nicely but there are limits given the structural limitations (old buildings had small bathrooms and some rooms have a view of the alley).  Bed was comfortable and overall I enjoyed my stay here.  I would give this location a slight edge over Hilton at the Ballpark, about a 5 minute walk away.Overall, this Hilton is pretty decent.  They upgraded me to a corner room which had a large bathroom area and workspace - definitely a good thing when you're on business travel.  I had a couple glasses of cabernet at the bar downstairs and had a good conversation with the bartender - she was helpful with cool places around the area.  The workout room has everything you need and more and was very clean with plenty of tvs playing my favorite channel - ESPN.  It isn't as upscale as some of the other Hilton I've stayed at and does lack a concierge lounge for diamond members which they didn't compensate for.  Would I stay here again??....Sure, but only if the Hilton Ballpark isn't oversold next time.I really wanted to give this hotel 5 stars the first day we were there. Its BEAUTIFUL, the location is great, the concierge was helpful, the rooms were spacious and clean, and its reasonably priced for this kind of hotel.But there was a big problem on our last day. As we made our way to the elevator to go downstairs for breakfast, we noticed a pretty disgusting smell that seemed to come from the garbage can located in front of the elevator on our floor. It smelled like someone set dog crap on fire in the garbage can and then threw rotten eggs over it. When we got downstairs we informed the front desk of the situation on our floor, but when we went back up about 30 minutes later, the smell was still there. In fact, the smell was still there when we checked out a few hours later. Not even the garbage bag had been changed.In my opinion, things like that should be taken care of rather quickly at any hotel, especially at a Hilton.","The Three Sixty Rooftop Bar is a great place to unwind after a long day on the road.  The drinks were good, reasonably priced for a major hotel and Shannon took great care of us.  The view of the city, especially the Arch and Stadium were great.  Make sure you get there early though.  It gets crowded around 6PM.Stayed here for 2 weeks. Bartenders and servers are great, but this hotel is run down. Reported that the ice machine on my floor wasnt working, but it never got fixed (in 2 weeks). My Coke machine on my floor was out of Diet and Coke Zero for 2 weeks. Any trash that was in my room that wasn't specifically placed in the trash can wasn't thrown away (drycleaning plastic, coke cans, etc). One elevator requires a card and one doesn't (that's reeeeaaallllly annoying after 2 weeks of sometime having to swipe in). $8 service charge on room service (not including tip). Oh and laundry was outragous (a couple hundred bucks). I'm considering switching to another company or at least non-hilton proper after this...worste hilton experience I've had. Oh, and my coworker had his bathroom flood from the sink 3 times (which he reported), but didn't get fixed. This place is not worth the money. I am a Hilton fan, but it has really been that bad.Great room, loved the whirlpool bath tub! Nice and clean!Stay in every time I'm in St. Louis.  Rooms are clean.  Restaurant is good for breakfast.  Really enjoy staying here.My room was spotless!!! I loved the location and we had a nice view of the Arch from our room. There's a Panera Bread and a hot dog stand about a block away (not a hot dog fan-but his were the BEST)-this hotel was close to sightseeing AND public transit. The housekeeping staff did a wonderful job-it's a lovely hotel...I'm giving 4 stars because the front desk clerk had a bit of an attitude problem.If you walk in, you probably wouldn't realize that you're in a Hilton.  The chain surprisingly maintained its boutique hotel roots with a beautiful lobby and personal (non-generic) rooms.Four star hotel, four star review.  This historic restoration was one of the nicer hotels that I have been to in travels.  Being someone who prefers a more contemporary feel to a hotel, This 4-star Hilton ranks as number 3 on my list, for the 4-star hotels that I have been to.  Truth be told, the ranking comes for my tastes leaning towards a more contemporary decor.  This hotel is definitely a nice hotel, but it could go for better lighting in the rooms (they always felt dark), and LCD TV's to replace the old models, to give it a more luxury feel.Some of the things I did like about the hotel, is first the bodywash that was provided.  Hotel soap always dries my skin, and the body-wash was a great addition.  The hotel concierge was also really helpful.  Free internet (a first for 4-star hotels on my list) was a great bonus.Good job to Hilton for this hotel.This a really beautiful historically significant 1889 building that has been lovingly restored.  Once called the Merchant Laclede building, it was home to a number of banks.  Some of the vaults were left in place in the lobby, kind of a fun touch.The staff here is really great - I came down with a deadly flu once while here on business and they could not have been nicer.  They actually went out and got me a thermometer and sent tons of extra water up to my room &amp; offered to call a doctor for me.  The rooms can be somewhat noisy (8 story building facing alleys/construction on a couple of sides), so they are very kind about remembering to place a box fan in my room so I can sleep.  If you stay here a couple of times, they remember your name and even the doormen greet you by name as you enter the hotel - nice touch. They call and check to make sure everything is okay a bit after you've checked in - so thoughful, I love the staff here! I've never been invited to an Honors reception here and I'm a HD.  Perhaps they don't have them?Room service is hit and miss - typical for a Hilton (I'm sorry Hilton Executive Towers in Portland, your room service is PERFECT always).  Servers are very friendly, but orders seem to be screwed up on a pretty regular basis.  I had a wedge salad, french onion soup &amp; potato skins tonight for dinner (I'm a nibbler).  The soup was really great, the salad fresh, but they forgot my skins.  I called down and asked if they could send them up, and they very promptly did, but they seemed like they had been tossed back under the heat lamp before delivery as they were rather burned.  My advice - keep your order simple and you should be fine. Breakfast buffet is quite good and the bar off the lobby is friendly and warm, much more comfortable than most hotel bars.  Also, the bartenders are really, really nice.Rooms are oddly laid out, which is understandable in light of the fact that this is a restored property, but not uncomfortable.  Fairly up to date decor, mini-fridge in every room, and recently rehabbed bathrooms make this a fairly comfortable stay.  Avoid rooms near the service elevators, they are very noisy.Overall, my favorite hotel in downtown St. Louis.  Character, friendly and helpful staff, easy access to downtown St. Louis.Very satisfied with our stay. We were there for 3 nights and from the moment we checked in the staff was very welcoming and friendly ( Mark who checked us in was great!). Our room was very nice for the price we paid. Everything was very clean, beds were comfy, TV was big. I definitely will be staying here again next time I am in St. Louis. Only compliant - they forgot to put a room service menu in our room. When we called and asked for one they did not send one up for an hour, and by then we had already just ordered food from somewhere else (Imo's Pizza - horrible experience, whole other review). Last word - went out with a friend Friday night, and when we got to the door realized it was raining. Thought I would chance it and ask the front desk for an umbrella - sure enough they had a nice big one that they gave us without even telling us we had to bring it back or anything (which of course we did much later in the night). Anyways - great experience, really enjoyed myself.i made a reservation for 1 night. when i got there my plans changed and i asked if i could stay 2 nights. The front desk said no problem. the next morning i saw my receipt under my door which means they thought i was in for 1 night instead of 2. i called the front desk and a woman said sorry we only have smoking rooms available and you need to switch rooms. I hung up the phone and thought to myself.. is this really how i should be treated? I am a diamond member with hilton! this should not have happened! i called back and a man answered the front desk this time. the man told me he could put me in a non smoking room.. why is it that the woman said only smoking was avail and the man said he could put me into a non smoking room ?!  i am so happy i did not have to switch hotels. ok now let's talk about parking and room service. I HATE HOW THE PARKING LOT IS ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE HOTEL! and when i ordered a salad through room service it was drenched in salad dressing and very unpleasant to eat...i would expect more from hilton.I can only give this a mini review based on 5 hours of being there.  So here goes.. The hotel is downtown, I was meeting a bridal party there in order to do their makeup.  The lobby was nice, but I expected more for a 'Hilton' hotel.  I stood there, in the lobby area, for 30 minutes.  During this time, not ONE employee asked me if I needed help with anything or if they could assist me.  Several employees passed me by.  The key to the room wouldn't work correctly in the elevator, so someone had to assist.. and we had to find that someone.  The actualy hotel (not the lobby) was not that great, kind of plain.. nothing exceptional.  The room.. well, the room was very small. I could barely turn around in the bathroom.. now, I'm sure there are probably larger suites.. but for being such a small room I would hope they would make up for it with bedding and decor.. but it wasn't anything to write home about.  Lastly, I asked the front desk attendants if they would validate my ticket since I wasn't there for too long and I'm a makeup artist for a bridal party.. they said NO.  Okay, that was that.. left a bitter taste in my mouth.The place was as close to the arch as you can get without sleeping on the river.  It has been a hotel since 1924 and has some charm from that era--great old floors, some bank vaults, a bit of art deco.  My girlfriend and I had an enjoyable two night stay in a funky shaped corner room.  We're yelping this because we want to give advice about the overpriced hotel parking: Try the Mansion House public lot right across the street for $8.00 (what we paid) instead of the $18.00 they charge at the hotel.  Do not use the hotel parking if you're a cheapskate like me.  Also, the staff there were tremendously friendly, and the Kona coffee in the setup just outside the elevator is worth a try.Always friendly staff. Clean rooms and a reasonable rate.  Merchants bar is a bit small but great staff.The Hilton St. Louis Downtown is a charming historic renovation in the heart of St. Louis.  Our room was incredibly spacious, the beds were quite comfortable, and the bathroom amenities were very nice.  Our view wasn't that spectacular, but we were there to see St. Louis - not to sit in the hotel room.  This hotel is a fantastic alternative to the other large (and somewhat) sterile chain hotels in downtown St. Louis.",,"['arch', '13th', '19th', 'writing', 'give', 'special', 'everyone', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-plaza-hotel-st-louis-saint-louis,Drury Plaza Hotel-St Louis,4.0,$$,70,"I stayed at the St. Louis Drury at the Arch in July 2015 with my family and had another wonderful Drury experience.  Based on my past experiences with the Drury hotel chain, this is my preferred hotel when traveling.  I feel they give you so many extras without trying to nickel and dime you like many hotel chains are doing more and more.The Drury is located a short 7 minute walk to the Arch, and even shorter to the Old Courthouse.The hotel is very well maintained and cleaned.  The lobby is large, nicely decorated, and very comfortable.  The staff were all very friendly, helpful, and professional.  Self parking in a garage attached to the hotel is $16 per day.On the 8th floor the hotel as an indoor pool and two jacuzzi's, open from 9am - 10pm.  There is also a small but adequate gym also on the 8th floor, open 24 hours a day.  There is also a small pantry market, an ATM machine, and a small business center with 2 computers, a printer, and a copy machine.This is a secure building that requires a key card to access the parking structure, gym, and pool.  Some of the rooms offer a partial view of the Arch and the river.All of the Drury hotels offer a free hot breakfast with lots of food choices.  Around 5pm they also have a ""Kickback"" which is three free drinks (beer, wine, cocktails), and food.  Although they don't call it dinner, it's enough to be dinner.  My family never wanted to eat anything else after the Kickback.The room was very medium size, nicely decorated, very clean and well maintained.  It had a desk/chair, a recliner, mini-frig, microwave, coffee maker, iron/board, medium size HD flatscreen television with lots of cable channels and free HBO, but no PPV.  The beds and pillow were very comfortable.The bathroom was  small, but clean and well maintained.  It was mostly granite and marble.  The sink was outside, and the tub/shower and toilet was separate.Again,  I feel the Drury chain works real hard to earn your business, and they value you as a customer.  I have never had a bad experience at any of the Drury's I have stayed.I looked forward to staying here again, next time I'm visiting St. Louis.I usually stay at the Hilton or the Drury Inn @ Union Station.  We stayed at the Drury Plaza this time.  It is an older building with cool architecture right down by the Arch.  We were participating in the Hot Chocolate race over the weekend and spent the night before the race.  It is on a one way street, so keep that in mind.  Also, to park while you check in can get VERY congested.  I ended up scraping my car in one of the piles while trying to park as I was told not to park in the ""bus"" lane.  Not happy with that.  Another thing to keep in mind BEFORE you try to park in the garage attached to the hotel, you need to check in first.  We ended up being out in the parking garage down the street ($14/night hotel rate).  The hotel lobby was beautiful and spacious.   It was nice that you needed your room key to call the elevator.  We were in room 608 and had a nice view of downtown and a partial view of the Arch (did not pay for the ""upgraded"" arch view).  Some rooms do face into the interior of the hotel - keep that in mind.  They do have a happy hour - however, it was super crowded and the line for the alcohol was soooo long, we skipped it.  We were okay with that, though.  The breakfast was very good the next morning after the race.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The 2 queen room was quite spacious and had a microwave and mini refrigerator.  The bathroom was HUGE and had dispensers for H2O shampoos, conditioner and body wash. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it highly.  You can walk to anything downtown.I really have nothing negative to say about my experience here. It was in a great location and we had a great view of the Old Courthouse from our room (sad there is so much construction going on in that area). The room was super clean and the service from everyone working here was great. The free breakfast is decent if you want something quick before heading out, the kickback is nice but everything was really crowded this weekend with a few teen tournaments happening. The only complaint I have is that I booked two beds back in September, and only got 2 king size in the room. Minor error and it worked out fine, just was no preferred. Other than that I recommend this hotel if you are staying in the St. Louis area.Came to St Louis for business. Stayed for 3 nights. Room was clean. Free food and drinks were good for breakfast and dinner. Indoor garage was warm toasty and didnt have to worry about walking out in the freezing winter to the car. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful especially at the front desk, dining area, gym and maintenance tech. I would come back again.Great location.  Very nice.  Clean and great staff.  Recommended for family.  Nice views and good food.How does this hotel make money!?  Free breakfast; popcorn and fountain drinks starting at 3pm; 3 alcoholic beverages and dinner options from 5:30-7pm. Did I mention free coffee the entire day?  Unheard of!The hotel is located across from the arch; two blocks from Busch stadium; 3 blocks from the Citygarden.  It's located walking distance from almost all tourist attractions. We received really good service during our stay. We booked a suite and it was spacious enough.  I liked that the toilette had its own room, separate from the jacuzzi tub and shower. This was my second time staying here and they've made some improvements. I would definitely stay here again.Very Efficient, Friendly and fast service/Check-in!  I was surprised as you don't see and get this kind of service on a same day booking as I did!  Enjoyed our 1 night stay and only wish I had more time just to enjoy the Beautiful Suite room I received!  Mahalo (Thank you) from Hawaii!!!Did I stay at the same hotel as other Yelpers? Drury Plaza at the Arch? Seems I did; but my experience was hardly out-of-this-world. This is a cheap hotel. Some people seek out cheap hotels and they'll probably love this property as it's likely better than some of the competition in this quality/price range. That said, personally, after one stay here, I would not return.The best thing about this hotel is location. Steps from the Arch. Blocks from Busch Stadium. You can't get a better location than this. An OK thing about this hotel is the freebies. Free breakfast, free alcohol, free junk food, free soda, free wi-fi. They don't nickel and dime for the most part, and that's nice. Problem is that none of these freebies are all that good (except the wi-fi, which was the fastest hotel Wi-Fi I've ever seen). By the third morning the only thing I could eat at the breakfast bar without fearing my stomach being twisted into knots were muffins and boxed cereal. By far the worst thing about this hotel is the guest rooms, particularly the ""interior"" rooms. I unfortunately got stuck in one of these rooms, and by the second day I was a zombie. You don't often realize how important natural light is to sleep patterns until it's gone. Rooms are clean enough (ie. don't look under the mattress or the bed). The deep red carpeting and ancient furniture makes the rooms feel dark and dated. My room had an extremely pungent fragrant smell like they were trying to cover something up. I spent as little time as possible in my room during the trip to St. Louis because it felt just so depressing. Customer service is hit-or-miss. Some hotel staff were very friendly to me. Though I also had exceptionally bad customer service while trying to buy some overpriced bottled waters in the little store off the lobby.Service is not something what you should expect in this hotel. Not very friendly staff at the dinning area. Gym equipments are very outdated.We booked this hotel in particular due to reviews on various travel sites such as Tripadvisor and Expedia.  I definitely would not agree with any of the sites that rate the rooms as ""exceptional"" or ""#6 hotel in all of St. Louis.""  I would however, probably stay here again.They gave us a much earlier check-in than requested which was very nice considering we had 5 hours to kill until regular check-in time. Upon arriving at our room, being the clean-freak that I am, we scour everything before unpacking - and to our dismay found several items unclean and one absolutely unacceptable.  Pulling the sheets back on one of the beds revealed dry crusty boogers (with nose hair included) on the sheet. I called the front desk but due to it being so early no other rooms were available. They sent room service up immediately and changed everything on the bed. For the hassle they comped our parking fees which was also considerate of them - even though we shouldn't have had boogers in our bed in the first place.The furniture was old and beat up, the arm chair was stained and just worn out, the arms were dirty and the headrest was discolored a dark brown.  They obviously don't dust either, I posted a picture of the desk in the room, I swiped the ledge and it was filthy. One night I dropped something that rolled under the bed...where I found popcorn from the last guests so I am assuming they didn't vacuum. Just another reason I won't walk barefoot on hotel carpet!Customer service was exceptional, everyone we encountered was very friendly.The free breakfast and free drink/dinner was a great perk. We enjoyed all the breakfast foods, we did not partake in the dinner meal, just the drinks. They give you a coupon for 3 drinks per evening, we stuck to beer but they offered all sorts of adult beverages. The lines for both dinner and drinks can get long so I would advise to get there early, or get there late!The parking garage is sort of a joke - VERY tiny spaces, I'm sure to get the most out of it, but just be careful maneuvering, I imagine there has been some small accidents in there.Free Wi-Fi which is nice, we were expecting to visit the pool but after seeing it thought we would spare ourselves. It is inside, dark and dreary and the chlorine was so overpowering I'm not sure we would have made it out alive if we swam. Most of the time there were a lot of small children going to/from the pool and swimming in pee just doesn't do it for me.When I decided to make a trip home my friend from Indy decided that she wanted to come home to St. Louis too. We decided to take a few days and catch a Cardinals game and go to the NFL draft event in Ballpark Village. They are within a block or two of the hotel. She decided on the Drury for the free breakfast and the free Happy Hour that's included with your stay. I have to say their breakfast is pretty large for free. It definitely beats any free breakfast included in any hotel that I've been too. Happy hour I had two glasses of wine and popcorn. Perfect for a little pregaming before we went out. They have a pool and jacuzzi. It closes though at 10. We tried to use it after going out, but it already was closed. The staff was super polite. The housekeepers always looked me in the eye and told me ""Good Morning."" There was plenty of parking in the enclosed garage. Overall my stay was pleasant.First, I'm not a big Drury Inn fan, but this is a well run hotel and is very well located to everything downtown. Also had great food. I will stay here again.So many things wrong, where to begin?  Basic comforts are lacking at this hotel.  The towels are so rough there literally is no need to exfoliate in the shower, drying off with one of them takes care of that.  The sheets in the bed must be 100 thread count and the pillows are old,misshaped, and have stained pillowcases on them. The general hotel just looks old and not clean.  The very dark carpets throughout the hotel are stained and look very dirty. There was popcorn spilled on the floor of one of the 3 busy lobby elevators early Sunday evening.  I noticed it remained there when I last took the elevator Tuesday morning!  The fitness room is a joke.  A small, outdated, can't breathe because of all the chlorine from the indoor pool right next door, joke.  The funnier joke is the hard and thin hand towels, I mean ""pool towels"".  We were supposed to stay for our week long stay but ended up checking out after 2 nights because it was just gross and not pleasant. Went to the Hyatt next door for $10 less a night and so far so much better.The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because the staff I interacted with was pleasant and the free breakfast was one of the best free hotel breakfasts I have had.I've stayed this hotel twice when in St. Louis. It is one of my favorite places to stay. The staff is incredibly helpful and friendly and the rooms are awesome. The only downside is the screaming children running around in the summertime. The extras are a really nice addition to the hotel, food included always makes me happy and their breakfast in the morning is amazing. I will stay at this hotel anytime I'm in St. Louis because I love it that much!  It is in walking distance to most of the tourist attractions in the area. I will admit the parking garage is incredibly scary, like it's out of a horror movie, but the hotel itself is worth it.  :)Had a wonderful stay at the Drury Inn &amp; Suite in St. Louis. A short hop, skip and a jump from The Arch - Gateway to the West. Really lovely hotel, wonderful staff and the room was perfect. We were so happy with our stay, the rates and the amenities we decided to stay at Drury's for the rest of our cross country trip!The hotel was nice. Great location. We walked everywhere. You have to check in before parking as you will need your room key to gain access to the $16 /day parking. Our room had a great view of the arch. We decided to take advantage of the free extras and headed down for breakfast. Totally jammed packed with people. My pancakes were undercooked...gross! Free popcorn and soda a plus. We didnt get a chance to take advantage of the other free food.but the evening food looked more impressive than breakfast.Wow, I am very impressed with my stay at the Drury Plaza. It was my first time visiting St. Louis and based on reviews on Yelp, made the decision to choose the Drury Plaza, and I am so glad I did. Firstly, a one night two queen size beds and a corner room was very inexpensive considering the location of the hotel (right next to the Arch), and all the amenities the hotel offers. My friend and I stayed on the 10th floor and had a view of the Arch from our window, it was very cool. The beds were comfortable and there is a TV with tons of channels. Only downside is the bathroom was pretty small. Also, FREE FOOD! They have a kick back at 5:30-7 where you get a drink ticket valid for 3 drinks (mixed drinks, wine, beer), which was really cool. I've never stayed at a hotel that offered this. The food they serve is ok, but I mean it's free. While I didn't care for the pasta or meat balls, they also served hotdogs and nachos which luckily was pretty good. We unfortunately missed breakfast. Customer service here was top notch, from the people working the desk to the servers and bartender during the kickback, everyone was so kind and accommodating. We also were even able to do a later check out (12PM instead of 11am) which was great. Oh, the only major drawback in my book is the parking. We had to park at Ball Park stadium which is about a block away. Parking is $14 overnight and you have to leave the garage by 2PM. Based on my experience here, I am more likely going to choose staying at Drury Inn/Plaza hotels in the future.My husband and I made St. Louis our pit stop on our way from Wisconsin back to Nashville so we could be tourists.  We chose the Drury because of it's location and for being the best price among the others, what a great decision!  Everyone we talked to on staff was super nice.  The lobby is very pretty with a couple fountains and big chandeliers, they have happy hour until 7:00 with OPEN bar and FREE apps, we got some beer wine and shockingly delicious mac and cheese.  Their garage is located right inside the hotel, very secure with garage doors and you can get to it from the elevators from any floor, so convenient and nice!  We payed a little extra for a room with a view of the arch and it was gorgeous.  Nice size room with updated bathroom and LOTS of windows for arch viewing.  We were able to walk to dinner and to the ""bar scene"" and back to the hotel no problem, we slept with the curtains open so we could enjoy the view as we drifted off and again as the sun came up.  Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in St. Louis.It's an absolutely beautiful hotel. With nice natural park-esque common areas on every floor. The lobby is absolutely gorgeous and the service could not be nicer. Plus, it was walking distance to the Arch, Right Field, and the Rams's Stadium. Amazing location!Honestly, I wasn't the biggest fan of the rooms. I thought they were a little dank and dated and not as impressive as the lobby or even the hallways and common areas. Everything seemed a little Holiday Inn-esque, which wasn't what I was expecting at all. A little too old-fashioned (and I usually like traditional furniture). I also was not a fan of the shampoo/conditioner/shower gel. I understand that the dispensers is a great idea in terms of optimization, but the quality was terrible. My hair is not high maintenance and after that wash felt dry and unwashed. The toothpaste was also abysmal. Bring your own toiletries for sure!There are a lot of great perks though, which bumped this up to a four stars from me.- Free breakfast (6-9AM) of sausage, oatmeal, powdered eggs, yogurt, fruit, and milk. - Free dinner (5:30-7PM) with hot dogs, chicken tenders, baked potatoes, mac 'n cheese, and a cocktail bar with three complimentary drinks for my stay.- Free popcorn and soda after dinner (till 10PM).Honestly one of the best hotel stays we have had.  Weeks after coming back to San Francisco, my husband and I still find ourselves missing Drury!  It's nothing impressive looking from the outside, but the inside is clean, well maintained, beautiful, and the best amenities you could ask for.  We got a corner suite, which was BEAUTIFUL and included a living room, bathroom, and bedroom with windows covering two walls.  The bed was super soft and comfortable, and the room was always clean and comfortable.Breakfast is included in the stay which consists of scrambled eggs (not overcooked!), potatoes, sausage, pancakes, omelettes, donuts, muffins, and basically anything else you would want in a continental hotel breakfast.  Yes, it's an unhealthy hotel breakfast, but it's a good one that I looked forward to every morning!In the afternoon/evening they serve ""hot and cold apps"" which basically means an awesome artery clogging junk food dinner if you want it to be.  They have chicken strips, mac and cheese, hot dogs, salad, and free drinks!!  My husband was elated with the free Johnny Walker that he got each afternoon.What I miss the most is the fresh popcorn every night on my way up to my room.  I seriously became addicted to this stuff, and it may have started a bad habit of eating popcorn every night.There is free wifi throughout the hotel and in the rooms.  Parking is pricey at $16/day, but that's not unusual compared to the surrounding hotels in this area.  There is a free business center and printer.  I did not use the laundry services, gym, or pool but they are available.Everyone here was so friendly, and I really did feel like this was a home away from home for my handful of days in St. Louis.  I just wish Drury would make their way out to the West Coast because this hotel definitely convinced me that Drury is one of my favorite places to stay!","I stayed here for an interview. I arrived late and the front doors were shut. Thankfully someone saw me and opened the door. When I booked the room I made sure it was a non-smoking room. To my surprised they put me in a smoking room.... there are STILL smoking rooms these days?? I told her I was severely allergic to smoke and need to request a room change but they said that the cleaning crew 'de-smoked' it and I should be fine....It wasn't fine. My hair dryer also stopped working. I had a hard time breathing throughout the night, my face broke out in hives... yes, if I could give this place a 0, I would.I very seldom take the time to review, but the outstanding experience I had at the Drury Plaza Hotel prompted me to write:For starters, the hotel is older, but extremely well kempt.  The room was clean and had a very comfortable bed.  Free breakfast and afternoon food were great and free, yes free, happy hour was a PLUS!  Also, you cannot beat free wifi (that was fast as well)!  But the staff is what made this stay great.  I can tell you that I did not meet even one unhappy or grumpy employee.  EVERY one was friendly, helpful and went out of their way to make this stay the very best!   It is so nice to experience suck great customer service and great work ethic!  You will see me again!This place wasn't too bad. It was very average. I nice place to stay if you will only be there for a weekend or a night. The beds were comfy the bathrooms were nice. They have free breakfast in the morning and that was pretty good. They even had hot dogs. The pool was pretty nice too. It included a hot tub.Coming into St. Louis we decided to stop for the night so we got a queen sized room. The people at the front desk were very friendly and the room was also very nice. Definitely worth the price.We got to stay just a night and our experience was amazing! For a King sized bedroom at $109.99 it was well worth it. You walk into this beautiful lobby with a mural and a water fountain. The front desk personnel were really nice and greeted you with a smile once u walked up. Once ur done getting ur room they usually have a valet but we got here kinda late so we self parked but I was still very impressed. It was a security garage parking where u need ur room key to open it and once you park u can ride the elevator straight to ur floor. The room was beautiful! The bed was soo soft it felt like you were sleeping on a cloud. The pillows were exactly the same. My goodness I think the bed was what made the whole room that much better. Two things why this didn't get the 5th star... 1) the view we had was of a building under construction. 2) the restroom didn't have a vent or fan so when somebody forgot to courtesy flush everyone knew it lol but other than that, best hotel I've ever been in!!!I had an amazing view of the arch from my room. The price and location were great. The free breakfast and happy hour were nice, but the food was meh and finding a table during these times was a frustrating experience.OK. Let me get this straight. I can stay in a beautiful hotel downtown St. Louis 100 yds from the arch, 2 blocks from Busch stadium, get free breakfast buffet for the entire family, free parking, pool w/2 hot tubs and they give me a late checkout, access to the parking garage for a couple extra hours and I only pay $99?????? I just became a huge fan of Drury Hotels!! I honestly can't find anything to complain about...sorry :)  OK. THE WEATHER SUCKS!!Drury is our favorite family friendly hotel chain, but I have never encountered as friendly staff as I did at this particular Drury. Even the cleaning staff go out of their way to create a positive vibe.The service is awesome. (Getting to the negative quick cuz I want to give good hypes for this place - had issues with payment not being split evenly among my roommates and had to check upon it multiple times. so it does get annoying but ultimately it was handled properly) The location is GREAT! Right next to the Arc and for the cost of the place, it was amazing. They have the dispenser shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, so there's plenty for multiple people. and it's a lot more green. The business center is quite small but it gets the work done. There's a gym on the 8th floor, which is typical and normal. The breakfast is HOT breakfast :) With the entire spread of eggs, sausage, pancakes, bread, cereal, etc. REALLY great. They also had something called kick-back at 5:30 PM and that's not just some chip and salsa. It's a legit full-on meal. It can definitely help you save some money if that's one of your goals for the trip.This is my 3rd time staying here and have always had great service from staff. Location of this hotel is amazing because it's only steps away from the Arch.  The rooms have always been clean and the complimentary breakfast is pretty good.Maybe I'm a little snobish when it comes to hotels at this point.  I checked in here recently and upon entering I was impressed with the lobby.  Unfortunately the rooms don't really match that elegance at all.  They seem pretty dated, although they are large in square footage.  The bathrooms are pretty nice but the ceilings are office style acoustical and that just screams 1975.  The good things were the happy hour and the breakfast offered.  It's a pretty decent collection of hot foods, hot dogs, chips, suasage, eggs, buscuits and gravy.  Not too shabby.  And they offer 3 drinks during that time.Service was fine and the check in was quick and easy.How can you go wrong with 3 free drinks for happy hour each night? I didn't dare go near their plaza of heart stopping HH food choices (hot dogs, mac and cheese, etc) but those are free too if you were a hotel guest.Conference rooms were ok, a little stuffy and cramped but like many other conference rooms I have been in before.  Had a nice little spread of coffee and ice water in the back which was cool.The rooms were standard, clean, and the water is SUPER hot in the room.  This specific hotel is located across the street from the arch and food choices were pretty limited for a walking radius.  We ended up walking about 20 min each direction to find something other than Ruth's Chris steakhouse.  Overall, not bad and it did the trick!This is a great hotel right by the arch. I stopped here during my cross-country trip with two dogs. The pet few was small and the staff was friendly. I would stay here again.Nice , clean rooms with up to date accommodations matching the price.  Nice location &amp; staff.Front desk staff are very friendly and helpful. Free breakfast, dinner and drinks while you stay in hotel. Bed was comfortable.  Hotel is walking distance to Cardinals Baseball Field.Super Friendly staff!! Everything is well maintained and cleanliness was 5 star. Double queen room was a bit small for 4 for my liking. Free drinks and apps from 5:30-7 at the bar was a nice addition. 2 blocks from Busch Stadium and 7blocks from the Dome. Placement was amazing. Plenty of near by bars and restaurants.  I would stay again.In preparations for our jaunt across the country, I started looking for inexpensive but not too sketchy hotels; I ended up booking hotels through four different sites -- Orbitz, American Express, AAA, and Drury.  The best deal for this particular hotel was found through Drury's website, using the eSaver code, I was able to book a room with two queen beds and a partial view of the Arch for around $160, which included parking in the hotel's in-building lot.We arrived late in the evening, sadly after the evening reception and drinks, which sounded like it was amazing.  There is a little alcove out front near where horse carriages often stop; we pulled up there and I went to check in.  The parking lot in the building has very narrow, angled parking spots, which can be tricky to navigate.  For a partial view, I was expecting to maybe see a corner of the Arch, but our room faced the river and we had a pretty good view!  The Arch, riverfront park and the historic downtown area were within easy walking distance, so it was great for our very short stay to be close to everything.  The room and bathroom were clean enough, although I was a little surprised at how cheap and small the bath towels were.  Breakfast the next morning was excellent -- in fact, this hotel pretty much spoiled us for the rest of our trip.  There were pancakes, sausage patties, fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, breads and muffins, an assortment of teas and juices.A little pricier than some of the other options in the area, but worth it for the convenient location and amenities.I was able to get this hotel at the last minute a few days ago. My boyfriend and I are in tons for the Cardinals and Dodgers game. When I gave Drury Hotel a call they stated that they only had smoking rooms left. I was in a bind so I took it and they stated they would have the room smoked out for me. They also  accepted dogs as well with a pet fee at $10 per night for cleaning up the rooms after the pet. They also have a parking garage which was $16 a night with in and out privileges. They also offer state employee discounts but once I got to the hotel the front desk stated that you had be Missouri state employee. The clerk went ahead and gave me the discount anyway since I was already told that I would receive it. Once I got to my room it did not smell like a room that was smoked out. I came well prepared just in case this happened. I had my can of Lysol and a air freshener. Overall this hotel is at a central location and close to everything. I also liked the fact that it wasn't very far from Busch stadium so could walk to the game instead of worrying about parking. The front desk staff was very friendly and nice. I will definitely book at this hotel the next time I'm in St. Louis, Missouri.This was a great hotel for the price point. We had a nice, big clean room with a helpful and accommodating staff. We did have to pay $16 for valet parking, but it was in the center of the city, near the ballpark, and this is par for the course with this kind of set up. The breakfast was the standard hot breakfast buffet, with the exception of organic granola, which was a nice touch. The main dining area was huge with lots of tables and a very friendly staff. Overall, it was a great experience for a one night stay in a new city. I'd recommend it to others. Nice job Drury Plaza!In all of my travels, this has got to be one of the best deals that I have ever gotten for the price, location, quality, and cleanliness.I knew that I'd be passing through on the train, and wouldn't have a rental car, so I looked on the web for one that was centrally located. I knew enough to know that I didn't want to be in the same neighborhood as the train stations, and so I came across this one was right across from The Arch; read some of the reviews; and booked via their website with an online special at $99 p/night!The place is a fairly good size, very clean, and nicely appointed for a nice 3-star hotel.  Lobby had lots of seating for hanging out with the wi-fi.They gave me a corner/end room with lots of windows that overook the skyline and a view of The Arch, which was pretty exhilerating in the morning sunlight. The room was fairly new and clean, and the matress was pretty comfortable. The free breakfast buffet was one of the better ones that I have been to with hot items such as scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, etc. in addition to the typical fruit, cereals, and pastries. Lastly, The Gateway Arch was across the street, as with the Old Courthouse, and the park trails. If you feel like a short walk, you can walk to Lacledes Landing, which is the arts and entertainment disctrict on the riverfront.","I was in town for a conference and the Drury Plaza at the Arch was one of the conference hotels.  The Drury Plaza at the Arch had a strange front door that took a few seconds to figure out, a rotating one a bit further down, and a welcoming lobby hosted by Lewis and Clark with Sacagawea and baby Jean Baptiste Charbonneau strapped to her back.  The expanded lobby had a sort of old world feel - part heavy ornate wooden table and chairs with a variety of levels divided by heavy wooden balusters.  It seemed to fit the overall theme of the hotel.The front desk staff was very helpful and accommodating.  They pointed out places of interest, including a few good places to eat nearby.  And helped with taxis and such.  They were concerned about tornadoes in the area and discussed defensive procedures clearly to all the patrons of the hotel.The rooms were nice.  The beds very large, but may be a little soft for some. There were pillows galore - four in all. I was lucky to have a window to the outside world; not all rooms have this luxury, so be sure to ask for a window if you enjoy the sunlight and nightlife for that matter.  The AC is a bit noisy and blew directly on my head the whole stay; there didn't seem to be any way to adjust the wind direction; that was a negative.The star may have been the food at the Drury Plaza at the Arch.  They have a real hot breakfast buffet - pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausage, and potatoes.  That is accompanied by a variety of toast-able breads, cereal, donuts, yogurt, and portable fruit (oranges, apples, and banana).  My only issue was it was the same exact breakfast every single day; you may need a change after a few days.Every evening at 5.30, there's a sort of happy hour.  Grownup patrons of the hotel are allowed three free adult beverages.  There is also a buffet of hot dogs, fries, mac and cheese, chicken fingers, etc.  It's bar food.  The hotel was overrun by Cardinals fans most of the time I was there; it was there pregame and within walking distance of Busch Stadium.  So, the alcohol line stayed pretty well attended; the bar food seemed easier to grab and go.Overall, the Drury Plaza at the Arch was a great hotel that was convenience to most places.  It has a nice breakfast and a happy hour.  The rooms are nice as well.   If you don't like the Cardinals or large crowds, you might want to pay careful attention to their home schedule or stay a bit away from Busch Stadium.  I wonder if it's the same when the Rams are in town.Beautiful hotel! After staying a night here I'm now a big fan. Right by the arch and perfect location! 5 stars!!!I like this particular Drury Inn for its convenient location, great value and the classy rooms. The location just cannot be beat.  It is across the street from The Arch; there are restaurants, museums, and stadiums within 1-2 blocks walk.  The value:  The complimentary breakfast beats any other ""hot breakfast"" at other mid priced hotels I have stayed.  Selection was great and quantity was great, too.  They kept refilling those big trays!   AND...there is that happy hour around 5PM.  We each got 2 free drink (yes, not just beer and wine, but mixed drinks, too) tickets.  And then there are the hot dogs, baked potato, nachos and such.  While the food offering is not the most exciting, but if you have a family with kids, it is definitely going to be enough to save you at least $50 on dinner.And the rooms were nicely decorated in the classic style.  While the rooms were not large, but the bathrooms were newly remodeled and very clean and roomy.I would definitely stay here again the next time I am in St. Louis.I stayed one night here on a business trip.  I wasn't excited by the idea of a Drury Inn, but it was a really nice plce in a great location. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from Busch Stadium and pretty much next door to the Arch. My room was nothing special, but it clean.Upon check-in, I was presented with a card good for 3 drinks the night of my stay during happy hour.  Happy hour was fantastic.  The 3 drinks were small, and the beer available was the local favorite (Bud Light), but for free it was nice.  Also included in happy hour was a variety of food choices on a serve yourself buffet including baked potatoes, chicken fingers, and nachos.The hotel is also dog friendly.Met my boyfriends dad and uncle for the weekend in St. Louis. I got to pick to hotel so I picked a cheap yet nice hotel near everything. I was very impressed! Great service (they let us check in WAY early!!!) comfortable beds and you simply cannot beat our city view! :) we will be back St. Louis! You can count on that!!!!We drive to Las Vegas about once a year.  Out of all of the hotels we've stayed at this one is probably our favorite.  It's better than the hotels we've paid twice the price for and that's without all of the free amenities offered.If you want to be downtown, this is the way to go.  You could not be closer to the arch.  Parking is $15 a day, but is worth it for the convenience.  Once you're checked-in and parked, you really don't have anything else to pay for.  The Wi-Fi is free and fast.  Free breakfast, dinner, plenty of free drinks for adults, and they even have popcorn available in the lobby if that isn't enough.  I don't mind paying for food, at all.  I would usually pass up a free meal, if there is something better nearby.  They have a buffet of free food available in the evening, which is surprisingly very good.  Also when you get your free drinks, ask for a double and you'll save time on your trips back to the bar.The pool/hot tub were clean and uncrowded both times we went, keeping in mind we were here during the week.  They also have a nice 24-hour exercise facility, if you're into that type of thing. For the price you can't beat it.Great choice if you want to be downtown!My husband &amp; I have had the pleasure of staying at two different Drury Inns and we make it an effort to stay if we are near a location. This specific location does NOT disappoint. It is literally right across the street from the famous St. Louis Arch. You cannot get any closer unless you slept in the park!One of the 'perks' of the Drury Inn is that they offer a pretty great breakfast as well as a 'happy' hour in the evening. The menu is mostly bachelor food (nachos, hot dogs, hamburgers) but we ate enough to skip a 'real' dinner that night. This location was also very large and offers two indoor pools. I wish I had known and had my swim suit with. They do have on-site parking but it is $15/day but makes it nice to feel secure in a 'downtown' location as well as being able to walk to everything nearby. Busch Stadium (where the Cardinals play) is about 2 blocks away. Perfect location and I'd stay again if coming through St. Louis!For a reasonable price, you get a clean room, modern hotel, and lots of freebies.  Get in line EARLY moochers, because people pile up for the free THREE drinks and free food buffet at happy hour.  They also have a free breakfast buffet.The lobby has a life size bronze statue/art installation/fountain of Lewis and Clark.  Weird, but awesome.  Parking (with FREE in/out) is only $12 and right across the street.Free wifi!The location is one block from the Arch.  Stay here!This is the best hotel in down town STL I've stayed in.  Lot's of good about this place being that it has a lot of competition around the down town area.  Breakfast and Free Drinks like a couple of their competetors.  Big rooms/Bathrooms.   My only complaint is that the room was musty smelling  I believe we stayed in room 627 if anyone from the hotel cares to deodorize the room.   I guess I could complain about no on site parking or Valet option either, but it wasn't a huge deal.  If I'd had my family with me, I might have lowered the star rating for having to drag my 3 year old and all the crap he and my wife travel with over a block to the hotel.  At least valet my car... I will pay for this simple service.Randomly picked this place since it was near the arch. We arrived to a really friendly staff who immediately informed us that we were entitled to complementary happy hour drinks, food, and breakfast... Room was clean and comfy.. Free internet too.. Nice deal!This is my FAVORITE Hotel!   We had never stayed at a Drury Hotel before.  From now on I will seek them out when we are traveling.   The room was great and in top shape.   Every evening  (from 5 - 7:00) they offer free drinks and food!   I'm talking about 3 alcoholic drinks for every adult in your room.  They serve free soda, coffee, popcorn from 3-10:00 pm.   The food consists of baked potatoes, salads, chips, salsa and nacho cheese, hot dogs....... (too many items to list).   In the morning they also offer an awesome hot breakfast--eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, freshly made pancakes, donuts, muffins.......    Everything is fantastic!   They even have table service that will clean up after you.     We definitely will be back here!   Another awesome plus for this hotel is, it is directly across from the Arch in Saint Louis.   Great views from the hotel, and so easy to simply walk across the street to get to the Arch.   Highly recommend!Clean  hotel, great location and friendly staff. Reasonably priced for a downtown hotel.We had a fantastic stay here. All staff was very courteous and friendly and the room was very clean. We would stay again anytime.Absolutely friendly staff and super convenient for I-70 travellers who want to stop and spend a day or two enjoying the Gateway Arch, the Museum of Westward Expansion, the Old Cathedral, the waterfront, and the Old Courthouse - all just steps away. Location and parking ($15/night) are another convenience in case you want a quick drive to the Jefferson Barracks, Calvary &amp; Bellafountain Cemeteries, St. Charles, etc. or just to get back onto I-70.Clean room and bathroom, comfortable bed, and awesome hot breakfast.  They even upgraded us to a room with a view of the Arch - terrific at night and at sunrise!We're first-timers to the Drury line (we're usually at mainstream hotels) and were pleasantly surprised and impressed!   You want to stay here!I am giving it four stars because the staff is just great.  The rooms themselves are clean but a little out dated and the carpeting in some of the rooms are in need of upgrade.  Aside from that, you get free breakfast, free dinner snacks during happy hour and it's in a very good location.The location is great.  Close to the arch, the ball field and bars and restaurants.  The staff is super....from the front desk to the servers at breakfast.  They go out of their way to provide great service.  Beds and linens were very comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this hotel.What a greeeeeeat experience!  My husband and I decided to surprise our sons with a unique Christmas gift this year.  We booked Christmas Eve night at this hotel.  I called ahead of time and asked for them to get ""special treatment"" during our visit, since this was a Christmas gift.  I spoke to a manager (Areanna).  It was woooonderful!When we walked in the door, there was a sign at the front desk welcoming our boys to the hotel and wishing them a Merry Christmas!  How nice!  They will remember this experience for life!!!  They also greeted them with gift bags with some miscellaneous items.  It was great!The room was nice.  The hot food, popcorn, and soda in the lobby throughout the evening was terrific.  The hot breakfast the next morning was wonderful.  We felt veeeery secure.  You had to use your key to get on the elevator to go to the rooms and to go from the garage into the bldg.  The price was extremely reasonable for all that we got.  The only negative was the price for parking.  Geeeeeeeez...$16 is a little outrageous!  $10 would be more reasonable.It was a great experience, and we HIGHLY recommend this place to others!  Areanna was the BEST!  I'm sorry her shift ended shortly after we arrived.  :o(The Drury was fantastic! We stayed on the 10th floor and were amazed by the view of the arch..literally outside our window. Also, the hotel has great security and we felt our car was very safe at all times. In addition, the hotel offered a 'kickback' to their guests which basically consisted of a free happy hour where they offered various hot apps, wine and mixed drinks all complimentary. The kickback was wonderful an the compliment breakfast in the morning was even better! Everything from scrambled eggs and sausage to homefries and biscuits. All in all we love our stay here and would absolutely return again---highly recommend!Do your business here, people!The staff are super friendly, the hotel itself is very nice, and it's a great value!  They have a happy hour in the evening with free food and drinks, and other freebies (and a cheesy motto about all of their 'extras')The best example of service: I left a really nice skirt in my room.  When I realized it and called about it a week later, the housekeeping department promptly returned my call, said they did indeed have the skirt and would be happy to ship it to me FREE OF CHARGE! Which they promptly did. :-)","Stayed here for Urbana missions conference two weeks ago and I loved it! The hotel is right near the arch. The front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful and the rooms were clean and comfortable. There's also a complimentary hot breakfast every morning and its actually good (eggs, sausage, pancakes,etc). They also serve light food at around 5pm like nachos and hotdogs. Next time I'm in St. Louis I'll definitely be staying here!The quick take - great for families, not so great for girls or couples having a nice night on the town.Other than that, I have to say it's a good price for what you get.  Free snacks and (exceptionally weak) drinks at happy hour and free breakfast, which is nice.  But, when that's your hook, it tends to get super overcrowded with loud, messy kids.  The pool was really crowded, and the water consequently gross and dirty.  Our room didn't have a window that faced outside and was laid out very strangely.  I shot up at 8:30 in the morning having no idea what time it was.  When your window faces the brightly lit hallway, 2:30 am looks the same as noon.  Weird.I was very impressed - unbeatable location, tremendously friendly staff, all around terrific customer service, a clean, comfy room. Added bonuses - complimentary drinks and a free, delicious breakfast. Thoroughly enjoyed the place, recommend it for all - oh, and the price wasn't terrible either.Very nice hotel, the staff was very friendly. If you want to take part of the free breakfast and dinner/drinks you need to get to the lobby early.This hotel gets great reviews, but make sure you know what you're getting. The location is fantastic and near everything in downtown St. Louis. You do pay for parking, but it is not unreasonable. The small lot in the building frequently fills up on weekends and we were put at the lot down the street. It's not too far, but getting there would be a drag in the rain and in the winter. Our room was fairly clean. I'm a nut about hair and yes, I found hair on the blankets - yuck! The bathroom was clean but incredibly small. Some of the rooms have sinks outside the bathroom, but ours was inside so only 1 person could get ready at a time. The towels are paper thin and scratchy. It was convenient that they provided body wash, shampoo &amp; conditioner in the shower (attached to the wall). Plastic cups are used for the the bathroom. I can't imagine how many they through away each day. Pillows and mattresses are just okay. Never made it to evening happy hour but we did breakfast both days. Food was okay, but they frequently ran out of items, coffee, silverwear, etc. There were not enough people to clean the tables, so it was hard to find somewhere to sit. The floor was unbelievably sticky near the food area both days. I know it's free and that's great, but they really are not geared up for the weekend crowds. Our daughter attempted to use the pool, but the water was so murky so got out quickly. It was also unbelievably crowded, just like all other areas of the hotel.This review is long overdue. We were in st. Louis in August with our granddaughters.  Our stay was delightful. The desk clerk Sharron was wonderful.  We travel with our grandchildren often and will look for the Drury hotel wherever we go.We stayed here recently for a few nights while in town for a conference. Overall enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  Liked the evening reception with free drinks and heavy snacks/light dinner.  Breakfast is included as well, and reasonably varied.  The location is very convenient for all the downtown sights.  Wouldn't mind staying here again on another visit to St. Louis.A reasonably priced hotel in Downtown St. Louis. It's not fancy, it doesn't have room service or any of the high-end perks of nicer hotels. But it's clean, well maintained, and has useful extras. The wi-fi is good and free. There is free breakfast (which is good), and free popcorn in the evening. We were never around for happy hour, but I hear they offer free drinks in the lobby in the early evening. The hotel also has a parking garage (an extra $15/day), a steakhouse next door and a Max and Erma's off the lobby. Next time we're in St. Louis, we'll probably stay here again.This place was perfect! It is half a block to the arch, few blocks to the ballpark. The rooms are clean, and pretty modern. Parking garage - $15/for your entire stay. Free breakfast that was actually good - a little cut throat but when you mix free food and people it's never pretty. They also offer 3 free drinks/night at Happy Hour. Great location, excellent service, I would recommend this to anyone staying in St. Louis! Average price is like $125/nightOverall I enjoyed my stay there. Everything was top notch, with the exception of the room cleaning staff. They could have done a better job. Below is a breakdown of the hotel's features.Cleanliness: Things in the lobby area was pretty spotless. Very clean and the restaurant staff do a good job of maintaining things during breakfast and ""Happy Hour"". However, the people that clean the rooms could use some more training I think. First of all, when I came into my room there was toilet paper in the toilet. Gross. The rest of the room looked ok, with the exception of some dust. There was some dust issues in the hallways as well (over fixtures, fireboxes, etc). I don't have strong allergies to such, however some people might have problems with this. When they cleaned my room the first time, they didn't really vacuum the floor well (there was still things left behind), and they didn't replenish the toilet paper. The sink wasn't cleaned very well either. The next time they cleaned, they did a better job. Though they vacuuming could have been better, and they didn't dust either time. This is an area the hotel could easily remedy.Location: Its downtown, directly across from the Arch. Lots of things in the area: bars, restaurants, attractions, transit, Busch Stadium, etc etc. Service: They were all very friendly and attentive. They do well in this area.Decor: Its a comfortable 3 star hotel. The lobby is very, very cool. Water features, and quite spacious. Art work all over the place. Very nice.Beds/Room: Soft and comfortable. Pillows are nice, both feather and foam. Room was spacious. Some of them have a view; mine did not.Extras: Breakfast is free and quite good. Scrambled eggs, sausage, pastery items, gravy, cereals, milk, juices, pancakes, etc. They have popcorn until 10pm (It starts around 4 or 5 I think) in the lobby. They have all day softdrinks as well. From 5:30pm until 7:00pm they have their Kickback time. This is free to all guests. You can get up to 3 free alcoholic drinks (not overly strong, but they weren't bad). They also have hot food items. This is salad, baked potatos, hotdogs, nachos, pretzels, chips, meatballs, chicken fingers, vegatable eggrolls, as well as spicey chicken bites. These are all free and in a buffet style setup. You can eat as much as you want. Internet: They have both wired (ethernet) and wireless (wi-fi) internt in the rooms and common areas. It is a highspeed connection, which wasn't too slow. They also have 2 computers in their ""business center"" area. Those are a bit dated and slow. Also, their Excell program wouldn't opening my documents for some reason. It worked fine on my own computer and office computer. Parking: They have a parking garage, which is pretty tight spacewise. SUV's might have a hard time of it. Also, it costs $15.00 a night.Security. Your room key will be needed to access almost everything. Seriously. They take security VERY seriously. Its needed to get into the parking garage, to get onto all elevators, to get into the stairs, to get off at any floor via stairs except floor 1, to get into the hotel after hours, etc etc. I felt very secure, which is nice since downtown St. Louis can seem a bit scary.Misc. They have a pool and jacuzzi. Which are nice. Also a fitness center, which was basic but not too bad. Room service is Carmines Steakhouse which is next door. Expensive, but really good food. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance however. Overall, I really liked my stay at the hotel. It was awesome with the exception of the room cleanliness. If the hotel would tighten a bit on the cleaning staff in the rooms/halls, it would be a really great place to stay. Its the only area I think they could work on.",,"['arch', '2015', 'family', 'another', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'based', 'past', 'experiences', 'hotel', 'chain', 'preferred', 'hotel', 'traveling',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheshire-st-louis,The Cheshire,4.0,$$,80,"What a wonderful hotel! 15 minutes to anywhere in St. Louis too - so convenient. The interior of the hotel is wonderful - fancy with just the right amount of ""kitsch"". The staff are amazing - from the front desk to the valets to the bartenders. Especially Lawanda at the front desk. :) Our room was very nice with a comfortable bed and a newly remodeled bathroom. We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed the Fox and Tavern pub, the on-site Starbucks, and the very cool basement bar Basso.We highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to St. Louis.Three simple words: WORST... CUSTOMER... SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This ""hotel"" offers sub-par rooms for being an ""alleged"" 4-star hotel. The rooms are dark, creepy and not updated at all. There is nothing that can make you want to stay there. No warmth, no comfort, but especially no premium-feel, which you would usually expect in the 4-star category.The kicker is though, that after we booked this hotel through Priceline and arrived fairly late, we walked into the room and looked at each other saying: there is no way we're staying here! Walked back to the front desk and explained our concerns to Dave, the gentleman who worked there that night. He was very apologetic and understanding and after we asked what can be done, now that we don't want to stay there, he referred to Priceline as the the party that needs to be addressed and that we should call basically the same night and not the next day in order to have the best chances of getting this issue resolved. We felt like Dave really wanted to help us here... at least initially, but not later on.Later that night we called Priceline and they had to call the hotel in order to work out a solution, meaning the hotel refunding the charge for the night that we effectively never stayed there. Priceline called us back after talking to Dave and his answer to Priceline was: Sorry, our hotel policy is that there are no refunds through Priceline. So Priceline's hands were tied. Thanks Dave, thanks management for ripping customers off without them even using your service.I cannot stress enough how much I do NOT recommend staying at this hotel, they just want your money and are not willing to make you as a customer happy.We were in town for my son's wedding at Forest Park. We enjoyed our stay immensely.  Bree and Brittney helped with the scheduling of rooms.  I had to make a few changes, they were done quickly and efficiently. We came in very late Thursday night or more like Friday morning, Dave was working the front desk and he was very accommodating. We actually ran into him several times over the weekend because of the late hours for our events and he was always a welcoming face no matter what hour of the morning! We had a very attentive valet, Jural, that helped us several times over the weekend because we had a large truck that would not fit into the garage. Jural diligently kept a spot for us close to the hotel. Since we had to do so many transfers between truck, hotel and venues, we were very grateful for his help.The rooms were very creative with the different English Author theme for each room. Beds were comfortable and rooms were large.We loved the pool. In the evening, we could sit around the fire pit and discuss all the events of the weekend.One of the members of our party actually honeymooned at the Cheshire 40 years ago and the staff upgraded them to a suite! They were thrilled!All these things made our special weekend even more unforgettable!! Thank you Cheshire!On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give the Cheshire an 11. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary + medical residency graduation. The Chase Park Plaza was booked so we landed on the Cheshire. WE LUCKED OUT! The Cheshire was truly amazing. The front desk staff is incredible. They knew we were celebrating a special occasion and since they have some extra availability, they upgraded us to the Romeo and Juliet Suite. Our room was beautifully appointed with a coffee maker inside, free waters, a large soaking tub, and a lush king sized bed. We enjoyed all of the nice touches like free Kaldi's (delicious local roaster) coffee, Danish and fruit breakfast and board games in the lobby. The weather was rainy so we didn't get to enjoy cocktails by the pool. The restaurant was also a lot of fun! I used to work at Wash U and casually advised parents all of the time on where to stay when in town. I used to say, The Chase and the Ritz are lovely and if they are full, the Cheshire is also a good option. What I should have said is, ""the Cheshire is wonderful! And if it's full, look at the Ritz or Chase"". You can't beat the Clayton location, great service, beautiful rooms and nice dining options!!!Poorly run. Our family had a group rate for a block of rooms for a funeral.  It took 4 phone calls (they cannot take reservations before 8:00 am; next - you'll have to call back for ""on site"" reservations since this reservation group is not not on site"", etc) to find out they were ""sold out"" of that rate.  ""We are very busy on weekends"".  Hardly professional.  I could't stomach paying the full rate for the poor operations observed thus far so I went elsewhere and advised the rest of the group to do the same.I got a room for the weekend off groupon for my boyfriends birthday. It was an absolutely amazing stay! The people at the desk were so helpful with all my questions, especially Dave?(maybe David). Definitely will be coming back to this beautiful and unique hotel next time we're in St. Louis!I pass by this place all the time so I felt New Years would be a nice time to try it. Sadly, I was underwhelmed. The cheese platter was good. I ordered the shellfish and butternut squash soup. Although it looked good, it lacked in flavor which is how the rest of my night went. For my entree I ordered the skuna bay salmon. I was disappointed that it was literally just salmon no sides nor was I offered an option to order a side. We never got bread. My husband had the filet which just by looking at it I knew it wasn't good. Both of our food had no flavor. The food also came out pretty fast, I would have rather it was cooked to order. Then for dessert I ordered the pumpkin ice cream which was just ok. My husband's creme brulee was better. The vibe looked nice but that was about it.So fun. Every room is named after a different author (with the exception of James Bond...?) Stayed in 101 - Bram Stoker. The hotel is located in a good area and has a European old world style. Good free breakfast, delicious coffee, nice big fireplace in the common room. The fox and hound pub is a great spot with a delicious selection of ales and cocktails.This is such a fun hotel and so dog friendly. If you are lucky, LaWonda will be working the front desk. She's a doll!!In summary, I love St. Louis, and not only because one of my favorite people in the entire world lives there.  And as much as I love St. Louis, I would return even JUST to have the opportunity to stay in this hotel again.  Yes, that's how much I loved it.PROS:  *The staff:  Beyond amazing, patient and helpful at all times.  My teenage daughter was very ill during our visit.  Every evening the front desk staff would heat her cornbag in their microwave with a smile.  Every day, upon returning from our adventures, we were warmly greeted like returning friends or family.*The atmosphere:  Welcoming and relaxing.  We felt transported to 1920s England, with all the charm and attention to detail that you would expect.  *Breakfast:  Get there early for the puff pastries, fresh fruit and a variety of teas and coffees.  We'd go down as soon as we were dressed (by 8:00) and were frequently the only ones there, the food freshly laid out.  We'd pick a corner table with a custom wooden puzzle featuring a photo of the hotel, enjoy our delightful pastries and coffee.  I love the unique packaging of the teas.  Just could not get enough of them (see photo).*Treasure hunt:  We did the children's hunt, a great way to explore the hotel and have some fun.  Be sure to set aside a little time for it!*Bed:  Sooooo comfy!!  And it's easy to open the window (no screens!) and enjoy the fresh night air.  We were there in March and love it cool, so slept with the window open every night.  I've seen others state their room was dirty.  I found our room to be perfectly clean and comfortable.  CONS:*The smell:  When we entered the hotel on our first day, there was a smell (bug spray?  Cleaning spray??) which did put me off.  It was a bit musty...hard to describe.  I don't know if that's a typical issue.  After a day or two it either faded or became accustomed to it.  I only mention it as the owners should be aware and it's probably something that a bit of incense could remedy.*The bathroom door:  I never understand why some establishments insert a translucent piece of glass into the bathroom door, causing the entire room to be lit up in the middle of the night when someone uses the bathroom.  Fortunately, I was able to maneuver in the bathroom without the light in order to not wake my daughter, but would love to have the glass covered with cloth or removed altogether.My husband and I stayed here on New Year's Eve. Good points were that everyone who works there seems very service oriented. Valet guys were awesome!  Front desk was responsive but... We paid extra for the romance package and it was kind of a bust. The strawberries and champagne were delivered while we were out and were melted and warm when we returned. I did have a few things that I brought to the attention of the front desk the next morning. I'm posting them here hoping they will fix them and not just note them. We stayed in the Keats room which is a corner king suite. The bed was sagging in the middle which caused us both to roll to the center. The blower for the heater was so loud it drowned out the tv so we had to turn down the heat so it wouldn't turn on as much. Lastly while taking a shower the next morning we stepped on Bobby pins. That means the shower hadn't been cleaned since the last patron. It made me wonder if the bedding was fresh. I reported all of this the next morning but I'm not sure I was taken seriously. I expected more for $300 per night.Just got to St. Louis from a lengthy flight from Seattle via Salt Lake City for some business. Because of the Cardinals game, it was A little bit difficult to find a room. However, had the help of Yelp, and found the Cheshire. It is amazing!! I do travel a lot inside and outside the U.S. The hotel has a nice British theme. The receptionist Dave is nothing short of outstanding. He hooked me up with a room in less than 2 min!!! I really love this place. You have to come here and check out a part of historic England. Check out my photos, and believe me, reality is even better than the photos. This hotel is worth it!!!Thus hotel us a little weird. Seems like a location for a murder mystery. Clean though with nice staff and a good included breakfast spread. Dog friendly too! And a wash u discount.My husband and I have lived in Saint Louis now for a couple years, and unfortunately, our apartment building doesn't have a pool. My husband loves going to the pool. So, for his birthday this year, I thought it would be nice to spend the night in a hotel that also offered a pool! I looked at various hotel reviews on a few different websites, and eventually chose The Cheshire. Here's how I came to my choice : Obviously, the first thing on my list was a pool. I also wanted a 4 Star or better Hotel, to be near restaurant choices, spend under $200 for the night, and possibly bring my dog instead of getting a friend to watch her.We arrived mid-afternoon on Sunday and checked-in. We immediately made our way to the pool for a dip and a bite. The pool was much smaller than it appeared in photos, with only 6 lounge chairs, a couple couches, and 3 cabanas. The pool was sadly not heated. I looked for that in reviews, but no one mentioned it. The large party celebrating something with a bunch of children and the temperature of the pool made our trip fairly brief. The lunch menu from Fox and Hound is small, and the burgers were good, but nothing special. We went back to our room to shower, and realized quickly we would be showering separately because the shower was not big enough for two. The carpet was damp...maybe they had just done a steam cleaning? It was odd, so we wore flip flops. Someone had apparently previously set our radio alarm clock, so at 5:30am, we were quite abruptly awoken, which didn't make us happy. While the bed was comfortable, the temperature control in the room must be only partial control, because we were still uncomfortably cold at a setting of 80^F. The chocolates, bottled water, and coffee were nice touches, but no mini-fridge was a surprise. Your room key gets you 20% off at the 3 onsite restaurants which is great! We had a pretty good dinner at The Restaurant, our server was great, but I don't really see us returning. Every staff member at the hotel and all restaurants we visited were WONDERFUL! From the front desk, to the housekeepers, to the bartender at Basso. Overall, I'd say the hotel needs a good make-over. I like the Ye Ole English theme...but the building should be much cleaner and a bit more updated. I would not give it an overall 4 star rating, because I don't personally feel it's on par with other 4 Star hotels in the area, such as the Four Seasons or The Chase Park Plaza.We stayed for one night having made our reservation on the road online with no problems. Got an ""online only"" rate that was at least $20 below the published rate at the Cheshire website. The Cheshire is decorated like an English country manor and feels about as old. The rooms are nice, well appointed, and toiletries especially high end. The place, especially the lobby, hasn't been well scrubbed in years. Crud and dust bunnies under every piece of furniture and the floors look like they've never been swept to the wallboards. The complimentary breakfast was great. Fresh fruit, cereals hot and cold, quiches and Danishes, juices, muffins, yogurt etc. Nice selection of fancy teas. WiFi and iPhone Dock in the room. The Cheshire is funky and fun and we'd recommend it if you aren't put off by the ancient English motes.Awesome stay.  The staff was very helpful and pleasant and the hotel is more interesting than the standard Holiday Inn.My wife and I stayed at The Cheshire over Thanksgiving for five days and had one of the best experiences ever. The staff was friendly, helpful and happy to serve, room was quaint and updated, location was the best and the free breakfast was a pleasant surprise. Sitting by the fireplace in the evening and having drinks at Fox and Hounds Tavern with family made this the best Thanksgiving ever.The Cheshire is my favourite St. Louis landmark. When my husband and I were dating, it was the first hotel stay we had together. It was June, and I wanted to show Chris a great time, so I booked a room. We went to the zoo and then checked in. We decided to make use of the pool as it was such a beautiful, hot day. We had such a nice time out there. We were able to order drinks (or food if we so chose) poolside and hang out in the water. We had such a nice stay, but as others have mentioned, we also had issue with the posters on the bed. Both of us managed to bang our legs at least once a piece.While we were staying there the first time, we decided to check-out the Upstairs Ballroom as a possible venue for our wedding reception. We fell in love immediately. The night of our first stay, we went to Fox and Hounds for a drink and then down to Basso to meet some of the Yelper's for a little Happy Hour to meet Chris. Several of us stayed after Happy Hour and enjoyed dinner there as well.Everything was perfect.We have booked our reception to be held at the Upstairs, and we spent our wedding night at the hotel in the Treasure Island novelty suite. We were treated so well. The entire property bend over backwards to make us feel so special on our Big Day. The fireplace had been switched on before we arrived into the suite and everything was so cozy and comfortable. The bed was big and comfortable. The tub was luxurious. The sitting area was beautiful. It was all we'd envisioned and more.As we had to run off to catch a train to Chicago on our first visit, we grabbed a couple things and ran, but on the day after we wed, we sat down and enjoyed the breakfast. Everything was great. Much nicer than many hotels I've stayed at.Next summer, we'll be staying in the Romeo and Juliet novelty suite, which has an entrance that leads directly to the pool. We'll be loving that! Can't wait to go back.Even if you live locally, take your partner and stay here for a night or two. You won't regret it.Chose to stay at The Cheshire based  of my previous visit. Sad to say this experience was less than pleasant. Here's the rundown:1) the  hotel can only be accessed from the first subfloor of the garage. That wouldn't be a problem except that valet uses all the spots to park cars for the restaurants. So you have to park on the 2nd subfloor and drag your luggage up the walkway. 2) Breakfast quality has decreased. You are no longer allowed access to drinks (juice, milk, etc) throughout the day. 3) Loud commotion outside the door. Overall... not what i was hoping for.I love this hotel so much!  I can't say enough.  I don't even want to stay in St. Louis again unless I can stay here.  We were so close to the zoo and tons of restaurants.  StarBucks and two great restaurants are on the property.  Walking distance to a good local hangout bar and a very nice bar (Fox and the Hound) in the hotel.  The rooms are ""author"" themed.  One day when it was raining, my daughter did a entire-hotel scavenger hunt, so I got to see the names of all the rooms.  There is an over-sized chess set out front that my teenage son loved.  (He also loved the complimentary breakfast!).  Every staff member that we interacted with was friendly and helpful.  We ran into a couple who had 3 cats with them, and I saw a missing toy bone in the elevator, so it is a pet friendly hotel.  The beds are comfy, the soaps/products are nice, Keurigs in room, Disney/HBO on tv, strong wifi.....All the things you need to have a great home away from home!  I can't say enough about this hotel; and I can't wait to go again!","A literature lover's delight! My husband and I picked The Cheshire for our honeymoon and we were not disappointed. Everyone working was very friendly and accommodating, the cleaning staff even showed us a few of the other suites in the hotel! We stayed in the Treasure Island suite, which was so cozy and very clean, themed without being tacky. We did not use the pool, but the patio areas were very well kept and had unique art and sculptures. We went to both the Restaurant and Fox and Hounds, both had great atmosphere, delicious food, and interesting cocktails. I would recommend this place to anyone, kids and adults alike. Definitely explore and do a scavenger hunt!This boutique hotel could be so great if it weren't for 2 things: 1) The dirty rooms and 2) The paper-thin walls. Fortunately for them, the first thing (unclean rooms) is something that could be fixed by hiring new, good housekeepers and bringing in an experienced trainer to train them how to properly clean a hotel room. When I say the rooms were unclean, I mean the bed sheets hadn't been changed between the previous guest and me; there was all kinds of dust, hair, dirt everywhere, trash bin hadn't been emptied between previous guest and me - basically I don't think the room had been cleaned except for putting the bed spread on the bed. The one day I wanted to rest and not have housekeeping come, I put the ""do not enter/service"" sign on my door, and the maid still knocked on my door. I was curious to see if she would try to come in if she thought no one was in, so I didn't answer the knock. Sure enough, she came into my room. Wow! I wonder what she was planning on doing in there while ""the cat was away."" I should have hid behind the bed to see.The paper-thin walls would maybe be more difficult to rectify.  I don't know whether it would be a major endeavor to add insulation between walls. As a short-term solution they could space the guests out, and maybe even have a dedicated quiet floor like some hotels have.Anyway, if a new owner and management came in and fixed the major problems, this could be a nice, unique little place.The Cheshire holds a special place in my heart.  During summers home from college, I was a regular at their now closed down beer gardens. I spent many a warm summer evening drinking cold Buds and having laughs with old friends.  A wise person once said that ""Time waits for no man"" and I was reminded of this upon walking into The Cheshire again after a 10 year hiatus.  With the exception of the closed down beer gardens, every change was a positive one.  New owners have pumped some serious coin into this place and the result is the most hip, interesting and unique boutique hotel in StL.  The old English theme throughout is blended with splashes of modern luxury and style.  The rooms are well appointed with beautiful tiled showers and nice soaps and shampoos.  I really appreciate a hotel that incorporates unique artwork and furniture into the rooms.  My room had beautiful framed Byron poetry and illustrations! I love that each room is unique in that way.  (Think 21c museum hotel)  The stained glass diamond windows in the room are so beautiful and actually open for fresh air! The king mini suite I was in was nice and large with two flat screen TVs and an office area.  My only beef with Cheshire was with their house keeping.  The trash can had not been emptied from the previous guest. I'll let you use your imagination as to its content. (Yikes!) There was a massive hair ball outside my door in the morning, and I didn't feel as though the wood floors in my room had been mopped in a while.  If housekeeping steps up their game, this is a 5 star review.  My room looked out onto the road and traffic can get quite loud.  Fox and Hounds was a great place to watch the Cards game and hoist some bevs.  It is dark and cozy with a huge fireplace and intimate seating.  Big ups to Jane and Christen...best bartenders in the StL! Basso pizza late night was just what I needed before turning in.  The space is jaw dropping and the food is exceptional.  This is a must do even if you are not staying in the hotel. Morning coffee and free breakfast was above average and having the ability to eat poolside or in the garden terrace is so nice! The staff here is very helpful and friendly. Overall, I'm a raving fan of The Cheshire and will be back again the next time I'm in StL.I come to this hotel once a month for 2 nights each time.  This last time I came I stayed in room 239.  Nice room first night, great experience.  Second night was very disappointing.  I got back to my room from a 14 hour work day to no toiletries replenished, bed barely made, water had not been replaced, towels were not even folded and somehow the alarm clock was unplugged.  I know someone was in the room because the decorative pillows were put back on the headboard.  I should also mention that the glassware I brought up from the bar the prior night was not removed.  The bar is nice and service is always great.  The restaurants are excellent as well.  Only complaint is housekeeping.  I have never had this issue before so I am giving the benefit of the doubt that maybe there was a new person for whom was not informed or was having a bad day.  I would prefer to have my tip money back if I get this kind of service.  That being said I will stay here again however if it happens again I will take my business elsewhere.we had a fabulous stay at the cheshire hotel - from the moment justin greeted us at the front desk, to dinner at the restaurant, cocktails at fox &amp; hounds, the luxury and character of our ""death on the nile"" suite, lovely tea, coffee &amp; fruit in the morning, to a friendly farewell from mike as we checked out - we look forward to returning to this gem and highly recommend the entire cheshire experience to anyone visiting st louis.Cute boutique inn. You kind of feel like you are in an English Castle or Mid-Evil times. All of the rooms are renovated and the bathrooms are up to date with nice high end finishes. A continental breakfast is included which is nice. It's off of a main road so it can get a bit noisy at night when you are trying to fall asleep. The walls are thin, so again you can hear noise throughout the hallways quite easily. The staff is friendly but there is no room service and the housekeeping was a disaster. They don't know how to make a bed or take out the trash... and they replaced my bath towels with something that resembled a rag. There is a decent outdoor space with a pool and cabanas. Ultimately, my stay here left me with good memories of St. Louis, but I think next time I'll splurge for the Four Seasons downtown.I don't usually write reviews for hotels, but I figured 'why not'.  My wife and I live near Memphis, TN and decided to go on a mini-vacation.  As silly as it may sound, we decided on St. Louis because we had never been and heard about some of the great food places in and around the city -- plus, St. Louis is only about a 3.5 - 4 hour drive.  I used Priceline to secure our hotel, and we were given The Cheshire.  After reading some of the reviews and checking the website, I was pleasantly surprised that we would be staying in such a nice location for only $80/night.  I was tempted to give it 4-stars because the amenities and the service was good, but there is one glaring issue will prevent me from ever staying here again.Service/s &amp; Amenities: Everyone we encountered while we were at The Cheshire was friendly and courteous.  The services provided, such as the tea time, the breakfast, and the other amenities were top notch.  The in-room amenities were fantastic.  The bed was incredibly comfortable; the linens were soft, plush, and great to wrap around your body; and the copious amount of electrical outlets built-in to the tables and desks was a really great convenience. Some of the not so greats in terms of service/s &amp; amenities: The bathroom light was on a motion sensor...but no way to turn off the motion sensor capabilities.  This is pretty cool, but not when it is 1 AM, you have to go the bathroom, and you have a 22 month old in a pack and play directly across from the bathroom.  The light woke her up almost every time.  This was a serious issue, and based on the configuration of the room, it was impossible to place her in an area that wasn't disturbed by light.Parking: This was a f-ing nightmare.  I usually don't use strong languages in my reviews unless it seriously warrants it.  This aspect of the our experience, definitely warrants it.  This hotel is attached to a very popular restaurant -- The Fox and Hound.  Unfortunately, the valet people are COMPLETE, and ABSOLUTE IDIOTS.  They drive recklessly through the garage (literally -- no exaggeration -- almost slammed into me and my wife while we were finding a parking space because they were going the WRONG WAY).  There are convenient arrows on the floor that shows the direction traffic should go, but they decided to completely ignore them, and zoomed around a corner at an extremely unsafe speed, and almost smoked us.  Unacceptable, and completely ridiculous.  I understand that there is a temptation to drive fast when you are valet-ing a Mercedes, but that is no excuse to risk others safety.  Parking some more: Exiting and entering the garage was a nightmare for the above reasons, and several others.  There are few parking spaces, navigating through the idling valet cars is a nightmare, along with navigating through the traffic of drunk patrons driving in and out of the neighboring restaurant.  I will never stay at this hotel again because of the parking...NEVER.  Between the idiot valet service, their dangerous practices, and the awful entering and exiting associated with this hotel, it is not worth the stress, the hassle, and near-death experience.Overall Service / Amenities score: 2 / 5 (4 /5 minus 2 for an abysmal parking situation)Atmosphere: It is too bad the parking situation above is so awful, because the atmosphere of this hotel is charming and magnificent.  You will never have another experience like this, unless you go to England (which I have been on multiple occasions).  It is extremely quaint, well themed, and very cozy.  My wife thinks that ""They really take a theme and ROLL with it"".  Atmosphere: 5 / 5 (incredibly unique -- unlike anything you will experience in the States)Price: I cannot really comment here because I used Priceline and got an incredibly low rate of $80.  When I checked the website afterwards, they were selling the same room on their website for $150.  So, I got almost a 50% savings.  I love Priceline!  Price: 5 / 5 with Priceline (3/5 if buying regular price)Final Impressions: I am incredibly saddened by the horrific parking issues we encountered.  This was the most charming hotel I have ever stayed at with genuine personality and comfort built-into its roots.  I would recommend experiencing this place for yourself, but beware of the absolute nightmare that parking is between the hours of 4:30 PM and 11:00 PM.  It is far to awful and dangerous for me to ever go back.Overall we are fans.  The atmosphere is unique for sure.   The WiFi is free, and very inconsistent.  I'm amazed how hotels these days advertise ""Free WiFi"", but it is always sub standard.  This hotels comment; ""we're very busy"" is just plain BS.  You know what I mean.The free breakfast is situated in an area that is very tight and hard to move around.  They need to find a better location.  The food is good though, cold with one hot item.  Very English of course.  Tea and coffee is free all day.Great pool area and great patio for breakfast.The pub is really good, but very small.  There are two other restaurants on site.  Very well located on Clayton Road next to I64 ramp.  Also close to lots of other stuff in Clayton and downtown Clayton. If this was in the UK it would be 6* I'm sure.  Here 4*.  We'll be back.  Plus there are plenty of ways to get rooms on discount, just check around.I give this two stars because the staff, and the lobby are awesome.  If not for that I'd give it a 1 star.  Two main negatives.  1.  The wifi is horrible, it took me 20 minutes to get online, my wife slightly longer  If you don't do anything online for 10-15 minutes then it kicks you off and you have to go through the agonizing process of trying to log on again.  Once on, the speed is non existent..dial up would be a welcome increase in speed.    2.  THE NOISE!  We have a room overlooking the pool.  Its Friday night and the pool has a DJ that shows up at 6pm and starts blasting his choice of music.  It is now just after 8pm and the pool is deserted as it has been since 6pm when the ""music"" drove everyone away.  When I called the front desk, the guy there told me, ""yeah, a couple of other people told me that the pool was empty""  I told him the music drove them away, and he just laughed as if, how could that possibly be?   Our room is shaking, and we have to turn up the tv to try to drown out that noise.    We got this on priceline, and paid about 1/2 the going rate which was over $200/night..how does that rate 2 dollar signs?  We'll see how the rest of the stay is, but as of right now, there is no need to return here.  Oh, each room is named after some famous British author, cute, but its still a hotel room and not much bigger than most of them.  No microwave, no fridge..for the price...meh..not impressedI just spent a lovely weekend here with my daughter, it was fabulous. Every staff member was friendly and inviting, especially LaWanda and Josef. Our room was pleasant, nice toiletries, quiet, as requested and overall exactly as expected. The valet service was quick and left our car out front when we told them we would be leaving within the hour. We took advantage of the free breakfast and coffee and we were happy with the pastries and very fresh fruit. We brought our little puppy and everyone went out of their way to greet her, give her treats and make us feel welcome and comfortable traveling with a dog. This is a super pet friendly hotel. There were at least 8 other dogs in residence while we were there. I will definitely be staying here every time I visit St. Louis.I want to stay here again so bad! I stayed here on business for two nights, and the booking was done by my publisher. When the car pulled up I thought there had been some mistake: they usually put me in funky boutique hotels, and this looks like an old faux Medieval motel from the 1970's (which it used to be). But when I went in I was cheerfully greeted by the staff, who explained the British literary theme of the hotel. That's right: they have embraced the old British manor decor and turned it into a theme hotel! All the rooms are named after British authors, and there is a copy of your author's works in the room for you to read. To remind you of your room's name, they give you a bookmark to keep along with your key card! I was in the Sir Philip Sidney room, but I want to go back and stay in the Wodehouse room so bad! My room was delightful: new TV, new bath fixtures, lots of light and closet space. Plus an incredibly comfortable bed with a curtained headboard, and a huge wing chair for reading as well as the desk! The breakfast was very nice, with the most selection I've ever had at a continental breakfast, and you could sit anywhere in the long, fabulously decorated lobby, which looks like Henry VIII's hunting lodge. They also have a grand selection of teas available all day long, which was fab as I had a terrible cold and was in town to speak at two events. The free herbal tea kept my throat going! The attached restaurant, a nouveau British pub, had great food as well as very friendly service. All the staff I encountered were wonderful, and the hotel is wonderfully soundproof. I left feeling rested and entertained!I remember the Cheshire Inn from when I was a kid growing up in St Louis.  In the 1970's, both my dad and my uncle earned some extra cash driving guests in the Cheshire's double-decker London bus to and from the Muny in nearby Forest Park.  So I was delighted to discover this vintage hotel has not only survived the years, but is once again a thriving boutique hotel with all the original British Tudor charm it can muster.   I'm very pleased that the current owners decided to invest generously to give this place a new lease on life.  We stayed four nights over a long weekend.  Booked for a superior poolside King room, upon arrival Andrew A. upgraded us to a corner mini-suite on the top (4th) floor - the Lord Byron room.  (Many rooms are themed after famous British authors, poets and playwrites.)   This upgrade worked perfectly for us; in hindsight, a poolside room might have been a bit loud for us anyway.  Our room faced Clayton Avenue and offered a view of downtown and the Arch off in the distance.  There was some light traffic noise but really nothing that bothered us.  We opted for self-parking, although valet parking was offered as an option. Upon entering the room, the seating area was comfortable with a large flatscreen monitor, sofa, side tables and desk, along with several lamps.  Strangely, the amply powered air-conditioner only vented into this room, and not into the area where the bed was located.  So, we kept it dialed down to the maximum so that we could be comfortable while sleeping.   Oddly, half of the light switches in our room didn't appear to operate anything.  The King bed was extremely comfortable - as good as I've ever had at a hotel - along with nice feather pillows and reading lamps on each nightstand.  The closet and chest held plenty of space for two people to unpack and dress. The compact bathroom was nicely updated with stylish tilework in the shower.  It would've been nice, though, to have a shelf to hold a dopp kit, and a hook or extra bar for towels.  The decor was visually interesting, with rugs, beautiful stained glass windows (which opened to the street) and framed poems and sketches of Lord Byron.  The hotel was busy for the holiday weekend, apparently hosting guests for at least one wedding party.  The pool area was lively most of the time; music started playing around 11AM.  On one day during our stay, we spent a few hours under one of the cabanas, with attentive poolside service for lunch and a few drinks.  While not large, the pool area is one of the highlights of the hotel.Our rate included a continental breakfast which is self-served in a small breakfast room off the lobby.   I would call it 'European"" in that it included a few savory baked items in addition to yogurts, cold fruit, meats and cheese.  Excellent coffee and tea selection.  Two restaurants plus a casual, market-style cafe are located across the small parking lot adjacent to the hotel.  The Restaurant at the Cheshire is the more traditional space, while Basso (downstairs) serves casual Italian fare.  While we did not eat at either of the restaurants, they both featured beautiful decor and appeared to be quite busy.   On one of the days, we ordered lunch at The Market and enjoyed it poolside.  It would also be a great place to purchase food and beer or wine to enjoy at nearby Forest Park.  One of the best things about the Cheshire is its great location.  It's right across the corner from St Louis' large city park, Forest Park - which includes the world famous (and free) St. Louis Zoo, art and history museums (also free), biking trails, golf courses, boat house restaurant, and more.  It's easy to access I-64, plus it's only a few minutes from the retail and restaurant areas of Clayton and Maplewood.Housekeeping inconsistencies were the biggest minus.  Our room was certainly kept tidy during our 4 day stay, but there was no rhyme or reason as to what would get changed or refreshed.  One day we would receive 3 bath towels and no handtowels, the next day we would get two handtowels, no coffee cups nor refills.  The day before checkout, we received all new toiletries.  The elevator area and hallway outside our room was mostly tiled, so I noticed some lint and debris would drift into the corner by our door.  Probably not much they can do about that - I didn't complain to them - but it just looks bad. My advice:  stay here if you're the sort who would appreciate a smaller, boutique property, and if you can make the time to wander around and enjoy the interesting decor, pool area and the Fox And Hounds pub.    The rooms and the property certainly have some modern conveniences, but if you're looking for a 'W Hotel'- type of experience - everything new and modern - then just go stay at a W.   This is a vintage hotel with one-of-a-kind decor.   Some things are showing a bit of wear, yes, but overall it's been kept in wonderful condition with just the right modern touches for a comfortable stay.If you'd like your hotel to be part of your travel experience to St. Louis and not just a place to sleep-- the Cheshire is the place to be. Full of old-world charm and antiques (everywhere), we had a wonderful time sipping cocktails by the fire in the Fox and Hounds Tavern or by the fire in the main lounge. The included breakfast was nice and 24-hour tea service, divine! The staff was superb-- very friendly and professional!! It's clearly an older hotel, but the rooms are well appointed and modernized and the location is perfect-- right near Forest Park and access to the interstate to get you anywhere, quickly. What a blast!!First of all let me start by saying that I really wanted to like this place. I love this part of town and there is so much potential with this place. My wife and I were looking for a nice hotel with a nice outdoor pool to celebrate her birthday. We have stayed at The Chase several times but we wanted to give The Cheshire a chance since they underwent a renovation in the last couple years. The Pool: It is a nice set-up with lots of shade, cabana's and outdoor bar. It really is a nice space. The bar staff seemed more interested in helping the people who had reserved cabanas than the other people around the pool. Most of the people at the cabanas were not even hotel guests. The Room: We stayed in room 228. The mechanical system is not regulating the humidity properly. Everything in the room felt sticky and wet. The bathroom had 2 of the 3 lights out. The toilet seat almost fell off the toilet. There were dead spiders in the tub. Overall, I just felt like maybe the maintenance is not kept up with the way you would expect a hotel at this price point. In my opinion this was overpriced for what it is.This place is not great in any way.  From a mostly indifferent staff (save for a few exceptions sprinkled in like Ashley) to the small poorly decorated rooms, and limited breakfast offering.  One of two elevators broke while we were there, a dog walking service offered on the website was not actually available, and our friend was charged a rate in excess of the Ritz in St. Louis.  The bar was pretty cool, but unless you get a chance to stay here for free, save your money and go to the Sheraton down the road, which while not exceptional, is cheeper and overall nicer.I mixed it up a bit on a recent trip to STL and stayed at The Cheshire instead of downtown... The Cheshire is an older hotel (dating back to the 1920s), but much more charming than some of the large chains I've stayed at in the past.  It's got an authentic British pub feel to it and recently underwent some major renovations from what I gather.I had a very pleasant stay, albeit a quick one - just one night.  I found the hotel to be centrally located and easy to access.  The staff was friendly enough, the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, there was free wifi, and there were Aveda toiletries in the bathroom!Best of all, the moderate room rate included a pretty decent continental breakfast in the morning and a couple of bottles of water in my room too!  I stayed in the Mark Twain room, which was very pleasant.  There appears to be all kinds of novelty suites available upon request as well.  If you're looking for a non-corporate chain hotel with some character, The Cheshire is A-OK in my book!What an incredible surprise this place was! From a last minute booking on Hotwire to my new favorite STL hotel in one night- no joke kids. This is just the coziest, warmest and most welcoming place I've ever stayed. Beginning with check-in by these amazingly funny and genuine clerks who seemed really interested in what brought us to them, I was just impressed over and over with the little things that make this hotel so special. A fireplace in the great room with a giant bear, tables and comfy chairs for lounging with a group, FOUR on-site eateries, each room is named after an author and you get a free bookmark with your auther's name on it, crazy comfy bed with plenty of pillows, huge bathroom, free WiFi and continental breakfast, I could go on and on. It's in this great neighborhood, Central West End, full of eateries and bars or Downtown is about 10 minutes away by cab. I'm already planning my next trip just to stay here again! The Market has to be the least pretentious/most hipster place I've seen (and I used to live in Chicago!!) with its comfy couches in front of a roaring fire. I could stay the weekend here and literally never leave the premises. What a total hidden gem. (Can you tell I'm in love yet?? ;)Vintage wonderful hotel.  Been staying here since I was a child with my parents.  Now at 40 years old I love that this place is still so beautiful and is a great place to stay with family or a romantic getaway.   Food is upscale.  Location is the only draw back as the neighborhood has kind of home down Hill over the years but would definitely stay here again.Andrew Allred the Front desk Manager fabricated a story to his staff. We were accused of calling a staff member a ""foreign B"".  B-Word that rhymes with ""itch"". So the staff retaliated and publicly humiliated us.  This was all before we even checked in. Don't stay here! Run!This place is just so bizarre and fantastic all at once.  You feel like Tim Curry will pop out in a butler costume at any point circa Clue.  The British literature theme is over the top, but really well done with only real deal items, etc.  The rooms are clean and modern eclectic (mixing together common hotel amenities well with kitchy antique items).  There's a massive taxidermied bear in the lobby and an amazing free breakfast too.  Also, you are right off route 66 which is pretty cool.One warning, this is a little outside of downtown St. Louis, and it is a little bit difficult to get into town, but not too hard if you have a car and don't mind the metro.  But, in my opinion, it is well worth it!  There's nothing quite like it.","Wow - what a complete mess. We stayed in room 101 - which is aptly named Dracula. So unless you are a vampire or somebody who doesn't plan on sleeping during the night, please stay the f*ck away from this room!The walls of the room are incredibly thin and due to is location (right off the elevator and computer area, along with opening up to the pool) you will hear every single noise outside. In fact, I'm pretty sure the room amplifies the noise.The visit started out really poorly. The Valet Bunch was by far more interested in talking to each other than helping guests. I had to drive around the parking lot 2x without finding a spot until one the valet informed me that there is plenty of room in their parking garage.I'm not sure if it was the confluence of all bad things during my visit but i got only 3 hours of sleep that night.The couple we shared a wall with seemed to be engaged in coitus 24/7 and very vocal about it.  Despite 2 calls to front desk and their repeated assurances that this will be addressed, the moaning and thumping continued through the nigh.In addition, the hotel seemed to host a wedding that night so there were drunken guests wandering all over the property until 4am that night, having loud and inconsiderate conversations. And again, several calls to the front desk did not fix this issue. What really disappointed me about this hotel was the lack of care from the staff. Nobody apologized or addressed the issues. My last time here.I travel a LOT. Most of it's for work so when I get a chance to play it's good-bye Hilton, hello boutique! And this, this magnificent, glorious, decadent hotel was just what the doctor ordered!First, they are so accommodating. I want to say it's the St. Louis charm, but I really think the hotel really requires the kind of service you get from everyone here. It's divine. Walked in and opened the door and, boy, did I suck in my breath. The room is large and so beautifully done that you may not ever want to mess the bed up. The headboard in my room (and I care nothing for the kitschy themed rooms, so let's move past that utter fail) was made from an old fireplace, or at least that's what it looked like to me. It had the most gorgeous chair and just everything was so perfect. The bathroom. Oh my. So beautiful. I can't say enough about the room. The bed would have been in the back of my Uhaul (helping a friend move cross-country) had getting it out not been so OBVIOUS. Ugh. It was by far the best bed I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on. I'll trade you mine. Please.The best part of this hotel is that you have so many things to do in such a small amount of space. There's a courtyard where I sat outside and watched my friend's dogs play (so peaceful), there's the pool where you can have beer brought out to you! What? Yes! Also, dogs stay free! Gratis! They love them! They also have this fabulous little pub inside with the best food. Seriously. Grass-fed burger? It will make you sell your vegetarian soul, or you'll feel like a gastronomical heaven just opened up and rained unicorns and bacon and THE best cheese down on your head. Hallelujah. Please also try the beer Arrogant Bastard. I've been combing Vegas for it since I returned home. I will be victorious or I will move to St. Louis. Also, the girl bartender who SEEMS stand-offish, is actually very witty and absolutely beyond helpful. You'll love her if you get close enough. Just be careful that you don't valet, it's costly and not worth it. Parking is plentiful and easy. I have stayed in many, many places, but this economical beauty in the best part of St. Louis stole my heart right out of my chest. Keep it, I'll be back for it soon.We took a mini vacation to St. Louis when we couldn't work out a big vacation due to home renovations. We really wanted a nice place to stay and something central to the Zoo and museums. We were also booking on short notice.We were SO lucky to come across The Cheshire.  The Staff was kind and helpful--going above and beyond several times.The food was great, the pool area lovely and the beds comfortable. The breakfasts in the morning were much MUCH better than what you usually get in a free breakfast situation.Wifi was great for us too. The night staff really welcomed us and made our stay the very best it could be. We will be back soon because we didn't have time to see the City Museum. Thank you to The Cheshire!Stayed in the King Suite for 1 night and would not stay here again. Every time the extremely LOUD furnace kicked on the bathroom lights came on. Very annoying as the bathroom lights flicked on and off most of the night. The mattress sank in the middle and was extremely uncomfortable. The shower/tub was stained and the bathroom counter was tiny. Only good thing about this place was the staff, all were friendly.Stayed there last night via Priceline which rated it 4 stars. It was not a 4 star hotel. It was cleanish and the people were nice. The air did not work so it was warm and could not open the window because of the car noise on a busy street. It is older and you feel like your in medieval times.  Breakfast is included but minimal. It's just OK.Although an old hotel, has been remodeled. Very helpful  staff. Parking $7 per nite is just plain wrong.Several restaurants on site.Room was a tad dusty, AC works very well. Rooms are not entirely sound proof.They have bikes and helmets for check out to ride in Forest Park. Valet parking or park in there underground garage for $7.Wifi is excellent.Free BreakfastI don't routinely visit St. Louis but I'm pretty sure I won't stay anywhere else next time. I had such an excellent experience staying at The Cheshire this past weekend. The staff was so incredibly accommodating, kind and considerate. I felt like it was some true southern hospitality. Here the rundown ...Food - I only had the continental breakfast; he fruit and the pastries were fresh and tasty. This might not mean much to some but I REALLY appreciated the fact that they have Tea Forte for the tea drinkers. I'm so sick of going to places with a crappy tea option. Rooms - Clean, extremely comfortable beds and Aveda in the bath.Service - I was in town for some unfortunate circumstances and needed some space to make some flower arrangements and knew it could be a bit of a mess and the room might not have been the best place to do it. A member of the staff that I ran into in the parking garage really came to our aid with getting us a room arranged on the spot, helped us with getting everything up and checked up on us if he could get us anything ... I don't find that this happens at most places and his assistance and generosity really made an impact on me. Thank you sir who I don't remember your name, sorry!Lastly, I really loved that the rooms were based on authors and poets. I was in the JM Barrie room who was the author of Peter Pan. Such an excellent touch! Thank you Cheshire for an excellent and pleasant stay.Ok, I've been debating whether or not to give The Cheshire 3 stars or 4 stars.  I really want to give it 3.5 stars, but of course Yelp doesn't have that option.  I was recently in St. Louis on business and decided to stay at The Cheshire.  I was an English major in college and I'm a bit of a book nerd so this hotel was right up my alley.  Each room is named after a British author, poet, or playwright.  You get a bookmark to take home with the name of the author, poet, or playwright whose room you are in.  There is also a book with their work in your room.  It's a cute and unique touch, for sure.When I arrived, parking was a giant pain in the butt.  Then I had to wait forever for the elevator in the thousand degree heat parking garage.  When I got to the front desk, the staff was very friendly.  Check in was quick, but not quick enough for me.  I wanted to take a power nap before my work get together, but had to wait for the front desk clerk to finish explaining about all the authors and such as well as my bookmark.  She also went into great detail about how my room was upgraded to overlook the pool.  Frankly, the upgrade did not matter to me since I was there on business and wouldn't be spending too much time in my room.  The sitting area was quaint and quite lovely.  It really did remind me of an old English home with all the wood, leather couches and fireplace.When I got to my room, I thought it was spacious.  The bed was comfortable and the desk was big enough for my laptop and papers.  Free Wifi was a definite plus.  I did have some major issues with the room though.  One being the dirty bathroom.  There was lots of different strands of hair on the bathroom floor and in the tub.  Now I know it wasn't my hair since I just got there.  It definitely grossed me out.  The other problems kept me up for most of the night.  The air conditioner was SO loud!  The other issue was the stupid sensor lights in the bathroom.  They would not turn off and since the bathroom door was glass, I could see them on all night.  If you are going to have sensor lights, at least have instructions on how to disconnect them for situations like this because I was ready to rip it out of the ceiling.Overall, my experience wasn't horrible.  Breakfast in the morning was good and I would give The Cheshire another chance.  I just hope that next time, my bathroom is actually hairless and the sensor light is off.Fantastic hotel!!!  Charming decor was like walking through a museum.  The food was fantastic at all the restaurants.  The check-in process was very friendly.  I was there for 5 nights and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my stay there.Very classy British looking hotel. The entrance areas had some nice looking couches and chairs. They serve tea and coffee 24/7. The free breakfast wasn't just a cheap junky continental like at most places...we had croissants with ham and cheese. These weren't some 'out of the box' thing either or definitely didn't look or taste like it. We loved the shower in the bathroom we had in our Royal King. The window opened and was stained glass it looked like. The bed was very very comfortable and they provided plenty of pillows. The walls seemed a bit thin but it didn't bother us much.I stayed in room 222 last Monday and Tuesday while on business. I checked in late on monday only to find a wadded up man's sock on the floor near the entrance to the room.  I must confess my confidence level in the place plummeted from that point and never recovered.  rather than notify housekeeping at 10:30 that night, i thought they would dispose of it the next morning during their routine housekeeping room rounds.  Wrong.  i returned to my room the next evening at 6 and not only was the sock still there, the room hadn't been touched and no fresh towels had been delivered...nada. I then called housekeeping and asked if they would please service the room while i was out fro 6:30 until 10 pm.  they assured me that the room would be taken care of.Guess what, got back at 10:15...housekeeping still hadnt even entered the room.  Now  i was upset.  i called the front desk and they brought fresh towels.  Oh and a piece of chocolate for my trouble.  One word: unacceptable.We stayed at the Cheshire for 4 nights checking out on October 20th 2014. After being our most of the first day of our stay we returned to our room before going out for dinner. We were surprised to find that our room had not been cleaned. We stopped at the front desk on our way out and the attendant said he would have the room cleaned while we were out. The room had been cleaned when we returned. The last day of our stay we were out all day and returned to our room late in the evening and again our room had not been cleaned. It was late so we called the front desk to let them know but didn't want it cleaned as it was close to midnight. When we checked out we told the attendant about our poor service and she said she would pass our experience on to the manager Tony Dandino and he would contact us. It has been 11 days and we have not heard rom anyone representing the Cheshire. This is not an inexpensive hotel and we expected service that would reflect the premium paid to stay at was represented as an upscale accommodation. I Would not recommend this hotel!My boyfriend and I stayed here in July. The staff was wonderful. i highly recommend it.During a major snow storm in the city, it was decided that we would have a party at the Fox and Hound and then hold up in The Cheshire that night.Maybe the best night ever!After enjoying the Fox and Hound for a few hours, got a room at the Cheshire and it was just wonderful. The bed are huge, conformable and a pleasure to stay the night in. The room was decorated wonderfully and everything was just perfect. It was a perfect place to stay warm with the snow storm outside.Since I had to go to work the next morning, a perfect shower and quick breakfast downstairs was added (no extra charge) and by then the valet had my car ready and already warm. Will return for one of the theme rooms in the future.The Cheshire was a great place to stay for our 4 day trip to St. Louis. The location was perfect: right along the highway and nestled into the gorgeous Clayton neighborhood. It was easy to get anywhere we wanted to go from this spot. The staff was always friendly and helpful.The English Tea service involves an open selection of Tea Forte teas (very high quality) - I was happy to see this! Not only that but they provided cute little glass containers of honey. And the breakfast selection was just right. Lots of freshly cut fruit: pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, grapes and strawberries; a selection of pastry items, cereal, bagels and a hot item with meat (breakfast burrito or biscuit...watch out vegetarians-these are not for you!). Perfect way to start the day. The room was pretty small but cozy. I liked having a stained glass lead-paned window in the room. The bed frame is kinda dangerous, I have some bruises from squeezing by the bed and accidentally hitting my shin or leg as I passed the corners. The bedding was down or down-like material. Very nice. The bathroom was small with minimal countertop space and didn't have any ventilation for the steam. But the hotel provides AVEDA products for patrons to use. This was a wonderful surprise-I love the rosemary mint type. Beware of parking past 8pm! The underground parking garage fills up! We had a lot of trouble finding a spot each of the three nights! Good thing we drive a small car: one night we had to collapse our side mirrors and squeeze between two pillars-not sure if it was even a ""parking spot"". Also be careful entering the garage because you will have to drive on the lefthand side-maybe its part of the European theme?They seem to be doing some renovations so I hope that maybe they'll paint parking lines or something to improve the parking situations. The pet accommodations are somewhat annoying. The guest neighboring our room left their pooch alone and it barked for a good 20 minutes. Nothing more annoying than an unattended barking dog.Overall a great stay and I'd recommend it if you take a trip to STL!Very nice. Comfy beds. Lovely decor. Excellent pub just downstairs. Fabulous sitting room for just hanging around and chatting.  Beautiful pool area. Nicer part of townThis has been my favorite hotel I have ever stayed at but the housekeeping was horrible! Found a sock in our children's room, cleaned the ice bucket and  tray that had food stuck on it, the desk and phone were not clean,  had dust and food crumbs on it, dishes and empty booze bottles around the hotel  but here we go, I LOVED it! The decor was fun, different and the staff was awesome! The pool is small but I didn't care I loved the cabanas that were free and they had these huge pots that lite up at night. The decor was fabulous and  so down to the theme. Free bikes to ride to the park that was across the street. that had lots of trails and ponds. Breakfast area was small and only one hot item but who cares. You can enjoy your meal outside on their beautiful brick patio. There were lots of tables and chairs inside and out  to enjoy the atmosphere and I also heard the food was delicious.I will cetainly miss my stay and I would definitely stay there again!We stayed at the Cheshire 5-16-2012 to 5-19-2012 for a graduation at Washington U.If we knew our way around St Louis and we had a rental car I would have taken the time to find a better place.  What was wrong?When we checked in at about 8:45PM the girl behind the counter who was registering us spent most of her time ignoring us and flirting with someone from the bar.  When done, we didn't even know which way it was to the elevators.I think they never trained these folks in good customer service.  It's like standing at the checkout line in a grocery store while the cashier is chatting up the other cashiers while ignoring the paying customer standing in front of them.Then, as we took the elevator up to the 3rd floor, the smell of hot hydraulic fluid was so strong we all became nauseous.  That smell was there all 3 nights.About 11 pm, our room is 75 F and getting hotter.  I turn the AC down to 68.  It comes on for a few minutes, then shuts off.  I play with it for awhile. Then  call the front desk. Ronny tells me he has to walk to the other end of the hotel and press a switch.  I assume we popped a circuit breaker.  But this must happen enough that he knows the routine.  I guess the hotel owners can not afford to fix it nor the elevator.As soon as I hang up and get back into bed, the AC goes on for 30 seconds then goes off again.  I make two more calls to the front desk and then decide to walk down there.As I approach the desk around midnight I here some other guest asking for a fan.  Apparently their AC was not working either.Keep in mind I am paying $300 for a small room in outside of St Louis.  I expect the AC to work and the elevators to not be leaking hydraulic fluid.Also, for $300/night in a rural town, I would at least expect to have a mini fridge in the room and a bathrobe.Ronny gets us another room on the 3rd floor and he sticks around long enough to make sure the AC is working.I should mention the two positives.  The decor in the lobby and the bar is great.  Looks and feels  like a 400 year old pub.  Very comfortable.  The staff in the bar was great.  Plus the food in the bar was great.  They should just close the hotel and keep the bar going.Then let me tell you about the dysfunctional room.  The posts on the corners of the bed stick out from the bed about 6 inches.  It's hard wood with  sharp angles.  The room was so small you would bang either your toes or knees on these posts every time you walked about the room.  Very poorly thought out.  I have scrapes on both knees and my wife thought she broke her toe.Then there was a 5 minute timer on the motion sensor for the bathroom light. Anytime you went into the bath room it would keep the lights on for 5 minutes after you left.  But because the bathroom door had translucent glass, this would light up the entire hotel room.  It made sleeping difficult. Especially with the AC kicking on and off.OK to sum it up.  The bar was great.  The hotel staff should be fired and the owners should sell it to someone who cares enough to provide good customer service and good maintenance.Unique destination hotel for a weekend getaway. Author named rooms, old English furnishings, make you forget your in the heart of forest park.  Near the zoo, great pool with cabanas and drink service and covered parking. Continental breakfast was very upscale with fresh fruit, Danish, cereals and cheeses. Not your typical hotel but a fun one.This hotel is classy and elegant. The staff was amazing and the overnight desk guy, Kevin, on Monday August 26th was the best!! He was so helpful and suggested a great pizza place after the concert we went to at the Pageant. If you are EVER lodging in STL this place is a MUST!! I will never stay anywhere else when I visit that city. Thank you so much for being so amazing, Kevin! I can't wait to visit again.","What a fun place!  Really comfortable bed, and a great change from the boring cookie cutter chain hotel chains. Wolfgang Puck coffee and Aveda soaps and shampoos in the rooms.Great lobby and tavern...and the free continental breakfast was great [ how often does that happen? ]This place is unique and has an amazing unexpectedly fun little gem! We loved the theme and the style!This was almost an okay hotel for the price.  Some of the staff were wonderful, while some were not so wonderful.  The hotel is very classy and elegantly decorated.  The artworks is fantastic, as are the tables, chairs, couches, etc.  It's absolutely beautiful.  The room was very nicely decorated and very clean.  The beds are very high, so if someone staying there has hip or leg problems, they'll need help getting on the bed.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  Be careful in the morning, if you walk too close to the bed, there's a wooden square that sticks a few inches out from the mattress and blankets.  If you're not careful, you'll slam your knee right into it.  I still have the scab lol!Another thing they could work on is the air conditioning.  It's so loud that if you have the tv on, the volume has to be close to the max to hear it, then you need to turn it down when the air turns off because it's too loud!  I read in old reviews that people were complaining about the noise from the air conditioning and I thought ""as long as it works, who cares.""  Well, you should listen to it before staying here.When we checked in we were treated very nicely.  Their pet fee is extremely reasonable, and they give you a pet bed, leash, coupon for Purina dog food, and treats for your dog.  Very cool for the $25.In the morning we came down to see what was available at the ""Full English Breakfast"" advertised on their site.  It was cereal, an empty tray that once contained fruit, and racks that once held muffins, pastries, and pound cake slices.  All that was left were a few grapes, a muffin, and cereal.  We asked if they could refill the breakfast items, and about 10 minutes later the fruit was refilled, but nothing else was.  We ended up going out for breakfast.  The coffee was horribly bitter and burnt tasting, but the last night of our stay it had improved, and the breakfast was fully stocked with a delicious poppy seed pound cake.  The website now states ""Complimentary Euro-Continental Breakfast featuring coffee, juice, pastries and hot breakfast selections"" but there were no hot breakfast selections any morning of our 3-night stay.In the morning they were out of more than half of the teas they had the night before, so I asked if they had any more.  The lady said she would go check.  I waited about 7 minutes before I went to the desk to see what happened, to find the lady that said she would check standing behind it.  I walked up, she looked at me and said ""Hi, can I help you?""  She had completely forgotten.  Oh well, I asked a manager when they would be getting more, he said he'd ask the kitchen when more would be arriving, he came back, walked right passed me, and continued what he had been doing before.  Ok, I know it's no big deal for you, but since your coffee sucks I was hoping for a normal black tea instead of the herbals you have left.  Sorry my stay inconvenienced youThere was a special area you could walk your dog outside where they had grass, a tree, and a fake fire hydrant.  It was a cute idea, but they didn't clean the wine/cocktail glasses from the tables the night before, and if any of them had fallen my dog and I would have been walking all over broken glass, or going out the front door and down the street.We got back from the wedding we were in town for, and had to park down the street because the parking lot was full of restaurant patrons.  I recommend having spots reserved for hotel guests so we don't have to walk down the road, through puddles in my suit and my wife's high heels and formal dress.  I guess we should just be happy we weren't checking in and dragging our bags that far!The pool is in the middle of a bunch of tables where people are drinking and socializing.  If you plan on swimming for exercise, plan on splashing everyone out at the tables.We never received the complimentary chocolates mentioned on their website.To be fair, they asked if there was anything they could improve upon when we left, and we said no.  We said no because my mother-in-law was with us and would scream and holler that we shouldn't complain.We have stayed at Embassy Suites hotels before for less money and were much happier.  For $99 Embassy had an open bar at night, and a breakfast that included sausage, bacon, made-to-order omelettes, pancakes, waffles, etc.If I had not been told a full English breakfast would be served, or if the breakfast items had been stocked when we went down, this would've been a 3-star review.  If I had paid $79 a night, it would be a 5-star review.  I am reviewing the experience staying there as a whole, not just the room, not just the breakfast, but our 3 days there.  I just feel that the price I paid didn't return a stay of the same caliber.  Hopefully they can address these issues and their staff so that people staying there can have a more pleasant experience in the future.  I, however, will not be one of them as I won't be returning to this hotel.Stayed there last November and it was awesome! So where to start? The rates:  super reasonable. Room service: good food, friendly service. The room:  super comfortable, unique (especially for literary minds -- they give you a classic book to read) and after staying there for 8 days the thing I most missed about St. Louis was my hotel room. Extras:  business center (great because I had unexpected L.A. business while I was out of town), WIFI signal was strong and FREE BREAKFAST. It was like the best combo of a bed &amp; breakfast but with some luxury touches. The Staff:  Friendly across the board with excellent service. Won't stay anywhere else next time I come to the Lou! The only downside for me, as someone from southern Cali, was the stuffed bear in the lobby and the food will make you FAT! But, hey it's the midwest.This hotel is the poster child for great management. It's location and even to some extent exterior might make the casual passerby blow it off. Once inside its warm. Very clean and you feel like you are in some secluded spot. We will be back without a doubt.  Its easy to just walk over to Forest Park and they were very cool with having pets.  Only downside is navigating the underground parking garage...it's very tight and spaces are narrow.  Getting in and out w/out scraping my car was a major achievement...valet may be worth the few extra bucks.What a disappointment! My husband and I traveled to St. Louis from about 2 1/2 hrs away to take our little boy (18 months old) to visit Grants Farm. We normally stay at the Four Seasons but wanted to try something different this time. So, we call on our way and the receptionist talked us into getting the most expensive room (The death on Nile or some shit)...because ""it was so great"". It overlooked the pool, had a separate room (where our son could sleep while we watched tv), Jacuzzi tub, etc. So, we arrive 2 hrs after I hung up the phone and try to check in. They had to inspect some things in the room before we could check in so, we waited for about 15 to 20 min. The room was upstairs 2nd floor. I don't think it was worth the $350 per night and here is why:-No help hauling our luggage to room-luggage rack barely fit thru the doorway-no refrigerator in the room (for my son's milk) - could have spent $10 and they would have brought one to the room-1 room, no separate room like we were told- hair balls all over the room- the parking garage wasn't even tall enough that we could open the back hatch to our vehicle to unload everythingOther than that, the hotel was ok. Definitely not fit for children.Love the Cheshire! It is a little quirky with its British theme, but that was part of the charm. We stayed for two nights in the fall of 2012. They were still doing a lot of construction, so we weren't able to try any of the new restaurants on location. However, not a big deal (we weren't expecting to). They provided a lovely continental breakfast. We rented bikes from them (free of charge) and rode over to Forrest Park for the day - its only about a half mile away (but beware - you do have to cross a couple busy streets). We also got a picnic lunch, which you order from the front desk, to take to Forrest Park. It was a little pricey for what we got, but definitely worth the experience. I believe it was around $25-$30 for a plate of meat, cheese, crackers, grapes, and two water bottles. All packaged in a checkered picnic basket, and a blanket was provided as well. As for the hotel room, the bed was very comfortable and noise was never an issue for us. We didn't get to try the pool, as it was too cool outside. The staff was super friendly. I had actually planned a return visit, during which we were going to take our dog (they have Royal Pet program where they provide treats, food bowls, a bed, and a bunch of other freebies) but had to give to someone else because something came up. We can't wait to go back (and hopefully try one of the themed rooms!).BF and I had a mini stay-cation here during Loufest, and It was wonderful in every way.  You can't beat the central location in the heart of St Louis close to major roads, landmarks, and amenities.  It is beyond boutique and well on the way to charming and distinctive.  We were given a comp upgrade to a junior suite, the Lord Byron Room.  A charming, comfortable space with an amazingly huge, soft bed and clean, modern bathroom.  There is poetry and historical art on the walls, so over the top it's funny and kitschy.  I had to steal the ""Do Not Disturb"" to take home for my own bedroom door as it reads ""Do Not Even Consider Knocking Unless you are the Queen Herself"" on it....it was just paper, but sorry Cheshire!  Complimentary breakfast buffet in the morning is simple but nice. Good coffees, teas, and a variety of juices and milks to drink.  To eat there is plenty of quality fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, bagels, yogurt, and hot breakfast sandwiches, even after the buffet was technically over.  Lots of late sleepers after Loufest, I suppose!  I do wish that they had a shuttle as we were just headed to the park, but a cab was under $10.  We thought about taking the cute, old school bicycles available to use free of charge, but I did not think that I was going to be able to make my way back after a long day at the fest...We spent one day at their outdoor pool.  It's a smaller space, but well maintained with the perfect temperature water, beautiful landscaping, and attentive waitstaff for food and drink.  We hired a dog sitter, but I noticed that the hotel is dog friendly and many patrons take advantage of that- though all of the dogs I saw were very well behaved.  It really felt like we were out of town for a few days and we did not want out time to end.  We will be back!Summertime is here!!!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Cheshire for making my first summer back in MO one to look forward too! This has become my favorite new place to sip and sun poolside....along with my girlfriend and friends. The poolside service is extremely attentive, my drinks never run dry and thankfully, neither do I!!!! I was thankful to find a pool in STL that offered bar service and the best surprise was no day pass fee!!! I would recommend it to anyone but I fear once the secret's out, it will get too crowded;)I travel a lot....Most weeks of the year for work. And unlike the previous post I will take Hilton. While I think they have a unique concept ---- housekeeping really lacks. I walked in and it was hard to tell that they made the bed ---- it was that bad. Rather than lining the trashcans they hung the bags over the cans, really do you think I am going to line them ---- I think not. Then the dirty sock in the room ---- YUCK! The parking situation needs some work too. But the people at the front desk last night were quite friendly and the fitness center is one of the best I have seen, thus 2 stars rather than 1 star. Poor housekeeping in a hotel doesn't sit well with me.What a great hotel experience. Fantastic charm in the lobby; you feel like you've stepped back in time.  I set up my ""office"" on an overstuffed leather couch in front of a massive fireplace and got lots of work done.  Baroque music plays softly in the background.  Lovely old English style that's surprisingly not obnoxious at all.  My room was clean and modern; they renovated not long ago.  Great access to Saint Louis.I am only reviewing the bar/restaurant for the Cheshire, I didn't stay in any rooms so I can't comment on that.  The newly renovated hotel and bar/lounge/pool were REALLY nice.  Watch out for the old bear in the lobby.We came in on a cool fall evening to enjoy some appetizers and drinks and ended up staying for dinner!  We tried just about everything on the small menu.  The wings were excellent - big and juicy with very good seasoning and sauce.  The house frites came with an excellent aoili (I'm a sucker for a good aoili) and were fried to perfection.  For dinner, I had the pulled chicken sandwich - which als was a pleasant suprise.  I really liked the barbeque sauce they used.  They had a nice draft beer selection and the bar was really rustic feeling.We sat outside in the courtyard and even though no one else was there they were kind enough to get a nice little fire started in the firepit.  This is a great little Best Kept Secret, but I have a feeling it won't be for long.  Can't wait to go back and hang out in the bar and sip some scotch.Absolutely LOVED this place! It's a little bit of England in suburban St. Louis, right down to the KEEP LEFT traffic pattern in the underground garage. The rooms are gorgeous, the service is impeccable, and it's very dog friendly.Awesome! Our dog was a welcome guest too. Very clean and comfortable, beautiful stained glass windows, fun decor and a delicious breakfast! I wrote all about it here - <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp1cn3Q-sd&amp;s=e5c3eacce79b1ba01cb97517b27fc4041368f9ceb12ef149af4d65ec41f2b218"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">wp.me/p1cn3Q-sd</a>This hotel is the best! It's clean, comfortable, in a great location and fun! The room themes were really cool and nicely done. My husband and I stopped in for a night on our way cross country. We were upgraded to a huge suite with a large jacuzzi tub and king bed. The bed was so comfortable, I didn't want to get up in the morning! I did though, and was served an awesome complimentary buffet breakfast with tons of fresh fruit, bagels, pastries and breakfast burritos. A great start to our day!The staff was so helpful and pleasant and the hotel even accepted our little dog! Not only would we stay here again, but I really wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in St. Louis! The tavern was really great too!I just stayed here this past weekend. Service was excellent, rooms were great and the renovation is gorgeous. The Fox and the Hound was a great spot to have after dinner drinks. Will definitely be back.My nephew was getting married, I booked a room for 2 nights 4 months ago. Parking options were expensive, I grabbed a spot open in the hotel owned restaurant lot next door. I immediately noticed the filthy glass in the front doors and the sticky, tacky feel of the handles and door. On the way to the slow, noisy and extremely hot elevator I was stunned to see that apparently a packed warehouse of heavy, ponderous 'olde' English furniture, artwork and knick knacks had thrown up in every square inch of space. The murky lighting and heavy dark woodwork created an utterly exhausting energy drain. I was stunned to discover my room hadn't been cleaned. There were used towels thrown over the ice bucket and in the bathroom. There was a spray bottle of cleaner left behind that obviously hadn't been used. The glass covering the tops of the furniture was filmy, smeared, greasy feeling and extremely dusty. The coffeemaker was covered with dust and large, greasy fingerprints. The floor was covered with dirty footprints and the carpet tacks sticking up from the line where carpet met floor was a painful touch. I was stuck several times. The sheets had not been changed and one of the pillows had the strong stench of dead fish. The heavy wood bed frame had whitish streaks, dribbles and smears. There was no soap, shampoo etc. There was hair all over the bathroom. I went back into the hellishly hot elevator and spoke to the desk person. It was after 9 p.m., I had just driven 7 hours and the thought of finding a different place in a strange city was not appealing. The desk person said he would send up a housekeeper immediately, apologized and comped half the rate for the night. A young man knocked on the door with a stack of towels. I asked him what that was about. He said he had no idea. I explained the situation, he came in and immediately commented that the room hadn't been cleaned in a long time and needed some serious detail cleaning. He told me there are no housekeeping people at night. He went to the front desk with me to confirm the condition of the room and the price was comped 100%. I refused to sleep on used sheets so this young man helped me change the bed. His eyes fell on the large spots and stains the same time mine did. Our eyes met as he asked, I wonder what that is? I said, oh, you know exactly what that is! We changed all the linen, he suggested I do not touch the throw. It gets worse! The air conditioning rattled constantly. And for some insane reason, probably the same reasoning behind the hideous decor and giant stuffed bear in the lobby, claws reaching out in warning to run, run! the bathroom lights, all 4 of them, are on a motion sensor with NO WAY TO TURN THEM OFF! Walk by, on they go, go in, on they go, go in at 3 a.m. and on they go, glaring, blaring light bouncing off the mirror and glass shower door, ensuring that you are now wide awake and can listen to the rattling AC the rest of the night. The next morning I had to attend the wedding rehearsal without a shower or even washing my face. I assumed that the desk person would make sure cleaning services were provided first thing in the morning. Nope. My room was not cleaned and supplied until 4:30 in the afternoon, 1 hour before I had to go to the rehearsal dinner. After the room was cleaned the glass remained smeared, the coffeemaker untouched, the ice bucket still had it's nice thick insulating layer of dust and the desk chair had little bits and pieces of something red, hard candy maybe, and pieces of cellophane. The lamps remained dusty and smeary.  The shower is set in such a way that you have to get in to turn it on, no way to reach in and adjust the temperature before entering. And those lights! My God! I could have operated on myself. When I returned that evening other wedding attendees had arrived to discover their rooms in the same condition as mine. Several employees were in the hall trying to make peace. I snagged one to unscrew the lightbulbs in the bathroom asking him what the hell was going on with motion sensors in a hotel room bathroom. He laughed and said it was the owner's idea. I learned that several visitors for the wedding were furious and ready to check out except, as it was with me, they had come long distances and were utterly exhausted. On the very scant plus side- the mattress was very comfortable, the down pillows and comforter good quality. Complimentary breakfast was good, fresh fruit, sliced turkey and cheese, a variety of muffins, bagels and sweet rolls, bean roll ups, juices, tea and coffee. No one to replenish plates, coffee or wipe the eating areas. Guests had to go to the front desk to request items. Every guest for the wedding had a horrible experience. I was comped the full visit as were others. This place is disgustingly dirty, sticky, noisy and not worth even half the nightly rate.We stayed here a couple of weeks ago and had a great time. One of the biggest standouts for me was the staff - everyone we met was very friendly and helpful and had an obvious pride in the hotel and its related ventures (they'd just opened The Restaurant two weeks previously and two more restaurants are in the works). It's very English country-style, with lots of heavy carved furniture and animal trophies, hunt paintings on the wall. Each room is named after an English author and you'll find a book or two by that author in your room. I'm not sure all the rooms are suites, but ours was and it was very spacious. I believe everything was recently remodeled - it was definitely clean and well-maintained, with a contemporary-style bathroom (shower only). I'd definitely stay here again.Overall a very nice experience.  I loved the charm of the hotel and the old English design.  I was in town for the St. Louis Scottish Games.  The games recommended the hotel on their website (among another option or two) and the hotel reciprocated with a promotional rate of $129/night (plus tax).  I was given room 245, a ""superior king room.""  The room was nicely appointed but did face a rather busy road.  For some this may have been a problem, but I can live with traffic noise, and didn't mind especially as I got the special rate.  In the hotel's defense I was emailed an upgrade option after booking (at minimal cost) which I elected to skip.  There were a few minor items with the room...a bedside light which didn't work, a motion activated bathroom light which couldn't be manually controlled, and a sink stopper that wouldn't stay shut.  The check-in was easy and the staff were polite.  Parking came at a cost, which I avoided by parking behind the restaurant.  I would stay here again.After stumbling on this hotel through ""name you own price"" on Priceline, I was initially pleasantly surprised. Newly renovated, old English quaint, great location. Since I knew it would appeal to my wife, I flew her in from Charlotte for a couple of days.The 2nd night we ate in the Pub there. Later that evening, I got very, very ill. Food poisoning. After a really rough night, I requested to extend my stay for a day because I was very ill and could barely get out of bed. First we were told there were no rooms and we must vacate by 11am (even though I had to previously request room make-up because it hadn't been touched when I returned at 4:30 the previous day). After further complaining about my condition, they offered to ""allow"" me stay for $229 a night but I would have to move to another room. I protested having to move as we were already in a small room and I was too weak but they said ""take it or leave it"". They never inquired as to the severity of my illness, offered to call a doctor, nor showed any compassion at all. Moreover, the front desk attitude was verging on snotty and inexplicably unconcerned about the food poisoning from their Pub restaurant. Since I had to move rooms anyway, I called the Marriott hotline, explained my condition, and they found me a nearby room I could immediately occupy. They even had a small basket of OTC stomach and pain medications waiting when I checked-in. As far as I am concerned, the Cheshire staff I dealt with was the antithesis of hospitality. Beware. Finally, the bathroom had two of its three lights burned-out and the fact that the automatic bathroom light control does not have a manual overide is absolutely absurd.The service at The Cheshire was truly excellent and the newly remodeled rooms were clean, comfortable and well appointed.  I was a little leery when I looked at the pictures on line because of the ""themey"" feel, but in fact, the hotel is tasteful, has character and the rooms are on par, or slightly nicer, than a

http://www.yelp.com/biz/omni-majestic-hotel-st-louis,Omni Majestic Hotel,3.5,$$,66,"I stayed here this week after I attended the Braggin' Rights game at the Scottrade Center.I booked my room on Priceline by using the Name Your Own Price option and got a great deal. Because of this, I felt comfortable valeting my car for $26. Normally this wouldn't be the case! There are several lots and garages in the area which might be cheaper.All of the staff I encountered were beyond friendly. My room was spacious though the furnishings are a bit outdated. This really didn't matter to me though because everything was clean!The Omni Majestic is a quick walk to some great restaurants (Bridge Tap House and Baileys' Range). They also offer a shuttle within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. I didn't use this amenity because everywhere I went was close by. I think this is a great place to be if you are in downtown St. Louis.We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Scottrade Center since we were in town for the ACDC concert.  I made a reservations for 2 rooms.  We arrived at 3:00, the hotels preferred check in time.  One room was ready, one was not.  We were told it would be at least another hour before our second room would be available.  We decided to make the best of it and hang out in the bar.  The bartender was great!  As we waited patiently for 4:00, we noticed that everyone else was being told it would be at least an hour before their room was ready.  Needless to say, a lot of unhappy campers in the hotel!   I took the elevator down to the basement to use the restroom.  The banquet rooms are also in the basement and this is where the employees of the hotel could be found having a baby shower.  Our second room wasn't available until 4:15.  There were many folks still waiting for their rooms when we left for dinner at 5:15.  The air conditioning did not work in either of our rooms.  My call to the front desk did not produce results.  I was told the engineer could come take a look but it would be several hours. Our room rate included one free breakfast.  We did not eat breakfast but my husband did go downstairs to get us two cups of coffee for which he was charged $6. We will not return to this hotel.This hotel is a GREAT value for what it offers. It's located within walking distance of many of downtown St. Louis' attractions, it's clean, archtechurally interesting, the staff is friendly and accommodating and maybe best of all...it's not cookie-cutter. The rooms are spacious and appointed with more traditional groupings than you see in most ""modern"" hotels. And most importantly to a woman, the bathroom was spacious with proper countertop space.We stayed on a Saturday evening (10/31/15) for the anniversary of our first date. We wanted to stay downtown since we were dining at Kemoll's for dinner and didn't want to make the long drive home afterwards. We selected the Omni based on three things: location, a ""shuttle"" available and the price. We'd read reviews and felt it would likely be clean as that's a pet peeve of mine. Much to my delight, I did find it to be clean and the ""shuttle"" is a beautiful black Escalade, so let's go!Our stay was brief, but pleasant. The doorman (and holder of the keys to the Escalade) was Emrah. He was a DELIGHT and knows how to greet guests and certainly does far more multi-tasking than I'm used to from a doorman. We've stayed in downtown Manhattan and didn't experience the kind of customer service we got from Emrah. This man is definitely the person you want making the first impression of your hotel. He's neatly dressed, articulate, friendly but deferential, and manages to answer questions, open doors, smile, handle luggage...and apparently take you to and from dinner! That was such a special touch on our anniversary. I hate stinky cabs with rude drivers, so having this door to door service with Emrah was such a delight! Well done, Omni Management. And...give that man a raise because he's the best advertisement you have. And no, I'm not related to him. :)Our only complaint, and this is super picky for the price we paid, is that there are only a few vending machines (not on each floor), but I was able to find a cold soda from a nice gentleman behind the bar in the restaurant downstairs. Although they weren't open at the time, he still accommodated me. Problem solved!We will go back!Big fan of the people of the Omni Majestic. We stayed there this past weekend. The staff was bar none, the absolute best hotel staff I've ever had the pleasure of staying with. The front desk, the cleaning crew, everyone was top notch! With that said, keep in mind this isn't a 5 star luxury hotel. It's just a place to park your bottom.The only complaint I have was being put on the corner of the second floor. Right outside of our window was two giant street lights... Not usually a problem, but the dark curtains do not close, so we only had sheer curtains to block out what I consider 'sunlight' from these lamps.. Easily fixed by installing dark curtains.Trip Adviser sir LIED!I predict: this place SHUT DOWN SOON! 1 room was flooded so they ""upgraded"" us to a room w/ sheets so thin and w/ holes I was sleeping on the uncovered mattress. Went looking for ice... Opened a maids closet on the 5th floor that had a stack of what looked like BLOODY pillows inside. Creepy! The Walsh are thin. Elevators like mahogany lined coffins for 2.It's like a flop house not a modern hotel.Beautiful, wonderful people and hotel. Upon our arrival we were informed that our room was not available - not a problem though as they placed our items out of eye while we ventured out to watch Sunday football for a few hours. Once we returned the on-duty attendant informed us we'd been upgraded to a suite [no reason given, but it was quite appreciated]. While I got to nap in the suite, the manager [I believe] opened up the restaurant for the guys to continue watching football. Shuttle service was amazing in of itself - they'll pick up/drop off anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel until 945p. For a small city this encompasses much of the attractions/sight-seeing things. When we had to wait to leave, it was no more than 10 minutes. It was a little disappointing though to have to wait at the Candy Kitchen for 30 minutes. Simply put, one of the best hotel experiences ever for me.DO NOT BOOK A GROUP RESERVATION HERE!I wanted to have my wedding party and guest stay at this beautiful hotel located on a few miles from our reception. I looked into group rates, with their group sales department, but found their web rate to be cheaper than their group rate. Therefore, I called to notify the group sales office that we were going to book our reservations without the group block. BUT, they told me to wait because they could get a group block rate that was more affordable than the current web rate. Five hours later, I received an email offer with group rates that were still higher than the previous viewed web rate. I went back online to simply make our own reservations and low and behold the web rates had increased $20-60/night. Frustrated, I called the manager and explained that I had held off on making my reservations because group sales stated they could offer a more affordable group rate. The manager stated he could not honor that previous web rate or offer for a more affordable group rate. Unfortunately, this hotel's customer service does not match the hotel's aesthetics. I will never consider an omni hotel again after experiencing such dishonest and poor customer service. I hope informing others of my experience will prevent other groups and bridal parties from such disappointment.Not really all that great for the money we spent, have to pay for parking per day as well as no complimentary breakfast, also really old and out datedAmazing value for the money. It depends on demand for the day you visit, as some weekend hotels downtown start at $200 for budget hotels, but this Friday we were able to get a king bed at the Omni Majestic via Priceline bidding for $56. $56! One of the cheapest hotels I've stayed at, yet much nicer than others I've paid $200+ for. Highly recommended.The staff working here is the absolute best. Alisha (sp) and another girl working were so amazing and accommodating. I simply don't think I would have gotten the same help anywhere else in the city. THANK YOU!Stayed in room 908, bathroom fan not working, found headboard post broke off and crudely wood glued back together. It added a nice low class motel touch.  Found litter on the floor (cocktail straw) when we got in, so attention to detail is lacking. They will tell you they offer vallet for $26/day, yet if you walk across the street you can get the car parked for $8 a night. The rooms are spacious,booked a last minute deal and got it for under $75. This hotel is not worth a penny more.Stayed at the Omni last night with a large group who had got a block of rooms for a wedding. We checked into our room around 2am after the wedding.  A couple hours after we fell asleep we were abruptly awoken by a fire alarm in our room at 6am.  This alarm had a woman's voice with it who just kept saying that they were inspecting to determine if there was a threat or not.  We stayed in our rooms while this annoying alarm went off for an hour.  It ended up being a false alarm. Upon check out they offered us no apologies or explanations for the alarm that brought us wide awake in the middle of our sleep. As we sat in the lobby waiting for our ride. The groom and some of our other friends came down to the lobby.  The groom complained about the alarm and the hotel gave him $50 off of his room.  I asked him about it and he told me they were discounting $50 to ppl for the inconvenience  of the alarm.  I walked over to the two ladies at the front and asked if we were eligible for the same discount they just gave to my friend.   The ladies response to me (keep in mind 30 seconds after she discounted my friend).  ""What discount?""    I said the one you just gave my friend standing 20 feet away. They told me they only discounted two rooms in our party and it was for people who were ""really inconvenienced"" by the alarm that went off in our room from 6-7am.  But we could go get some free breakfast.  We had already made plans with friend to go to brunch so we passed.  But they should have led with that offering not used it as leverage after we complain.  Also lying or playing dumb about a discount you just gave my friend is a pretty poor business practice. As a small business owner.  I always worry about the customers who experience bad service and just don't want to make a big deal about it.   You lose those customers future business without even realizing they will never give you a second chance. I've stayed at the Omni in Dallas,San Diego, and my home town St Louis.  I won't be back.  They clearly don't care about their guests experience or retention.I stayed here for a wedding recently, and it's a fine hotel. I don't often (this is the first time) stay in downtown St. Louis, so I can't really compare rates (especially since this was for a wedding block) or compare to other nearby properties, but this was nice enough.They don't have much of a lobby - it's not obvious when you walk in where you need to go check in. It's just a very unassuming desk right where you enter the hotel. So that's odd, but doesn't really matter. My room was large and comfortable, beds were nice (although, no fitted sheets, tsk tsk) and the shower had pretty solid water pressure. Everything I needed.A couple rooms weren't ready (I checked in with a number of other wedding-goers) and in compensation, a very helpful gentleman opened the bar for us and comped multiple drinks for multiple people, including those whose rooms *were* ready. So I thought that was very nice. He even gave us recommendations for nearby restaurants, even though the hotel did serve food. So not just trying to make money for himself.I also had breakfast the next morning, and while it was a nice little spread, it was on the high side for what I'd prefer to pay. But, downtown, captive audience, etc, I can forgive them for that.Would I stay again? Sure. I'm not in hotels in the area often (since I have family nearby) but if I needed a hotel in downtown St. Louis, I would definitely consider this. Plus they have a loyalty arrangement with some hotel group that includes the First Hotel I stayed at in Copenhagen...where I would have made their top tier in a single stay. If only I would have signed up...BED BUGS! BED BUGS! BED BUGS! I slept with bed bugs last night and added a couple of photos of one of the superstars. Please check your bedding when staying here.They were super nice about it and the general manager is paying to have our clothing laundered. But be aware!!Staff was rude! Place is beyond outdated. I had hair in my food. And seemed done intentional. Only goid thing was parking seemed easy. Food was clearly gross. I now stay at Magnolia hotel. Its newer and amazing for the same price or cheaper. I will never stay here again!!I travel everywhere throughout the U.S.  I've been what are proclaimed as ""the best"". I must say, I found ""the best"" here in the Omni in Saint Louis. Upon checkin we were greeted by a lady at the front entrance. She was VERY accommodating. She addressed me by my last name the entire trip checking in on us throughout. She saw that we had kids so she immediately asked if we needed sheets for them. I said yes. By the time my wife got to the room there was a knock at the door with someone with sheets in hand. Service is what sets hotels apart and this group nailed it 100%. Great job!!!  We will be back!!!!Great Hotel! The staff are extremely friendly and super helpful. Rooms are a nice size, not too big, not too small, but just right. Beds are extremely comfortable. The only thing missing is a pool, but they have a fitness center, and other nice amenities. It was also great having a nice shuttle to get you places within a 3 mile radius in case you don't feel like walking. I would definitely stay again when I return to St.Louis.I've never experienced anything as unbelievable as to what happened at this hotel.  I travel regularly as the owner of two companies and this was my first time staying at an Omni Hotel.  After a long week of travel, my partner met me to see the gateway arch and explore the city museum, two local attractions.When we got back to our room that night, we were in shock.   Our room, 208, was directly above the bar that had music louder than a dance club.  This was at 11:30 at night.  We decided to relax thinking they certainly could not go past midnight.  They did.  I called the front desk and they did not answer, probably because they knew why I was calling.  I called again and the staff member picked up...you could hear the music clear as day though the handset.  I asked her when the music would be shut down as we needed to sleep (It was now 12:05 AM), she told us they were going until 1:00.  I asked if there was anything they could do as we were very tired, like move us to a different room, and she said no...but she would leave a note for the manager.  We continued to listen to music that was conversation level in our room with lyrics that were derogatory to African Americans and the LGBT community and a song about something called truffle butter that comes from lady parts.  We were both in shock that the hotel would allow such explicit music to be played in an open lobby area at 12:30 at night - especially when it could be heard clearly on the 2nd floor.  It left us wide awake wondering what they meant by things like truffle butter - quite disturbing as we are a gay couple.Finally at 12:50 they shut down the music, and our room became peaceful - we had no other complaints about the room besides the fact that we could not sleep until 1:00 AM.We were taken aback when in the morning they slipped the hotel bill under our door without even an acknowledgement of what had happened overnight.  Surely I thought to myself that the manager at the front desk was ready to rectify the situation.  When I went to check out he said the total and told us to have a good day.  I told him that we had a terrible night in the room (208) and told him a note was left for the manager to discuss with us in the morning.  He told us he was the manager and wasn't aware.  We explained what happened and he told us they would take off our parking for the night.  That seemed like a pittance given that from 10 PM on most hotels will enforce a noise ordnance and throw guests out that do not comply.  Our only option was to lay awake in our bed and listen to the disgusting lyrics in our room, some of which were highly offensive to a gay couple.  I told him I would not have paid anything for the room or stayed at the hotel had I known this would have been our experience and he said, ""I'm sorry for the inconvenience."" We left infuriated at the situation and how poor customer service is at the Omni Majestic Hotel and that they felt free parking justifies keeping guests up until 1:00 AM without any prior notice.  Certainly we will never be staying in this hotel again, and it brings into question the Omni brand being that this was our first experience.Awesome!!! This hotel was well worth the price. Perfectly located in the downtown area (for tourist purposes) walking distance from all major attraction! The staff is super friendly and helpful! And they have a ""shuttle"" which is more like a personal car service.  At no cost they will take you on a first come first serve basis to any location within 3 miles!!!!! The room was spacious and clean towels were amazingly soft (lost of fabric softener :)) the pillows were perfect and the bed was super comfy!I must say I was a little weary keeping my reservation after reading previous reviews. That being said, I'm glad I didn't. I was in town for the Blackhawks game a couple weeks ago. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. We were promptly checked in to our room. The room was incredibly clean and bed was so soft. I will always consider staying at the Omni for future visits.","I only gave this hotel 1 star because one of the managers tried to redeem themselves after the fact.This hotel blows some serious chunks. I stayed here in late July for 4 nights for a wedding that I was in. I see a lot of reviews that keep stating that there are nice perks here, and you get a complimentary beverage in the morning. The juices they offer are store bought, not organic or freshly squeezed or anything. Even the grapefruit juice is some RubyRed juice by OceanSpray in a glass. Also, be warned that the pictures on the internet do not show you a true picture of this hotel. It is old, not modern in the least bit, certainly not even close to the standard of other Omni locations. They have an office desk as the registration/check-in area. It's absurdity at its finest. Everyone that walks in for the first time always walks past the front desk because it's not standard for a concierge style desk to be the registration area at a hotel. Upon arrival (around 11am) I was told that rooms are not ready and check-in is at 3pm...although I requested an early check-in with my reservation. I explained to the staff member that we flew in from CA, approximately 2000 miles away on a red-eye flight...we were BEYOND exhausted. I was basically told to leave and they'll call me when my room is ready, so I grabbed a bite to eat, toured the city a bit in my rental, and proceeded back to the hotel. Hours passed by at this point, and I just knew that the staff had not made me a priority to get checked-in. When I returned they behaved mildly concerned about getting me a room...even radioed the housekeeping staff to ""double-check"" if my room was ready. This room had been ready for some time. These staff members are slow, nothing is urgent to them and they seem to have a careless attitude about everything...with an exception of the night staff, which is all very accommodating. An hour before we were to arrive at the wedding, the water in our room stopped running. We called the front desk to notify them, and they said they'd send someone from maintenance to fix the issue. 30 minutes later the water was back on with no explanation as to what happened, and as a result of this delay I barely made my friend's wedding! The next day before I checked out I talked with the front desk staff to give them feedback on my experience. I told them that I've never stayed at a hotel that's lost water, certainly not an Omni hotel, and I've stayed at hundreds of hotels. The staff member of course looked at me with a blank stare, mostly like they didn't care about me being annoyed with the quality of my stay. She then told me the manager was on lunch, so she would wait to finalize my bill so that the manager can make adjustments to the bill for my inconvenience. Several days went by, and I actually never received a follow-up phone call or an electronic receipt as I requested, so I decided to call them. The same staff member I dealt with answered, and I recapped my entire experience with her. After all of that she told me ""I remember you and no the manager did not take anything off of your bill"". Great...so I then asked for the number to their corporate office. The staff member then asked me to hold. Which I did for about 5 minutes and finally I was in touch with a manager on duty. They asked if they could help me, so I told her my story, my issues with my stay, and how I was annoyed because no one had even apologized to me for not having running water in my hotel room! It was only after getting angry that I was able to convince these folks to do the right thing and discount SOMETHING off of my bill. Candidly speaking, my opinion is that the management and staff here are pretty rude and careless until you've threaten to call corporate on them for the awful service they've provided you. Stay here if you don't like running water in your hotel room, and overpriced valet parking that's in a lot uncovered next door.So pleasantly surprised by this charming hotel in DT St. Louis. It's centrally located, and walking distance from the Arch, Scott Trade Center, and Bush stadium. Like many other reviewers have commented on, the staff at this hotel is truly amazing. They're exceptionally friendly at all hours and will go out of their way to make you feel welcome. They truly go over and above! Yes this place can seem a little antiquated but I enjoyed the quirkiness of it, and most importantly it was comfortable after a long day of walking. I don't know the next time I'll be back in StL, but I will definitely be coming back to this place when I do.Stayed at the Omni for one night recently while visiting some friends in the city. The service was good when we first arrived. Very friendly staff helped me get my bags up to my room and aided me in finding some good places in the area for some food and drinks. The room was nice, but there were some issues that made the night less than enjoyable. The faucet in the bathtub dripped several times per minute, making a loud noise echo through the room. Despite my best efforts to stop the noise, I called the desk to have someone sent up while I was out to dinner. When I came back, the drip persisted, with no sign of it being touched. I ended up just using earplugs to sleep through the night. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows felt like heaven on my neck. The lighting was pitch black at night, which made for some good z's. If the bathtub hadn't ruined the ambiance, this hotel would have been great.Do not stay here.  Room was dirty and the lost the keys for my valet car for over an hour.  On top of that, they did not reimburse for the locksmith I had to call.  I stay on the road in many different hotels and this is by far the worst.  Stay away.I booked this hotel room through a military website, of which I purchased the reservation through a military credit card. While the booking process was seemless, the follow through and the check in process at this hotel wasn't so spectacular. On the latter portion of my stay, my friend joined me as I was a seminary related function at Pride. She was mostly impressed with the hotel. However, I was a tad disappointed, as the hotel's accomodations did not meet the $200 per night price tag and other high charges. So, I ordered a double bed room for two nights. When I walked into the place, I noticed the size of the lobby. The check in desk was also a simple desk with an agent behind the desk. When I got my room, I was shocked. I definitely did not get what I originally ordered: a double bedroom. I was given a single bed room with a king size bed. The room was a bit smaller than what I was advised and the bathroom was even smaller. The TV was a small box TV tube set, not nicer flat screen TVs. Omni definitely needs to look into at least upgrading to plasma flat screens, since most $50 chain hotels offer that service.The bed was nice and fluffy and I was seriously considering stealing the linen. However, that was the only plus that I could think of. Other amenities? A gym? No, don't think about that. There was a small gym downstairs, but that place was almost in disrepair. There is no pool. There is no gift shop, but they gave us walking directions to a shnuck's drugstore to get any needed supplies. The complimentary shuttle service seemed to have driven off to space. Oh yeah, their $25 valet service involved getting the desk person to walk out to the car and drive it up to the hotel. And they store the car in a parking lot where normal people can park and pay $12 a day. Other outrageous charges and surcharges involved a $10 per night 3 meg internet service (not complimentary), and their hotel dining lounge, which offers a $12 breakfast buffet, which offered a small buffet that only sat on two tables. I seriously think that Omni needs to visit RiverCity or Lumeire and check out what a real buffet encompasses. The rooms didn't even have smaller mini fridges or the hallways did not have any ice machines. The only positive aspect of this hotel would be the nicer and enthusiastic customer service and the plush beds. However, that could not save the fact that this was extremly overpriced and the bedroom suites were overly eggagerated as ""suites"".Honestly, I recommend that you save your money, pay half, and go to a nicer hotel (eg. Doubletree or the Hilton). Skip this joint.Aside from the very friendly and efficient front desk staff (really it's a front table) and clean room, this hotel leaves some things to be desired.  First thing I would desire would be hot water that does more than come and go. Add to that a shower that takes a moment to figure out how to get the sem-hot water going - turn the knob to the right, towards the C?  Add to that a shower that barely dribbles when you pull to stem on the faucet to get the shower going.  You get the picture.... Morning wake up time was not too fun.  In room WiFi was fast though so, give them one more plus I suppose.We stayed at this hotel for five nights in the first week of June. Everything was excellent especially the service that we received from each and every person who works at this property. Everyone always had a smile on their face at any time you saw them. Rooms were super clean and comfortable. Having the shuttle that takes you anywhere in a 3 mile radius was nice too. Only thing I would prefer would be a pool, but they told me they are apart of something like the historical hotels association which doesn't let them have one. Not a deal breaker to me. Hopefully the next time week go back to STL they will have all rooms with HDTV's!Stop searching and stay here. This hotel had impeccable service, beautiful rooms, and amenities that surpass many hotels I've been in before. The interior (especially the room) looks like an old, historic NYC hotel. You are offered to join their guest club for free the day you arrive. This allows for unlimited in room internet service, free pressing, and 2 beverages in the morning by your door. They offer a shuttle service to all the major surrounding attractions. There is a bar in the hotel that also has food. It's everything you need! Enjoy your soft, luxurious robe and sleep until checkout in pitch darkness and quiet. This hotel will do anything to make your stay worth every dollar. A few tips: park on the street and get a ticket for $10; it's cheaper than valet. It's also right across from the entrance! My only complaint was the bartender at the hotel. He was nice, but after leaving a cash tip on the table and going to the bar to pay, he kept staring at me to leave him a tip. It was awkward and made me want to go back and get the tip I left! No one else in the hotel was like that, though. I will stay there again! I just won't visit the bar.Perfectly priced hotel with amazing customer service.If staying downtown, I would recommend the Omni.  If you are traveling with a dog, stay at the Omni.   They gave our little guy a bag of treats and a new toy, so sweet.  Every time he entered the lobby, he was met with 'oohs' and ""awws"", sounds you feel your best little guy deserves, but is nice to hear from a staff of employees that don't have to do that.  Someone was always opening the doors and saying a warm hello.  When room service was not available, someone was more than happy to hand deliver  menus of local restaurants that were willing to deliver.  The place is tradition in decor, but modern in their approach.  The rooms are comfortable and clean, not current and pristine.  It's a boutique hotel with slow elevators, but charm and service overshadow any shortcomings.This was our first stay at the Omni Majestic.  It is within walking distance of any of the great architectural sites and they have a free shuttle that takes you within a three mile radius.The staff was outstanding in their hospitality.  Rooms were very clean and well maintained.  While we had a great corner view of the Civil Courts and Southern Bell buildings, this is not a place for the views but rather for the comforts.  The hotel restaurant was ok.  We had a good breakfast, I cannot speak for the other foods but never did it seem busy.  There are lots of places for the younger crowd over on Washington Street.  Make sure to join their rewards program which entitles you to complimentary WiFi and morning in room beverage.The price point was on the spot.  A great value compared to its competitors closer to the Arch and so much quieter away from the raucous sports fans and noisy tourists.It will be our primary choice of lodging when visiting this city.This is by far one of the most positive experiences I have had at a hotel. The staff here are top-notch. They made us feel comfortable the minute we arrived. To give you an example, the front desk staff (I feel really bad I did not catch your name) called me by Mr. (mylastname) the entire time I was there. They asked me several times if I was enjoying my stay. When I first arrived I did not like my room because it was adjoining and I could hear my neighbors; they had a new room for me within a few minutes. They had chocolate dipped strawberries and champagne on Thursday evening. That was nice.  Oh! And they have a shuttle that will take, and pick you up, within a 3 mile radius. Doesn't get better than that. Highly recommend this place.This was my first stay and it was very excellent. Nice staff, nice room, great location.They really went above and beyond and exceeded my expectations. On my last day of the stay I happened to get really, really sick. I checked out, went to the office that I was working from, and they asked if I could just go back to the hotel (good idea.) I was worried because I had already checked out.Not only did they let me get back into my room until my flight later that day, they were SO helpful and got me anything and everything I needed. Multiple boxes of kleenexes, lots of hot water for tea. The soup of the day was chili (which wouldn't be too soothing) and they made special creamy vegetable soup instead. SO NICE!I will be back. Thank you!I didn't stay at The Omni today, but I was definitely treated like I did.My daughter, husband and I spent the afternoon walking and playing at Citygarden. We were there longer than we planned and I noticed that my diabetic husband was experiencing low blood sugar. We started walking in hopes of finding someplace to get him some sugar. We spotted The Omni and walked into the lobby asking for a Coke as quickly as possible.The gentlemen in the lobby were outstanding. They got him a Coke...then another. They told us to have a seat and take as long as we needed. Then he went off to get a banana. We stayed in the lobby for about 15 minutes and felt right at home.Running a hotel should include being a part of the community. I will always remember how these men welcomed us and helped us. When I have friends and family in town, I will certainly speak highly of The Omni.Thank you so much.I should have listened to the previous reviews. The two stars are for the comfort of the bed. That was the only plus about this place. ""Tired and old"" is definitely a good description of what you'll find at this establishment. We were let down from the beginning. There isn't even enough room in the lobby for a check-in counter, so you sit at a tiny desk fit for one person in order to check in. Awkward and unwelcoming. The gym is tiny, shoved in a small basement room with an eerie feel. I think there were maybe three machines down there. They also have no vending machines (c'mon, even the Motel six has that?), so you're forced into the hotel ""restaurant"", which looks abandoned, and has poor decor and terrible lighting. Oh, I guess you do have the option of drinking the $5 bottle of water in the room. The room is poorly designed, with a tiny bathroom, and 1988 Zenith-style box TV. No pool or any other amenities at this place. Very bare bones. Oh, and it needs a revamp. The elevator had stains all over the door and paint and wallpaper were peeling in places around the room. And if you're staying downtown with kids, don't take them here. Not family-friendly. Your kids will be bored.  I feel like I got ripped off for $160/night. I would've been better off anywhere else.Great hotel.  Very clean, and friendly staff.   They provide a shuttle that will basically take you anywhere you want to go, and the driver was very knowledgeable about the area and gave many great suggestions.I came here with my friend to stay on saturday night for pridefest. While I am a local to the city, we decided to stay close to pride so that we could fully enjoy the weekend without having to drive back to where we live. The hotel itself is very clean and the employees were always asking if we needing anything to make out stay better, but i can say that they did an excellent job in providing service weather they could get it or they directed us to where we could get what we needed. I do have to say that the bar there has an excellent breakfast (i believe it's only open on the weekends, but i may be wrong here) and stay open till 11pm for drinks, if you need one. The rooms were clean, spacious and the beds comfortable (I'm very picky and seem to only get good nights rests at my home... I know picky!) and the pillows wonderful!We recently stayed at the Omni Majestic St Louis and the staff was amazing!  They found out it was my daughter's birthday and sent a piece of chocolate cake up to our room. Attentive does not begin to describe the service we were given. Thank you to everyone there.This was a lovely hotel.  The rooms were exactly how they are displayed on their website and the staff is equally friendly.  The only draw back was that their air conditioning was non-existant during our stay. My co-workers and I were in St. Louis for a training session and this hotel was conveniently located across the street from our corporate office. They did have a very nice breakfast layout but we were all complaining about the lack of cool air blowing in our rooms.  We were told that it wasn't warm enough for them to get the air conditioning going but it was fairly warm during the days we spent there.Overall, the rooms are great, the elevator is a bit small but does the job and the staff is what made our stay more pleasant. Super attentive, hospitable and positive.Omni Majestic Hotel is a little boutique hotel with an amazing little bar bathed in windows all around it. Prices are hotel prices so don't get excited about affordability. Don't go to a hotel bar if you are a budget. But Omni has enough character and charm with its warm woods and low lighting to make it worth the investment. Wine selections is decent. The house chard was very drinkable. Beer selection isn't Growlers but you should be able to find most domestics and imports that have good distribution. Although I don't think PBR is on the menu.There is street parking in front or valet for $5. Very reasonable. Omni promotes itself as a family friendly environment so if you have out-of-town guests with kids, Omni is a great choice for lodging.After reading its many great reviews and anxious to take advantage of my newly-raised status with Omni's Select Guest program, I booked two nights at the Omni Majestic in St. Louis, Missouri. The hotel's glowing reviews seem to share a common theme: the friendly, customer-service oriented staff with whom so many guests are impressed. My contact with the hotel's staff was neither good nor bad - the staff conducted themselves professionally and were attentive to my needs. This should be of no surprise - how else would we expect them to be? A smiling, enthusiastic front desk agent does not make a hotel three star versus four star, though.The Omni Majestic is located on Pine Street in downtown St. Louis. It is the lone hotel in this part of town, as nearly all of the other luxury hotels are found close to the Arch. On the weekend, downtown is a ghost town - there are no stores in walking distance that are open and the choice of restaurants is limited as well. If you arrive by plane and do not rent a car, you will find yourself trapped. From the airport, I took the MetroLink directly to downtown. It cost just $3.75 and took about thirty-five minutes. The Omni is about a block and a half from the 8th &amp; Pine station. Approaching the hotel, it's exterior is drab and uninspiring. It did not have an ""old"" look as much as it had a Orwellian 1984 look. The hotel's entrance is unimpressive as is the lobby, despite the grand piano that looks out of place. The front desk is literally just that - a desk at the door where someone is seated, waiting to check you in. I assumed the front desk was being renovated but no, this was the front desk. The front desk agents were friendly. I requested my room upgrade but was told that the hotel was completely booked and there was nothing available. I was given keys to a room on the sixth floor. My room was a huge disappointment. The decor is uninspired, boring and lacks any charm. The windows provided a view of nothing. The television was old - no flat screen, and there was no safe in the room for valuables. Perhaps worst of all was the bathroom, for which even ""small"" would be an overstatement. I assume this hotel has nicer rooms wherein some of these things have been addressed. It is, therefore, an even greater disappointment that the hotel provided this room to one of its most loyal guests. The internet service was okay at best. The fitness center should be closed. It had two or three very old cardio machines and two sets (a total of four) dumbbells laid on the floor. What a joke. I have seen two-star hotel gyms with more variety. Aside from that, the fitness center is in the basement and lacks any decor to brighten it up or inspire. There was no turn-down service in the evening. I thought about giving room service a try just after 10:00 p.m., only to learn that it was already closed for the evening. This hotel could have old-world, historic charm, but instead it just looks neglected and dated. It lacks a four-star feel but charges four-star rates, excessive considering the hotel's offerings. Similarly priced hotels are located by the Arch, a much better area, offering views, modern amenities and up-to-date technology. I love Omni hotels, but the Majestic is a huge disappointment.","I stayed 3 nights at the Omni Majestic for a business trip.  I frequent the Omni chain and just recently obtained Platinum status in their loyalty program.  That meant this trip I would receive a local market item in my room as well as bottled water refreshed nightly.  When I arrived to my room, the welcome card was addressed to Mr. Bryan, clearly not my name.  I also did not have my amenity, which was a bowl of nuts.  I called to the front desk to be sure I was in the right room.  The gentleman was courteous but really didn't seem to care about getting me a card with my name or my ""welcome"" treats, as a Platinum member. I also received bottled water on one night only.  This was the trend the remaining time I was there.  The staff was courteous enough, but really didn't go out of their way like other Omni hotels. Two times when I ordered room service they did not bring silverware and one morning they forgot my complimentary beverage, another supposed perk of being a loyalty program member.  The resteraunt in the hotel was so-so at best.  The food was usually cool when delivered and there was not much variety.  Certainly disappointing experience, even though I do frequent Omni chains, I will not stay here when I come to St. Louis again.The Omni Majestic is truly a three-star boutique hotel, but the excellent service my mom and I received while staying here bumps this place up a star.We both had been flying from opposite ends of the country (me since the night before) in order to attend my grandmother's wake and burial. The funeral home was close to the Omni Majestic, and from the reviews I chose it as our home-base while we were in St. Louis.I had phoned prior to our arrival to let them know we were coming. When we arrived Mark and someone else who's name I cannot remember (but she was the sweetest woman ever) greeted us. We were early, but they got us into a room quickly. They stored our bags while we got some food in our stomachs and off we went upstairs.The hotel is rather dated. The elevator is old and the smell is not that great. It still smells like it's legal to smoke indoors-that's how long it's been since the carpet was changed out-or perhaps it was never changed out.The room was nice. Bathrooms are tiny and the televisions are the old tubes. They also offer complimentary shuttle service within 5 miles.The $25 a night parking fee is a bit steep considering the location and city. I'd expect that in Chicago, Miami or NYC, but not a boutique hotel in St. Louis. If you want nice, centrally located, clean-though dated and great service I'd recommend the Omni Majestic for your stay. If you want big and roomy with some glamour, keep looking.All in all, such a pleasant and positive stay. They were very kind and accommodating during such a difficult time.My first stay at an Omni was in Richmond, VA.  I really enjoyed my stay there, so I was really excited to stay in another one.  The lobby was really nice.  I remember reading that this was a historic hotel.  It had a stately look about it.  There was lemon and lime flavored water, newspapers, tourist information, and oranges in a bowl to welcome guests.  Customer Service:  The hotel staff was seated at a desk and there was only one person there to check in guests, but we didn't have to wait long to be checked in. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the area.  On our last day, we used the shuttle service to go to Budweiser.  The lady who took us, not sure of her name, was really nice and give us some tips about things to do when we returned.  When she came back and picked us up, she took us around to see the best view of the Arch.  She even got out of the car, crossed the street and took pictures for me.  She was awesome!  The restaurant staff in the morning were really polite and helpful.  The older guy especially was engaging with the guests and had a great sense of humor.  Overall, they are fantastic!The room:  As someone else mentioned, it is a historic hotel.  It isn't really modern, but has stately and well appointed furnishings in the room.  I wish there were more electric outlets, but again, it is an older hotel.  It was still very comfortable.  The bed was super comfy and I slept like a baby.  The room was very spacious and the furniture was arranged to maximize the space.  The tv was old, but it had a swivel base.  I do wish that there were more cable channels to watch.  The channels were pretty limited.  The bathroom was nice enough and the room was really clean and smelled good too.  I was greeted by soft music on the tv, a bottle of water, and a hand written note.  It was definitely a nice welcome to the hotel.Convenience:  I didn't drive on this trip, but instead took the Metrolink.  The hotel was very convenient, since it was only a few blocks from the 8th and Pine Street stop.  You can see the Arch from the hotel and it is also within walking distance.  If you don't want to walk, you can take the Metrolink or get the shuttle driver to take you there.  The hotel is right in the downtown area and there are plenty of restaurants a few blocks away and a grocery store, Culinaria (fan-bloody-tastic market), nearby.Amenities:  There is no parking in the front, but there is a lot next to the hotel.  I'm not sure how much it costs.  The breakfast was great!  There were plenty of cereal options, croissants, muffins, cinnamon buns, bagels, sausage, eggs, waffles, and fresh fruit every morning.  There was also orange juice, coffee, tea, cranberry juice and water.  I really liked their gym.  It wasn't too tight in there and they had great Precor equipment.  There was an elliptical, treadmill, stationary bike, and a recumbent bike.  They also had dumbbells, mats, and a basket of towels, Clorox clothes to clean the equipment, and lemon flavored water, although they put too much lemon in it and it was a little bitter.Overall:  Great service, comfortable room, fantastic breakfast, and great location.  I would definitely stay here again and I recommend it to any of you who might be visiting the city.I don't know how Hotwire can call this hotel a 4 star hotel. It's fine if your looking for a 2.5 star hotel. Old rooms, old carpet, big old retro tube TV with a 19"" screen and no high definition. The bathroom is tiny and the rooms are cramped. It's really a joke. Few outlets to plug in. Just dated and obsolete. Definitely not a 4 star hotel. Holiday Inns are nicer and cleaner. Take a pass and don't trust Hotwire.This is my second visit to an Omni hotel and both have been perfect. I was in St. Louis for an interview and used Hotwire to get a great rate; when I found out that my $54/night room would be the Omni, I was very pleased. First off, Omni's free-to-join members club is an outright steal; free wifi ($10/day otherwise), free pressing for 2 items, free morning beverages delivered to your room, and free shuttle within 5 miles of the hotel? STEAL. For the Majestic in particular, the staff was extremely courteous (they were welcoming me by name by the next morning) and were nice enough to upgrade my room with no hassles (also free, just ask). So in the end I'm getting a 4 star hotel, with all these freebies for less than $60 a night? Ridiculous. As mentioned by the other reviewers, the location is great and very close to restaurants and a nice supermarket. 2 blocks from the metro. Lots of great bars nearby, including Jack Patricks just a block away. Oh, and their beds and pillows are SUPER comfy as well. Only downside is that their bathrooms can be a little small, but thats minor. Oh, and their in-house ""restaurant"" isn't really that great in terms of selection/quality, but it makes up for it by being relatively cheap (about $10 for a meal). Can't recommend this hotel and chain enough; I will no doubt keep my eyes peeled for them on hotwire in the future.Excellent service, beautiful wood and brass finishings, rooms are spacious, but the bathrooms are a bit tight. Great location too, walking distance to delicious restaurants, bars, and sights. Can't wait to stay again!Despite a very friendly and polite staff skip this hotel when stating in St. Louis. I have stayed here a few times for business and each time my reservation was screwed up. The rooms are nice but have signs have wear and tear and forget trying to find an outlet you can use. Omni's are nice hotels but this one is old and tired. There are better hotels for the money in the downtown area and they won't charge for a refrigerator to be bought to your room.Stayed for the 1 night I was in St Louis and the staff there was amazing.  They were all super friendly, (thanks for putting up with me laura) the shuttle service (Lincoln navigator) takes you to all the great spots in st Louis. The bartenders were gems. Didn't eat at the restaurant. The only complaint i have is that the pool table slants to the West. This allowed my girlfriend to beat me at pool. That and Jim got me drunk. To keep it a fair review, however, the rooms do need updating. But rest assured that I will be returning.I stayed at this hotel on a business trip to St. Louis this weekend because of all of the positive Yelp reviews, and I'm sorry to say my experience was nowhere near as pleasant as the other reviewers. My main gripe is the value, or lack thereof. Given how the rooms were more than $160 a night, I was surprised that certain basic amenities were missing. There wasn't a fridge in the room, nor were there any vending at all anywhere in the building. When I asked where I could get a can of soda, the woman at the front desk suggested I go four blocks down the street to a grocery store. Meanwhile, the A/C was so clunky it sounded like a death rattle and there were bits of peeling paint and wallpaper in my room. It felt like the Omni forgot to renovate the place whenever it was they took it over.Meanwhile, two mornings in a row I had a problem with wake-up calls. The first time I arranged a wake-up for 6:45am. I ended up waking up around 6:30 anyway because I was on east coast time, then stayed at the hotel for an hour - and the call never came. Then this morning, when I needed to get up around 4am to make a 6am flight, the wake-up call was 10 minutes late. Better than nothing, but I had to scramble like hell to make my cab reservation.The ironic think about all of this is that I had a great night sleep here for three nights in a row. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, well above average, and I woke up feeling well rested. This would easily be a 4-star review if my room hadn't looked so run down and they hadn't screwed up my wake-up calls. Twice.The Omni is where I was shacked up for the impending snow storm that blanketed the area.  I arrived monday at about 4:45pm after falling on the ice not once, but twice less than a block away from the place.  Entering the place was great, an employee opened the interior door for me and welcomed me in.  The lobby is small but nice and very bright with great wood work.  Just past the front desk is the entrance to the restaurant and then the elevators. I decided to head up to see if I could get a quick work out in before my staycation/ business function/ work bender begins. The room was excellent. Nice, large king sized bed with all the trimmings.  The rooms are simple yet elegant and the furnishing are all real wood with a dark finish too them. First thing I do is hop on the wifi to check the weather.  It is $10 for wifi for your stay if you don't get it comp'ed.  Next I decided to turn on the TV to check the local news to see what we were actually in store for.  The remote is, to say the least, worse than my DirecTV remote in that it is unresponsive and a pain to use but after sufficient pressure was applied to the buttons I managed to get it to the channel of my choice and watch as the ice storm overtook the city.  Now I'm feeling lazy, and out of shape so I decide to head on down to the gym to get a little bit of a work out in at least.  The gym is cardio only and they have two different stationary bikes, an elliptical, and a two tread mills (one of which was out of order at the time).  Towels are provided down there along with Yoga mats and they have a TV as well that also sports the same difficult remote as the rooms do.  Time to hit the showers.The shower/bathroom is quite small but efficient enough.  Best part is that I could actually stand underneath the shower head and not have to bend down or anything to wash my hair. I only bring this up because I'm 6'4"" and most places have the shower head at like 6' off the ground which makes showering interesting to say the least.  After the rest of my co-workers arrived we spent the evening at the Bar watching the weather come down.  The bartender was excellent and kept us all sufficiently lubricated until closing time before heading to Jack Patricks to close that place down. The next night we ended up actually eating at the restaurant.  The food was ok, nothing to write home about but it was good and was a little higher in price compared to other restaurants in the area but since the storm was still going on we decided to use the expense account once again and grab dinner and some drinks. The restaurant and bar are both beautiful as you can see from some of the photos uploaded by other yelpers.  Breakfast in the morning was ok as well and I really liked how they had Eggs and Sausage on top of the standard bread fare. The coffee is pretty hot also so make sure if you are getting it to-go you grab one of those cardboard holders. I spent 3 nights at the Omni and have to say it was one of the more enjoyable hotel experiences I've had.Let me start by saying I've never met a friendlier staff. They are so polite and accommodating.  Having 6000 sorority women invade your city is no small feat. However, the staff at the Omni act like its nothing new.The hotel, while not brand new, is clean and well maintained. The rooms are large and quite comfortable. My only complaint is the lack of natural sunlight.  The room that we had face the other side of the building. Our room was dark most of the day and the windows did not open.  The hotel is in the middle of downtown and within walking distance of many shops, restaurants and the convention center.  All in all this was a great experience and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who plans on visiting the St. Louis Area.Do not recommend! Condition is dated &amp; worn. Rooms show bad signs of being really old. Furniture needs replacement in rooms. Carpet is disgusting. TV is more than 10 yrs old (small screen, boxy type, &amp; buttons busted). Bathroom is poor quality craftsmanship. I even spotted a cockroach scampering. Room is tiny and view is bad. Hotel property is not in a happening area. Restaurant is dead. ...Only plus, reception staff is nice. PS no parking included. Total hassle and extra cost you'll have to budget.We stayed at the Omni on our wedding night after getting married at The Thaxton. The Omni was a beautiful place and convenient for us considering our ceremony/reception site.  Upon arrival we had already been checked in by our day of planner and our car was already parked without problems.  Our room was much more spacious than we expected with a living room area on the side...also not expected. It had two bathrooms which we didn't notice until leaving the next morning.  We had a plate of chocolate covered strawberries with a bottle of champagne. Very exciting for a lady who loves chocolate! The room was neat and tidy and after getting relaxed in we we newlyweds decided to order our breakfast in bed before going to sleep. It promptly arrived at the asked time and was delicious and enough to feed 3 of me. So much food and so worth it! They even had soy milk which is a plus for someone who can't have dairy!We were offered early check in and late check out if needed. We truly enjoyed the room and would recommend and stay again!Outstanding customer service. All the reviews about this property being great were very true. Very comfortable, kid friendly, restaurant in the hotel, right downtown and close to everything.Service at the Omni was exceptional! We stayed here in a mini honeymoon and they went out if their way to accommodate us and sent up complimentary champagne. Bed and pillows were not as comfortable as I like but that could be a difference of opinion. Definitely will stay again.What a cool hotel. Almost boutique but not quite. Room was a little tight with two double beds, but quite, clean and updated.  Restaurant and bar was good as well - when reserving ask for the all inclusive $5 breakfast buffet, well worth it.Nothing but good things to say about this place. I recently was in STL for a concert and had such a great experience while staying at the Omni, my next trip and over night will be here! The staff is so friendly and helpful. The front desk all the way to the restaurant was constant friendliness and willingness to help with anything.My fiance and I stayed here for a little weekend getaway to St. Louis. The staff is amazingly friendly and had good suggestions for dinner. Valet parking is highly recommended since the garages nearby do not have an attendent that stays overnight. The only thing was that the bathroom was small but it wasn't that big of a deal. The bed is heaven...seriously it's amazing. The best sleep EVER! Everything is pretty much in walking distance of all the attractions. Plus there is free Starbucks coffee in the morning :)This is a nice hotel. The rooms are large and comfortable and the beds are just wonderful. The hotel is in a great location (if you want to go around downtown STL) and they offer a free shuttle within 5 miles of the hotel. We used it many times, and the only drawback is that it ends at 10 p.m. The driver recommended a reliable taxi service for us to use instead. The staff at the front desk were incredibly helpful during the day and seemed willing to do almost anything to make our stay even better. When we showed back up at the hotel after checkout (I had dressed for a warmer day and needed a place to change), they were understanding and still friendly, and let us use their restrooms.The night staff was another story. We had purchased the sweetheart/romantic package for the night, which comes with free breakfast, two special drinks, a turndown, etc. When we called down to request our breakfast the night before, the staff member said they'd make a note of it. No breakfast arrived, and we had to go downstairs to get it. Also, when we asked about the drinks/other specials of our package, whoever was at the desk had no idea what we were talking about/what our package even was. Needless to say, we didn't get the two drinks included in our package.Other than the night service issue, our stay at the Omni Majestic was great, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for comfortable, luxury accommodations in St. Louis. We plan on staying at other Omni hotels in the future.We had our wedding reception here in their restaurant area.  They were extremely accommodating and the service was solid, though it was pretty clear that they aren't used to doing this sort of thing.  The only gripe was that there was some miscommunication on the billing, which upped the price-per-person quite significantly, but not enough to totally piss me off. Regardless, everything went as smoothly as it possibly could go.  The food was excellent and they were more than willing to provide tastings and try dishes that were not on the standard menu.  Also, it was definitely one of the cheaper options compared to other venues.","The Omni Majestic is a cute little hotel right in the heart of downtown. Its within walking distance of the arch and other downtown attractions. There was a rib festival two block away when we stayed. The rooms themselves are a little on the small side for an Omni. The TV's are still older tube sets. However the bed was comfy, and the place was clean. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and gave us lots of inside tips on things to do in the St. Louis area.another great weekend at the Omni Majestic.  hint:  ask for an upgrade to one of the suites (presidential OR ambassador)  HUGE, hot tubs, lots of seating, super comfy.  the upgrade will cost you...but still.another thing:  sign up for the FREE select guest programs.  I love this hotel.Downtown is not the best part of St. Louis. Despite the hope of revitalization, it's kind of a ghost town. But downtown is where most people end up staying when they visit, and it's where my friend blocked rooms for her nearby wedding. If you're going to be downtown, the Omni is a great choice. The service here was amazing. Free shuttle service, fantastic free continental breakfast, chocolate mints in your room each night, and a really friendly staff. We left our keys in our room two or three times (it was a total sitcom), and they were great about giving up new keys each time.Now don't get all confused by my pimped out rating. Is this is five star hotel? No, it's not. But do they deserve five stars for being awesome? Yes, they sure do! My mom and I visited this Omni last weekend to see some sights in St. Louis. F'ed up, right? Who visits St. Louis as a tourist? I do, of course! Check in was painless, even with my dog. No stupid waivers to sign. No deposit as it was waived because of a special on their website. All they asked for was my dog's name. Our room was nice, tastefully decorated and comfortable. It was not, however, modern. Comfortable? Yes. Quiet? Yes. Clean? Very. But W style? No.  It was kind of decorated like my the house of my dead step granny. Bless her heart. Her taste in furnishings sucked. The best part about my stay was the wonderful staff. They were SO freaking nice! Just plain nice, efficient and so helpful. I would definitely stay here again.  One tip about parking - there really is no need to valet for $24 a day. Meters are free on Saturdays, Sundays and after 7 or 8 p.m. on weeknights. They are widely available all days of the week. If you're out of the hotel most of the day, it's really a waste to pay that much for parking. Just street park it and feed the meter when necessary.I travel a fair amount for work, and although my trip to St. Louis was for pleasure, I found the Omni Majestic to be much better than many of the big chains I typically stay at (Hyatt, Hilton, Westin, etc). The property itself is a small, historic hotel, giving the place a boutique-like feel. The room was on the large side, and had a comfortable bed, which is always a nice surprise, even in this era of the ""Heavenly Bed."" But what really threw the Omni into the Yelp 5-star category was the service. From check-in to check-out, the staff went out of their way to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We got a complimentary shuttle ride over to the Hyatt on Thanksgiving for dinner, and the continental breakfast was probably the yummiest I've ever had at the hotel (definitely try the omelette if you stay here). All in all, a great stay, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone traveling to St. Louis for work or pleasure. Just don't walk the streets after dark -- it's a bit sketchy and desolate --- America's Most Dangerous City!",,"['week', 'attended', 'rights', 'game', 'center', 'booked', 'room', 'using', 'name',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotelumiere-saint-louis,HoteLumiere,2.5,$$,43,"We were here with three other couples.  They gave us all rooms next to each other.  The rooms were huge, with each having a separate living area.  There is an enclosed walkway to the casino and free parking.I should have checked here first. That was my first mistake!As I drove to St. Louis, I called to extend my stay an additional night. The person who answered the phone was rude as (bleep) in letting me know that the hotel was booked for the third night that I needed.  Thank God for that. When I arrived, I learned that there is no valet - ok, I'll take that one as my own fault. But who ever heard of a casino hotel with no valet? Huh?The person who checked me in was dry as toast. I arrive in my room after driving 8 hours to find a musty, damp smell waiting for me. It was late so I just went to sleep because I was dead tired. I woke up the next morning to find the nastiness posted in the photos.  Some things aren't immediately obvious so I'll list those here. The rest you can see for yourself. I immediately booked a room at a new hotel and checked the (bleep) out of this one.- only 2 can lights in the TINY bathroom. Could barely see when applying my makeup.- the closet only had one door. O_o- the furniture (sofa and chair) was worn and dirty- the vents in the room were bent, dirty, and rattled- the wallpaper had bubbles in it- the carpeting in the roo was worn- the carpeting in the halls is FILTHY. I mean, YUCK.Consider yourself forewarned.Not a business hotel so don't expect it to be. Nice public areas but the hallway and room carpet is filthy and covered with nasty stains. Not in a safe area. I walked once to my office downtown and took cabs after that. Service was actually friendly despite previous reviewsYou can get a nicer room with better customer service for the same price at other hotels in the area. This place is old and run down. The pictures already posted are accurate.This is where you stay when your husband and one of his best friends wants to gamble at the casino, but for any other reason, I would not stay here unless I had to. When we got there, I didn't expect the hotel to look as nice as it did when you saw the exterior of the building. It reminded me of an Embassy Suites with all the rooms facing the main floor. Each room is a suite with bedroom with a separate living area. The best part of the room was the bed. Very comfy. Maybe on any other weekend and any other room i would have had a better time, but it was not meant to be. First off, the carpet had some random red stains by the TV. My husband and I could only guess what it was. The layout of the hotel also made it difficult to sleep because you could hear all the obnoxious drunk people by the bar. There were limited outlets in the room. None around the beds. What hotel does that? It didn't make sense. When we came back late for checkout due to car troubles, our keys didn't work. Understandable since we were late. We went to the front desk and they gave us access to the room. It wasn't until we got to the elevator on the far side of the hotel that we realized that the key still didn't work. I don't think it is that difficult to program a key card. The final straw was when I was taking an afternoon nap. We had left the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door. The maid decided to come in still. She woke me up. I was sleepy and she had a thick accent so I couldn't understand what she was saying from the living room. Apparently, she wanted me to get up and sign a piece of paper that showed that I declined a room cleaning. I have never had happen at any other hotel before. So rude. Stay away from this hotel if you can. I know that the Four Seasons is pretty expensive and this is probably your only other option, but I would stay away if I could.Last minute decision to go here on the last leg of our trip instead of Louisville, KY. Great choice for sure. Hotel was very reasonable at only $109 (with taxes $148). We asked for an arch view room and ended up in 713. Great view of the arch, downtown and river. Rooms were not just rooms but suites. There was a living room/kitchen area when you first walked in. It had a fold out couch, sink, mini bar, dining table with chairs, another couple of chairs and a flat screen TV. You open the door and the bathroom is to your left. If you keep walking, the bedroom is at the end of the hall. Everything was clean. Staff members were very friendly. Beds were comfortable. Didn't hear a thing from the room next door and it was full of little kids. I was impressed. Short walk across the street to the casino. Highly recommend!Room was nice enough for 3 people to stay. two to share a queen bed and a fold out couch.  bathroom was small.  Plugs are behind the bed mattress and it was heavy to move, however we asked for an extension cord and maintenance quickly brought one and moved bed to plug it in.Don't touch the mini bar--a 12 oz. can of coke is $3. nothing has prices on it--it's a surprise when you check out.The size of the room was nice but it was very run down. The carpets were very dirty both in the halls and in the actual rooms. The sinks were stained. The furniture was so dirty that it made me question whether they were safe to sit on.It was nice that the hotel was attached to the casino but it was quite the trek to get there.I expected much more from a place that looks so nice when you enter.  It used to be an Embassy Suites and the entry still had that appearance.  The desk staff was pleasant bit pushy. Told us to park in their $10 lot. I wish it wasn't so late when we arrived, the free parking is easier access.  Second floor seems to be the party floor. Our room was dirty, and had no working heat.  We spent the night in a 60 degree room because we didn't want to call maintenance for the second time at midnight. The bathroom was dirty, long hairs left in the shower, and the outside of the tub has dirt marks streaming down it. Upon further inspection it appears that the floor of the bathroom had not been well cleaned in quite sometime.  The same goes for the door and the walls, really disgusting. The lighting in the bath is terrible. We asked for a non-smoking room and we were told it would be a $150 charge if we smoked in the room. In the meantime, their burn marks on the carpet as well as other stains, and the toilet and countertops in the bathrooms all have cigarette burns.  Certainly this was a smoking room at one time which they have not updated. Add to all of this housekeeping knocking on the door at 8 AM.  This is very much a sad finish to a great trip.  The rooms themselves, if they had been well cared for would be very nice we had a two queen suite and could've easily had somebody sleep in the living room.Since my last review this hotel has improved significantly. New carpet has been installed on most floors and they are continuing to upgrade themselves. The rooms I've stayed in since then are much better and cleaner. They also have improved the lobby area. Hotel lumiere is on its way up.Booked this hotel for a business trip as rates were the lowest in the city.  It was a great location, there are many bars and restaurants in walking distance.  Being from Chicago I am used to walking everywhere and has no complaints walking anywhere when we stayed here.  Hotel Lumiere is by no means a luxury hotel, but for the price it gets the job done.This isn't a terrible hotel as long as your expectations are low. I went into my stay expecting a nice casino hotel, similar to the Ameristar a few miles away. This is more like what you would find at Chief Snatching Buck's Hotel and Casino. I was told the hotel used to be an Embassy Suites, which explained a lot. Nice fountain, glass elevators, large lobby. All apparently built and last updated in 1972. I was amazed at how dated this property was (see others photos - I didn't look beforehand).I parked in the garage for the casino not knowing any better, and saved myself $20 in the process. This didn't make any sense - covered casino parking is free, but lot parking for the hotel is $20? When waiting to be checked in, the woman at the counter was very abrupt and rude to the customer ahead of me, which was a little shocking because you'd never see that in a Hilton or Hyatt property. In all fairness, this customer did look like she was on meth, but still, the overall attitude displayed screamed ""I used to work at the DMV."" The room was very very dated and kind of beat up. Nothing functional was broken, but don't expect to impress a date by taking her back here. Bed was comfortable and clean, sitting room was a nice feature, and I only paid $100 for a king suite. Hence the extra star bumping this to a 2. Crowd at the hotel and casino were both pretty ghetto. Again, don't expect to impress a date by bringing her back here, unless she's impressed by Nelly impersonators. The entire floor reeked of weed when I was coming back for the evening. Thats a first for me at a ""nicer"" hotel. The next morning room service tried to come in at about 9:30am, which wasn't a huge deal but c'mon, checkout is at 11 and I had not checked out yet. No folio under the door as I'd come to expect from other hotels. I've heard the Four Seasons next door is nicer, and it would about have to be. I won't stay at Hotel Lumiere again, but if all you want is a big room near the Landing for $100, this could be your diamond in the rough.I booked this hotel for a 1 night family get away; myself, boyfriend and daughter. We enjoyed the day at the zoo and science museum in St. Louis and due to weather finished with our tourism early and had no problem checking in early. Really, I'm not one to book a lavish lap of luxury on a mini-fam. Trip, but this hotel was better than expected; as I usually try to stick to a lower budget for these sorts of things considering, all my daughter cares about is a pool and all my BF and I care about is a clean soft bed and a shower. This hotel met all expectations and went well above. They have a efficient pool (great for making friends), a nice sauna, jacuzzi and exercise room. Also the hotel is within walking distance to bars and restaurants ( huge advantage, don't pay for parking) also close to the arch and other attractions. The room was clean and well kept, only negative  the mattress on the pull out bed was a bit of a bummer, which the kiddo wasn't too crazy about; but you know what I remember going on road trips with my folks they got the big cozy bed and my sister and I got the springy pullout!! So really it's more of a right of passage lolWe will definitely book this hotel in the future... Grate value for the price!! Very impressed!We stayed at the Lumiere because we decided to see a Rams game at the nearby stadium.First: Book early directly through the hotel and get a significantly better rate on a better room. Don't trust the travel sites that claim it's already booked for your date.  I have to wonder if Lumiere just isn't paying the price to be a preferred hotel, given how hard it was to get a room until I just called them directly. We paid $120 ($105 plus taxes) for a queen suite after all taxes, and that included parking.Beyond that: For the price, this was a good room.  But let me take you through the process, and you can decide just how good it really was...I checked in at the front desk.  She asked me if I needed a parking permit (YES, I did. You can't park in the hotel guest lot without a permit.. they will make you go check in and get your permit).  I asked her, ""This is included in my rate, right?""  She looked at me, somewhat condescendingly (I swear she almost rolled her eyes back into the back of her brain) and said, ""Ummm if you SAY so...""  Ok. I sure hoped so.  I took the permit and went back to my car to park it.We went to our rooms after parking. The lobby is very nice.  It looked pretty luxurious with the water fall and all the nice tables.  The room was very nice, especially for our advance rate.  The carpets (yes, I saw them mentioned in the reviews) were indeed stained. That wasnt such a big deal. I told my kids not to lie directly on the carpet and to not rub their faces on the carpet.  Really though, I tell them that at ALL hotels... and if you don't, no matter how luxurious and pristine the hotel may seem, you might want to rethink that.  No hotel is truly pristine. But I digress...We were ready to crawl into bed.  The beds were.. a little disturbing.  Both beds had (all white) sheets with visible stains.  I guess the idea of having all-white so that it can be bleached into complete whiteness wasn't working for them. Trying to untuck the sheets and the comforter meant accidentally untucking the sheets all the way down to the mattress. Ooops. And ummm.. eww? First thing I saw was a longish, curly, dark hair on the mattress protector.  Let's just say the length and curliness led me to think maybe this was not a hair from someone's head... You make the conclusions from there... I was kinda grossed out at the question of how thoroughly my bed had been cleaned off between changes.  The setup of sheets above the mattress protector was a flat sheet, a comforter, and another flat sheet.  One can only hope their comforters (which were somewhat duvet-like) are washed between uses... there was no way to sleep in that bed without direct contact with the comforter, which is usually yet another thing I avoid direct skin contact with (I've had friends who did housekeeping in hotels.. They advised me that the comforters are not cleaned between uses and are usually thrown onto the carpets, which are also never really truly cleaned). There was mold on the ceiling in the bathroom.  Not a deal breaker, but... It was also pretty cramped, but I'd not have docked even a single star if that had been all that I'd noted.Now, as far as the rest... If you're going to the Edward Jones Dome for a game, this is a great place to consider.  There's a skywalk over to the casino, and then there's a tunnel from there to directly across the street to the dome.  You can bring your children on this route, as you never need to actually access the gambling areas when cutting through the casino.  There are restaurants that you can also access while cutting through.  The tunnel is a series of moving sidewalks (flat escalators) up to a regular escalator (or elevator) up to street level.Summary:I'd honestly probably have given this hotel a 4 star rating if the sheets hadnt made me a bit apprehensive and made sleeping more difficult the night we stayed.  Nice views, and a very nice setup for much cheaper than any other hotels in walking distance from the dome.Do not stay here. Done - that simple. This place is absolutely disgusting. This doesn't have to do with just my experience, this would be your experience too. You may be fooled by looking at the common areas where it looks somewhat ok but this place is well overpriced and the accommodations are just poor. It is exactly like a motel 6. This is a $59 per night hotel but charges $200 because it is tied to the casino. Everything is smokey and outdated. Service is ghetto. The food is as poor as can be. Trust me on this. Stay anywhere else.For the price I'd never stay here again. The bed was fairly comfy and there was good water pressure but that's about all the nice I can say. Granted the water pressure was good but the water felt slimy, and none of us ever felt clean after the shower. The towels are crap-tastic and don't dry well at all. So you have a slimy water glaze on you and the towel just smears it around, which means you don't feel clean at all. That my friends is called a shower fail. And while we're in the bathroom lets discuss that...why is it so damn tiny? It felt like an airplane toilet with a shower attached to it. Self parking is $10, and prepare to walk your ass off to the hotel lobby. Staff was slow and had that ""I don't care"" attitude seeping from their pores. And the elevators sometimes go to your floor, sometimes they don't. That sure is a shitty game to play when you're holding all your luggage. The hotel attached to this place is a joke. A complete joke. But that's a review in itself. Anyways, the moral of this review is to look elsewhere. There are other options within a stones throw and we messed up by coming here. Don't make the same mistake.I would give this place only one star, but if you are looking for a conveniently located place for a Rams game or a night at the casino, this works OK.  This is really it's only redeeming quality.  Other than that there are a lot of problems with this place.  Stains.  Stains everywhere.  The carpet everywhere is horrible.  The furniture has stains.  Sheets had stains.  Rooms are big, but the bathrooms are tiny.  Good luck finding a place to plug in your laptop or cell phone.  Every receptacle is behind furniture.  Closet door was completely broken.  Service is not friendly or helpful.  Wifi is free, but pretty weak.  Overall, I would avoid this place in the future, unless you really wanted to stay close to the Edward Jones dome, or if you hate walking outside to get to the casino.  So much potential to be a cool place, but they really miss the mark.As a road warrior I can tell you this hotel is not as bad as some people have said. Yes it needs updating and yes the carpet is dirty. But - I have seen MUCH worse. The staff was fine and I had no issues. The casino reminded me of any I have been in outside of Vegas - yes some are nicer but this was typical. Go visit any Tribal owned casino and it is right there as far as options and atmosphere. I will likely be back when business keeps me downtown - otherwise I stay in the burbs.I stayed at Lumiere for a bachelorette party last weekend.  We all had a fantastic time.The beds were comfortable, the place was clean, and I had a good view of downtown from the 6th floor.  Wins three stars for these attributes.  Wins a star for ""wow effect.""  That fountain and the glass elevator up... I'm not saying it's the most aesthetically pleasing I've stayed in my life, but it sure is something to admire. The only reason Lumiere Hotel doesn't get five stars is because there was only one tiny trashcan in the room.  With all the drinking happening at Laclede's Landing (in addition to regular trash use), there should be one trashcan in the bathroom, one in the bedroom, and one in the living room area.We were going to walk over to the casino but ran out of time/energy.  I wouldn't mind staying at Lumiere again and rectifying that.Perfectly fine, but from all the hype I expected something a bit nicer. Very nice lobby area. Comfortable bed and suite. No overhead lighting in the bathroom which made for a dim showering experience. Overall we were not terribly impressed.","This hotel was a big let down for me. The first room we received, the door did not close all the way to the bathroom. We requested two beds but only received one. The let out bed had stains on the sheets, very disgusting. The carpet is stained and very dirty. The second room we received, the heat didn't work and the bathroom sink stayed clogged. I suggest that they undergo random inspections. For this to be such a beautiful hotel the upkeep is terrible.If you're ok with Motel 6 at 4 star prices... By all means you'll be ok with this place.  It's old, dingy, not at all what I was expecting for being associated with the Lumiere Casino.  After already paying for our room, I did not care and was ready to leave after being here for an hour.  The pool was dirty, staff was rude.  Yuck.In all fairness.. Room was spacious, and we did get a nice view out onto the lake...  But any hotel I won't let let my kid walk around barefooted...  Well you get the point.I stay in Hotels in excess of 150 nights/year and I feel I'm a fair judge of what makes a hotel exceptional. I can honestly say that this hotel is in the bottom 1% of hotels I've ever stayed in at any price. The fact that we paid $230/night simply adds insult to injury.  The first room we received smelled strongly of smoke, so we requested another room. It smelled better, simply of cleaning products, but the stains on the carpet were pretty discouraging.We tried to relax in the hot tub, but it's cold water was no relief. Also it was difficult to relax with the 27 children playing in the nearby pool. Literally 27 children with no adult supervision. This hotel has an exceptional location with a sky bridge to the nicest casino in STL and a very short walk to the bars and restaurants of the landing. Overall it's a hotel that has enormous potential but was a serious letdown, especially for the price.I'd highly recommend you try any of the other nearby hotels to experience Saint Louis.The most beautiful hotel to be blacklisted...I stayed here for a conference and the hotel lobby and atrium is recently renovated and quite pretty. The hotel food was good. The casino is similar to other mid-priced casinos. When I was looking, gaming tables had $10 minimums. The hotel is attached to the casino and Four Seasons hotel through an indoor walkway.This used to be an Embassy Suites hotel. It is obvious in the layout and the suites still show the same layout and furnishings. The bathroom was very small and poorly lit with only 2 spot lots over the sink and no lighting in the rest of the room. Water pressure and hot water was plentiful.The bed was awful-a broken mattress. My back was aching so badly I slept on the couch. The couch was firm and reasonably comfortable if you can fit on it (I did not open it to a sofa bed). However, I expect a comfortable bed... not an unreasonable request for a hotel. Also, there are no available nor accessible electrical outlets near either desk or bedside. This makes it very hard to work or charge items.The HVAC system was also not operating properly. The thermostat was off by 6-8 degrees and the systems did not change over from AC to heat, despite it being reported to the hotel upon checking into the room. Finally, the Asia restaurant over in the attached casino had decent food, but horrific service with the server ignoring my table of 2 after seating us. The table was dirty and 1/3 of the items were never served.Upon checkout, the hotel tried to overcharge me in excess of my contracted rate. The managers were pleasant enough and wanted to try to help. Once the hotel undergoes a full renovation, I might consider returning; but not until then. Overall, I was VERY disappointed.Worst hotel ever!My husband and I and my parents booked this hotel with suggestions from friends who frequent this hotel once a year for cardinals games. These friends stayed at the hotel this weekend as long as us so that's 4 rooms for 2 nights at $200 a pop not counting tax and fees. All I can say is I can't believe this place cost me over $200 two nights. For starters the HVAC units are garbage in this place. Our first room we walked into was pretty warm so we adjusted the temperature dropped our bags and went for a late lunch. We returned two hours later to the same temp 77. We called the front desk and they had matience bring a tester up to the room to tell us the temp out of the vent was 57 degrees. Well my husband being patient (I'm not) told me to wait it out it will be fine. Within 40 min the desk called to check on the situation, I let them know it had not gotten any better so they asked if we wanted to move rooms. I said yes even though I would have rather stayed on the same floor as our friends and family. So we moved from the second floor to the 8th floor. My husband once again adjusted the temp down to 50 and we all left for dinner. We came back to our room this time about 3 hours later to exact same 77 degrees in the new room. Can you believe this!  So I moved to the couch in my parents room while the desk brought a box fan for my $200 a night room since it wouldn't cool yay me! My parents room was a cool 68. Our other two set of friends rooms were just like our last two rooms 77. So one room out of 5 a decent temp. The next day while leaving for the cardinals game we ran into a family coming into the lobby with two box fans in hand from A STORE! The hotel ran out of fans so they had to buy there OWN THEY WERE SO HOT IN THERE ROOM! Rediculous! This was not the only issue!1. Awful HVAC terribly warm2. Stained carpet terrible in halls and rooms and elevator3. Elevator hardly worked (staff said that was typical)4. Air vents in rooms caked with dust 5. Tile in bathroom was stained and didn't look even moped. 6. Caulk around shower molded and black7. Lobby chairs ripped and leather flaking off. 8. Staff agrees hotel has went down hill in the last couple years. 9. Smelled of stale smoke everywhereIt's my understanding that hotel Lumiere was bought out by embassy suites. Our friends that have frequented this hotel for years and recommended this hotel were embarrassed to tell us to stay there. They said they were mortified how bad it's gotten run down so fast. This hotel needs to get there stuff taken care of and clean and seriously change so many things or they will be closed. When walking out we heard multiple guests complaining at the front desk right along with us. When walking through the casino to our car we actually heard a couple say I can't wait to get out of this hotel from hell. Bottom line people this place is maybe worth $59.00 a night. Don't let there website make you think your staying at the tall hotel and gorgeous Four Seasons. There website completely made me think we were headed to to wrong hotel from the pictures because 90% of the pictures showed THE FOUR SEASONS. Don't give your money to this establishment the only thing this place has going for them is there location. Very disappointed!This place is WAY past its prime. Hallways are a mess with spots &amp; blotches and in passageway between Hotel &amp; Casino, rather smelly. Speaking of the passageway, it is a real ordeal to snake through the corridor, figure out the access/egress codes, walk down staircase, walk up staircase (unless you locate the SLOW Elevator) to finally get to the Casino but WAIT, you are NOT even close to the entrance which is a LONG way down the corridor to your left.Now about the ""Suite"" we paid through the nose for - it was SMALL and the entry door was pathetic plus you had NO access to the fridge (door must have been welded shut).The Bathroom was so small barely one person could fit in and even then you could barely turn around in it when door closed. Now, WHEN was the last time you stayed in a Hotel (Suite no less) where the bathroom had NO vent??If you look across the street, you will see a 4 Seasons. I HIGHLY  recommend you consider staying there.Extremely Disappointed. We arrived around 11PM. The Front Desk staff was rude.She did not greet us, and I had to ask her if we could check in, which she did after chatting with another employee a little while longer about non work related nonsense. She gave us the wrong room. First our key cards didnt work.  Even though I had reserved and specified a suite with 2 Queens and a pull out bed, she gave us a king bed room. When I requested another room, she gave us a room that I don't think was cleaned. The room smelled like mold and acetone....weird..The towels had stains on them...gross. The fabric on the sofa and carpets was very dirty, with red and brown stains all over. I don't know what happened in that room but it grossed us out. It was so gross that we were going to go to another hotel, but by the time we got that room, it was midnight and we had been driving all day. Overall, extremely disappointed and disgusted. The casino that this was attached to was terrible. We walked in and right back out. I would never return here.I'm giving 5 stars soley for the fact that their beds are AMAZING!!! the service is always great.the rooms are spacious, bathroom is small though. nothing fancy, but always clean.reasonably pricedskywalk to casino!Able to walk to the landing and other STL attractions.I've stayed here multiple times and have never been dissatisfied!The atmosphere of the hotel is very nice. The glass elevators and large lobby are beautiful. The room looked nice when we came in and the beds were comfy. However, this hotel gets a 2/5 for horrible customer service.When we got to the room we realized we had zero garbage cans. I called down and they brought us 2 dinky little tiny garbage cans. There were 6 girls staying in the room so obviously we needed a lot more than that. Then I go into the bathroom and the sink doesn't work. The cold water handle turned all the way around, 360, and the water would not turn off. That night we went to the bars then went back to the casino. My friend and I got in, but when our guy friends tried to get in the one security guard said he had kicked one of them out earlier that day. This never happened. I got the manager to come over and he said my boyfriend's eyes were glossy and they couldn't get in. If anyone out of us was too drunk it was me and my friend who they allowed in. My boyfriend and his friend were perfectly fine, but they could not get in. Fine. So i went to the front desk and complained to the staff there. They were absolutely no help. It was like talking to a brick wall. They told me all they could do was fix the sink and bring me more garbage cans. So this was around 3 am. I was beyond frustrated at this point so I just gave up and went to my room. Then a man came in, mind you this was 3 am, he couldn't wait till the morning? He comes in and walks to the safe. We say what are you doing? He says oh I thought the safe was broke, if it's the sink I'll have to go get my tools and come back. He never came back. We also never got any more garbage cans brought to us. The sheets also had stains on them.Although the hotel was nice and the food was great, the customer service and the staff were horrible and none of our room problems were ever fixed. This hotel left me infuriated and I would not stay there again.This is an old hotel that has been refurbished. It has a nice look, but doesn't appear to be sold out that often. Because of that it seemed they were keeping everyone on the bottom four floors which was disappointing since it would have been cool to have a decent view of the St. Louis Arch or the Mississippi River. *The rooms were very comfortable suites with two TV's, comfortable beds, and a mini fridge that was well stocked. The Moet was reasonably priced as well! That being said, it was so well stocked that the leftovers from Asia, the casino's Asian fusion restaurant, didn't fit. ****The bathrooms were dimly lit, and cramped. It served it's purpose, but made getting ready in the morning a bit difficult. ***Nasty. Rooms, hallways, and elevators are all stained and dirty.   Hotel staff is rude and condescending.  When we complained about the room, they stated no refund once your card was swiped to your room!  Would only give us a different room that was also stained. Spend the extra $10 and stay somewhere nice.Do NOT stay at this dump. This place smelled, water wouldn't drain well in sink and shower, and the carpets throughout the hotel were the most disgusting that we have ever seen.. We paid $200 a night and it is really an $60 a night hotel. I will definitely stay somewhere else next time.We stayed here for two nights complimentary and. Also had some friends from NYC In town. The atmosphere wasn't great. The room was not what I expected. Carpet was dirty. One elevator was out of service and the second elevator was really slow. Since we got complimentary nights it was alright but I wouldn't pay what they charge per night nor probably stay here again.Great location and for the price we paid (through Hotwire) it was great.  We stayed through Christmas, so being attached to a Casino was awesome since nearly everything else was closed.  The room was nice and large, we were loving having multiple rooms.It is an older hotel, but everything was clean and functioning.  The staff was super friendly, even loaning us a deck of cards to play in the lobby bar area before we headed out for the night.  It's great that you can access the Casino and people movers to head into downtown (utilize them, we made the mistake the first night of dodging that crazy intersection).Had fun at the Casino &amp; even won a free buffet breakfast in the morning.We never get housekeeping, unless we are staying for a week or more, so I can't say how well they tidy up daily.  I would not have wanted to pay $200 for this room (I think we got it for around $60) - but I'm guessing it's mostly business/convention people that stay here anyway.Oh, don't forget your keycard to use in the elevator.  That made for interesting times.I spent the weekend at Lumiere Hotel as part of a group of 6 who stayed for 2 nights for free in exchange for social media coverage of everything we did. I can't speak for everyone, but the general consensus was that the hotel was not up to the standards we are used to. I wouldn't recommend the hotel unless you are looking for budget and really want to be attached to the casino/downtown. Pros:- suites - I never get a suite, so the extra space was great. The room has a sitting area with a couch (pull-out), easy chair, TV, table/desk with two chairs and a bar w/fridge. The bedroom itself was a good size with a desk, plenty of space for two suitcases and to move around. - shower - while the bathroom was fine (small but workable), the shower had good water pressure and felt spacious due to a curved shower curtain bar- Atrium style sitting area - I actually like the open railings that overlook the sitting area on the 1st floor. If you've ever been in an Embassy Suites, you'll recognize the layout (this hotel was formerly an ES). - location - if you are looking for a hotel that is attached to a casino or is in the heart of downtown, this could work for you. There is a walkway to the casino so you don't have to step outside to get to the casino, which was appreciated since it was in the high 90s the weekend we were there. You could easily walk to Washington Avenue restaurants/nightlife, Laclede's Landing, Arch, Metro train stations and around downtown.- parking - there are 2 large parking lots for hotel guests plus valet parking. I parked myself. No complaints here. Cons:Where do I start?- old - the hotel simply felt old and worn. Each time you came back from the casino, it strikes you that the hotel feels shabby in comparison. It really hit me when I came back from a spa treatment in the adjacent Four Seasons hotel. - beds - I thought the beds were much too soft, as did my roommate. Some of the other women in our group seemed to like them, so I guess this is just personal preference. I'm also not a fan of feather pillows, though I did get 3 of them for my double bed, I still would have rather had my smashed down pillow at home. - HVAC - The first half of the weekend something must have been broken. The humidity inside the hotel lobby, atrium and halls felt like you were inside an indoor swimming pool. I started sweating the minute I stepped out of our room. They did get it fixed, but it still felt a little muggy inside the hotel. Our room was comfortable, but the 2nd room in our party was too hot and the 3rd room was too cold. - Service - I didn't experience this myself, but one of the room's in our group was a Director's Suite...a HUGE suite with 2 sitting areas plus a large conference/dining table. They had repeated problems from a moldy bathroom, no linens or pillows for the pull out couch and delays in getting things like linens &amp; TP when they called for service. - atrium seating - I took my computer down to the atrium area to sit and work for a bit, and was really disappointed to discover that the tables were too high for the chairs. You sank into the chairs like you were on a couch, but the tables were the height of a dining table. I ended up working at the bar for a few minutes, then quickly decided to go back to my room. - limited wifi - I was really surprised to find out the only place in the hotel with complimentary wifi was in the business center. I really expect to be able to get on the internet for free in my room, but at a minimum I should be able to sit in a lobby or bar area and get on wifi. Not here. - outlets - in today's era, lots of things need to recharge. In a suite, I would expect at least 2 people to have cell phones, laptops and maybe even more things that need to plug in. The only easy access were one each in the bathroom, bar and by the TV. I had to pull the couch out from the wall to sit on the couch and internet surf while plugged in. They could easily fix this by installing a power strip on the desk in the bedroom. - swimming pool - the swimming pool is through a glass wall directly off the atrium area, so I think you would feel like you were on display. It is an indoor pool and is in a fairly small room with no decor. It reminded me of a pool in a fitness center. We decided to pass on swimming even though it was in the high 90s. Just wasn't appealing. - room service breakfast - we ordered room service for our last morning by hanging the order on the door Sat night, and the service was right on time. But, the food was pretty bland. I ordered an English Muffin and hash browns, and the bread was overly crispy but without the little brown edges I expect on something toasted and the potatoes were clearly cooked without any seasoning. Blah. Bottom line...if you will trade amenities and a newer feel for price, then this hotel might just work for you if you can get a good deal. But go with appropriate expectations, or you'll be really disappointed.I'd give this place 5 stars if they updated the carpet in the common areas and somehow got the police to get a handle on the locals that hang out riverfront. The hotel has a huge manned police tower in the parking lot, which tells me they have probably had a lot of trouble with the low life locals that hang down on the riverbank all hours of the night. Went out to my car last night and heard the officer in the tower moving people along, so I was comforted that they are paying attention. I loved the hotel, the towels were the softest I have ever had in a hotel. The bed is super comfy. The walk from the ballpark was quick and nice. The sitting room was awesome to have. The bathrooms are small and poorly lit, but it didn't bother me. I haven't checked out yet, and only just a few minutes ago, we opened the fridge for the first time and saw that there is an empty space in their, I am a little nervous that they may try to charge me for a missing beverage that I didn't consume. So far, the staff has been super nice and helpful. I wish they had something to offer, continental breakfast or something in the hotel, but just like in Vegas, everything is in the casino... Just that this casino isn't on the ground floor, it's across the parking lot. But even a drink vending machine on each floor would have helped. I found my 8th floor, arch view suite to be clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. My father-in-law had a 1st floor room and loved it too!While I stayed at Hotel Lumiere there was a  lot of construction because of remodeling.  It's great that they are updating their lobby, but I was there to surprise my sister with a bachelorette party so the lobby was underwhelming to welcome her.  The rooms are very nice-the beds were super comfortable.  They do need to update their carpeting in the hallways-it has definitely aged.We checked into our room to find it had not been cleaned from the guests before. We called to ask for a new room or have ours cleaned and never heard back from the front desk. It's an okay place to stay if you don't want to drive after a long night of drinking and gambling, but I would not suggest booking it for a special occasion.I didn't pay a dime because I was there on business, so I can't really comment on the value for the money...but there are plenty of other things to comment on.Pros:Convenience...it's walking distance to all the stadiums and the Arch as well as a number of restaurants and of course the attached Casino.Customer Service...surprisingly good, I was always treated very well and found the staff to be quite friendly. Room size and furnishings are both quite decent with two 40"" flat screen TVs (one in the bedroom and one in the sitting area).The bed was pretty comfortable.Cons:Elevators are the worst I've ever encountered in a hotel.  They are slower than death, require key cards to go to all floors except the LL, L and Casino level and I even got stuck in one of them at one point.Because of the bad elevators, I took the stairs...which smell like urine, have a plunger on every floor and do not require a key card...which makes you wonder why you need them for the elevator.Even though the TVs are high quality LG flat screens, they have a terrible cable system with Standard Definition (which made the football games on Sunday unwatchable) and HBO is the only premium channel.The Key Cards were pathetic.  It took at least 3 tries every time you used your key card.The Gym had only one weight machine.Just walking through the Casino makes your clothing smell like an Ash Tray.The internet connection was the worst I've had in years, it was disconnected far more often than it was connected.  The decor is clearly dated and in desperate need of upgrading.I give it three stars because it could be worse, but I'm hesitant to give it 3 instead of 2.Nice room, friendly staff. Maybe if you weren't such a stressed out monster when you were checking in, you would've gotten the upgrade instead of the Illinois view. Every room is pretty nice though.","This is a great value and a very nice Hotel. The staff was very nice cooperative and so very helpful.  The room were very nice older but nice, the lobby was beautiful.  I will plan to stay again when I come through STL.  Only issue, we asked for dinner locations and the front desk suggested the casino restaurants, nice but more costly.  The next day I noticed  down the street there was the Laclede's Landing which had some very cool restaurants, pubs and gift shops.  I would have preferred to go there.This hotel was not worth $200 a night.  I would put it in the $125-$150 range.  Cons: -Our concierge did not know of anything at all to do in downtown St. Louis.  We asked her what there is to do in the area, and she told us to go see the Arch...  However, on the whole the staff was very courteous.-Our shower did not work properly and it filled up with water.  We could not control the temperature of the water, nor shut the water off.  Spinning the water spigot reminded me of spinning the helm on a boat.  It had no beginning and no end.  -The toilet broke during the middle of the night.-The fridge did not work.Pros:-The pool was clean.-The fitness center was above average.The casino and 2d street were pretty un-classy.i stayed here before the remodeling and new name and enjoyed it in 2006.  last year i came back and it had a new name and a million dollar indoor waterfall that comes down several stories of the hotel.  it has an indoor glass walkway that leads next door to the casino which is neat because it keeps it separate if gambling is not your thing.  the staff is very friendly and for the price, you get a clean little suite with new amenities.  the beds and sheets are nice which i always judge a hotel on.",,,"['three', 'couples', 'gave', 'rooms', 'next', 'rooms', 'huge',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-inn-and-suites-saint-louis-2,Drury Inn & Suites,4.0,$$,43,"Stayed there 1/27/16 through 1/28/15. The front desk employees were superb and cordial. Could not have asked for more better staff. We also ran into a maintenance man by the pool and he was very polite and asked how our evening was and if there was anything we needed. The rooms on the 5th and 6th floors have an inner and outer ring setup. We were on the inner ring which made access to the pool and breakfast area very convenient(the inner ring has two entrance/exits into the room). We called to the front desk and she transferred us to the in house restaurant, Sanfilipo's. The service was great, the burger was great and the young woman that delivered our food was very kind. It's amazing how rare and uncommon kindness is in current times, but at this hotel they exceeded expectations.The rooms were very clean and the bed was comfortable. The walls seemed a bit thin but that is nothing to complain about. I recommend this hotel as well as the restaurant. Thank you to the staff!Five stars to the on-site hotel staff! They are simply wonderful and hard-working. Gail and Michael were on different night shifts but equally as amazing! They made sure that our arrival and entry went smoothly. When a mix-up happened with some of our rooms, Gail quickly worked to make things right and was so pleasant in the process. Michael helped me make sure late arriving staff felt well-received after their long travel day. Both are the definition of HOSPITALITY and not just a well-managed hotel. Even the man who brought the rubbish bin to my room was extremely polite!The off-site phone service is not so polite, however, so don't let them turn you away or leave a bad taste in your mouth. They are definitely NOT a good reflection of the on-site hospitality and care.Best hot food and drinks free!! We stayed here for girls weekend and loved the convenience of everything. Hot food at 5:30 to 7. Good drinks, and they were strong too!My friends and I stayed here for two days in mid-May.  I had never stayed at a Drury Inn before.  We arrived around 7:30 in the evening and the woman at the front desk was polite and efficient.  We were able to park next door for free in a parking garage.  I thought that was a fantastic deal to have free parking in a downtown of a major city.  Hotel is next to the home of the St. Louis Rams, a block from a casino, and two blocks from the Landing which has some bars and restaurants.Our room had two queen beds, free wifi, fridge, microwave and two doors-including one into an atrium where the pool, whirlpool, and food area was.  Breakfast was good.  Both days was eggs, potatoes, sausage, biscuits/gravy.  All were on the better side for a free breakfast.  During the evening they have a manager reception which seems nice but I didn't attend.  I did speak with the manager on duty both days who was very friendly.  Room was very clean and a fair size.  We paid 300 + tax for two nights.  Hotel was a 10 minute walk to Busch Stadium. Home of the Cardinals.  The area felt safe to me at all times.I was very impressed with everything about this hotel.  I highly recommend staying here.  Everyone is friendly, everything was clean, and a great value.  Hotel won't /shouldn't be compared with the Ritz but I highly recommend!The hotel was very nice but there were so many things about it that was strange. There was only one set of elevators and no stairs?? Our room had a window to the hall..and when we were trying to go to sleep the light from the hall came in from around the curtain and pretty much lit up the whole room. There were a lot of good things though. They have hot foods and mixed drinks at 5:30 which was nice. I didn't try anything because we had just eaten but it looked good. The breakfast was pretty average. It's really convenient if you're going to the Edward Jones Dome, which we were.A friend invited me to stay with them, they were running the Rock and Roll half marathon. The price was right for the size of the room $110 for a one night stay in downtown St Louis that is within walking distance of so many places to eat and play. The beds were comfy, pillows fluffy and the sheets clean and bug free. The shower head was like standing in the rain, wonderful shower head and for those that forget their shampoo, conditioner or body wash a dispenser was mounted in the shower stall. We did not get to try the complimentary breakfast because we needed to leave before it was served.This hotel has been great from the start. Complimentary wi-if, free services in the business center, and helpful staff everywhere. I certainly would recommend this hotel. I stayed for an ABA conference and after talking amenities with my colleagues, found that not many of the other hotels they stayed in offered breakfast. Ours did!Local.... Decided last minute to stay here on the way home from a long day on the river.Service was EXCELLENT.  The woman that checked us in was super nice and filled us in on all the info as far as where all the amenities are etc.The parking garage is key card access only, and there where plenty of spaces available.  Entrance into the hotel from the garage is key card (at all hours), along with the elevator up to the floors also requires your card.  ""After hours"" access is also key card only into the front lobby, plus they have security in the lobby.   I am not overly cautious about security, but thought it would be good to note all of the features for anyone worried about staying here downtown.The room was nice and roomy, bed was comfortable.  Bathroom was large, shower was small, but adequate... Maybe could benefit from a curved shower rod to make the shower seem a little roomier.  The room was immaculate.Breakfast was really decent as far as free breakfast goes.  Scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage and biscuits and gravy... Make your own waffles etc. along with your typical ""continental"" breakfast items.  I was pleased with the eggs, selection of fruit etc since I don't eat refined carbohydrates.  Breakfast atrium is In The middle of the 5th floor along with the indoor pool.  Hotel rooms are all around the perimeter.  I would think the 5th floor rooms might have the potential to be somewhat noisy for this reason, we stayed on the 6th floor... So I could not really say for sure.  I would probably request a 6th floor room though (6th floor is all non-smoking FYI).All staff was above and beyond nice.  A woman in management stopped to take our plates from out table at breakfast and asked about our stay.  Another gentleman who was cleaning tables also asked us about our stay etc.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming in from out of town, or any locals who just want a night out in the town or who are catching a Cards game and just don't want to make the drive home.   If I could give it 10 stars, I would.We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Very pleased with the room and the delicious breakfast offered for free. The staff as kind and went out of their way to accommodate our needs. The front desk changed our room from 2 queen beds to 1 king with no hesitation. A gentleman named Segar was very kind and helpful and demonstrated customer service as it should be. Would definitely stay there again!!I've never even heard of Drury Inns, much less stayed at one, but after my first experience here, I'm wishing they would expand beyond Arizona and into California.  This is not a big corporate resort-type facility but is family-owned and I felt like a member of the family, thanks to the staff.  There was free Wi-Fi (are you listening, all you big hotels?), a great complimentary breakfast, and free drinks/hot foods in the evening.  There's even a popcorn machine!  Everyone on the staff that we interacted with, from the front desk to the food service staff to housekeeping, was warm, friendly, and easy to talk with.  I will be checking into the availability of Drury Inns for all my future road trips!Within a spitting distance from the Arch and the Illinois border, this place lives up to the Drury name. Friendly staff, comfortable beds, a computer lab and printing, a Happy Hour with light dinner, and parking garage. Plus the usual like a TV, fridge, microwave, and iron and ironing board. Plenty to do nearby. This is a great location.I stayed here 06/06/14.  My 2 room suite was decent.  The living room had one exterior window, a couch, chair, ottoman, desk, and a TV which sat upon a unit that housed the fridge and microwave. The bedroom also had a TV but no window.  I wasn't wowed by the decor, but everything was clean and comfy.Many of the other rooms are inward facing.  They have ""balconies"" with a small table and chairs overlooking the ""atrium"".  The ""atrium"" is a giant room w/the pool, fitness center, and food area.  It seemed quiet during my stay, but I suspect that during weekends and holidays these rooms could be loud and lack the feeling of privacy.  To avoid this I would request a room with an exterior window.Free parking was a big plus.  I hate to pay for valet only to wait for my car when I want to go explore a new city.  You use your room key to open the garage door.  When you first arrive, you will need to park at the front door to check in and get your key.  The location is convenient.  I walked to the arch and old courthouse.  Busch Stadium is also walkable.  I felt safe walking around alone during the day.Free food and drink is a big plus.  Breakfast was pretty typical, but I had never seen a hotel with free dinner.  Options the night I stayed were: Hot dogs, mac'n cheese, chicken strips, baked potato, salad, ruffled chips, and nachos w/optional chili and cheese.  Adults get 3 free alcoholic beverages.  There were plenty of open tables there, but I chose to take my plate back to the room.I'm pretty content with my stay.  If you are debating staying here, I'd say go for it.It's rated as a 3 star hotel but definitely better than Hilton that we stayed in last night. The TV is bigger and free continental breakfast and between 5pm-7pm hot foods and alcohol drinks. It seems cleaner and nicer bathroom. I want to stay in this hotel every time when I come to St. Louis or another Drury Inn.Stayed here when I attended the Saints/ Rams game this past weekend.VALUE: Saturday night was a bit pricey, but when you throw in free parking, three free drinks at happy hour, free breakfast and happy hour snacks...it works out.PARKING: Easy garage parking that is FREE. Garage is connected to the hotel so you can go from your car right into the hotel without stepping a foot outside.HAPPY HOUR: From about 5:30 to 7:00, you get free food and three free drinks. When I was there, they were serving up some pretty good baked potatoes, Mac n cheese, hot dogs, and chili. Drink selections included some wine, beer, and mixed drinks. Not too bad!BREAKFAST: Served up until 10:00. Bagels, fruit, muffins, scrambled eggs, tator tots, biscuits and gravy.... decent and free!WHAT ELSE IS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE?: The Arch, The Landing (bar/restaurant district), casinos, parks, the Mississippi, and the Edwards Dome is literally across the street. There are many other hotels nearby too and I am pretty sure that the train stop is right there too.STAFF: Friendly and funnyROOMS: Very clean, pretty quiet, comfortable beds. Shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner were all available in those shower wall dispenser gadgets. No shortage of towels. FINAL VERDICT: I would probably return but would also be open to trying other hotels in the vicinity (for no particular reason).We had a Thanksgiving family reunion and chose Drury Inn because it is centrally located and there are good things to do in St Louis. We stayed 3 days and could not have gone away any happier with our stay. The rooms are comfortable though not luxurious. They are clean and in good repair. The hotel is well appointed with many televisions and lounge areas, meeting rooms available. Parking is attached and included. Breakfast is good. The big surprise is the ""kickback"" snack which amounts to a free meal and was very welcomed by our large family. Also the staff was extremely friendly and became very familiar to us. I would go back in a minute.The Drury Inn Convention Center is a decenet hotel in a weird area. The hotel itself is excellent, but the area isFREE PARKINGFREE BREAKFASTFREE DRINKS (3 alcholic/non-alcholic drinks!!!)FREE ""KICKBACK"" (snacks before dinner) but this was more like an actual dinner! While we were there, they had pasta with meatballs, nachos, hotdogs, etc! Plus, our room had 2 doors. One door lead right out to the dining area and pool area! Super awesome, super convenient. The only thing that sucked about our stay was the parking garage was a bit scary to go in and out of...the door closes automatically super fast! I was afraid it would crush us each time we go in and out. Also...the satellite tv sucked. The Giants &amp; Cardinal game kept going in and out! Other than that, everything else made up for it. The hotel is close to the freeway exit and right in the middle of downtown. Arch is not too far away. I would def come back to stay here if I'm ever in the area.Warning: this review contains a RAPTURE reference related to a recent divine action non accompli.  If you're just plain tired of such references to a word that doesn't appear in the Bible, then read no further. But if you know there's something wrong with the world, and that ""something wrong"" makes you crave justice, read on.We stayed here on a Saturday, and enjoyed almost everything. It's easy to pull up to the curb, and check in was a breeze. Then we drove fifty feet further, turned right, and drove into the garage. Guests park mainly on the fourth level, and use the elevator just inside the secured door. Every exterior door and elevator requires a room key after a certain hour.Once inside, we found our room was standard-sized, not bad, but noticed things like a carpet stain by the desk, some red wax-like spatter on a wall near the floor lamp, and dried coffee on the ironing board leg. We were on the sixth floor, with access to the exterior hallway and the interior balcony that rings the pool, fitness, laundry, and eating areas. This area forms an atrium, with plenty of natural light from above. In the eating area, there were fountain drinks and popcorn, and morning breakfast and evening happy hour are found here. We partook only of the popcorn and soda, having meal reservations at a couple restaurants.In retrospect, perhaps the punch card each guest receives for three drinks should have been a sign of trouble. One free drink -- nice. Two -- generous. But unless you're injured, disabled, or a parent of rug rats, who needs THREE drinks, when in an urban setting surrounded by great bars and restaurants? I'll tell you who: wannabe Frat Boys, who like to gather in the hallways ... and spar w/ one another ... and chase one another at a clomping gallop ... at 2:00 AM ... at 3:00 AM ... as late as 4:00 AM. Long ago, during the era of  ""Animal House,"" I lived in a large dorm, and don't believe anyone was quite that loudly wasted in the hallway by 4:00 AM. When there was partying, we got it out of the way earlier -- we had plenty of things to do the next day, like watch a real football team.  You're thinking that I could have called the front desk, and I suppose you've got a point. But, look, I monitor college students all summer, and this was supposed to be a break.  If I hear someone hurt or dying, I'll do something. Otherwise, I'm just putting in the ear plugs to muffle the commotion a bit.Drury, perhaps you're not technically responsible for every action of your guests. Each day your population is transformed by departures and arrivals.  When there's not a convention, and the Rams/Cards/Blues aren't in town, maybe you really need youngish, young adults to support your revenue stream. Perhaps they were especially excited, celebrating the Rapture's delay. But whether or not Jesus is coming again, these jackasses may be making an unexpected trip to meet him soon. Next time, if there is a next time, I hope that the light at the end of the tunnel is an officer's 20-inch maglite, and that the wicked are tossed out an alley door.The Drury family of hotels I feel is overlooked by a lot of folks.  I am hoping they do some more expansion to reach other cities.  Because I recently (due to a long road trip) had the pleasure of staying at a Drury Inn on more than one occasion.  And we had great experiences.  I had been to a few Drury Inns in my day ; usually because a relative was visiting, &amp; we went to their hotel.  I know I have stayed in a few Drury Inns as well.  But this year, apparently was my year to truly check them out.The hotels are not ""fancy"" ; at least the ones I have been to thus far.  But I definitely can say that the Drury Inn in Saint Louis (this is only ONE of the lcoations) is definitely a good value.Some PROS:* free parking* free drink tickets + snacks for an evening happy hour* free popcorn &amp; fountain soda available* free breakfast* in walking distance to stuff downtown -- AND very close to the downtown location of my fave STL Pizza joint- Pi PizzeriaThere IS a pool.  However, I never did get to use it because it was monopolized by children the entire time we were there.  But that happens at a lot of places (especially when we stay at the more affordable hotels).  I* The STAFF was super nice* Clean, large room (at least the one we were in)* close to public transportation (as well as the Amtrak station)I would definitely go back &amp; stay at this same hotel.  It pretty much met all of the criteria I have for the price.We came out from Massachusetts this summer for a trip. We was treated great from the time we arrived to the time we left . The rooms where very clean and at a great value. The help at the front desk was amazing .","This place is great! It is just blocks away from many landmarks. We are in St.Louis for the 2014 Midwest haunt convention and  the service was some of the best I have ever revived! All the employees make you their first priority and assisted in helping us anyway possible. With all this hospitality we will be sure to say here again when back in St. Louis.Perfect budget hotel if you need to be close to the convention center.The freebies include: Wifi, parking, Adult drink tickets + snacks for an evening happy hour, popcorn &amp; fountain soda  and a nice  breakfast!The pool is indoors and also has a (small) hot tub. They are currently renovating, but the noise was only during the day.Pros:Parking is greatWiFi is free and it is reliable and super fastGood location downtown although we spent most of our time up by Forest ParkFriendly staffFree breakfast, free soft drinks, free popcorn, free ""kickback hour"" snacks and alcoholic drinks, although lack of variety and a lack of quality.Reasonable priceCons:Pool is smallBeds are not very comfortableNo variety with the food choicesTowels were not softSoap, shampoo and conditioner were very low grade (bring your own)We stayed at the Drury Inn &amp; Suites near the football stadium while in town for Mardi Gras.  The rooms were clean and nice.  Parking was abundant and free.  The evening free drinks and appetizers were great.  The morning hot breakfast was fantastic.  They are only 2 blocks from the metro stop so public transportation is a breeze.  We'll be back.First and foremost, if you are looking for an upscale hotel, this location isn't for you.  While nice and comfortable, it isn't really high end or modern...The rooms are comfortable.  They are your standard hotel room.  Beds, mini fridge, microwave... One thing I did really like on my last visit is that they have started using dispensers for the shampoo/soap/conditioner rather than having individual bottles.  I don't use the hotel provided stuff anyways, so it seems like a great cost savings for the hotel themselves, as well as environmentally better.The staff has been excellent every time we have stayed here.  Each and every person I've encountered has been pleasant and sociable.The free breakfast is pretty standard to what other places offer.  It is free.. and for that price it works.  It has the waffle makers, donuts, bagels, eggs, etc.  The free drinks and evening appetizers are a nice bonus.  Its nice to have a glass of wine (or two or three) before heading out to dinner for the evening.  Again, the price really solidifies this being a perk.  Free parking... enough said... All in all, I enjoy staying here.  The location is fantastic, walking distance to plenty of things and also the subway around the corner.  An entrance to the casino is across the street and the landing is just a few blocks away as well.Wonderful rooms for a great price! The breakfast was good and the service was outstanding! Free wifi lets you wind down in your room while surfing the web with no charge to you! And you know your car is safe with the free parking garage attached to the building. Overall great hotel. Nightly recommended.As we got closer to our next destination - St. Louis, Missouri, we found a Drury Inn. We called and was able to make reservations quickly. The hotel is located in downtown St. Louis, almost directly across from the arch. Our room did not have a view to the arch, but it was OK. We just needed somewhere to crash for the night. The room was clean but they could've changed some of their paper menus and channel guides in the room.The rate was $130, $15 for parking and no pet fee. Free hot breakfast &amp; wifi.I expected an average stay but was overwhelmed with the hospitalities of Gail and Denise at the front desk. My paperwork and keys were ready even though  I checked in early . The rooms were clean and updated with free Wi-Fi ,secure parking and a great location to see Rams football games. This is a great value with free breakfast and evening hospitality. I look forward to my next stay.Hotel is nice. Beds are comfortable. Staff is super friendly and helpful. MY PROS:1) Free drink tickets during happy hour? Yes please!2) Free appetizers and snacks during happy hour? OK, twist my arm.3) Within walking distance to the arch and hip downtown restaurants? Sa-weet.MY CONS:1) Pool is way too small for the size of the hotel. First evening, we couldn't even get in because 20 kids under 10 were jam-packed in there like sardines.2) Breakfast food is gross. Wish there were some healthy options.Free Parking, Free Breakfast &amp; Dinner, Free T.V. and Free WIFI (That isn't slow!!)  I really enjoyed my stay here. The staff was efficient, nice and very helpful. The decor in the rooms could use some updating but other than that I was pleased.I had a great stay at this Drury Inn last week. I was in StL for a conference at the Renaissance (about 2 blocks away) and didn't want to pay the exorbitant rates for the conference hotel, so I happened upon the Drury.Two things set this Drury apart: value and people. The much-touted ""extras"" at Drury, especially the daily happy hour, made us the envy of the rest of the conference attendees who were paying $50/night more for their hotel rooms. Those poor folks were also paying $15/day for wi-fi, which was free and easy to use at Drury.But the real clincher here was the people. Every employee I encountered at the Drury was friendly and helpful. This kind of thing really makes a difference to me. Overall, I'd stay at this Drury again in a heartbeat.This is one of the nicest, most convenient hotels to stay at for such a reasonable price.  Everyone here was super friendly, and room was spotless.  We used an arch getaway promo code and received $20 voucher which we used at the arch for the journey to the top.  Free parking (just remember to park in front to check in before entering parking garage) free wifi, free fountain pop &amp; popcorn, free 1 hour of long distance, free kickback munchies which included delicious meatballs, pasta in marinara sauce, hotdogs, and nachos and cheese along with 3 alcoholic beverages a person.  Felt like Christmas in May!  Breakfast tasted much better than rival hotels!  Checkout was at 11 but they let us keep the car in the parking garage until we was done seeing the Arch which was super nice of them. I totally recommend Drury Inn and will always look for them where ever I stay!My wife and I stayed here for two nights on an impromptu Memorial Day Weekend trip to St. Louis.  We had a great time. The rate was affordable, our room was clean, the free dinner/drinks/breakfast were a great bonus, and the location at the convention center was convenient.First, I booked a room on Drury Hotels' website and used the eSaver rate. This is the best rate they offer--better even than the military and government employee rates. If you book with this rate, you have to pay in advance and it is non-refundable, but since we were booking a last-minute trip, this was not a problem for us. With the eSaver rate, we got a room for cheaper than we could have gotten at pretty much any other decent downtown hotel.  Second, our room, while basic, was fairly clean. There were some old, faded stains in the carpet, but the bathroom was clean, the sheets seemed freshly clean, and the room was neat and tidy.Third, the free dinner and drinks, and free breakfast, go so far above and beyond almost every other hotel I've stayed in that I've begun recommending Drury Inns to everyone I know traveling on a budget. The breakfast is basic but thorough--eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, some fruit, and a row of waffle makers, coffee, juice.  The dinner is basically ballpark food--always popcorn, and a rotation of chili, baked potatoes, hot dogs, tacos, hamburgers, etc. This might be underwhelming if you paid for it, but is pretty spectacular when you get an endless buffet of it for free.  The best part, however, is the free drinks.  Each guest gets a card redeemable for three free drinks per night.  And they're pretty good drinks, too.  They have some basic light beers, a few different bottles of cheap wine, and even a few mixed drinks--my wife enjoyed the margarita.  The portions aren't too bad, either--maybe a 10 oz. beer, 4 oz. glass of wine. Since we were traveling on a budget, the money we saved enjoying dinner and drinks at the hotel before we headed out for the evening allowed us to enjoy our weekend even more.I keep saying ""free"" and you might think: ""well sure it's 'free,' but you pay for it with the room rate."" My wife and I, however, stayed here for around $100 / night. In downtown St. Louis. On a holiday weekend. Booked about 2 days before our trip.  For everything we got, we were tickled at the rate.Overall, this Drury Inn is an incredible bargain right in the middle of St. Louis, a nice walk from the Arch and right across the road from the Rams' stadium.Great location! We stayed here on a cross country trip, so we only had a night to get the feel of St. Louis. This was a great spot to be in. You can walk right out to the arch and the baseball field. We were bummed that there wasn't a home game for us to go to.The room was clean and comfortable and the water pressure was good in the shower. You may want to avoid the 4th floor where we were because there are event rooms on that floor which made them a bit louder and more congested. Also, ask for a room that has a window to the outside and not a window to an inner hallway, and while you're asking try to avoid being too close to the elevators because they beep. This sounds a bit negative, but I would totally stay there again. These are a just a few little things that can be easily avoided when you check in. Happy hour food and three drinks were included which was nice, in addition to a great breakfast spread (considering it was all included)!** Very PET FRIENDLY! No fee to have a small dog in the room with us and nice, accessible, grassy areas around the hotel.The only downside was that it was pretty crowded and felt chaotic in the lobby. And the fee for parking was $15 without valet.After a long day, the beds at the Drury Downtown are ""the perfect amount.""  You know what I mean.  The hotel is steps away from the arch and a few blocks away from Busch Stadium.  If you are planning a romantic weekend, horse-drawn carriages line up outside across the street.  They have many free amenities such as WiFi, breakfast, and even drinks.  Their service was friendly, and I really liked the fountain and Lewis and Clark statues in the lobby.  As far as I can tell, if you ask for a king size bed, your room will be on the interior of the hotel away from the street noise.This place is like my ex. Pretty on the surface, but once you get to know her, you realize you never stick your ...stick... in crazy.The amenities sound great. Free breakfast and happy hour, free drinks, pop corn, phone calls..the works.The reality? It brings out the entire Ma and Paw family. Breakfast had a 10 minute line just for oily eggs and sausage, happy hour had a 10 minute line, just for oily nachos and hot dogs.The free drinks were from a gun...the same gun that can be used for soda at a bar. They were pumping out swill disguised as alcohol. One ""punch"" on the card was about 1/4 of a shot.The atrium is nice at first, till you realize two things: 1) You never see outside. 2) The noise is BEYOND annoying. Don't think about sleeping in past 8, it has the buzz of a busy Denny's. Don't think about going to bed before 10, it has an even louder shrill of kids playing in the pool. The sound bounces off the steel roof and all around the place.I am sure there's more, but my fingers hurt. Avoid if you can.Went to St. Louis to see a Rams game when they were playing my Seahawks. I wanted to stay in a hotel that was in walking distance to the Edward Jones Dome but also close enough to other things so my wife and I could do some touristy stuff after the game. This place is directly across the street from the dome and a 10 minute walk from the Arch and so just because of its location I went for it. Little did I know I was getting a lot more for my money then just convenience.The Good things:The Staff: Check-in time is 3:00pm. Driving down from Chicago my wife and I gave ourselves some extra travel time expecting traffic or road construction to hinder our travels but we hit nothing. We soon realized that we were on schedule to arrive in St. Louis before noon. My wife gave the hotel a call while we were still on the road and explained our situation. They told us that they would take care of us and to come in not mattering the time. We arrive, speak to Michael the nice man who my wife talked to earlier, were able to check in, parked in their free parking structure, brought our bags to our room, and I sat on the bed while the clock hit 12:00pm.  Not only saved us money not having to park in a lot with game day prices, but it also gave us a place to change into our Seahawk gear for the big game. Thank you Michael! Other interactions with employees throughout our stay were friendly and helpful but Michael was my favorite. The Room: Nothing life changing but it was nicer than something found at a Motel 6 or Super 8. The room was not huge but spacious enough but more importantly the room was clean and comfortable. The wireless internet was easy to connect to and unlike other hotels in the downtown area it was included with the room. Both the nights we stayed there, despite the low hum of a nearby ice machine, the hotel was quiet and I easily fell asleep in the comfy king sized bed. The Food and Drinks: On the fifth floor there is an open courtyard area where guests can eat breakfast, dinner, and alcoholic drinks all for free. Sure. Like stated in an earlier review, the food is basic and can be considered ""ball park"" fare, but it's still a nice perk to have especially with the alcoholic drinks being available. Because they close this area at 10pm I did buy a soda from a vending machine later in the evening one night and was pleasantly surprised that the 20oz Pepsi was normally priced at $1.25 and not some bloated price like I'm used to while staying at other hotels.The Security: No. They don't have any armed guards but being downtown I just found it nice that the doors to the hotel and the elevator in the lobby can't be accessed without a hotel key after 10pm. And no. They weren't any stranger dangers lingering about at night, it's actually a pretty quiet downtown and I never felt unsafe, but it was just a nice feeling to know that those who weren't supposed to be in the hotel weren't.The Not So Good Things:Some parts of the building are obviously old and run down a little bit. Nothing too major, except for the back stairwell from the parking garage to the rooms, but the worn out parts are a reminder that this is not any 5 star establishment and can be a damper.Because of all the freebies this is a great place for families. Yes. This is a good thing but if you want some romantic getaway with your loved one then I would avoid this place. This hotel is great for ball games and vacations but there is much to be desired in the sexiness category. I'm not saying romance can't happen here but it's just more difficult with the scent of hot dogs in the air and kids splashing loudly in the hot tub. The Good is Way Better than any sort of Bad:The price is right, the service is right, and my experience with this place will be encouraging me to stay with them again next time I'm in town to see my Seahawks beat up the poor little Rams.After deciding to come to St. Louis for a mini vacation in April, we decided this hotel looked decent, the prices were pretty good for a downtown site with a partial view of the arch, and we figured we'd be pretty close to everything.  We had no problem trying to find the hotel.  Checking in was a breeze as we had reservations.  Parking in the ramp is a little tight, but had no problems there either.  Coming from downtown minneapolis, I wasn't surprised by the $15 fee to park; I was just glad it wasn't $15 a night.  We got a little turned around trying to find our room... that's because the person at the front desk gave us a room number that was non-existent. ha, no big deal. we got our real room, and i was pleasantly surprised!  We did have a ""partial view of the arch"", which means you get a sliver of the side and you have to lean to look around the building.  BUT the room was HUGE and nicely laid out for the price we paid!  We got a king size bed that was separate from the rest of the room and had it's own flat screen tv.  The ""living room"" had a little mini bar and fridge and microwave, chairs, table and a couch with another flat screen tv, and then there was the bathroom area that was big enough to move around and the sink was separate from the toilet/shower.  I think we paid around $130 average a night for 3 nights.  Another plus was that they had free breakfast and free snacks/appetizers for dinner, albeit the food wasn't fantastic, but it was edible.  Also, if you are 21 you get 3 free drinks with a punch card.  The drinks are small, so I felt like 3 was pretty fair!  The lobby is pretty and large; there is even a small convenience store located by the front desk (which is a good thing because we drove around for 30 minutes just trying to find a CVS or Walgreens!) The hotel staff was friendly, there was a pool/hot tub/work out room but we didn't use them.  I believe there is also laundry.  Our trip went kind of sour, but I'm glad we had a nice room to come back to at the end of the day.The sign out front says room prices start at $59, which is a lie, but after the shock of finding out what a room REALLY cost, it was a good stay.I was not at the downtown site, but at the I44 &amp; 141 location in St. Louis.   Good breakfast, nice staff, clean room, free long distance and happy hour.This was great, last minute find after many hours on the road.  With a few conventions in town plus a big game, there were only two rooms left and this one was $129.  I feel that this rate was very fair for how clean and quiet our room was.  Very nice front desk staff, secured parking (first time in St. Louis, but it looks like area can be a teensy sketch?  maybe?  places near ballparks seem to be sometimes...), free HOT brekkie, free 60 min of long distance calls per night stay.+++update+++We left a bottle of champagne in the mini fridge.  I called.  The front desk gal told me that ""the cleaning staff usually doesn't report likker""    My indignant response of ""even champagne?!?!?"" got me nowhere, although she wasn't mean or anything.  In fact, her tone was mildly apologetic.  I called back the next day and asked to speak to a manager directly.  I explained the (true) story of just getting married, visiting my brother &amp; sister in law (who recently returned from Iraq) and who had given us this bottle of champagne that they bought when they were on their honeymoon.  Blah, blah, this was a long, sad story, all of it true.  The manager called the cleaning person and found that she hadn't opened it yet!  They sent it back to me in a well-padded (Coach-- guess Drury managers get paid decently) shoebox.  I will love them forever for this.","Being a Cardinals fan, I've visited St. Louis quite often. I usually stay at the Millennium or the Hilton. This hotel is great! We went to Mike Shannon's before Game 1 of the World Series (yea we won!!) and decided driving home was not an option. I Binged hotels and landed a room for under $150! The EXTREMELY accommodating person on the other end of the line booked us in the Executive Suite. What a pleasant surprise to find a nice, large, clean hotel suite to rest my weary head after a GREAT ballgame and a few hours of celebrating! The bed was comfortable and the shower had plenty of hot water and water pressure. For the life of me I cannot remember her name, but there was a very nice lady at the front desk who bent over backwards for us! Cell phone charger, late checkout, even later checkout...I mean...wait! Let's stay another night! She was very helpful! Included in the price of the room is a breakfast buffet. It's so-so, but it will fill your belly. Angelo's Taverna is located in the same building. It's a great place to grab a drink and a bite to eat! Night two we had some visitors who slept on the pullout couch. There was plenty of room!Can't beat the price with free happy hour and breakfast.  This place would be my second choice if the Hilton on Olive street was full.Great hotel. 5 minute walk from convention center in downtown St. Louis.   Much more affordable than other hotels in the the area if you are attending a conference or other function downtown. Features free happy hour with 3 drinks per adult plus munchies and a free breakfast too.  Staff are friendly and helpful too.  Room was clean and very comfortable.  I did hear from other guests that the rooms facing the inner courtyard were noisy if people were in the courtyard late at night.  I had an outside room and was completely happy - very quiet.  Free high speed internet is a plus as well.  Also recommend TransExpress shuttle service to and from the airport - $27 roundtrip if you don't have a car.  You have to call the morning of your departure from the hotel, but they are very reliable about picking you up at the stated time.",,,"['front', 'desk', 'employees', 'superb', 'cordial', 'asked',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-ritz-carlton-st-louis-saint-louis,"The Ritz-Carlton, St. Louis",4.0,$$$,89,"Stayed here for a wedding over Valentine's Day. The wedding was also held within the hotel.For the stay, I was pleased considering the pricing (a king bed for about $218/night, the wedding rate we got for staying over a holiday weekend in February). Every employee we interacted with was incredibly polite and helpful. Facilities seemed pretty clean, and it is an older, more stately decor rather than the new clean modern look. The room was very spacious, bathroom was updated and clean. I had never been to a Ritz before, so based on price, I was pleased. My girlfriend has, and thought the look wasn't as exceptional as other Ritz's, but agreed for the pricing and considering its location, it was still a great deal and still good quality.We used the gym, which I loved (very clean, spaced out, quiet, great selection of equipment). We frequently used uber to venture out of the hotel, and there was always an uber just two-three minutes away. Very convenient location to explore Forest Park, which is mainly where we went. Delicious brunch place just a block away (Whitebox Eatery), cafe (Kaldi's) and some excellent restuarants less than half a mile farther.For the wedding, I thought the venue was a great pick for ~100 guests. Food was decent, dance floor was the perfect size, sound was great for the live band, and bathrooms were conveniently close to all of the action. All my friends agreed the post wedding brunch served by the hotel was much better than anyone expected (a selection of chocolate crepes, sausage egg mcmuffins, quiches, and the usual fruits and pastries). Essentially, great place for a wedding weekend.Great hotel and wonderful staff. The recent update has really refreshed it. The location is killer for those in the Clayton area for business. In the evenings the lobby is a popular bar/hangout for both customers and locals. The onsite dining is great. The Grill cant be beat. If you are staying at the hotel, you have access to the private on site cigar club. Its a great, albeit smoky place to visit. Overall, this is a wonderful place to visit/stay.A little outdated in terms of the property, but still maintained the charm and glamor of a Ritz.  Wonderful room, modern amenities, nice city view balcony, floor to ceiling windows, comfy bed, late check-out time, and in the heart of Clayton. Incredibly gracious and wonderful hotel staff.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat in any subsequent visits to the area.Great place! I wish they had a spa and the massage therapist  are all pretty mediocre,  had many. I love the location. We live local but when we want to head out we grab a room hit 801 Chop House, walk back to the Riyz and hang in the cigar lounge. Highly expensive but worth it!First stay at a Ritz ever, and it was a very nice experience. The lobby was ridiculously nice and the staff are amazing. The beds were super comfortable which is always very important. Downside: The room has a dated feel. The shower had 0 water pressure so it took forever. The light in my bathroom also didn't work. Super expensive parking... and it's kind of far from everything.Excellent hotel and excellent service. We miss the hot tub and pool they used to have but the remodeled gym and spa are very nice additions.Posh. Elegant. But what sets this place apart from many nice hotels is great service all the way from the curb to the guest rooms. Nary a door was held open without a smile and a ""Good Day!"".A very nice hotel, great service, and a classic (albeit older) feel.You can't go wrong with service at any Ritz. They definitely go out of their way to make your experience pleasant. I love how they reach out to you to see how they can make your stay memorable. And while they won't pander to your every ridiculous request (my co-worker requested a jenga tower of towels), they do read them all and joke with you when they see stuff like that.The rooms were a bit dated, but very nice. I love the balconies; if I wasn't there for business, I would have spent more time just chilling out in the open air. The beds, as expected, are super comfy and you will just settle, sink in, and sleep (for better or worse -- work productivity was a little lower!).Overall... will definitely stay here again when I'm in town.What a wonderful hotel!  We were in for w conference. The conference room, food, facilities were great. The staff of the hotel went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Such friendly people. The hotel itself was beautiful, clean and updated. Valet parking was quick and efficient. The room was spacious and the bathroom was luxurious. I would highly recommend this hotel, even if it's not right downtown. There is a Metrolink station nearby, though.I've been to a number of Ritz Carlton hotels and I was pretty disappointed with this location. The lobby was nice but the rooms were very average. The toilet was old and did not function properly, and the rest of the room was very standard. The service was OK - the front desk was not very helpful and seemed as if they wanted to answer any question quickly and make you go away (and their answer ended up being wrong). Very different service than the other RC that I have visited.The hotel was fine but not up to RC standards. If I visit St. Louis again, I would not pay for the premium at this location over a Sheraton or Hilton.This was probably one of the most disappointing stays we have experienced in a hotel in a very long time. We were so excited to stay here with the great name and supposedly spectacular accommodations. First off, when we arrived, everyone who worked there were welcoming and friendly. I have no issues with them and they allowed us an early check in time. When we got to our room and were cleaning up from our trip, we discovered there were many towels and hand towels in the bathroom, but only one wash cloth. Not sure how that happens, but it was a minor bump in the road. Now, I realize we stayed there on New Years Eve and maybe should have expected it, but given the accommodations and the price of the room, I did not expect to be listening to partiers in the hallway until 3:30 am. There was yelling and slamming of doors and pounding on other doors and even more yelling. This was not from kids, these were grown adults. We finally gave up and checked out at 4:00 am and headed home to get some sleep. I told the person when we were checking out how disappointed we were with our stay and the level of noise. They comped our 25.00 parking. I will have to think long and hard before I would stay here again and I would make sure it was not on New Years Eve.Love, love, love. My husband and I stayed here for our baby moon. We were immediately greeted nicely at the door. The front desk was so friendly. The place looks so great. Our room was perfect, we loved the balcony. We ate the restaurant and the food was amazing. As we left our car was washed when they brought it to us. What a fabulous hotel.Decided to book the Ritz for a trip to visit a family friend's father who was not doing well.  Checked hotel prices and was pleasantly surprised to find this property at less than the usual Ritz Carlton price.  Booked it, and don't regret it.  Situated in I guess what counts as the second downtown of St. Louis, plenty of restaurants and shops in proximity, but why bother when you've booked the Ritz?Staff was very friendly, attentive, welcoming and ... ... as you would expect from the Ritz.  Rooms are well appointed, the club lounge was exceptional ... and having a balcony off the room was a nice touch.  Definitely would recommend this property.Pretty outdated, wood paneled vibe. Less expensive than the typical ritz but they literally charge for wifi. How tacky is that? The answer is: about as tacky as the big haired bad plastic surgery clientele. Parking garage is gross and the lobby was so packed with a tacky holiday party I couldn't check in. Terrible for business travelers. Avoid.CLASSIC, Classy and Superb all-around. One of the best hotels, this old-world styled Ritz is in an amazing part of town (Clayton) that features dozens of walkable restaurants, bars, parks and shops. The perfect place to stay in St. Louis as it is centrally located and near highways and airport. Service is excellent, lobby bar is ONE OF THE BEST in the country and features live music on weekends and special theme nights during the week. Two restaurants are both very good, but across the street is 801 Chophouse--which is TOP SHELF steaks and an amazing wine list. This is the best place to stay in St. Louis. A few tips: easterly view faces downtown, westerly view is of the buildings in Clayton. Both nice. Ritz CIGAR BAR is a very special place and considered one of the best cigar bars in America... Classy and relaxing. If you have work to do, come down and sit in a comfortable chair with free Wifi in the Lobby Lounge. Service is very friendly and rooms are updated and comfortable. Prices are better than most Ritz's. My only complaint is some areas are a bit dated, but overall it's a great spot to stay or visit.Weekend trip for a wedding. The hotel is ok, rooms are pretty nice, spacious, and seemed very clean. Didn't like having to venture through restaurant and bar to get to event spaces. Also concierge never seemed to be at his/her designated post when we had a question so ended up at the reservation desk which did not yield helpful information. Oh, well. Maybe he/she had the weekend off. All in all, everyone was very nice and I would stay here again.One of the worst Marriott experiences we have had.  Room was okay but kind of outdated.  Hotel staff was rude and unhelpful.  We tried to order sushi at 4:45 as the chef was setup next to our table.  We were told you could not order until 5.  I feel like this Ritz could really step it up a notch.The customer service at the Ritz was sub par at best.  We stayed for a wedding and were constantly harassed by the night manager.  Apparently, our requests for extra pillows and a rollaway were too much for the staff.  As lifetime platinum Marriott members, we were not impressed to say the least.The stay was incredible. I was in town for a wedding, everything was taken care of by the hotel staff. Spend a few hours at the lobby bar between the events on Saturday and I met someone in the lobby bar that was in town for a separate wedding. We met while ordering a drink. Looking for this person to reach out.The staff was great and the wedding weekend was fun and stress free. Recommend this hotel to everyone.Excellent stay.  I highly suggest the Club Level on the 17th floor.  The Bvlgari toiletries complements my personal preferences, the robe is cozy &amp; made with quality, it is quiet, awesome city views (see picture), and it's just overall lovely!I also have to brag about the 17th floor Brunch!  WOW!!  I honestly believe this brunch was made for me!  Caperberries, fresh juices, domestic &amp; international cheeses, exotic fruits, mini quiches, croissants!  Eeek!  I ate twice in three hours!  Shhh!!","If this is a Ritz, than I'm not sure I was ever missing out by not being....erm...""ritzy"" enough to afford to stay at one.I really wouldn't normally pick a Ritz, but I had a great deal I purchased through my work wellness program ($135 for a night including breakfast).  When I walked in to check in, there was an overwhelming smell of stale cigar smoke from the lounge that lingered in my hair.  Gross.  This isn't an older hotel in Vegas.  Check in was friendly but very curt and she told me to present my certificate for the stay in the am when checking out and settling up.  In the morning I had a bill under the door for $142...so we checked out on the TV and decided to save the certificate for another day/better Ritz (saving $7 didn't seem like a screamin' deal to me and we could just grab a quicker breakfast at an area Starbucks).There was one scratchy bathrobe (I wore it for the novelty but certainly didn't feel fancy) and a non-working telephone in the bathroom.  It may have been ""ritzy"" in 1991, but modern hotels have come a long way.  In addition, parking was $22 (and this in a tech center type area, not downtown or anything).  Fortunately for us, nobody was manning the parking booth so parking was fo' free!So while it was a very serviceable stay, it wasn't as ""special"" as I anticipated.  If I'm ever passing through STL again, I'd likely just opt for a Super 8.Visited St Louis on business today, harried day and left my credit card in the restaurant on way to airport.  Called Tim and Zach, who both rallied and delivered the card to me at the airport.   Unbelievable service. Over and above the call of duty, even by Ritz global standards, and thank you gents!   CheersQuick biz trip to St. Louis. Definitely worth club level expense as the 18th floor staff are pleasant and there are toms of munchies in the afternoon. And heavy breakfast and dinner snacks available. Typical ritz rooms at a cheaper price than any ritz on the west or east coast.The staff really went above and beyond during my bachelorette weekend in St. Louis. When Guest Services learned that it was a special occasion, I received a complimentary upgrade and was greeted with free champagne and snacks. The executive suite was amazing. The hotel is also conveniently located in downtown Clayton. You get the Ritz brand without paying an arm and a leg.This is not your typical Ritz CarltonService: the welcome was friendly and everyone including the doormen, bellhop, front desk, and restaurant staff were very accommodating. Room: I was extremely unimpressed by our room. I was staying with my husband and our room had one robe and no slippers. The bathroom was bare with no floormat and one towel each. I  was amazed to find that my toiletry bottles were half empty(!!) when we arrived! The disappointment continued when I came to the room to grab something at 10pm and our room had not been turned over! This is clearly not a standard Ritz. I called housekeeping and they came to turnover while I went back out to meet friends. When I got back past midnight the room was turned over now complete with bath mats and extra towels. It is a mystery as to why my room was not properly set up when we arrived. (They did NOT put out another robe though...nor slippers)Hotel itself is quite dated with 100 year-old appearing chandeliers in the elevators. However, everything is well kept and clean.The Grill food (brunch) was simple, fresh and tasty. I can't comment on the price as my friend hosted an event Ni enjoyed everything from the fresh squeezed OJ to the pastries and scrambled eggs. The brioche French toast was a bit soggy but otherwise fine.Overall the room was very disappointing and gains the most weight. I was not impressed and I do not feel our experience was what I expect from a Ritz Carlton.Phenomenal property and super location. It has a lot of charm to it and incredible decor and personality. Big hotel with small and warm feel to it. Not your typical Ritz where feels stuffy. Super friendly staff. Went into the private cigar club and had a phenomenal cigar and a local beer Whales Ale I had never tried. Wow incredible beer a and the bartenders were top notch. They had been in the property for 13 years and shares a wealth of information about the area and hotel. Extremely impressed and will definitely go back next time I go to St Louis.This was my first time ever staying at a Ritz-Carlton Hotel. I have stayed at some spectacular hotels in my life, but The Ritz Carlton lived up to its brands reputation of great customer service. The great service started before we arrived at hotel. The service and upgrade accommodations provide by Brandese were phenomenal! The wine and chocolate cake presentation upon entering our suite blew my wife away. It started our weekend on a positive note. The Ritz- Carlton St. Louis, you are simply the best! We will definitely stay here again on our return visit.My fiance and I love this hotel. The lobby bar is great, we love to have drinks and socialize. It's a very comfortable atmosphere. The cigar lounge is wonderful (and this is coming from a non-smoker). I usually hate sitting with my fiance while he smokes, but the Ritz has great ventilation and the smoke didn't bother me at all. Out of everything we enjoy during our stays, the staff has to be at the top of the list. There is always exceptional service, and everyone goes above and beyond expectations to ensure our stay is memorable and enjoyable. Would absolutely recommend, whether it is for a weekend staycation or you're visiting from out of town!Worst meal ever. Paid $120 a plate for Valentine's Day wine-pairing dinner. I can't write a review short enough to fit in Yelp's 5,000 character count. And this gets one star because I can't do any less.Summed up:*Sat us 15 minutes late after a 9:00 reservation.*Restaurant smelled like cigar the whole time.*Terrible wine and was not paired well. Didn't drink it.*Dirty silverware*1st course came 20 minutes after we sat (it was soup) and served with no soup spoon. The waiter asked if I needed anything else and I said ""yes. a soup spoon"" He brought back not a soup spoon, but the largest table spoon I'd ever seen. The wine for this pairing was terrible.*2nd course was a salad. We watched as a waiter sat the salads on another table then took them back to the kitchen because that table already ate theirs. Then he came back out wandered around the restaurant only to go back to the kitchen with them again and then finally brought them to my table.*Bread didn't come until after the second course. It was stale and not baked fresh even though the waitress informed me it was late because it was baking.*Main dish was horrible flavorless watery fish. It tasted and looked like wet paper pulp. We didn't eat any of the dish.*Dessert was not good at all. Didn't eat that either.*The waitress couldn't identify the wines she was serving. One bottle came without a label so we didn't know what we were drinking and she didn't know either. (Remember this was a wine pairing dinner.)*Asked for a vegetarian option at the time of the reservation. They said it would be available and when we ordered there was no option.For a special wine pairing dinner for Valentine's day this restaurant failed miserably. The worst part is they never really offered an apology but instead told me how crazy I was because other people liked their experience. Then they didn't comp any part of my meal. An hour after I left they had the waitress call my cell phone and leave me a message to say they would comp my wine pairing portion. Neither the Chef nor the manager had the decency to call me directly but had the waitress do their dirty work. I paid the bill in full and never asked for a discount and paid the waitress a full 20% tip which she did not deserve. So basically I paid $250 for a thimble of flavorless soup, a salad that traveled three tables to get to me, a main dish I didn't touch, the worst wine I've ever drank, and a dessert that was awful. I will never recommend the Ritz as a destination for food ever. Just go the Taco Bell instead.Unfortunately, I would expect better service - after all it's supposed to be a Ritz Carlton. A lot of varied not meeting expectations and when staff were told, they didn't care enough to take action: no available car so was sent to hale my own cab on a side street across a median; a temporary location for exercise equipment and no air conditioner on in the area; a bed that is old enough to be swayed toward the middle; asking to buy a candy bar at the desk because mine was already eaten and told they couldn't sell one; such a small gift shop - tiny closet actually - that there weren't options available so went off site instead. Disappointing when staff were told and nothing was done. Polite enough. But lacked friendliness and kindness that are more usual in other locations.A friend of mine always wants to take me to the Ritz for food and drinks and general good times. I really didn't like coming here mostly because I always get lost and can't find the stupid parking garage. Yes, I am retarded sometimes, I know. I managed to get lost on my most recent trip. But hey, I found the place eventually, so whatever. I rarely go to Clayton so I am not as familiar with the streets there. I went last night with a girlfriend and another friend who actually used to work there. We met the bartender, Monica, who was extremely nice and makes amazing drinks. I told her I wanted something sweet and tropical but not too intense. She made me a fruity rum drink that I loved. They also bring you some nuts to munch on complimentary. What really makes me happy about the Ritz is that the employees are SO freaking nice here. I guess maybe it's the norm for high-end hotels but having the guys out front rush to grab the door for you and make conversation is so refreshing. I wish this level and quality of service existed everywhere! I want to go back to try their sushi as I heard it was pretty good. They had a really awesome band playing too. It was classy and sounded like swing music. The bathrooms are super nice and clean too. I wanna go back!Visited here in July for four days and had a wonderful stay.  Parts of the hotel has an ""old"" smell but the service from all but one employee was outstanding.  I mean deserving of award outstanding.  Mike was his name and he went out of his way to make our stay very, very enjoyable. We had a suite with a balcony and it was very quite.  We had a small dinner in the lounge two nights and we enjoyed the club level amenities.Extraordinarily friendly staff. Can't complain about that. Food in restaurant, at least what I ordered, was not really ""Ritz"" level quality. French Onion Soup was not that hot, and the cheese was just melted but not brown and bubbling as it should be. The Cobb Salad was OK, nothing special. Still, everyone is really, really nice. The rooms could use some updated furniture. The desk chair in my room was worn, and the door knob on the handle to my balcony came off in my hand and is now sitting on the chair in my room because I can't figure out how to reattach it so it stays. Overall really nice place, but a little dated, with a friendly staff and food that is so-so. They charged my credit card for my room night even though I prepaid for the room when I made the reservation so I'm glad I checked my bill!I'm only giving 1 star because I have to. our bed had black bugs crawling all over it. The hotel was outdated, and when we complained we were only offered an upgraded room. Very disappointed-won't be back! Went to 4 seasons had an excellent time.Spent 5 days at this hotel with my wife and our 4 small children.  The care and service was even beyond what I have come to expect from a Ritz property.  Staff from top to bottom anticipated our needs and delivered exceptional service.  Suite was spacious and sparkling clean.  Both my wife and I were more than pleased with our experience.  Will definitely return.  My highest commendation for this hotel.This is a fine place to rest your head. Very nicely appointed rooms. Clean. Comfortable beds. Spacious bathroom.The front desk and the room service peeps were all polite and smart and all that.Would stay here again.We were in town for a wedding so we stayed here. Staff was great and informative. We actually came the night before a huge ice storm was going to hit St. Louis and were highly advised by the front desk that we shouldn't make our way out the next day. Thank goodness they told us because in the morning the weather looked perfect but once 10 am hit, a serious ice storm rolled through town for a few hours. I've stayed at a few other Ritz Carlton's and were turned off by how snobby some employees and guests can be. This location the workers were actually really pleasant and their clientele was more relaxed. We actually spent two nights at the lounge/bar area and enjoyed their drinks and appetizers. On Friday night they had a live soul band that played some classics which we enjoyed grooving to. We didn't go around the neighborhood much because of the weather conditions but it had a few restaurants and shops that you can walk to. The rooms were nice, clean, and good size. The downstairs lobby could use a little updating. The decor in the lobby feels like you are in a haunted mansion! Yikes!*This review is not for the hotel portion, but for the dining room.I've wanted to go to High Tea at the Ritz for awhile now, and got the opportunity today when my mom took me there to celebrate my upcoming nuptials. For those who don't know, High Tea in the US is pretty much an elaborate afternoon tea, with the tea being accompanied by various sandwiches and sweet pastries.The dining room is rather dark and formal, but what do you expect? The Ritz is a glitzy place in old school style. Think old portraits, china, silver. Not modern, but has its place for sure. There was a huge fireplace and we were placed right in front of it, which was welcome. It wasn't too close but was nice to be by the fire. The table was set with their china and silver. The server brought us 3 varieties of tea and let us choose, then brought us pots and served us. We prepared our teas with whatever sweetener we wanted (they have sugar cubes in white and brown (unrefined) varieties plus milk or cream). It wasn't rushed at all. It's the kind of place you savor.Then she brought us a 3 tiered tray filled with goodies. This definitely is enough for a meal so come hungry! The top tier had tea size sandwiches. Open faced, there were different varieties. We requested all vegetarian when we made our reservation, and got the standard cucumber/cream cheese (yum!), one with red peppers and asparagus, and egg salad. Very fresh and a nice presentation. The middle tier had semi sweet items like macaroons, lemon Madelines, and currant scones. They also had real cream for the scones and blackberry preserves. The lower tier was the desserts, all little tarts and the like. Cream puffs, lemon merengue, raspberry cream tarts, and a chocolate tart. I'm missing a couple things here but the tray was loaded!The service was good, as well expected from the Ritz. Not intrusive but never far away. The price tag was hefty - $100 including gratuity for 3. But it's an experience, so if you are into that kind of thing, it's something to try. I can't give 5 stars since I haven't stayed there and one other odd thing. When we got our bill, the server had written in gratuity - as in, it wasn't included by the computer, but it was hand written on the gratuity line instead of letting us figure it out. It was 18%, which I found strange because there were only 3 of us. I've never seen gratuity added for tables of under 6. And certainly not hand written. Anyhow, it was great! I can't wait to splurge for it again! I'm thinking it's going to be my mother in law's Christmas gift.Had a stay recently and its a Ritz Carlton but not the nicest Ritz I have stayed in.  Rooms are good but not great.  I had the missing bathrobe problem as well.The lounge is a nice place to hangout if you want to lounge.  Its pretty tame and quiet.  I do like the fact that the give you assorted nuts and kettle chips to nosh on while you are drinking.They have a pretty decent gym and a small pool, so bring your swimming trunks as an alternative to your normal work out.There's a reason they're one of the highest rated hotel in St. Louis. I was particularly impressed but how friendly and helpful the staff was from top to bottom. Had a lovely stay and will definitely be going back upon my next visit to St. Louis. On top of that, it's very close to downtown Clayton, the nicest mini-downtown area in St. Louis.","Beautiful, beautiful, old school looking Ritz-Carlton with all the famous R-C levels of service to go along with it.  I prefer the Four Season's in St. Louis but mainly cause not only is it a great property but, I can play Blackjack at the Lumiere casino while there.Blackjack aside, in terms of all the things you want from a hotel, this Ritz is definitely the Four Season's equal.  There is very nice bar area where you can get a quick dinner with some really interesting choices. Duck fat fries anyone?? The rooms are immaculately appointed and have a small balcony to at least go out and get some fresh air on.  5 stars without a doubt.I've never stayed at a Ritz, but somehow this hotel made it on the list of company preferred hotels and our corporate rate was comparable to other non-luxury hotel chains.The room was big with a very large bathroom and had a small balcony overlooking the courtyard in the front of the hotel.  It definitely had the perks that I would imagine a Ritz to have.  Bathroom robe, plush hangers, soft, pillow top bed.  There was evening turndown service with chocolates, bottled water &amp; glass placed on the bedside table.  I left my toothbrush and toothpaste on the bathroom counter, and they even put it in a glass for me and cleaned up the counter.The staff was supremely nice and high-class from the front desk, bell hop, waitress to even the parking garage attendant.  They make you feel welcomed and treat you well.The breakfast buffet at the restaurant is pricey though. $23 but they have a nicer selection of items to go with the price.  Eggs benedict, yogurt parfaits, biscuits &amp; gravy, great selection of pastries, lox/smoked salmon, etc.  Still expensive though and getting an entree is better off if you have the time.Top shelf hotel with excellent service all around.  Had a fantastic room, access to the club lounge, and a wonderful stay.  Best hotel I have been to since the Maui Four Seasons.  Only wish I could have stayed longer and enjoyed the hotel more.Four, but not Five. The lobby has a great, convivial vibe.  The crowd knows how to enjoy themselves while behaving themselves!  Lobby staff was professional and midwest-friendly, which was appreciated. But, with midwest style, you do lose some of the polish. Room service was the same, super friendly but not sophisticated.We stayed the night, after attending a fundraiser.  I hope our organization never, ever has a fundraiser here again.  Staffing was skeletal and it took forever to serve drinks and dinner.  Then, when my back was turned, my plate was whisked from the table.  Hey, I wanted those last couple bites!  The staff was breaking down the room while people were still socializing--it felt like a real bum's rush.  bleah.We had long standing reservations for a Sunday and Monday evening in July, Club Level Suite. The Club at this location is nothing special and  beware that the hotel restaurant is closed on both Sunday and Monday. If you plan to eat dinner, you are forced to dine at the 1 restaurant in the immediate area or get in your vehicle and drive to a restaurant where parking is mostly non existent. I believe it would be incumbent upon the hotel to inform potential guests of this situation. What hotel of this quality does not have a restaurant for their guests on the premises seven nights a week? Their suggestion was to have room service!  Really two nights in a row? At the price you can do much better!I was in town for business and was put up in The Ritz-Carlton. I had a deluxe room which I found very enjoyable. It was a good size, with a comfortable bed. Everyone was very welcoming, but in truth, I wasn't there long enough to really take advantage of the ""Ritz"" amenities. Not the fault of the hotel, but at the same time I wasn't bowled over by everything. It seemed like there were quite a few people staying at the hotel, but it had a bit of a sleepy feel to it; especially in the lounge, which had solid cocktails and a small food menu, but nice options.From my northern perspective I think St. Louis has an interesting mix of north and south, new and old, and I felt that this hotel really epitomized that. Cigar Club anyone? Furthermore, the hotel is nicely located. There were different things to walk to, which is especially nice when you're cooped up in a conference room for most of the day. My time was so short and since I was there for business my perspective is a little different most likely. If I'm back in St. Louis I would most likely stay here again and really try to experience everything.I decided to go to the Ritz Carlton for a fancy breakfast. It is my last big splurge for the year. I got the breakfast buffet. It was interesting to not see tables of over cooked food. i liked the different choices. the smoked salmon, various cheeses, and the vast fruit selection. The mini pastries were very good also. The stand outs for me were the cheese blintz's and the eggs benedict. i was not a fan of the coffee. the fresh squeezed oj was good. It is pulpy and i am not a fan of pulp but still very good. the bacon and sausage links were not what i am used to but how can you not like bacon, and sausage well it takes alot to mess up sausage also. The service and interior were what you would expect from a place like the Ritz. The seats were big comfy seats. they leaned back a bit for comfort. unless you are a BBW like me then they can be a bit complicated. Long story. the server was going to bring me fresh silverware. I told her don't worry about it because that is just a waste of water.i will be back.Stayed here for a conference....They upgraded our room...fantastic!  It was huge.  The bathroom was separated so one person could go to the bathroom while the other showered...good planning Ritz.The accommodations were pretty standard with a slightly, nicer flair to everything.  The conference room was pretty standard except there was no internet in it and the chairs were attached to the tables so you were swinging all over the place...The restaurant/bar....ok what is it with really nice hotels having crap service at the restaurant.  We wanted to grab a bite before we left on Sunday and it took FOREVER.  Very poor service.  The food was great, but definitely not worth the wait.  I was also there the night before and didnt remember what the service was like...I think one too many cocktails for me :)second time here still a 5brought kidsvery kid friendlygreat pool for kidscatered to kidscame for our kids birthdayWe were in St. Louis last weekend for a wedding and stayed at the Ritz, which was the official wedding hotel and also where the reception was held.  The prices were incredibly reasonable for a Ritz-Carlton - the wedding rate was around $140 a night but just from looking on the internet I could get a rate for under $200 a night (this may be expensive for St. Louis, I don't know, but coming from California it seems extremely reasonable).   The room itself was adequate although it wasn't quite as fancy as I expected it would be.  It was larger than a typical hotel room and a had a large marble bathroom, but the bed was not especially comfortable and the bathroom ceiling above the shower had suspicious pink and gray splotches that looked like mold.   Wifi was $10 for 24-hours, which is on the high side.  It also did not work that well and kept kicking me off.  I was connected remotely to my work desktop, so every time it kicked me off I had to go log back into that, which was pretty annoying.  The best thing about the room was that there were nice chocolates by the bed when we checked in and complimentary bottled water in the room.The service, however, was as wonderful as you would expect for a Ritz.  Everyone greeted us with a friendly smile and bent over backwards to help us.  I accidentially left my computer power cord in the lobby and when I called them to ask about it, they not only had it and were willing to ship it, they also paid for shipping and ended up overnighting it to me.  I'm sure there is probably a better value for your dollar in St. Louis, but our stay here was very pleasant.This review covers the hotel as well as the dining.  First of all, it's the Ritz and it lives up to expectations with wood paneling in the lobby to lend an old world feel and classy decor in the rooms complete with a juliette balcony to look down Carondelet Plaza.In general, the beds are super comfy and the staff are very helpful and friendly (from the front desk to the room service).  ""The Restaurant"" where breakfast is served has incredibly friendly staff, and I was pleasantly surprised at how quick they were with my waffles (with 20 minutes to eat and get going, I was able to fit it all in).  ""The Grill"" where dinner is served is a true steakhouse - whether its a 5oz filet and shrimp or the 128-oz steak for four come ready for steak and heart-clogging sides which are decadent and range from duck fat fries to asparagus with hollandaise.  Why not 5 stars?  Three main reasons:First, for me, the Cigar Bar, while a good fit for potential Ritz customers, is not my thing and the smell pervades the lobby, particularly in the evening. Second, the fitness center which is located adjacent to the pool and shares the same air flow (in other words, it's stinking hot and humid in the cardio area).  On the plus side, they have a good set of machines with personal TVs, headsets to borrow, fruit at the entrance, and a separate weight area.  I haven't had trouble getting a treadmill in the morning which is another plus.Third, the room service menu is limited, particularly for healthy food, which is probably only an issue for the frequent traveler.  I would love for them to make the sushi available for room service instead of just in the lobby.Overall though, my favorite place to stay in St. Louis.Never seen nicer people working at a hotel.....From the front desk to the housekeepers. Everyone was super helpful. Lovely rooms. Very good food and meeting rooms.FABULOUS....we stayed for two days and was on the 18th  (black card) floor...sooo lovely...open bar...and nice foodstuffs for breakfast, lunch and dinner if you didnt want to go anywhere...we took part in all three and still went to have dinner at a cute place in walking distance of the hotel. When you pay with AMEX you get a few upgrades..like a 100 credit towards the spa...let me tell you, the massage was sooo wonderful and the steam room and dry sauna did the trick...later in the evening there was a fun jazzy band in the main bar..and the bartender, Monica was wonderful.This review is for the event space and service. I attended a wedding reception and the staff and facilities were super. The food was also very good. Valet parking was a snap as well... and free (except tip) for those who are staying and/or attending events. Wonderful place.I went here for the afternoon tea in The Lobby Lounge with a group of about 30 girls. It was fabulous!! They had use sit in a circle so we could all see one another and the service was superb. Our waitstaff was very friendly and explained each of the teas and sandwiches/pastries that were served. They had three teas that day which included: An African Solstice tea which had hints of blueberry and vanilla, A vanilla tea, and a Jasmine Green Tea. My favorite was the vanilla tea. We also had Smoked Salmon and Crab with American Caviar and Dill, Classic Egg Salad, and Cucumber Sandwiches for the first course and the best was the Egg Salad. I love me some egg salad and this was really good. As far as the pastries and sweet stuff, my favorite was this little chocolate pie. It was really good! The blackberry scone had one piece of blackberry in it which was disappointing but the Devonshire cream that accompanied it was amazing!Overall, I LOVED my first afternoon tea experience and cannot wait to do it again! I would highly recommend the Ritz for afternoon tea.I stayed at the Ritz for an extended holiday/wedding weekend. The hotel staff was very friendly and they kept up all of the amenities that you would expect from a Ritz Carlton. They provided an excellent wedding party room rate. The hotel is definitely more traditional elegance than modern so, it is not overly hip in anyway. I made major use of the spa/fitness center. The fitness center was way better than your average hotel exercise room. It was a real treat to use the steam room and sauna in preparation for the wedding activities.One of the things I like about the Ritz is that the lobby is essentially a solid dining area where you can just hang out and have some extremely yummy food.Case in point, Tea Time.Sarah S sums this up pretty well where you get a choice of 3 teas and you get a 3 tier tower of goodness with sandwiches and pastries.  Have you ever wondered what REAL milk tea tastes like (as opposed to the powdered stuff at Stl Bubble Tea)?  Try any of the Asian teas and pour just a splash of cream.  Now imagine that with the boba.  Yeah.  St. Louis disappoints on the bubble tea front  :( BUT ANYWAY.  Everything is delicious.  You usually get 3 different types of delicate sandwiches, three uh... not dessert pastries/bread and then a bunch of dessert pastries.  The price is high at $27 a person, but you're going to walk away full, even if you do spend the entire 2 hours they have for tea.  I believe you do need to reserve 24hrs in advance as well.  Few locals would have any reason to visit a hotel, but the Ritz provides plenty of good reason with their awesome lobby and tea time.When you are here you really forget about everything else going on in your life and can truly ENJOY a wonderfully luxurious experience. I have both stayed/ dined here and always leave happy. Whether its a fabulous Sunday Brunch, live music and drinks in the lobby, or a peaceful hotel stay this truly stands out as a destination hotel in the city. I have stayed in some beautiful places, but this lobby has to be one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. Old world lux. A few years ago I might say that the rooms were somewhat dated but the (somewhat) recent makeover was done fabulously and now the rooms are as beautiful as ever. Each has its own private balcony, and if you are lucky enough to stay on the concierge floor you won't be dissappointed. 5 different buffets each day - and don't miss out on tea - or the chocolate chip cookies!!!!! Over the past few years the immediate neighborhood has also transformed and added some great shopping.Very nice hotel. Old-school: dark elegant wood, oil paintings, etc. Excellent service and high-quality furnishings, bedding, etc.But they fall down on some of the more modern expectations:The internet connection is unreliable for connectivity and speed. This was on two different devices of mine, and not just me: laptops etc. on the people I was traveling with.The restaurant is *right next to* a cigar bar. So although it is non-smoking, the smell is more like sitting in the non-smoking section of a restaurant that allows smoking. Also there is *not one* vegetarian entree, so be prepared to cobble together a meal from salads and side dishes. The desserts were great: grand marnier souffle, creme brulee, and the s'mores skillet were the favorites of the group I went with.Would stay again but find a different place to eat.My favorite place to stay in St Louis.  This is an older Ritz Carlton, but the rooms are clean, the bathrooms well appointed, and most of the rooms have a nice, if small, balcony. I like the work out room.  I have never had to wait for a cardio machine, love the weight area, and it has a full steam and spa.  Another plus is the full compliment of lockers. The valet parking attendants are very friendly.  I have found the desk staff to be a bit stiff and not as personable.  I don't eat at the hotel as I'm usually out with clients for lunch and dinner.  There is usually fruit in the work out area that I eat for breakfast.  Overall a great hotel and I will be back.","I have had the privilege to spend some time in about a dozen Ritz Carlton locations. I don't say that to be pompous, but rather to lend some perspective to this review. (Not all Ritz Carlton locations are the same.)I really like the Clayton location. It's a regal place, right from the beginning. It's pure Ritz. From the moment you arrive, the staff is immediately courteous, and the amenities, down to the last details are all very well appointed. I did not see the rooms, as I am a local, but I have spent a few nights in the lounge and private wine room, while sipping some great libations and eating very very well.The staff always remembers my name, making me feel a little like I have come to a friend's hotel. This is a very nice touch...if you're a service professional, you could always take notice of the Ritz Carlton service model. Enjoy.Very surprise there are so many positive reviews...I stayed there last Wednesday and don't agree.  Upon entering the hotel you are overwhelmed by the smell of cigar smoke without ever witnessing one being smoked (even worse @ 6:30 AM the morning following).  We ate a late dinner at the bar and while the bartender was nice enough, she seemed absentminded and required us asking for for her assistance several times...and she (admittedly) had no clue of the menu. In most places I wouldn't think twice, but when you are paying $250 for dinner and drinks for two...that doesn't cut it.  Just a heads up.  And the ever present cigar smoke smell blows my mind.This place is as good as it gets when it comes to service.  Room and food products are top notch and executed by talented staff.The staff, lobby, room and service are all what you'd expect from the Ritz.  Great place to stay in St. Louis if you're in town for dining and a show at the Fox.What prevents this from being a 5 star is the restaurant downstairs.  Gorgeous setting and incredible service, but the food is nothing special, and in some cases pretty poor quality despite excellent presentation.Recent stay in Clayton. Valerie the concierge arranged my pick up at the airport, transportation to pcik up my grandkids and back to the airport. The staff is friendly and the room was very nice. The chocolatet cookies on the conmcierges floor are amamzing! I reccomend this hotel.This was my second stay at this Ritz and once again, it was perfect! I was celebrating my 21st birthday with two girlfriends and my parents so we booked two separate rooms. They kindly upgrade us to a gorgeous suite which was perfect for us girls to use!! On top of that, the service was top notch (as always), and everyone always greeted us with a smile. Brunch the next morning was DELSIH and there was a wonderful assortment of yummy things.Couldn't have asked for a more perfect 21st birthday weekend and we will be back again!!Awesome hotel and great staff!  Lounge is great size compared to other ritz locations that are much smaller.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone!We held our wedding reception in the restaurant of the Ritz.  The staff all bent over backwards for us, and it was a lot less expensive having the reception here than one might imagine.  There was a $7500 minimum, but everything was included: 3 tier cake, china, silver, tables, white linens, chairs, waiter service and room rental.  We were even given a complimentary wedding suite that was as large as our apartment!  Kristen, who is the lady who books your event, is wonderful, professional and very caring.  We got Mary our as event planner.  Mary is equally as nice, but she had trouble keeping details.  Only a few minute details were forgotten for our event, and overall it went without a hitch.  After the reception we were surprised when we arrived in our suite because there was a plate with chocolate and gold painting atop of which there were a variety of truffles.  Next to the plate was a bottle of expensive apple cider and a silver Ritz Carlton frame with a photo of my husband and I that Mary took when we arrived at the reception.  The personal service we got here was unbelievable and overwhelming.  The problems:  The head table was supposed to receive their meals with silver domes, but that didn't happen.  The filet meals were supposed to have prosciutto wrapped asparagus, but had broccoli instead.  Our guests had to ask to get something other than water to drink, instead of it being offered.  My father was ten minutes late to the ceremony because he had to wait for the restaurant to be cleared before he could help set up, as they would not ask a table of people to leave for preparations for our event.  So, while there were problems, I doubt that our guests noticed and overall it did not matter in the end.No I did not stay here.  I went to the Ritz for a lunch with a group of friends.  What is unusual about this lunch is we were eating lunch in The Cigar Club.  10 men smoking cigars telling tall tales and laughing and having a great time.  We all come from very different backgrounds.  But we all share the  love of all things Cigar.  So we are sitting at this table(per the club member cost $35,000!!!)  Our server waits on this motley crew on the last Thursday of every month.  While the majority ordered burgers, ruben, and the like I had a Cobb Salad.  It was a nice salad but I cannot in all truthfulness rave about salad, eggs and bacon bits.  After lunch was over more talk and tall tales and one by one the guys say goodbye and head to parts unknown.  I was the last to leave before the club member.  Walking away thinking my god that was a fast 4 hours.  I can't wait for the next last Thursday.Love me some Ritz people watching! Amazing drinks and tasty sliders in the lobby lounge. For being 5 star hotel, I really don't find them to be too expensive.Outstanding !    Our group of about 120 people looooved being here.   The staff and food and decor were all top notch.   This is one of the best luxury hotels in America..... and they made our group feel special.   Thank you.   We look forward to coming back.You would think having the name Ritz-Carlton would automatically include great service, NOT. I called to get information on hosting an event there and was given not 1 person, not 2 persons, but 3 different persons to tell the same story to, ending up with nothing.  I spoke with a man named Andy who asked about my event. Once he realized he couldn't assist me, he transferred me to Cheryl. He only told her the date of my event and nothing else. So after explaining a second time what my needs are, she let me know she is NOT the one to speak with about it and wanted to transfer me a third time. She said the person I needed to speak with was with a client. That's fine, I thought. So Cheryl reluctantly offered to email me the banquet menu with additional pricing for my event. Do you think that showed up at all? NO!When I called back, I was transferred to at least 3 people before I got any where. When asking for the size of the rooms and how many they hold, Cheryl told me in a snotty tone that the room I was asking about was ""very expensive"" - Um, do you remember the scene in Pretty Woman?I didn't ask for the price, I asked for the size. Obviously we chose to go to a different hotel in St. Louis that offers a higher level of customer service without the hoity toity attitude that Cheryl was giving. Ritz-Carlton, after many years thinking that this was the best out there, I stand corrected. This was the worst customer service I've ever received while trying to book an event. I will be taking my 200 guests elsewhere.The Lobby Lounge is the perfect place to dine and have cocktails. Get the seat by the fireplace on a cold wet evening and enjoy the ambience! I had the shrimp and Grits which were superb. The service was on point. The seating was like being at home!Before you read this review, please note that I stayed here for work and probably would not have stayed at someplace so upscale if I was paying with my own money.Pros - Gorgeous Christmas-decorated lobby, courteous staff, clean rooms, classy lobby bar area, above average gym/pool facilities.  All in all, pretty much exactly what I would expect from an upscale hotel.Cons - The hotel has a cigar bar which sounds cool in theory but overwhelms the main entrance with the smell of smoke.  Also, the two meals I had were mediocre: BBQ chicken sandwich (lunch menu) and the multi-grain pancakes (breakfast room service).  I can't speak for the dinner menu, which I didn't sample.Because I was there Wed-Fri, I found it to be a more business traveler-oriented hotel, but I'm sure it sees its share of tourists as well.It's the Ritz - it's likely to be fantastic (even for StL).  The staff is professional and courteous.  If the Ritz is out of your range, be sure to go on their website to take advantage of their various packages - the ""Bed and Breakfast"" package includes free valet and a $40 credit for breakfast (in-room dining or in the restaurant).The rooms are spacious and each room has its own balcony (ours had views of downtown and the Arch).  The room amenities are great -the bed and bedding are super comfy and you get Bvlgari products in the bathroom.There's a sushi bar in the lobby if you're looking for a quick bite, and there is tons of seating with armchairs and couches.  There was a band performing (Sat night), and lots of hotel guests were hanging out with cocktails and dancing.  However, be prepared for stares from other guests if you're not over the age of 40 and not dressed ""conservatively""...lol.Beautiful room with excellent service. A bit pricy but what do you expect from a Ritz-Carlton???I'm not usually loaded enough to stay at the Ritz but, since it's St. Louis, this particular Ritz was affordable. I had heard it was a ""Ritz Lite"" so I was pretty surprised when I got there and everything was first class all the way. We were greeted every time we walked by a staff member. The bellman even remembered my name. The beds were heavenly. Even the rollaway we got for my stepson was plush. Highlights: We were there for a family event and when we discovered that nobody had made dinner reservations (for 20!) the event planner stepped in and pulled together a full catered meal in one of their banquet rooms, all with less than 8 hours notice. Amazing. Cocktails and food down in the sushi bar - also amazing. And served to us by the most professional, attentive waiter ever. The only negative experience we had was with the hostess at brunch. What a biotch. You know the blond lady in the boutique in Pretty Woman that snubs Julia Roberts when she walks in to buy a dress? The ""I don't think we have anything for you here"" lady? This was that lady. Except about 40 years older. She actually told my husband's neice to stop bouncing her baby. Gave her some lecture about how his little brain was still fragile. By the end of brunch, all of us wanted to slap her for one reason or another. So be warned, but don't stay away. This place is awesome. Especially for only $200 a night!What else could one expect from the Ritz Carlton, anything less than five stars would be an extreme disappointment for not only me, but also for the Ritz.The lobbies are super nice, with an inviting set of couches and decor. The lobbies lead right into the premium sushi bar. The list of mixed drinks is impressive, but I must admit the scotch is the way to go.The rooms are always super clean. Sleeping in the extra soft Egyptian cotton sheets always helps one be comfortable, and I always feel like a champ in the bathrobe reading the paper the next morning.Now that the construction is over, parking is a snap, valet or private garage, and the hotel is just minutes from the airport and downtown. Centrally located in the heart of Clayton (St. Louis' real business district) great dining is just minutes outside the door if you decide to leave the hotel.If you decide to have a snack at the Ritz some suggestion include the Sunday brunch. Chocolate covered strawberries, super tasty fruit filled waffles, cheesy eggs, champagne, and caviar pretty much top it off, all for $50. I love it. Oh, and the room service is just as good. Where else can you have a Steak and Lobster delivered to you in bed?Expected a little bit more from this Ritz.  Room was clean, shower had terrific water pressure and marble though out.  Technology upgrades were nice in the phones/ tv and all.  It was a large room but the French country theme sorta fell flat with my husband and I.  Pluses included a stocked mini bar and complimentary water in the room ( I hope the bottled water was complimentary,?)  Linens were soft and clean.  We had a very small balcony looking toward the downtown area and we could see the Arch.  The fitness center (where the pool and hot tub is) also included the spa services was very new and immaculately clean.  The whole hotel is very nicely done with tons of deep mahogany and great furniture.  There are two turndown services where they bring you more towels and things so that is a great service. Cons:  -I was awoken by shutting doors by either housekeeping or  other guests.  Not a great way to start the day.  -I felt at this price point in hotels that  a few things should be included- There are small charges for - Internet 9.99 a day, Self Parking 22 a day. No free  B-fast?? I dunno -Other cheaper brands seem to be able to provide it.  IMO.  -Double charged for drinks at the lounge, once on my cc and once on my room. (Was quickly cleared up with one phone call.)-There was only one bathrobe for two people. Umm, who gets the comfy robe shall we flip for it;)Overall ok but I am unlikely to stay again.  Down the highway is a residence Inn and for the same or less in price much more space and other nice freebies.We were here for  a conference. A beautiful hotel. The bed is so comfortable. The toilet is  seperated from the bathtub/shower.The air conditioning  was great while outside was 99. Each room has its own balcony.Beautiful lobby.Next to the Metrolink Forsyth Boulevard Station.Complimentary morning newspaper.Breakfast,lunch,dinner were all first class.Service was excellent.Great meeting rooms.We were able to sample all the following at breaksToasted RavioliGus pretzelsTed Drewes Frozen Custard--Chocolate, Vanilla &amp; StrawberryFitz's Root BeerGooey Louie Butter CakeI  was happy that we all got a chance to try all the local St. Louisfood.","Older, larger rooms but updated.  Pleasant staff.  The balcony doors actually open.I actually love the lobby bar staff and the front desk here. This is my second stay in the past two months, and almost all the general staff in these areas recognized me. It was really awesome as they all were very thoughtful and cool and did a wonderful stay to add to the pleasantness of my stay.  So, I'm not the guy in a dark ill fitted suit jacket wearing a collared, awkwardly striped dress shirt unbuttoned sporting the light tan run of the mill khakis with stretch waist and horribly boring shoes, while in a haze of multiple-consumed libations over the rocks, chomping on a cigar with big jowls flapping loosely with idle conversation of some statistics of their region. No, I'm the guy with side chops, the FauxHawk, ears pierced in a pair of crazy ass Vibram 5 Finger crazy hippie shoes, a plaid shirt, tactical boots with an awesome shine, and a Mac under one arm. Of course I'm the homo from California.  But I'm treated with awesomeness and the best service as the first time and I appreciate any place that is able to see that I respect their business and that they can respect my style.The rooms are always clean and well laid out. Bed is fantastically luscious. and the bathrooms are sized so you can move about with comfort and not have to run into everything. So my only little weird thing:  I get back to the hotel room and my lamps are unplugged this evening, from behind the bed, a cigarette butt is behind the bed and the clock no  longer works.. LOL. I told the front desk because it was really entirely funny, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it.  I blame it on the ghost or whatever. All was taken care of and things are back in order. So stay here, ask for an Italian Side Car from the lobby bar staff. Say Dave said you make a great one. :) They'll love ya.I live 3 blocks from here and my family stays here when they come into town.  I have watched the decline over the years. This is a Ritz Carlton just like a McDonalds would be a Morton's Steakhouse if you put a Morton's sign in front. This is really a Marriott hotel. The customer service is horrible here and there is so much turnover in staff that no one really knows who is in charge. The location is good, but the service will certainly disappoint.  You have been warned.We had a class reunion there recently. The ambiance, service, food, drinks and live music was really great.Wonderful place to stay while in St. Louis. Great military discount!I came here for a quick weekend to visit my sister and was very impressed. My dad made my reservation the day before and had no issues getting me a room. I was also able to bring my cat, which was great (they are very pet-friendly). My room was very nice and the service was excellent. As members of the Ritz-Carlton Club, my sister and I were able to visit the ""Club Level,"" where they always have cookies &amp; coffee, breakfast in the morning, and chocolate fondue (among other sweets) late at night. So good. I also really liked the lounge by the lobby. We went here for drinks before going to dinner, and then came back afterwards, where there was a live band and dancing (I think they do the live music thing every weekend). We ended up dancing all night and had tons of fun. I will certainly be back here again in May for my sister's graduation!Because the sheets were always scrumptious and the pool divine.  Whenever my mom visited this was my home away from home.  The elevators always smelled good. They have Nintendo for free and plush cozy bathrobes.  It's all about the details my dear, all about the details.My brother's high school graduation reception was held here in one of the ballroom's.  It was a nice venue, statuesque and fitting for the occasion, but the food was horrendous (very typical if not bad hotel catering).  I honestly expected more from a Ritz.I've only seen the rooms - haven't ever stayed in one, but I'm sure they are just as impeccable as the service is, so I'm going out on a limb and giving the place 4-stars for what remains to be seen. I'll revisit this review when I go back and stay next time around.It's The Ritz, people.  Even St. Louis can do it right.  This is where the ""who's who"" of St. Louis will show up on Saturday night.  There is a sushi bar in the lobby on the first floor - delicious.  Cocktails are quite tastey, and quite $$$.  (Try the Pineapple Upside Down Cake Martini.... seriously tastes like Pineapple Upside Down Cakey goodness.)  I've stayed here on several occasions.  Even the hallways smell good.","['wedding', 'valentine', 'day', 'wedding', 'also', 'held', 'within', 'hotel', 'pleased', 'considering', 'pricing', 'king', 'bed', '218', 'night', 'wedding', 'rate',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-st-louis-airport-bridgeton-6,Crowne Plaza St. Louis Airport,3.0,$$,42,"Starting very bad - waiting for their shuttle out in the rain!  If you are staying at this hotel plan to get a taxi unless you have a lot of time to waste.  I like IHG hotels but when you are tired from a long flight the last thing you want to do it sit outside in the rain and wait for an extended period for a hotel shuttle.  If there was a taxi anywhere close I would go - if not raining I could have walked there by now!!!!!I originally rated at 1 - but updated given the service I received upon arrival.TIP: Don't call the reservation line to book the hotel call directly to the hotel to avoid problems.I booked a room, called back to cancel it after 15 min. and still got charged for the room.  I spoke to the reservation agent and the front desk clerk who both assured me that I would be able to cancel with no problem if I needed to do it.  Unfortunately when I called to inquire about the charge I got the runaround for 4 days from the girl Jackie and another guy at the front desk that refused to let me speak to Mr. Vasquez the manager.  He was either in a meeting or unavailable each time and I finally had to call IHG Rewards Guest Relations to handle the issue.  It was resolved today after 8 days.  If it wasn't for IHG Rewards Guest Relations I might not have finally been contacted by Mr. Vasquez, the manager, who was most apologetic and offered to refund the charge and a future discounted rate when I was in STL again.  Thank you, Mr. Vasquez for straightening out the situation.  I'm sorry for the negative review maybe you guys will get it right the next time.I requested a wake up call at 6:15 AM. Never did they call and I missed the 6:30 AM shuttle as a result. I politely asked the shuttle driver who was standing around doing nothing at 6:45 AM if he could please take us to the airport that's a few minutes away. He refused in the most snug manor possible and seemed to take pleasure in f*cking up my morning. Basically, long story short... every staff member I encountered was rude, short and extremely blunt with me. In general theres a bad energy and overall negative vibe that surrounds this place. I will not be staying here again. Room was dirty and the bathtub clogged. Gross.My wife and I stayed at this hotel about a week ago. The amenities are very nice with a great atmosphere. We only had one big mishap with the shuttle pick up at the airport and we were well compensated for that issue.  All in all I highly recommend this hotel for a very comfortable stay!Kudos to the front dest staff (Andre) for going above and beyond and helping us out after a long day and getting rooms for us with a smile. He made our night. Thanks again Andre. Also the hostess (Dori) at the Clouds restaurant was the best! Thank you bothThe Crowne Plaza is an okay hotel.  The front desk staff was nice enough to allow me to check in early, although I was prepared to sit in the lobby while I dealt with some last minute emergencies.Unlike other hotels in the area, the advertised parking fee seemed ironic, as finding a place to part is about impossible.  On the other hand, either owing to the time of year, or perhaps day of the week, I wasn't charged.The glass elevators, with the inside shaped like a house rather than a box, gave a view of the courtyard, pool and dining area as it takes you to your floor.   Some rooms face the outside, and the parking lot and freeway, others opened to the inside courtyard.  The rooms have the standard hotel furniture, but are larger than usual and the amenities are nicer.  The fitness center was much better than most places with equipment that was both maintained and clean.The Crowne Plaza has a Friday's attached, so the hotel restaurant is only open for breakfast.  It has a nice buffet offering with more hot menu choices than comparable places.Eh, it's okay.The hotel is kind of cool, with the pool in the middle of the atrium and the rooms are okay.  Admittedly, my experience with the hotel is kind of tainted because I was brought here when my flight was delayed for ""mechanical issues"" in Saint Louis, and I missed my connecting flight (their fault, not mine.  Thus the free hotel room.)  So, I was able to have the hotel room for literally about 3 hours while I waited for the next flight.  (I didn't even get to take a shower...)The reason the hotel doesn't get 4 stars is because the front desk wasn't answering the phone at about 4 AM (when I needed to use the express checkout) and wasn't behind the desk when I wanted to use the normal checkout.  That, and (more importantly) when I was 10 minutes early to the lobby for the shuttle at 4 AM, my coworker and I had to raise a stink to get someone to take us to the airport because our seats were almost given away on the shuttle.In summary, other than some staff-related ""logistics"" issues, it's an okay hotel with surprisingly nice rooms.The rooms are pretty nice but that's outweighed by the ridiculous parking situation and the inconvenience of being located off Lindbergh (and therefore needing to play a u-turn game half the time).  The parking lot is too small and poorly lit.  I did NOT feel comfortable going to and from my car at night.  Half the time my room key didn't work in the automated key reader, which is apparently a known issue.Servers at breakfast were very friendly but the food just wasn't very good and the space was very poorly heated, considering one whole wall was windows.  Don't expect a variety if you're staying here for the week.  As for the room itself, it was large and the bed was comfortable.  No refrigerator though and I struggled with connecting to the wifi a couple of times.  Worst part was that I could not keep that room warm on a cold night.  The heat couldn't keep up with the large wall of windows, even with the drapes drawn closed.This is the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in. Our hotel room faced the atrium and the indoor pool. We were kept up by screaming children and woken up by them in the morning. The icing on the cake was someone using a power drill on the other side of our wall at 10:15 in the morning. The front desk was very nice and polite when I called in about the noise, but unfortunately that couldn't really fix the poor design of the hotel.Our room has a little indoor patio, but we weren't able to go out into it because the door was locked (I'm assuming this is because of the noise problem).We could hear our neighbors talking through the walls as well as people's conversations in the hallway.Throughout the night, music from the lobby kept us from sleeping well -- some sort of cheesy jazz music with really boomy bass.I could overlook the uncomfortable bed or the questionable cleanliness of the room, but the basic premise of a hotel is providing a place to sleep, and the lack of sound proofing made that impossible.No place nearby to eat except TGIF in the hotel and that closes at 11p. If you're a day sleeper bring extra duty ear plugs. All day nothing but slamming doors and banging on the walls with who knows what. Maids yelling back and forth and one even answered a personal call right in front of my room. Front desk was apologetic but it didn't do much to solve the problem.We chose this hotel due to the ""free"" parking for our vacation. Once we arrived our check in agent states we don't qualify for that since we used Expedia. Once I shows her our #funjetvacations form, we them were asked for payment. I reiterated to her it's pre-paid from Expedia she then figured it out. We finally get a room key, once we arrived to our room the key doesn't work. I then go back down to the front desk and tell her it's not working....she then states it my fault for having it next to my phone. We get I our room and the bathtub/shower is filled...I mean at least 15-20 black long hairs laying in the tub. It was disgusting. I call back down they move us to a new room which is acceptable. Storm comes through, their tvs go out #directv the restaurant #tgif tvs Re on the hotel isn't.  I ask why, front desk agent gets belligerent with me then asks if I want to talk to maintenance, I said no, then she say good night and Hangs up. As an #IHG member and frequent traveler this will be the last place I stay in #STL. Hopefully everyone will understand the #CustomerService here is awful. The only good thing was the service at #tgif. #awfulFront desk staff and transportation manager were helpful and knowable. The gentleman who checked us in was very funny. Parking was free. The shuttle was convenient. We didn't have to wait long, they took us to the airport where we purchased day passes for the metro, and took the subway everywhere we wanted to go. We got Chinese take-out one night and realized after we left that the restaurant that they didn't give us any disposable utensils. When we got back to the hotel, there were plastic folks, spoons, and plates for guests sitting at the front desk. That was awesome. The only thing I didn't like was that the internet was really really slow. It was free, but I couldn't do anything. I would say it was still a good stay overall.Hotel was close to the airport and the staff was very friendly, even suggesting a small Italian restaurant close to the property. The room was good sized and comfortable. The property also has a large indoor pool. When arriving, you may be put off to see paid parking but the room key is your pass. There is a TGIF in the hotel but we did not visit based on reviews. At first, my WiFi connection didn't work and I even tried the Ethernet cable offered on the desk as well. A quick look underneath the desk revealed a router screwed to the underside of the desk. Removed power and rebooted it, voila, connection was great. My room did not overlook the Atrium though, so not sure about noise levels in one of those rooms. Mine overlooked the expressway but it wasn't noisy enough to be of any issue.There are some positives, but I wouldn't stay here again (by choice)--the sheets/blankets on both beds were stained. Yuck!Anyway, for completeness...Positives:`- Timothy at the front desk was very fast and friendly, even though he was overwhelmed by the sudden influx of about 40 people who needed rooms because of a canceled flight at the airport (which was why I ended up staying here).- The atrium is quite pretty.- The glass elevators that look down on the atrium are nice.- Pets allowed, according to their website. For a fee, or something.- Fitness center and indoor pool. I didn't get a chance to try either out though.- Free coffee set up in the lobby for those of us catching the 4 am first shuttle out to the airport. Much appreciated.Negatives:- Sheets/blankets were stained. I don't want to know. - The alarm clock (Sony Dream something) took forever to figure out. And the buzzer was too faint to wake anyone up.- Wireless took several attempts to connect to. I was persistent though and eventually got on (to draft this review).- There was some intermittent buzzing I kept hearing...- The walls are not so great at filtering out noise from nearby rooms or the hallway. I could hear another room's alarm clock going off for a good few minutes.- The shampoo, conditioner, and lotion bottles were all less than half-full, so they don't really restock those..- Oh, and the bathtub hadn't been cleaned... definitely saw a bunch of hairs in there.- When I woke up at 2:45 am, there was an invoice stating I was being charged $10 for my dinner at TGIFriday's even though I had paid with a voucher, and the bartender who rang me up told me it was all taken care of. I had to get the charge removed when I checked out before grabbing the first shuttle (4 am) to the airport. That was pretty easy, at least.Most discouraging is the incredibly unusable wireless in room internet.  It simply doesn't allow for anything productive to get done.I went to the lobby in hopes to get better speed.  eh, somewhat faster but still discouraging.  TGI Friday's attached so that helps the fact that there isn't much around.I don't recommend.This place is simply poorly maintained. The wifi is utterly unusable. After more than a day back and forth with maintenance and offsite IT nothing. They moved us to another room where the wifi connected but still only worked a bit at a time.Other problems were that two separate room cards had trouble getting in and out of the parking lot. I had to call to get out during checkout. The first room had no fridge or microwave. The second room had both though it was an identical room as far as I can tell. The hotel looks nice, beds are comfortable, TV is nice, and I like the passive bathroom fan. The breakfast buffet which Expedia included was good, though if you get there at the wrong time you will have to wait a while for a seat, and they let a guy cut us because he threw a fit.I'll never stay here again, I need Internet and the lack of Internet made me miserable for the week I was there. It also made the business I was there to conduct nigh impossible. They acted as of this was a temporary problem but I found other reviews mentioning the same problems. I only ended up at this hotel when my original reservation ended up overbooked which is why I hadn't reviewed the place in advance. They get 1 star because it's apparent they aren't working to fix the wifi, or the parking meter, and this is the first time I've talked to front desk people who sounded so unhappy to help me. The first time I called down their tone was just so frustrated.The front desk staff are very friendly, and knowledgable. The Hotel is also very clean. However, it only deserves three stars. They do not offer complimentary breakfast and it's 13.00 to eat on the breakfast buffet.  For as much as the rooms are breakfast should be free. I've personally stayed at cheaper hotels that have free breakfast and it was a full spread of breakfast foods. Also, it seems a little unorganized there. In some parts of the hotel they have hand written signs posted on the wall. Also, when we checked in our front desk Representative charged us 20.00 for parking  which is unprofessional because the outside parking lot is under construction and the parking meter is not set up yet. Also we didn't receive a parking sticker or anything to distinguish us between a paid or a unpaid vehicle. Overall, it's an alright hotel but the management could make it a lot better.This Crowne looks like a glass pyramid from the road. Inside is a nice atrium, bar, restaurants, and pool area. The concierge floor does not look down to the atrium, so the rooms may be quieter when events crowd the atrium.The service and amenities are a step up as with all Crowne locations. While this Crowne is not as nice as some, it is certainly better than most hotels.Our traveling baseball team had a block of rooms reserved here. My son decided at the last minute to play in the tournament. Tried to add a room to the block and they wanted to more than double the rate of $88. I called the Marriott St. Louis Airport and they were happy to match the rate.Crown Plaze customer service SucksThe seventh floor of this hotel smells like a black and mild cigar factory, it is non smoking mind you. An alarm near the swimming pool went off for nearly an hour at 4AM... so much for getting any sleep.  The TGI Friday in this hotel is the worst restaurant I have ever eaten at and the staff there are completely useless,  although I doubt the hotel has anything to do with that. The Hotel feels old and dirty. I would have rather slept in my car and saved $130.","The good: +Very friendly staff +Given blankets our second night since roll in beds were taken +very clean hotel rooms and fitness center +Located close to the airport+Complimentary shuttle with experienced and professional drivers The bad:-Charged for self parking. $10 a night automatically added to your room fees. -Hotel was overbooked and took 20 minutes to find us a ""locked room""-All the roll in beds were taken our first night and second night. -Breakfast was not complimentary -No fan in the restroomA beat up crown.Crowne Plaza in St Louis airport is rated 4+ stars; not sure how they got there, but that sounds quite fishy to me. From the outside, the architecture may be attractive to some.As you get in, the lobby opens up into an atrium. As you walk further, you notice the pool on the left,the restaurant on the right and conference rooms straight ahead. Not surprisingly, their homepage emphasizes that aspect of the hotel. The devil is in the details as it is commonly said. Beyond the lobby lies a beat-up, old 3-star hotel, with dirty carpets, cheap 1 star shampoo, conditioner and cream; the cheapest toilet paper I have seen for a hotel of that category. A staff that is all too willing to charge you for anything or nothing. Don't even think about taking your breakfast back to your room without paying room service. The quality of their delicatessen is cheaper than what you can get a local grocery store (schnucks) right around the corner... The carpet is so dirty that my feet turned dark grey after walking bare-footed for one hour in the room. I stayed in a suite; so you would think for that price ($200 to $500/night off season), I would get something decent. Suites are usually equipped with a microwave, kitchenette, bathrobes, decent coffee, water bottles, but they did not have any of that.. There was a tiny fridge and coffee machine that was propably as old as the building. It's was least 20-30 old technology. Did I mention their 56 kbps internet connection? Got any work to do using a VPN? Forget it. You might as well go back to the airport or go to a local coffee shop.When the central heating or air conditioning kicks in, you get that buzzing sound all night. Outside, there is no where to walk. I could not get a decent coffee either at their restaurant (if you can call it that. It is dressed up like a restaurant, but it is in fact a cheap cafetaria). Taking the stairs is always revealing and a good gauge of the management operating the building. I encourage you to go up and down the stairs. If you like their stairwell, you'll probably enjoy their rooms. They crowned themselves with a 4.3/5 rating on their website claiming that the reviews come from REAL GUESTS. How suspicious is this? It is really laughable. There are probably enough hungry people out there willing to get a perk for writing the 5 star non-sense.We had a very good stay. Cool room overlooking the atrium and indoor pool, but little noise and no chlorine smell. Room service is pricey, but there were many convenience restaurants nearby (we got room service anyway, since it's fun!) All the staff I encountered were cheerful and welcoming.Staff was friendly and even haver free buffet breakfast and bumped me up to the lounge level. The hotel may need a little updating, but the rooms were quite nice with modern LG televisions and the beds were comfortable. The windows only had sheer curtains though and highway noise was audible. WiFi was pretty quick and I even watched a standard definition movie over it.Julia Rosen at front desk had a big attitude. I stood there in front of her and she still chose to answer three phone calls, one of which was to make a reservation for April. That's a month away! And i am standing right in front of you, patron! trying to check-in to my room!!! Why would you prioritize answering the phone? Finally when she decided she had the time to check me in she gave me a roll of the eyes. Not a good first impression of The Crowne Plaza MO. David the custodian/handyman was very friendly though! He saw me standing there, he came to change a lightbulb and asked if i had been helped and if there was any way he could help me. Very sweet older gentleman.No dogs allowed.Room was comfortable, as was bed.Television was old school, round from the 90s. HBO was a plus.Shower pressure and temperature was great.Plenty of free parking though it gets full come evening and then it's tough to find a spot near an entrance to the hotel (might have to walk a bit).TGIF restaurant inside hotel (if you like overpriced American fast food).Minutes from the airport.On-call shuttle whenever you need it.I am glad we were forced to switch Crowne Plaza hotels midway through our trip, from the Clayton hotel to this one. This hotel was so modern, clean, and spacious, we were super impressed! First of all, the place is massive. There is a huge glass ceiling that makes the whole lobby, conference, pool, and restaurant area feel like it's a big atrium. It's neat to have the natural light andThis place is NOT for a weary traveller!  You cannot even get a nap during the day due to the noise created by kids in the indoor pool!The staff is uncaring and not professional!  If you try to park a large vehicle such as a bus the parking lot is NOT too good at all!Of all hotels I have stayed at I would rate this one at the bottom of the scale.The Crowne does it again! You may have seen my review on the Crowne Plaza near Cleveland or you may have not.  But rest assured (in a fantastic bed) that I had an outstanding stay in both! The entire staff was extremely friendly, very eager to please, and showed a true dedication to their job and hotel guests. They offer a complimentary shuttle that will take you anywhere within a reasonable distance - I used this benefit several times and really enjoyed my friendly conversations with each of the drivers. The housekeeping staff did a great job as well. Conveniently, there is a TGIFridays attached to the hotel that did a outstanding job as well. My server each night, Natalie, was accurate, friendly, and extremely attentive.  As a result of the consistency between all of my stays at multiple Crowne Plazas, and my recent disappointments with other chains, I will be making them my first choice going forward. Additionally, this location is in the process of renovating rooms so it can only get better. And no, the renovations didn't bother me at all. No sounds, no mess, no nothing except the end of a hallway blocked off which wasn't a inconvenience at all. Again, outstanding.My husband and I stayed here for a little reunion for his side of the family in January 2010. What a nice hotel! The lobby and common areas are gorgeous, and the rooms were nice, but a little outdated. I see from other reviews that they're updating the rooms, so that will be a plus. The beds were pretty comfortable. The pool and hot tub were great...indoors, as obviously we would NOT be swimming in Missouri in the middle of winter.We loved having the TGI Friday's there in the hotel...we met a friend for drinks one night, and our bartender was very friendly. We ate with his family two nights in a row since there was snow and ice...we didn't feel like leaving the hotel. It was very convenient, the food was great, and our waiters were great. The breakfast from the hotel was also very good. Had a lot of fun staying here!Great customer service at the front desk.  Natalie was awesome and she made check-in super easy!  Will definitely be back!I have been coming here for about eight years in conjunction with a yearly conference. I have been an attendee as well as on the event planning team. The Crowne Plaza team is very easy to work with, from the staff with which we negotiate contracts to the staff ""on the ground"" when our conference was in full swing. We usually get four conference rooms all weekend, plus have a banquet on site. The rooms are perfect and the staff is very flexible. We rent outside equipment, have musical events, rearrange furniture, ask for additional tables and chairs, and require room freshen-ups between sessions. Everyone that we deal with is friendly and attends to our needs quickly. The guest room rates they give us are competitive, and the rooms are modern and clean. The only issue is getting there. We have a lot of out of town people who drive, and getting into the parking lot (particularly from northbound Lindbergh) is very tricky and often we have people call us to say that they are lost - that they can see the hotel, but can't get into it. I took off one star for that.The pool, atrium, and other room amenities are great, and our attendees love them. I highly recommend the Crowne Plaza for your next conference.Here for a conference. Reasonably clean, close to the airport. Food for our event was great. Meeting areas were nice and roomy. Overall good place,  The room rates for people staying for the conference were very good.We stayed here over the T-giving weekend and we felt well taken care of. The atrium with the waterfall gave the place a fresh airy feeling. The rooms are clean and the restaurants (though limited through the holiday weekend) was good. Yes this hotel is out by the airport, but we found it accessible (once you found the road entrance) for driving around St Louis to see the sites. They do have shuttle service (to the airport and nearby Metro stops). They also have a stay-n-park option for those early or late flights for locals. The front desk staff was friendly and answered all our questions about where to go and what to do.The breakfast buffet was good but not overwhelming with hot selections. it was part of our package which included breakfast each morning. I ended up stopping by Friday's every night for drinks and food and it was a typical fun Friday's with friendly bartenders and wait staff.Hall way and room smelled. Bed OK. Front desk no help. Driver rude and possibly drinking. Bathroom not cleaned and outdated. room not cleaned well. There are much better hotel near by, only use this one as a LAST RESORT!bummer I checked in late at night and u packed.  walked into, bathroom and a washcloth was hanging from shower head and hair on the sink. hope they changed the sheetsStay at this hotel at your own risk.  Unauthorized charges on my card. Didn't get any room service or any pay movies....nasty attitude in accounting when I called.  They reverse the charges or I challenge them at my bank.  Again, I strongly advise you do not stay here.I was just here for a 2-day conference. I didn't stay the night but I spent something like 16 hours in their ballroom over the past weekend.  This is a run of the mill mid-range hotel by the airport.  It was clean.  The staff was friendly and helpful, yet unobtrusive.  The conference services were decent (fresh but weak coffee and dry danish all morning, etc).  The indoor pool is inexplicably part of the lobby, which makes everything kind of smell like chlorine.  You can sit on the (indoor) patio of the TGIFriday's and watch people swim and take a dip in a hot tub about 10 feet away.  Oh, did I mention that there is a TGIFriday's in the hotel, as well as their own restaurant AND a bar?  I suppose if you're looking for a clean, reliably generic room near the airport, you could certainly do worse than this.Where do I start? Bed was uncomfortable. The air conditioner sucked. It was quiet but I had it on full blast and the room never really got cold. It wasn't warm but I like my room really cold. Room service was way overpriced. Go somewhere for breakfast. TGIF food was ok. Oh yeah the tv was from the 80's. Wi-fi was free but annoying cause you had to enter the stupid password every time you used it!!!!This is an older hotel, not really near anything. It does have a TGIFridays inside of it, but I don't know if that is good or bad. The rooms are spacious but the beds and televisions are old. The room seemed dingy and the chair in the room had stains on the fabric. There is an indoor pool but it is in a large lobby and makes the whole lobby smell like chlorine. There are better options for hotels near the airport, skip this one.TV's, carpet, room interiors and wall paper seem like they  are from 80's. Towels provided were tattered. Breakfast is not included in the room rate and was very expensive. TGI Friday was bland and below average. Only positives are proximity to airport and brings back memories from past, that is from 80's. Who wants to live in past though....","great hotel to stay at, check out the atrium!!!!?If you can get into the parking lot, you'll enjoy yourself. The entrance is hard to see, and you can only get to it from one side of the highway. We stayed here for a family wedding, and the room was very nice. The pool was uncrowded and our kids had fun.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-st-louis-frontenac-saint-louis,Hilton St. Louis Frontenac,3.0,$$,47,"Enjoyed my stay here on first floor - spacious new rooms (must have recently remodeled, can still smell fresh paint in my room). Also a short walking distance to the local schnicks supermarket, starbucks/froyo, panera, and plaza frontenac mall.Overpriced laundry, lots of rude staff - good restaurant onsite, and fairly large rooms.I really did like this hotel but some things made this place a Nikki meh. It smelled all over the hotel like someone had spilled cheap perfume. The scent was overwhelming. I did like my room, the staff, and the main restaurant which I had the breakfast buffet. If the fragrance hadn't been so strong I would have enjoyed it.I had to stay in this hotel several times because of work. This hotel is disgusting. Housekeeping and management should be replaced. Spoke with a manager and an assistant manager about housekeeping issues. Nothing was improved. My room had not been vacuumed for several days, and the 9th and last day I was there, after the two complaints, it was still not vacuumed. During one of my stays, a huge cockroach was in my room on the third floor. This is what happens when a room is not properly cleaned. One time I asked for water and these two girls knocked loudly at my door and in an arrogant manner gave me the water and walked away with an attitude.  They need to clean their utensils, plates, and coffee mugs better instead of placing them on the table with stains.  The hotel appearance from outside is nice but very misleading. TO HOTEL MANAGEMENT - please don't bother writing your comments to this post, just fix the problems you have.I don't know how a hotel can have roaches the size of my thumb and continue to be called a Hilton.I stepped on a roach.The sheets for the pullout were placed in the bag while still wet. Very unpleasant smell.The robe had red/brown stains.When I checked out and told the front desk there was a roach in my room her response was. ""Ewww, have a nice day. Bye.""Stayed here two nights for a friends wedding. Neat and welcoming hotel. It's one of those hotels that are older in construction but pretty much make up for it by good renovation and modernization. Since I opted for the wifi+breakfast package, I was given a room in their 3rd floor, dubbed ""executive floor"" since it had this amazing place called Executive Lounge. They had light breakfast, cereal, fruits, milk, sodas, coffee, all day snacks and get this, night time desserts....all included in the breakfast package! This truly enhanced the experience. Other notable points: - the gym was spacious and one of the better equipped ones that I have come across in such hotels. - there's a Panera Bread , interestingly marked St. Louis Bread right next door.- a grocery store across the road looked convenient although I didn't need anything. - free airport shuttle is a good service, but they can take their time to come and pick you. The rates were good too so I would happily stay here again or recommend it to friends.Arrived late at night,we think this must be the smallest Hilton hotel in the world?No elevator so the baggage man has to lift the baggages. The front desk man is nice and helpful, but the hotel room is so old,we can't believe this is a ""Hilton"".Old hotel that is under renovation.  Rooms are dated, but staff is super friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcome!   The fitness center is great and reason enough to stay here.  The location is walking distance to lots of restaurants and shopping.  The grocery store across the street is great for a snack as well.Very charming older building.  I stayed in the executive floor. Room was nice and bed was comfortable.  Bathroom was in good shape.  Despite some users saying the construction was better and more sound proof, I beg to differ.  I had a con joining rooms in both sides and could here the rude person next door making calls at 11:30 at night.  Also heard the same individual waking up, showering, and clamering around at 4:40 in the morning.Hotel staff was very nice.  My only interaction was the check in and check out.Gym was superb.  One of the best gyms I have seen while traveling.  Brand new equipment and lots of it.Pretty good menu for brunch. They had an array of cheeses, meats and breads. Omelette stations, fresh waffles and even baked chicken arm others items to decide from. The price was a bit on the high end. 30 bucks per person for the buffet. This is a special kind of place only doe special occasions.This is an older, more run down property. Usually short-staffed, especially the restaurant. Staff occasionally displays an attitude (the wrong kind). We've stayed here about a half dozen times, but seriously looking for something better in west county. Alas, the choices are slim :(I experienced terrible service and waited 3 hours to check into my room even after check in began. Very nice appearance that makes up for the not so charming service.The price seemed right on this hotel during a holiday weekend. Overall decent place to crash after a wedding. Pros- Immediately located off the highway so getting to and from the hotel and wedding location was a breeze. - Friendly staff and prompt morning room service.- Style is a bit outdated, but the room was clean and bed was comfy. Cons- If possible, avoid getting the interior rooms with ""windows"" that looked out into the hallway. This style of room was noisy and you could hear people walking down the hall and talking in normal voice volumes. For a light sleeper, this would make it hard to get rest. - They need to replace their shower curtains. The one in my bathroom smelled like mildew. Ick.Had my first stay here last week for 3 nights while in town for meetings.  A few of my coworkers were grumbling about it, so I had low expectations, but honestly, there was only one hiccup in the whole process for me.  Other than that, the staff is superb, very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was good every morning, and the room was big, clean, quiet, and comfortable.  I tend to like older properties.  Yes, they need some TLC, but the rooms tend to be bigger and the building overall is built more solidly and quieter.  My only issue was when I checked in, my room was stifling hot and the air conditioner showed absolutely no signs of life.  They made me wait until almost 4 to check in.  Are you telling me the maid cleaned the room when it was this hot?  I'm shocked they didn't have the A/C already on to cool it off.  I had to call the front desk because my unit wouldn't even come on.  The maintenance dude arrived about 15 minutes later and had to crawl underneath it to do something to it, and then the thermostat on the wall was working.   Soon the room was the temperature of a meat locker which is the way I like it.The A/C units are covered with a wooden cabinet to make them look nicer.  Well, when the handyman was working on mine, he must not have pushed the unit all the way back up or something because it chose about 2:30 a.m. to fall forward, hit the floor, and damn near make me wet the bed.  I'm sure the inhabitant of the room underneath mine was none too happy either.  That was not cool.But I'm a self-sufficient gal, so I slowed my heart rate, got out of bed and put the cabinet back over the unit, and shoved a chair up against it so no more of those falling off the wall shenanigans would take place.Overall I would definitely go back again.  The location is great as well with several good restaurants within walking distance, a grocery store across the street, and a mall &amp; movie theater across the other street.Nice and comfy place to stay.  Friendly staff. Gorgeous decor in the front lobby. Close enough to downtown.  And far enough away too. If you want peace and quiet.  Easy on and off to freeway. And a nice grocery store across the streetOld. Badly in need of renovation. Very musty and smelly throughout. I am a Hilton gold member but will not stay here again. Courteous staff.Gorgeous hotel decor. It seems it was an independent hotel or manor at one point because it has too much character and unique qualities to be a typical Hilton hotel. We had a king junior suite. There was a lot of space but for some reason the bathroom was extremely small compared to the rest of the junior suite. We came here for a dear friend's event. There is a barber there but not sure of hours. The room service closed at 11pm on a Saturday night :(   They provided complimentary toiletries which was great. It had some old, broken down features but not too bad. It has a mall across from it with a Neiman Marcus and other high end shops. There is also a sort of grocery store near there across the road. It has free parking and you will not be guaranteed a room in the main hotel building and they have other buildings with other rooms in it. Free wifi in the room but not outside or in the banquet rooms. It was nice overall.Nice older style hotel in a nice area. Nice restaurants close by, with a supermarket across the street. Friendly and helpful staff. Room service is inexpensive considering it's a nice hotel. I would stay again.The hotel is so promising from the outside into the front entry way.  Once you enter this named propoerty you really really feal like you are in for a treat.  Man was I wrong.  I will say the staff was the only redeeming part of the stay.As i left the classicly decorated front desk to find my room I encountered some frayed carpet and maitnence opportunities.  This was not of real concern till I enetered my room.  What a disaster.....Good:Bed was pretty comfortableStaffBad:Hair in the shower - looked like someone shaved a chiapetA/C - did not workRips in the rugsBad weight roomOverall dirty everywhere.In my opinion this hotel needs some love and a face lift before I will go back.Loved staying here. The location (15 minutes to downtown) was great. It's a beautiful hotel and the staff was very friendly. The workout room was also very spacious with more accessories than your typical Hilton. Highly recommend.","This is my ""go to"" hotel when I visit my family in St. Louis.  I like it since it has a great location for easy access to everything, has an excellent staff, and is generally a clean, safe hotel.  I also like the beds as they sleep well.  The rooms are generally quiet and restful, the bathrooms exactly what you would expect from a Hilton property.The secret to staying here is accessing the hotel on the side where the traffic signal is - it makes for a much easier entrance and exit.  There is a food store across the street and a neat German restaurant across the street, too.I noticed that the televisions receive the high definition signals and a vast array of cable channels that will make those staying a while happy.  My Hilton Radio did not work, but I didn't really need it since I used the wireless to access my music services.  All in all, I had a great visit here and would certainly come back again.Extremely disappointed with this hotel.  Paid extra to stay a little closer to our destination and was expecting something nicer.  We ended up in their north annex which was outside of the main hotel overlooking the highway exit ramp (although room was soundproofed nicely.  The carpet was worn and stained and the annex lobby was musty smelling. Ick.  The beds were comfy though.  After staying many nights at Hampton Inns we thought the Hilton would be step up.  Oh well, we love Hampton Inns so much we will stick to those.  No free breakfasts at this place which is another minus.Short staffed, poor service and excuses in the bar/restaurant, over thirty minutes waiting for a steak that never came, very poor service for a conference hotel.Maybe  Nerium should contract somewhere else?The best thing I can say about this Hilton is LOCATION LOCATION!  Right next to  highway 40 (or is it 64?) It's on Lindbergh so if you chose not to hit the highway you could zip up and down Lindbergh to get to a lot of places. It's across the street from a grocery store and next door to Plaza Frontenac with all of its stores and eateries.The staff is very nice, check in was a breeze, the room was a nice size, and a nice pool right in front of the hotel.  That may or may not sit right with some people because anyone from Lindbergh can see you as they drive past.  There is a nice bar inside, a restaurant, and meeting and ballrooms galore if you have an event.  So why just a 3 star?It is not a very modern Hilton.  They charge for their WiFi unless you are a club member (no biggie, most hotels do that now).  The beds are nice enough but the room and the decor is so dated and old.  I had to call housekeeping as one of the glasses in our room next to the ice bucket was broken - but still sitting there with it's ""protective"" cap on it. WTH?Parking is a bit weird too as it is pretty much all over the grounds and there is one garage.  We had a server in the restaurant who was not too with it that day as well.  Wiped off the table with whatever was in/on that rag and it left a less than pleasant aroma.  Our breakfast included juice but we had to flag down another server to get it as ours went missing on us.  Perhaps it was just our turn to have a hotel with some problems, but it wouldn't stop me from going back and staying.  I'd just eat breakfast someplace else.First off, the staff is great, they couldn't be any better.The problem, though, is that they are working in a hotel that is straight out of 1973 or so.  The whole place kind of needs a reboot to bring it into the current century.  When you see the Hilton sign, you kind of expect a certain standard, and this place doesn't live up to that (other than the staff as mentioned.  They are first class Hilton all the way).In some ways, I kind of feel sorry for the staff because they deserve a nicer place in which to be so friendly!Location wise, it isn't really all that great but isn't all that awful.  There are some dining options nearby but if you have business downtown STL, you are probably better off at another hotel closer in.  The area of this hotel is suburban/residential for the most part...so if you are looking for Strip Mall Takeout Chinese, you are in luck.It isn't awful, if this place was a Holiday Inn or Red Roof Inn, it would be 5 stars.  But judged through the Hilton lens, it need some work.Most of the  time when I travel for work, I don't really have a choice in my accommodations, but I am always pleasantly surprised with what our travel services department comes up with.  On a recent trip to St. Louis I found myself at the Frontenac Hilton.When we pulled up to the entrance, I liked the fact that it didn't look like a conventional hotel.  The entrance had a large foyer which reminded me of an entrance to an old fashioned estate home.  There were many different hallways and rooms around the place.  I didn't find this disturbing, but more of an adventure to locate areas that I needed.  Like the bar.My room was just fine with a huge and very comfortable bed.  I sleep on a Tempur-Pedic mattress due to multiple back issues.  I was a little concerned that I would not sleep well and wake up in pain.  However, the bed was just perfect.  There was a little coffee maker in the room which provided me with a nice jolt to start my day.  The room wasn't large, but it really didn't need to be since all I was doing was sleeping, bathing, and heading out to meetings.All the folks I interacted with during my stay were polite and helpful.  The only small glitch was the surely bartender.  After checking in, I headed out to the bar area, which is quite large, and parked myself at the bar, next to an associate for a beer before we were to meet others in our group for drinks and dinner.  The bartender made a comment that, you got your name on your lapel... Yes, I was wearing a name tag since my company requested that we do.  For some reason this somewhat bothered him.  He made more than one comment about it.  It was a little awkward.  If I find myself in St. Louis again, I would  gladly stay here again.A bit dated, but truly beautiful in it's design.  Great housekeeping, a fully rennovated and excellent 24/7 gym, and conveniently located near major access points, a grocery store, and a swanky mall with movie theater.  Sure it isn't The Four Seasons, but at 1/2 the price I think the bang for the buck is on the side of the Hilton.Boo on this place!! I'm a Hilton Platinum member and they completely botched my stay. HORRIBLE!!!!The confluence of an evening event and an early morning appointment led to a stay here. The location is central, with bonus stars given for being across the street from Plaza Frontenac, with its bounty of stores and restaurants. I have stayed at a fair number of Hilton's standard properties and this location runs true to form, though it does seem that there are more ballrooms and meeting rooms lining the halls at this particular Hilton. The hotel rooms themselves are serviceable, though the windows could have benefited from some additional insulation as I could feel occasional drafts of cold air seeping through. Check-in/check-out were routine and there were no hiccups on this stay, always a plus in my book.Gorgeous entrance. Nice but not accomodating staff. That's it.I called to verify our reservation, it's there. I also ask if there is an airport shuttle. Yes. Our plane lands at 11pm and I call them for pickup. They tell me they stop running the shuttle after 11pm. I go to check in and ask for their airport shuttle to pick me up at 6 am. They tell me can't do that either, shuttle starts at 7 am. You've got to be kidding me Hilton. They tell me they have otherwise an 8 mi radius for the shuttle to take to other places. Have to go somewhere at 2pm 1 mi away, let's hope the shuttle isn't ""on break"" at yhat time.This am I am awoken to some wonderful conversation as the walls are that thin. You can hear every single word.Bed is soft, shower is ok, nothing extravagant. I'm not even done w my stay here and am not impressed. They probably put all the money into making that ridiculous entrance and stopped caring after they lured customers in.The place might not really deserve one star-- the staff is great and the beds are ok, and the gym is pretty good. But for the price, it is a miserable value. The hotel hasn't really had any updates in the 20 years or so since it became a Hilton.  Much of the furniture and by the looks of it, the carpet dates back to the 80's. The windows are drafty, rooms are dark, and the layout of the hotel is a mess. Hilton really needs to invest in this location if they are to get by on anything other than the location.We were able to get a room last minute because we were disappointed in the Sheraton across town.  The lobby is beautiful, front desk very friendly and helpful, and the room was nice.  We usually get room upgrades because my husband is a Hilton Honors member, but they apologized that all upgrade rooms were taken (not a problem, considering we had just booked at 9:30 that night!)The rooms were clean and very quiet, and the fitness facility was also nice.Not quite a Hilton.  This property is dated and worn.  Staff is nice enough .  First room had blood spatter on back of bathroom door, hair on the shower stall wall and a curly hair on one of the bath towels.  Front desk was kind enough to get me another room.  The rooms were both two room suites, a sitting area and a bedroom.  The sitting room was virtually unusable because the refrigerator was so loud that you couldn't talk or watch tv and the sofa was so worn out that I expected to see it on the curb with a ""free sign on it"".  Seriously, was unable to sit on it because the cushions and frame were so worn.  There was an upholstered chair in the sitting room, but it was so hard that it was unusable.  The desk chair was nice.  The fitness center was nice but only one of the treadmills was fully operational.  The neighborhood is nice and there is a terrific shopping center next door.I recently stayed in this hotel. What a complete let down.  Save your money and go to Best Western. You will get better service and more amenities.  This place is a complete joke and the free ""executive"" breakfast was so very sad.  If you want a nice place to stay near St Louis, go to the Sheratan.Compared to the standard Hilton properties (actual Hiltons, not Doubletrees, Hamptons, etc.) this place is not going to blow anyone's mind.  That being said, its a really nice property with a beautiful entrance and sort of a 'campus' feel with different buildings for ballrooms, the restaurant, etc.  The executive lounge is staffed at all times and serves booze along with the usual free drinks, breakfast, apps, and desserts.  The ladies working there were very nice and attentive during my visits.  The coffee in the lounge isn't Starbucks (unless they didn't advertise it), but its still a tasty and relatively strong brew (100x better then the stuff in the rooms). The rooms were nice and clean and it was always easy to find a parking spot (free) near the entrance of the building.  My only complaint was that the shower curtains are not waterproof, so if you have the shower head pointed towards them your entire bathroom floor will be covered with water when you get out.Otherwise, its a nice Hilton with a bit of flair and solid service.I don't live too far from this hotel so because of that reason I have never had an excuse to go in to it until recently for a school function.It is a nice hotel, presentation is nice and the staff was very attentive and whatnot to make sure our function ran smoothly.  I do have to say I wasn't too much impressed with the food they served us, esp for the price that our parents paid to have it.  It was pretty simple setting and food service wasn't spectacular.  They weren't clear on when dinner was going to be served and personally if the wait staff is supposed to serve the wine, they should be more attentive and be at the table once someone is looking at the bottle.I do have to say that from general looks of the hotel you don't realize just how big it is until you have to drive around to see the ballroom you're supposed to be in.  Then you'll see there's lots of other stuff on the grounds of the hotel as well.I would like to see other parts of the hotel...one day.From the moment I checked in the staff was condescending and sobbish.  I was hassled for refusing to give a credit card even though it was on a company paid trip.  I was then told my rewards wouldn't be honored because I didn't give them the CC.  I have never had hilton staff be so rude.  The hotel is very old and dated.  They spray the rooms with fabreeze to cover up the musty odor that is present just about everywhere.  If this hotel wasn't chosen for me for work I would never come back.I found this to be a great facility.  A little different than most Hilton properties, but I thought it was mostly a good thing!It is definitely a 'spread out' property.  My room was in a different building than the front desk, and there were several places to park (including a covered garage).  There is dining on-site, as well as an old-fashioned barbershop (I haven't needed one of these for 20+ years), but if you don't shave your own head, I guess this is pretty cool!This would definitely be a great facility for an event - wedding, conference, etc.I liked it.  Definitely different, but in a good way.I flew in for a business meeting and had a pleasant stay. The staff was warm and courteous. The room was clean and well-appointed. The room service breakfast was pretty greasy but that might just be a normal occurrence. (I prefer light healthy fare). Great value. Free WiFi. I would stay here again!I think this place's nadir was in the 80s - things need freshening and updating in the common areas.  I have not stayed here, but I will say that the grill does solid sandwiches, an afterthought at most places like this.  And, it was reasonable, and there are not many of those choices in this neck of the woods.  That bumps it up to 4 stars.","I stayed here for a family weekend recently and overall it's a nice hotel. There were some mix-ups with hotel rooms and the suite we were supposed to have (in order to have a private common room for the 8 of us) was given away. Meh. The rooms we did end up getting were spacious with lots of seating area. We were also out on a floor with an ""Executive Suite"" so basically a decent snack room for the floor. We stayed in the main building but there are several surrounding buildings which could make it annoying if you need to leave a building to get to the restaurant for breakfast. The fitness room was in one of the surrounding buildings, but a short walk from the main building. Fitness center is pretty small but has all the basics - treadmills, weights, etc. I don't see a lot of people using this though (only 2 people there on a Saturday). Parking was free which was nice since we had our own cars. However there were two events happening when we were there, so you are battling for spots with people not actually staying there. There is a grocery store and a high end shopping mall across the street. It is also right off of Interstate 64 which makes it easy to come in and out of the downtown area. Overall a decent experience.3 1/2 stars is probably a more accurate rating.  The hotel itself is nice.  The rooms were well sized and well kept.  The pool was a major plus (two kids). Location was so-so, it is about 15 minutes to downtown St. Louis and the hotel is right off Interstate 64.However, given the quality of the hotel and the reasonable price, I gave 4 stars.If you don't mind a 15-20 minute drive to most major St. Louis attractions and you want a good dollar value I would recommend it.  If you want walkability and price is not a big deal I would recommend downtown hotels.This hotel is not worthy of the Hilton name. The entire property is in desperate need of an update.I just returned from a convention at this lovely hotel.  It's a state convention with nearly 300 people in attendance. We ate in the hotel restaurants and also had food prepared and served at our breakfast, lunch, and dinner meetings.  We have yearly conventions--one in the northern part of Illinois, one central, and one in southern IL or St. Louis area.  This was the best hotel of all!  Food was fabulous! For once we had enough staff to serve us so that one table wasn't eating dessert while the table at the other side of the room was being served a salad.  Hotel rooms were clean and had comfortable beds.  Meeting rooms were set to our specifications--and when we had issues with temperature, all we had to do was mention it to one of the friendly staff readily available in the hall and it was addressed.  Whenever we passed a hotel worker in the hall or on the elevator, we were greeted with a smile and polite, ""Is everything okay with your visit?""or something along those lines.  I plan to go back with my husband or friends and stay at this hotel--conveniently located across from an upscale mall.  If we choose to take Amtrak from Northern IL suburbs, we can get off at the Kirkland station and the hotel offers a shuttle to their door. I think the hotel has addressed all of the complaints that were addressed in other comments, because I saw none of them.Really old Hotel and poorly laid out...It's a little confusing to navigate at first with multiple elevators.  The rooms are averagely small, and nothing really worth mentioning.  The bar is not too bad and serve a limited menu, but poorly staff.  The restaurant closes up really early and the staff are not friendly about it at all.Rooms are clean and food was decent (i ordered the ravioli), they also helped me find a late night spot to order from on one of the nights when the kitchen had closed, which was very nice.  The hotel bartender is sweet and the prices are VERY reasonable. I also ended up having an eye infection and needed a special kind of solution, which they got for me from the gift store. I don't know what the rate normally is at this hotel, so I can't tell if it was reasonable or not--- I was here for a wedding and had a group rate. The only other thing that was a little frustrating was the gentleman at the front desk. He wasn't overtly rude but just not particularly friendly, and a bit standoffish --which is not something an east coast gal would normally complain about when visiting St. Louis. Lastly, and this is not a big deal, but the elevators were gross. Considering there is a nice fountain outside and the inside is well kept the elevators were really out of place. Regardless though, all in all a good stay and they provide a complimentary shuttle to and from the airport every hour!So, ok this is not a New York Hotel. If you're a New Yorker traveling to the Chesterfield area lower your expectations stat. The Hilton Frontenac is basically off the highway and across the street from a large strip mall. Not thrilling. The entry way has a big old chandelier hanging in it which only serves to heighten the expectation that you probably shouldn't have had from the beginning. The layout is really odd with certain areas of entrance and egress not really panning out which I learned the hard way, Frontenac style.So, the cheery front desk guy gave me my room key card and a map. He did the whole ""You Are Here"" circle and pen pointed the path to my room. I, being just off of a flight and having only fifteen minutes to freshen up before leaving for my meeting didn't really listen to chatty Cathy. Instead - eyes glazing over perma-grin intact - I quickly traded in what would prove to be valuable nuggets of information for the opportunity to think about how I could simply find it on my own by reading the signs once this dude stopped babbling. I'm on the second floor. That's really all I need to know. So, I thanked my kind clerk and exited stage left for the elevator first briskly passing under not only the Dynasty chandelier (I waved to Blake and Crystal) but also under a South Fork style balcony (I winked at JR and Sue Ellen) with sweeping staircase. I just don't get this place. I dragged ass into the elevator and began my assent to 2. What's this? These room numbers don't make sense? The fake fireplace with fake fire in it was burning oh so bright (not so much crackling) at one in the afternoon but my room was nowhere in sight. What's that? I think I hear someone calling my name. I look down from South Fork to see that same cheery clerk waving me back onto the elevator. I cannot get to my room from this part of the second floor. I had gotten into the wrong elevator. Drat! I was weary and weight with luggage. Geez, this is so stupid! ""Sorry Mammmm!"" exclaimed front desk guy. No problem, grumble, grumble. Why does it smell like dog? Grumble, grumble.I finally make it to my room way-way-way back in the hotel and it's well, ok. Pretty standard room with two beds, television, coffee and tea machine, A/C but NO mini bar. It was clean, didn't smell funny and held the promise of a quiet and comfortable nights sleep. I slept like a baby. The bed was very comfortable, as were the pillows - not too lofty, not too flat. It was freezing, however, and though the temp could have been a spoiler I just grabbed an extra down comforter off of the spare bed and got to snoozing. Turns out the working temperature gauge for the A/C was on the wall and was not the fracking foogazi on the unit. So even though I turned it down it never changed the temperature in the room. Oh well. Thank goodness for extra bedding. In the AM my bill was under the door. I had an early call so I skipped breakfast, paid my bill quickly and peaced out of the Frontenac. The staff made sure a car services was waiting out front for me to take me to work which was great.Overall, I just don't get it. This poor baby just has a severe case of the blahs.The Blahs:* Not a first choice hotel.* No personality*Staff needs a make-over (somebody dial up A.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-st-louis-downtown-at-the-gateway-arch-saint-louis-2,Hampton Inn St. Louis-Downtown At the Gateway Arch,4.5,$$,54,"Ok, this begins with location, location, location. Right next to sports arenas and entertainment options, I can't imagine a better setup. Hampton Inn amenities, but in a classic downtown hotel style, which to me is the best of both worlds. Can't imagine there will be another choice for me in Downtown St. Louis!Nice clean hotel directly in the heart of downtown St. Louis. When we first arrived we were greeted very nicely our room was cleaned above 100%. The hotel is right across from a hotel/casino &amp; plenty of eateries. I would stay @ this location once again. I was a very happy &amp; pleased customer. I have already referred someone to this facility.Amazing location. Good price. Great amenities and top-notch customer service. Very clean. Would definitely return to this hotel again. Lots of great establishments are walkable from this location. The Metro is also nearby.Really enjoyed our stay! This is the perfect location downtown and walking distance everywhere. Check in was easy and the front desk gave us plenty of suggestions on places to eat and things to do, some of which we did. Breakfast every morning and views of the arch. No complaintsOur stay at the Hampton Inn Downtown St. Louis location was a treat. Wonderful staff, spacious rooms, plentiful amenities -- even a view of the St. Louis Arch!The staff at this particular hotel were fantastic, though the stand out was a fellow named Andrew. He was working the front desk most of our stay and provided exceptional service, great entertainment recommendations, and even talked some local history. He was able to direct us toward some great restaurants, watering holes, and night life spots. He also set us up with some complimentary credits at the nearby casino. What a guy! The recommendations were especially useful as the Hampton Inn downtown is fantastically located. We were able to walk to find most everything we wanted, and even the couple spots we needed to drive to were easy to hit as the hotel is right off the highway.With that said, the hotel is also connected to a great bar/restaurant (a convenience I always appreciate). The Tigin Irish pub offers delicious food (traditional Irish dishes, but also above-par American pub fare), Guinness on tap, and a great atmosphere; there was a group of musicians playing traditional irish music on the night of our arrival. Feel like staying in? They also offer room service.Other amenities include complimentary breakfast, a business center, large pool and hot tub, and even a 24-hr game room (I'm a sucker for pinball!).Great hotel, great room, great location, but the standout is the staff. Highly recommended.Nice place with nice rooms. It's a bit pricey but that's too be expected downtown. There are tons of great restaurants within walking distance and the view is nice. My experience with the staff has been wonderful. They are very friendly and helpful. Parking seems secure as well. Cable and wifi in the rooms!We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn Downtown St. Louis. The entire hotel was extremely clean, and the staff was very helpful. However, location is  key in a big city, and this hotel had it. The highlight of our stay was the view. We had an unobstructed vista of the St. Louis Arch, which was just blocks  from our room! We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting St. Louis.Best thing about this hotel is the location.  It is old and a bit tired.  The hot tub was out of service the two nights we were there.  We left at 8:30 and returned at 1:00. Our room had not been serviced. A knock on the door a minute later and hskp asked if I really needed my room cleaned.  My grandson was trying to nap so I said ""no"" but we could use fresh towels.  About 4 hours later while we were out again fresh towels were delivered.  However the damp towels we had used were still in a pile on the bathroom floor.  Unless you can get a deal I would stay somewhere else.So tonight I am in the ""nicest room"" as they say. Not very impressed especially at $149 a night although top floor corner with a Arch view is nice. Think it's time to check out the newer properties, I'm curious if the bed frames will fit the mattresses there.This Hotel has a perfect location, we are on the 17th floor looking at the Arch. It is GOOD for the price, but needs to be updated. It is a little tired, but for the location and price EXCELLENT! You can't find a better Front Desk Staff, knowledgeable, friendly and professional!Megan and Nejra (as well as the entire Hampton Inn crew) were absolutely fantastic! Upon check-in, we were greeted with smiling faces and a warm welcome. When they found out that we were on our honeymoon, they upgraded us to an arch-view room! After that, they gave us two drink tickets to Morgan Street Brewery as well as a gift card to their hotel bar. And THEN, if that wasn't already more than enough, they knocked on our door and brought up a sweet goodie bag and sparkling wine with 2 glasses! We were blown away- they did everything they could to make sure we had a wonderful stay...and we did!The continental breakfast was the best free hotel breakfast we've ever seen- hot eggs, potatoes, plenty of fruit and pastries, cereal and yogurt. Tons of options! Lastly, the room was modern, clean and the bed was super comfy! If we could give extra stars we would!The lobby is nice, but the room was depressing as shit. The lighting and the setup of the room was so gloomy. Biggest issue with the room was the carpeting. The carpeting was so unappealing and unfortunately it was the first thing I noticed when I walked in. It seemed old and dirty. Please change the carpeting. Like, please. Like, now! Lol The comp breakfast was pretty OK, the sausage patty was kinda like Mcds breakfast sausage patty, it was good.This hotel is really close to the arch which is probably it's best amenity. It was only about a 10 minute walk. The room itself was decent but nothing special. There's an indoor pool which we didn't check out and they have free hot breakfast which was okay but we only ate it once and went out the other two mornings.If I were to visit STL again I would probably stay in a hotel a little farther west in a different neighborhood...perhaps with more restaurants, bars, and attractions within walking distance. But it was nice to see the beautiful arch every time came or went from the hotel and it wasn't a far drive, metro ride, or walk from most places we wanted to go.First of all... you can't miss it, just make your way to the arch.  It is in a place where you can easily walk to many things.  Second, the staff here have to be the friendliest bunch I have ever met.  And it wasn't just some of the staff... it was all of the staff: the front desk, the maintenance guys, and even the ladies putting breakfast out in the morning!So why only four stars... I had a super lumpy bed which made it quite uncomfortable to sleep on.  Our air conditioner seemed to cool the room a bit, but it was always sticky and muggy inside.  WiFi was a bit spotty in my room... which complicated things further because apparently I wasn't receiving cellular coverage in my room either.Otherwise, the one cup coffee brewer in our room was awesome.  The view was great and parking was fairly cheap ($14 per night... compared to some places at $45).  Breakfast was really good!  Highly recommend their French Toast Sticks!!!!  Seriously addicting.  Or you can make your own waffle.  And they have a lovely Irish Pub/Restaurant downstairs that has good food!  There is a refrigerator in the room, but I didn't realize that you could put water and things in it... I thought I would get charged for opening it... oops.  And on the table between the two beds, there was a convenient plug in with four plugs and two USB plug ins... this way you don't have to crawl behind the bed.  If you are looking for a place to stay, I would highly recommend it.Wonderful hotel, was cheerfully great as the customer of the day which came as a surprise, small gift bag of goodies was waiting for me when I arrived, location is excellent to down town, room was clean and smelled clean unlike others I've stayed at that requires a can of air spray.    Breakfast was nice and wide variety to choose from, even had a table reserved for us which was a nice surprise.   Highly recommend this hotel.Great hotel. Near the Arch, near the stadium and near the river. There is a trolley you can catch near by that takes you all over town.Great hotel........very clean, friendly staff, reasonable price. Close to the dome, Busch stadium, the Arch, and many other area attractions.I stayed here for one night during the middle of the week on my way to California. I had a great view of the arch from my room. The breakfast was free, and there was a huge room to accommodate everyone. The staff was friendly and nice. The guy at the front desk was funny and joking around with me because I was wearing a redsox 2013 World Series shirt (they beat St. Louis). The location was great, short walk to the arch and Busch stadium. The rams dome is also right next door to. One of my favorite cities I've been to and nothing to complain about during my stay.Great hotel and value!  Super friendly staff; free hot breakfast (eggs, ham, waffles, etc). Located 2 blocks from Edward Jones Dome and a short walk to Busch Stadium and the Arch. I liked that the parking ramp was very secure (parking fee was $14). Very comfortable beds and pillows. The only issue I had was that the elevators were rather slow.Great hotel, great staff, great location, parking and free breakfast. The only issue was that the elevators were a little slow. Otherwise everything you'd expect from a chain hotel. Great experience.","Front desk staff was very helpful with pointing us in the right direction for food. Beautiful view of the arch from the 9th floor (but you pay for it). Elevators are a little scary, and the hot tub jets didn't work at the time of my stay. Otherwise, very cozy!I'm happy to say that the Hampton Inn St.  Louis-Downtown At the Gateway Arch surpassed my hopeful expectations!  I had the opportunity to be in St. Louis for 3 days to tour the city,'especially wanting to see the Arch, but never having been there I didn't have a clue where to stay.  When I saw their website and location I thought, perfect!  Having stayed several times at the Hampton Inn-Foothill Blvd. in Salt Lake City and been very impressed, I decided this would be a good choice.  When I saw the picture of a room with a view of the Arch, the late afternoon sun brightly shining off the side and the boat sailing underneath it, I knew this was the one.  Arriving late in the evening after a sleepless  overnight 17 hr. flight with 4 rushed transfers, I was really hoping I had made the right decision to stay there.  I barely set foot in the lobby before I was cheerfully greeted by the reservations staff.  Within minutes I was checked in, and she said she had given me a room away from the elevator. When I opened the door, there was the view, exactly as pictured! I rushed over and took pictures to send to my family.  It was a great trip-the staff was friendly and helpful, the room immaculate,  and the jacuzzi and swim in the pool, also with that signature view, was so relaxing.  The breakfast, like the one in Salt Lake, was delicious. It was thoughtful, too, that there were play areas by the pool and breakfast areas for the littlest guests.  The kind housekeeper left a sweet note for me, welcoming me and wishing me a blessed day. I'm saving that note with my pictures as a heartwarming reminder of the nice staff. This was my first time booking on-line and I'm relieved that it went so smoothly. It couldn't have been better! I've recommended  it to others and hope I can return one day soon with my family so we can all share the same wonderful experience!We had a wonderful stay at the Hampton this weekend.  It was my daughter's birthday and we could not have expected more. We had a beautiful view of the arch.   Staff was incredibly helpful and kind.  Andrew C. went out of his way to make sure our stay was fabulous and my daughter's birthday was unforgettable. I will always be staying at the Hampton from now on whenever possible. Thank you Andrew and all other staff! :)Location is great, next to Arch, restaraunts, bars, football stadium, and two metrolink stations.  Room was clean, free breakfast was good, free wifi was good.  Staff was helpful.  Only slight problem is that layout of parking garage is a bit odd, some spots can't be reached.Wonderful hotel with fantastic service! My husband and I used this hotel for our wedding block. Not only was there no charge to hold 30 rooms for our guests, but when we filled those they added a few more for us. Price was very reasonable for being in the middle of downtown. I think on our wedding night our group used 1/3 of the hotel. The service was great. All the staff we encountered were welcoming and helpful, all the way down to the people cleaning rooms. We found out later that two of our guests (who don't know each other) had both requested random pictures be placed in their rooms for their arrival. One of dogs and one of a 90s tv character. Both requests were honored with a sense of humor! Can't praise the staff enough. The whole hotel was nicely decorated and spotless. Breakfast was good, pool and hot tub were nice with a great view of the arch. The arch view rooms have a full view of the arch. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to St. Louis and looking for a place near downtown, the arch, the football stadium, the convention center, or Laclede's Landing.Fantastic staff!  I stayed here recently for work, and enjoyed my nights.  The staff were personable and very professional.  Pricing was reasonable for a medium range downtown hotel.  Fitness area is a bit small but has the needed equipment, 2 treads, 2 ellipticals and an assortment of dumb bells.  Breakfast was great, good starches, and fruits.  A typical Hamptons hotel, but definitely distinguished by an excellent staff.  Kudos!LoactionLocation location.Rooms are available with a stunning view of the Arch along the river.  1 block from casino, 3 blocks to the Arch.  1 block from football dome.  3 blocks to americas center.  Free newspaper, clean rooms. Friendly staff.tight parking lot at a $12 per night kind of sucks.I noticed something new about Hampton/Hilton properties over the past week...  Everyone on the staff is friendly saying Hello, Have a good day, good morning, etc.  and when I say everyone, I mean everyone!  This hotel is older, but adequate with good amenities and a nice view of the arch.  Would recommend for a short stay.Convenient location just a short walk to the Arch, Lacledes Landing, America's Center, the Edward Jones Dome (Rams stadium) and the Lumiere Place casino.  Clean, comfortable rooms with a friendly staff.  Parking is a bit expensive at $12/day.The room was very nice and quiet.  They initially gave me a room next to the elevator.  I have had issues at other hotels with the noise from the guests entering and leaving the elevator early in the morning waking me up so I asked if they could move me to another room.  The staff was able to quickly accommodate my request.  In the morning they have a decent hot breakfast buffet: oatmeal, muffins, waffles, coffee, juice, etc.In addition to the breakfast buffet served in the basement, they have an ""On the Go"" breakfast available in paper bags in the lobby.  The bag included an apple, a breakfast bar, mints and a bottle of water.  They have an indoor pool, exercise room and a small arcade all on the same floor.   There is a view of the St Louis Arch from the pool area.For some reason, everytime I needed a room in downtown St. Louis, the Hampton Inn is more expensive than either of the Hilton Downtown or Hilton at the Ballpark. However, I did end up staying there on night because I wanted to get annihilated at Laclede's and didn't want to drive all the way back to Arnold. Decided I'd just stroll in and get a room but both Hilton's were booked. And by booked, I mean I am a diamond VIP and they still couldn't accomodate me. And they have moved people to other hotels for diamond VIP's if they haven't checked in yet.So I ended up getting a room at the Hampton Inn which is literally a block away for a little more money. Gotta say that the Hampton Inn is still very nice. The one here is a lot nicer than some of the other Hampton Inn's I've stayed at in the country. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable. Though not as comfortable as the ones at the Hilton but I did get a very nice sleep after walking the nice girl out of my room in the early morning. The funny thing was that she was actually staying at the Hampton Inn too.You do have to pay for parking. Not sure what the price was but I do know a parking garage right across from the Hilton Downtown that is $3 for the night so I park there instead. The location of the hotel is pretty solid. It's literally a 2 minute walk to Laclede's and they have a restaurant downstairs where you can pregame hard and get some food in your stomach which is what my friends and I did that night. They got a room at the Best Western which is a little bit further from where we were partying and they did envy me not having to walk further at the end of the night. Well. They also envied the fact that I had a hot brunette around my arm too. Probably more so than them having to walk further to pass out.My boyfriend and I stayed here a few nights ago and its a very nice place. Comfy beds, friendly staff, good breakfast, fairly easy to find. All in all a pretty nice place! Our only issue is that they charge for parking, $14. Which we later found out was really steep. Now maybe other times of year its harder to park but we saw all day parking for $5-$10 all over the city. We felt a little jipped.GREAT location! A reasonable price at that. Close to both stadiums, arch, and downtown life. Comfy beds, good complimentary breakfast, and responsive maintenance when we had an issue with our shower.Great Hotel!  My family stayed here on the way to take our daughter to college, I flew in and drove back home with my husband.  He wanted to stay here on the way home as well.  I see why...the staff was super friendly, the bed was wonderful, the dining options were plentiful and within walking distance.  The view of the Arch from our room was fantastic, and we also enjoyed the walk to and around the Arch and the view of the downtown skyline.  We would stay here again!I am a Hilton Honors member and I usually like what I get at Hampton inns, but this was an exception. The facility was fine and the staff at check - in were nice. However , as a HH member I request a room on a high floor far away from the elevator. I got the first floor  next to the elevator. I realize that sometimes they can't accommodate the preferences. But, at 5:00 am I heard the treadmill running and the runners pounding on the treadmill. My room was also right next to workout room.  I told the woman when I checked out and she barely apologized. So, don't stay in Room 508 and you should be just fine.I was extremely impressed with this location! We arrived early in the morning and the staff found us a room way before check in time! The rooms are clean, the breakfast is very satisfying and the attractions are close by! The staff was very knowledgeable was very friendly and able to answer any question I had. The staff also set up transportation for a ride to the airport...again very professional and all went soothly!I look forward to coming back to St. Louis...would stay here again and again! Loved the Irish Pub on location as well!The hotel is located in an ideal location downtown, by the arch, close to several great restaurants/bars, right off the 70. The breakfast is great (love the waffles!). The staff are entertaining and accommodating. The downsides are that it feels like an older hotel, the elevators are slow, and while the parking feels secure, there are not enough parking spots and the spots are tight.With the exception of the parking (which was paid..$12 for the night and in a very, very small parking lot) this hotel was top-notch. I'm actually use to way, WAY, way crappier hotels/motels being as most of the time I'm just passing through a city on the way to one coast or the other. This one was great though, it was impeccably clean and comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and there was plenty of room for us to just chill. And best of all you cannot beat the location. We walked the the Gateway Arch in less than 5 minutes and the football stadium was right outside our window!I feel tat 4 stars was a bit high. Just spent the weekend there. The hotel was very clean, and the staff was very helpful and friendly. However, one morning there was no hot water and on another day the housekeeping showed up around 6:30pm after we had been out all day. It wasn't a bad stay, just not my greatest experience with hotel stays.Very nice Hampton.  Best hotel in St Louis for the price.  Complimentary parking and Internet.  Very close to restaurants, casino, Arch and ballpark.We wanted a room with a view of the Arch &amp; we got it! The room was clean &amp; the service was friendly to boot :) Nice location with the arch, shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Bars are not close enough to cause pandemonium near the hotel, but close enough so that your cab ride home won't cost you an arm and a leg. Those appendages are important :) Overall good experience!","First things first: this is a great value, and a great location. We came here for the AMA Supercross race at the Edward Jones Dome. Forty thousand people, downtown STL.  Parking is $14/a day - cheaper than any ""event"" parking. We were at most two blocks away from the Dome. So - no end-of-event insanity driving to the western suburbs, a close and quiet room, nicely appointed, wifi included, free coffee around the clock. Front desk staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly - given the fact that they were at 100% occupancy, that was very good. Yes, the rate was high - but with our AAA discount, it was only about $50 more than Red Roof was, and we saved $10 on parking! We didn't get to use the pool, and we slept through the complimentary breakfast, so can't comment on that. But the beds were great, the water pressure in the showers (a real bugaboo for me) was good, the sheets and linens were above average, the view of the Arch was wonderful, and everything was spotless. We were pre-checked-out, receipt delivered to our room overnight. If a hotel can deliver that on maximum-capacity weekends, we'll be back, for sure.The first room I was given was already being occupied.  The person was not there, but all of their stuff was, including a laptop I could see on the bed.  Luckily for that person, I am not a thief.  THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN!  Train your hotel staff to do a better job!!!! NOT SECURE!!!!!  Room:  The (2nd) room was quite large. The bathroom was huge.  Everything was pretty clean.Noise: I was on the 15th floor, however the traffic below was LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.  Unless you are deaf, you likely won't get a good night's sleep at this hotel.Location:  It is downtown, near all the attractions.With the noise and the security concerns, I won't be staying here again nor can I recommend it to others.After a string of iffy hotel stays on this trip, I availed myself of the wifi at the rest stop and pegged this place as where we'd stay for our day in St Louis - and so glad I did. Great location (walk to the Arch), *great* pool, friendly staff, very decent hot breakfast bar (compris), clean, cushy room with an Arch view, comfy beds and extra pillows. Very happy me.Clean and close to dome with free breakfast.This hotel is in a great location, everyone was helpful and friendly.  It was super clean, smelled nice and had free breakfast.  Not to mention a warm pool and hot tub.  I would highly recommend!Awesome hotel! Friendly staff, free breakfast, clean hotel, plenty of parking and nice business center. It is not as old looking as the Drury hotel nearby that I have used. Can't wait to go back!Solid location, perfect for losing your shirt on the casino and stumbling home in a drunken stupor or dancing your face off at a nearby bar.Rooms are nice, nothing special.  Incredible toilet flushing power...if you are the kind of person that needs that.Some rooms have a nice view of the Arch, which is great for about two seconds, then you get bored because it's just a giant Arch.After diligently researching for a hotel to spend our St.Louis wedding weekend at, we came across Hampton Inn, wich was nothing less than hospitable and friendly since our initial contact. This specific weekend was a hectic time to book a stay in St. Louis; the world series, marathons, and other events. Originally we were looking into staying at the Westin, but Hampton Inn was more fitting to our budget and frankly; the service was at the caliber of a 5 star hotel. The moment we arrived at Hampton Inn, we felt like royalty. A specific employee by the name of Portland, went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and comfortable; letting us know where everything in the hotel is located, parking our car, cracking jokes and listening to our needs; a very simple, but refreshing act of service. Their security guard was probably the nicest guard I've met. He gave us tips where to go,  he even offered to take a picture of  my wife and I on our way to the wedding. The room was nicely upgraded, with absolutely no complaints. The hotel is within walking distance to many downtown attractions. For the price we paid, we were beyond impressedAll in all, a wonderful stay, and we would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone, and we will DEFINITELY return!I don't think you can beat this hotel for the price. The area is fantastic, as Charles W mentioned, great for stumbling home from the casinos/landing area. The rooms are standard Hampton Inn, which is fine, though there is no wireless in the room. There is free internet on the hardline, but bring a longer Cat5 cable if you want to work from anywhere but the desk. Parking is cheap at $10 a night and secure. If I ever find myself in St. Louis again, I will make my best effort to stay here, even if it means I am sucked in by that evil monster Gamblar, taking my money.What a great place. Free internet, nice big swimming pool, a gym with treadmills and weights, free apples and coffee in the lobby, even free breakfast. Very nice staff, too.stayed there for one night had a great stay front desk was courteous and helpful gym on 5th floor and a great size indoor pool and also a laundry room (great for my situation on the way of completing a long trip) room was great awesome view and walking distance from some of the best places in Saint LouisWe spent three nights here and everything was great! The staff was pleasant and very helpful and the room was clean, roomy and bright. The adjoining pub was great and the walk to the arch and nearby restaurants &amp; bars was easy.  We also had an easy walk to the baseball stadium. Kudos to the management and staff.I love Hampton Inns.  You know what you're going to get: well-designed, comfortable rooms, free internet and breakfast, at a good price.This one is conveniently located just off the northeast corner of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial (the Arch).  The staff were super-helpful.We paid $116+15% tax for a room on a busy Friday (big Cardinals game), and parking was $10.Stayed here for 2 nights 3 days.  The staff were helpful and friendly.  The room was clean, it also had a little refrigerator. I was on the 5th floor near the gym room, swimming pool and game room which were pretty small, but seem to work for me.  The view from my bedroom was not that great but i didn't care since i plan to be out most of the time  Elliptical machine was really cool.  Location is absolutely wonderful.   Close to many restaurants, metro link which can put you close to Forest park near all the museums, zoo and fun stuff in the park, which all have free admission    Don't forget around the corner from the hotel, you can walk to the arch, another place to visit.  The only reason that I didn't give this review a 5 is because at random times the bathroom would make odd noises.  Didn't bother to mention it because I didn't stay in the hotel most of the times, but it was pretty annoying waking up to the bathroom flushing noises.  Bonus. Free breakfast.   Was not bad.  I loved making my own hot waffles and the coffee was very good.   I would recommend this place and would stay here again.",,,"['begins', 'location', 'location', 'location', 'right', 'next', 'sports', 'arenas', 'entertainment', 'options', 'imagine', 'better',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/chase-park-plaza-saint-louis,Chase Park Plaza,3.5,$$$,132,"I normally stay at the Ignacio when I come in town to visit my son. However they were undergoing renovations and recommended that I stay here is a comparable property. Well, the truth is that they are two very different types of hotels. The Park Plaza is full of old world charm and reminds me of a step back in time. A step back I really like! My room/suite was well apportioned. The lobby is classic. Yet the feel of being old school is well complimented by easy and strong wifi access and recent movies in-room. The location is easy for the Central West End, a hipster area, and there is a movie theatre in the hotel. This may become my new place to stay in Saint Louis!I only stayed for one night at the Chase but it was quite decadent! My boyfriend and I took a one night 'staycation' and had a great time. I was worried that because I booked through Expedia (only $100!) we would get a bad room but it was wonderful! Huge, huge room with lots of amenities and a pretty view of Maryland St. Only 4 stars just because of the parking cost. Why pay $18 a day (?!?!) when you could park a short walk away in the residential part of the CWE for free? We didn't really explore the hotel but every employee we ran into was kind and courteous. I especially liked that there wasn't any surprise charges upon checking out. With all the mediocre reviews for this hotel I was expecting the worst but we had a pleasant night!I'd been in the Chase Park Plaza several years prior, but I only stayed at the hotel this past year during the summer. You can valet the car at the front or self-park around the back; I did the latter, and it's plenty easy enough - after you have checked in, you just swipe your room key to go in and out. The only downside is that the lot is also available for general use, and given there are plenty of spots at the edge of Central West End folks like coming out to, you could end up on one of the higher floors. Walking inside from the front, you have a small but grand-looking lobby; at night, if you walk further back, you'll have musical entertainment near the bar, and there's a very small, retro movie theater that you can swing by if you're in the mood for light entertainment. Back where you walk in, there's plenty of meeting rooms and convention space. The folks at the front desk were very nice and accommodating - no complaints there.As for my room - I ended up getting parked at the end of the northwestern end of the building. The view was mediocre (no direct view of the park, really only of traffic), but there were two things that bothered me. First, I had an extremely loud cooling unit in a door that looks like a closet, making it somewhat difficult to fall asleep (I was there in the middle of the summer, so it was on quite frequently). The second, more bothersome part was that my room was never made up. Perhaps it was too far to make it down to the end of the hallway, but I was disappointed to come back during the only full day I was there and discover that nothing had been changed or made up. Given the price of the hotel, some hospitality should be expected. Amenities on balance were a bit on the older side, and some things (like putting the only cups in the room in the dresser beneath the TV, instead of any in the bathroom) were puzzling.While the location is hard to beat - you are right next to the park on one side, and the popular haunts of the neighborhood on the other - I felt like this was a bit on the pricey side for the quality of what you actually get. I know the hotel has a grander, older feel to it, but there's certainly no harm in redoing the rooms and updating them to make it feel like you are truly staying in a luxury hotel, instead of one that looks like it on the outside but feels more worn once you get to the place (the room) that you are actually spending money on.We stayed in a small suite here for NYE.  The room looked a bit dated, but was very large.  We ordered room service 2 times and both were pretty good-margherita pizza and then the breakfast with eggs, sausage, toast, and potatoes.  The roomservice staff was excellent and quick.  It is a central location, the lobby is beautiful, service is very good...just a little dated in the rooms.  But for the price, it was a nice little NYE get away.I scored a great last minute deal with a friend so we decided we had to check it out! We were upgraded complimentary to an executive suite (score!). The lobby and 1st floor is very well done and I wish I had scheduled more time to have a cocktail and explore. The room itself was large and spacious, however felt fairly dated and drab. The room had a full kitchen, but again outdated and very 1983. I made use of the sleeper sofa, however there were no sheets and the mattress itself was stained. My friend also noted that his mattress wasn't terribly comfortable. We ended up hitting the road earlier than planned. All in all, I thought it was a nice space, good location, but not worth more than I paid for.Second time I've stayed here - both times for meetings. Very conveniently located (next to a huge park, upscale grocery, and nice restaurants). The hotel is very cool (has movie theaters, restaurants, bars) - had a remodeling effort a few years ago and it really shows. The rooms are huge, have really nice amenities, and are very quiet. Great place to stay.(Had to edit my review and drop the rating to 4 stars because housekeeping did not service my room - I had to call and request someone come and clean my room. Not the kind of service I would expect from a really nice hotel.)My organization used Chase as a venue for a very important recognition dinner for donors.The service staff was excellent. Everything was set and ready to go without any issues. (Open bar baby! ) I digress ... :)For dinner We had a beef, chicken &amp; asparagus plated meal for our guests. The feedback was excellent, especially for the beef. Be sure to let your guests know all parking options beforehand! It will save them a great deal of time.  recommend Chase Park Plaza for your more formal needs.At the end of my stay at the chase park plaza I had the pleasure of being helped by a most excellent room service attendant. It was late and my request was a bit unusual but Deon was not only super professional but extremely kind. Five stars for Deon!!!I wanted to note that for some reason the Chase doesn't seem to give the servers their tips. The automatic gratuity goes to the hotel, not the staffer who delivers the service. If I could give the hotel a demerit while giving Deon a 5 star review I would, but I have not figured this out. Yet. Chase management - shame on you! Good service teams deserve their tips and it should be an incentive for your employees not a demoralizing confusing situation as it currently exists...!!!Granted, service is not 100% - I requested a pot of hot water (in the absence of tea kettles available for in room use) and never saw it. But overall I thought the hotel was lovely. I was there to work and the food (Atlantic salmon and simple scrambled eggs with spinach for breakfast with a side of bacon and a pot of tea) was delicious. At one point I asked for an arugula salad (no dressing) and instead got a baby kale salad (both work for me) which has happened elsewhere at ""luxury hotels"" so I'm just grateful to get a nutritious green option at all.  *The bed is amazingly comfortable!!!*I can't stand the overly cushioned pillow top crap mattresses in most ""luxury"" hotels these days. I purchased an Aireloom/Kluft (brand of many luxury hotels) firm mattress at home and this bed was almost on par. Amazing!!!!Most impressive!Unfortunately the name doesn't live up to expectations. Staff is very friendly valet is very slow. One bedroom sweet is out dated no mini bar and shower head was out of control and not in a good way. Probably won't stay here again with all the other choices in areaAdequateNot at all impressed. This is not a 'downtown' location. For anywhere in the country other then Manhattan these prices are ridiculous for anything other then luxury. I paid  They describe themselves as 'high end' but the only thing high end are the prices. I booked a one bedroom suite. See both my booking and their description. See pics side by side of rooms that they advertise and what you get. I stayed in room 744 - horrible. Went to compare my room to others on the fire escape map on the back of my door only to find the map was absolutely inaccurate. This is a huge danger to people to not even have an up to date list. First off - $18/day for parking? $27 for valet. Not listed on my reservation. As such I refused to pay this and that didn't work. Crooks.No room service menu and a late arrival. Had to wait for a menu to be delivered to my room. No bottled water in rooms. They've 'phased out' fridges in the room - ie it's clear where one used to be and now isn't. I asked and was told with great effort they 'may' be able to get me one. Apparently asking for my own water to be chilled (as they don't even provide any) would really be putting them out. No coffee facilities as advertised in my room booking,My 'suite' had one teeny tiny window possibly 1.5ft by 3.5ft. See picture. Nothing like advertised. To sell this room as a suite is a joke. No window in the 'living room'. If this wasn't dreadful enough the terribly repaired blinds to open this porthole were broken. See pics. Left a note for maid (on her gaudy envelope asking for tips). Not only was it not repaired but she put a new tip envelope - the nerve!! Brilliant - guess I'll just hide out in a cave then. Sorry did I say cave, the two inch gap on the door to the hallway could be used as a source of light as it sure doesn't convey privacy. Otherwise every light had to be turned on (heaven forbid that be done with a switch had to stumble around in dark at night and am) to be able to see anything.TV channels are printed with the only place in room located under glass on table TV is mounted.Well now in the 21st century we have remote controls so lots of good that does as I'm clearly not standing at a TV choosing a channel.Bathroom has very cheap subpar toiletries and a pitiful hair dryer that could be compared to a mouse fart. No robes. No amenities that are very standard such as cotton balls or q-tips. Thanks for the soap - where's the soap dish? No expense has been spent here. Looks a bit outdated but at least shower head was nice. Mould in tub - see pics. One night showered around 6p and went out. Returned around 11p and (surprise, surprise) the room had not been serviced and no new towels. It was the first time I'd been back to the room during the day - pretty standard to service rooms after people get ready for dinner!!Every single time a toilet flushes sounds like it's next to my bed. Not amused. No thermostat in my room meant cold air pumped out nightly to the point I work up with sniffles as I'm not used to American air conditioning. The bed is not of high quality and the mattress is not thick like you would expect in a nice hotel. It has a shoddy synthetic mattress pad (about 1/2in - woooo) is meant to improve it?I booked in for $350 of services at the spa. I thought maybe the spa (an Aveda brand) may have been run a bit different. I was :15min early (as is normal at a spa to go change into robe, etc). I then was told to fill out a form and wait in a waiting 'area' in a hair salon playing loud pop music. Not exactly relaxing spa music in a robe pre-treatment. Where I sat for :25min, quite a long time to the point where they were quite late. With no word from anyone. I had a facial then a massage. I would have expected a brief break and some water in a relaxing area between two 90-min treatments.I stay in hotels all over the world in the past month alone I've been to 4 countries. This hotel is pitifully pathetic. And I would honestly say many basic holiday inns and travelodges have more basic amenities and much nicer service. Never have I paid so much for so little.What was shocking about reading reviews (insight of this expletives) is that all of the bad comments, even people who have taken the time to be constructive, seems to be met with a cut and paste generic reply from mgmt on trip advisor. Replying something generic is worse then no reply at all as it really does confirm 'we really can't be bothered'. Awful, awful management.Maybe to someone who splashes out once every few years for 'graduation weekend' this place is passable but as a seasoned traveller in all levels of hotels (nice to extremely basic) I can truly say this is really the biggest rip off I've ever stayed at mostly as its unreasonably missold.I had a very pleasant stay at this hotel. It has old world looks and charm but the rooms are modern and updated. The top floor venue for events is outstanding and has an amazing outdoor terrace with a 260 degree view of the city! Sunset was beautiful from up there. Usually traveling on business I don't have too high of expectations but this hotel would've exceeded even my highest expectations for a vacation. First off, great location. Next to great food and drink. Also, there is a movie theater inside the hotel! The pool had live bands playing poolside. The bar was serving up great drinks. Somehow my room got overbooked and so they upgraded me. This suite had a view from it's balcony of the arch, a separate living and dining area, kitchen with fridge, beautiful comfortable bed. Would definitely come here to relax and take in the sights instead of a working trip.We stayed here for one night in September for a family wedding.  The wedding was actually at the hotel, so 90% of my visit to St. Louis was somewhere in the building.Check-in was easy when we arrived, and the lobby was beautiful.  Unfortunately, our room was not clean when we got there, but it was fixed within an hour.  Once we got settled, the suite was large and very comfortable.  We had lunch at Eu Bistro with my husband's grandparents and and had a very good experience.The wedding reception was upstairs at the Skylight Roof.  As a guest, I can't tell you what the staff was like to work with beforehand, but I can tell you they did a great job the day of.  The service was fantastic, the views are great, and the view from the balcony is beautiful.  It was one of the better catered events I've been to; you can't quite hit perfect with an event this large, but they did a very good job.I can't compare this to anything else in St. Louis-- I was in the city for under 24 hours-- but had a very lovely experience at Chase Park while I was there.I am somewhat excited to come back to The Chase, but the 4 Diamond has to be validated. Issues: Dirty in room drink glasses(lip stick on glasses)Discarded razor left in roomDirty phoneStains everywhere( couch, carpet, towels)Honor bar not fully stockedClub level was a let down with no replenishing of the snacks and the waitress, who let it be known it was her last few days on the job, was very crass.  However, walking in to the Chase I felt like I was in New York at the Waldorf Astoria. Great staff and very welcoming, they just need to refine their 4 diamond level, if they want to keep it.Do NOT use the valet parking. Valet ran into our car and it's been a nightmare to get ANYONE to answer our calls/return our messages/treat us with respect from the hotel OR valet company.The comment feedback form on their website also does not work, so they are clearly not committed to ""optimal customer service"" as their voicemail message states. I could go on about other disappointing aspects of our stay at CPP, but let me just end by saying...look elsewhere.We stay here frequently. Beautiful hotel. Friendly staff. Quiet, clean and comfortable rooms. A little pricey but worth it.We spent 5 days at the Chase Park Plaza and felt at ease throughout our stay. All of the staff were patient and helpful. Room was large and clean and while it would have been nice to have a microwave or kitchen sink, it was nice all the same. Great location and history to the hotel with several great restaurants within walking distance. Be warned that the smell of popcorn will tempt you at all hours! Overall, great stay at the Chase Park Plaza.I stayed in their 1 bedroom suite for 4 nights, beautiful hotel, gorgeous pool, first hotel I've stayed at that has a movie theater, but service does not equate what it costs to stay there.  First night toilet was leaking, let guest services know about it and was not fixed until my 3rd night.  The bed was made each night but the room was not vacuumed or dusted outside of basic cleaning of bathroom.  The second day the toilet paper had been removed.  The hot water for shower was never more than mildly warm.  Staff is friendly, courteous, and complementary beer and wine each night along with breakfast is good, but I would think twice before I booked again with Chase Park Plaza.They say about hotels if the front desk doesn't piss you off check in they will when you check out.  The Chase is not different.  Their front desk function basically is a lunatic asylum.Now why is the Chase still considered the primo property in St. Louis for events?  Well quite simply, no other facility is the Chase, and no one can make it happen quite as brilliantly as the Chase.We just held our 50th High School Reunion, and the staff in the events department were amazing, the food was fabulous and the variety of venues within the Chase is amazing.The staff tore down an event starting at 5 pm, and had it reset for formal dinner for over 300 in less than 1 1/2 hours.  Beautifully done.Think a intimate dinner party for 300 of your closest friends is tough to do?  Not at the Chase, the service was top flight, they got the special meals to our classmates, and the salmon was as good, juicy and wonderful as any seafood house.Thanks to the Chase, their staff is wonderful, conscientious and scrupulously honest and dedicated to pleasing their guests.This is an overall wonderful hotel located in one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in St. Louis. From what I have been told, this hotel has played a lead role in making memories for many St. Louisians over its illustrious history.  I stayed here for two days last week and enjoyed my stay as I have the other times I have booked a room here. I usually order a suite which is really a lot of room. I didn't have a great view but it didn't bother me since I am from St. Louis and am familiar with the area. The room was clean and nicely furnished.  The rate for the room was about $250/night including all the taxes and fees. Very reasonable for the magnificence of this hotel.I didn't utilize too many hotel services while staying here. In fact, I avoided the valet and parked for free in the large surface lot on the southeast corner of the Kingshighway and Lindell intersection. I like doing that so I don't have to wait for the valet and it's free.The hotel was booked with a convention during my stay and I was told I had the last room for one of the nights. I suggest booking ahead in case there are conventions or weddings being hosted here. The only reason it's not 5 star is that during my previous stay here in November, there were a couple room service food trays sitting outside of rooms for the whole two day stay. Beyond that, this is a great option for a top tier hotel in a centrally located area of St. Louis. There is so many options of places to walk to in the immediate area.","I wish I could give zero stars, this hotel is a disaster. I waited in line for an hour to check in; the check in process was a nightmare because I had reserved two rooms under my name (with months and months notice), they couldn't figure out how to change one room to the other person's name and card, charged me 2 deposit fees at $520 each, checked us into the wrong rooms (one was king, one was double bed) and then gave me two rooms in opposite towers of the hotel; the service and cleanliness of the hotel are not worth the price; and upon check out my final bill (which i have printed) says $234 when in reality, they charged my card $418. I left several voice mails with no response and finally I had someone from the front desk track down someone to speak to and she was so rude. I can stay in a great hotel in NYC or DC for $200 a night, a St Louis hotel is not worth that money or hassle.Do NOT use the valet service at the Chase Park Plaza in the central west end St Louis. I  allowed my car to be parked by their valet service and later found my 2000$ watch stolen by their employees.  I mistakenly left my watch in a laundry bag as we were moving to a new home in the area. When I learned of the missing item I immediately contacted the head of security. He was totally uninterested. He kept saying no one turned in a watch. Of course no one would turn in a STOLEN watch. They have signs placed that say they are not responsible for missing items. Perfect for a thief!  No one can accuse them of anything. Think before you give your car keys to one of these employees.My husband and I stayed a night here to celebrate our anniversary on January 30. Sadly, we were a bit disappointed by our room. We stayed in room 950 on the Club Level, which the front desk clerk told us was the ""best room"". I'm sure he meant it was the room with the ""best view"" because the view was awesome from the balcony. Unfortunately the room looked like it hadn't been used in quite awhile, as there was dust all over everything. One of the lamps on the bedside table didn't work and there was a hole in the ceiling.  It just didn't live up to what I expected this hotel to be. It desperately needs a makeover and a heavy-duty scrub down. The staff was helpful and friendly. Beware of hidden charges when you order room service. We ordered a bottle of champagne that turned out to be about double what the menu said. Next time we're in STL, we'll stay elsewhere. This place just wasn't that impressive.Entering the room i realize how poorly it was cleaned... Finger prints on the nightstands, hair in the corner, shower...The room is noisy and uncharming for what is expected for a historical landmark. It makes me sad.... And by noisy i dont mean the street but thw poorly isolated room next to mine.The elevator system us bad and slow.I would have been happy to get a clean room at least.This hotel is lovely - but after staying here twice we started to realize that it's really lacking with the details.   Our room is beautiful but we didn't have soap, or robes. The place for the mini fridge was left empty.  We went out for the day and came back to our room propped open without a housekeeper in sight.  We ordered room service and it came in 60m (even though we were promised 30).  The order was wrong, the coffee pot missing a lid and smelling like it needed a good cleaning. They were generous and comp'd our meal (we didn't want to wait another hour).  Overall not impressed with the details.Stayed here for 3 nights, staff was very friendly, room was clean, hotel is beautiful and unique. The fire pit was nice, had a few drinks at the bar downstairs while a band was performing, pretty laid back atmosphere. There are many bars, restaurants and clubs to check out in the CWE all within walking distance of the Chase too. Room service is kind of pricy especially for the quality of the food, got a personal pepperoni pizza for basically 26$ (with tip) and it was not good at all. Parking is pricy too 18$ a night to self park in the garage. Had a great weekend and great stay here, would do it again.Great Stay!! Perfect Location!!I stayed here on a business trip and loved every minute of it. The hotel personnel were amazing and unbelievably accommodating, from the doorman who took my car keys while I checked in, to the bell hops, to the front desk and room service (dinner was to my door in 30min or less and was very delicious!!). Location: This place is in the perfect neighborhood --Forest Park is only a short walk away, -The Arch and stadium downtown is about a 15 min drive,-there are some wonderful restaurants (Crapes Etc.) and bars less than a block behind the hotel, -a lovely grocery store (Straub's) across the street (very similar to a whole foods, but more of a boutique), -a modern gym (Sante) with very well kept equipment in the basement level (and offers BeachBody classes like Insanity too!)-a movie theatre right in the lobby-there is a beauty salon in the basement *Best tip about this place: you can get to everything you need indoors - especially helpful since I visited in November when it was FREEZING COLD!! Plus, having a movie theatre with new release movies right in the lobby steals my vote hands down!!I really like this place. Staff is friendly. Rooms are relatively big and it has a quirky bygone era vibe to it with out actually sacrificing comfort and modern amenities that you often see with hotels of this age. I always stay here when I'm in town for business and have never regretted the decision.Disaster! that is the best word to describe our 3 day stay at the Chase Park Plaza.Making a reservation: We called the 800 number to make a reservation and was transferred to voice mail that indicated we would get a return call. Hire a call center to handle this, the cost would outweigh the lost reservations. That being said we wanted to stay in this area and our first choice hotel was sold out for our Wash U reunion block. Did we get a call back? that would be a NO! We called back two days later to make a reservation and did get an operator on this call. Made the reservation and asked to get a email confirmation. Did we get an email confirmation? That would be a NO! So we called the hotel a third time to confirm the reservation and request a email confirmation. This should have been our first clue that the management of the property have no clue what they are doing. Arrival: On arrival we pulled up to the front of the property. They had 4 staff on duty at the front. I am assuming 2 for valet and 2 bellmen. While we waited for the attendant, we watched all 4 staff just stand a watch the elderly man in front of us unload the luggage from his car without assistance!  Maybe the 4 people just did not realize that they are at work? We got our parking ticket and proceeded to unload our luggage as well. It must be policy that if you do not need assistance to the room they just stand and watch you. Check in: We proceeded to the front desk with 4 people in line (5 if you count the guy that cut the line for non working keys). They had one person behind the desk at 5:30pm. I asked if they had another front desk person and she indicated he was on lunch. This is almost a 400 room property, industry standard is 1 person per 100 rooms. Not at this hotel! One works just fine in their minds. During our 3 day stay I only witnessed more than one person at the front desk one time.  The attendant apologized for the wait and said she would upgrade us to the executive suite (we had booked a one bedroom suite). She indicated that she did not like the room she had on the 7th floor and that is why she wanted to upgrade us. We had requested a down-free room (due to allergies) at the time of reservation and also asked again at that time since we were changing rooms. We arrived the room located on the third floor and went out to dinner. We returned from dinner and realized that great executive suite was located directly above the Ballroom and the music was vibrating that great room past midnight. We would have rather stayed in the original room booked.  House keeping did come and change the pillows to non down. I cant breath: Woke up the next day not being able to breath. Investigating the room, all pillows on the sofa are down as well as the bed spread. Called the front desk again letting them know that down was still in the room. We left for the days activities. Back to the hotel for the night, Party #2 was raging in the ballroom and thumping in our room continued to midnight. Woke up not being able to breath again. On investigation they removed one of the down comforters but another was still between the sheets in on the bed. Called down again and asked for the down removal while out for the day. We returned to get ready for an evening event and checked the bed and again the down was still on the bed! so now is request #4 I called and asked for the manager on duty I was transferred to Jason. Jason indicated that he would take care of it and to stop by the front desk on our way out.  We stopped by and spoke with Jason and he assured us it would be done. How hard is this? I can not believe I am the only person that is allergic to down! Finally is was removed!Room Service trays: It is also practice at this property to leave room service trays in the hall for days. The halls stunk of old food. One room three doors down had three days worth of room service trays next to their door. How does that happen? One would think that upon delivery of the next order they would remove the finished order? Nope just leave it in the hall! Have they never heard of tray logs and have someone check the logs to assure they are collected? Housekeeping: House keeping only cleaned the bedroom and the bathroom. Never touched the rest of the room (kitchen, living room and dining room). Never cleaned or replaced the glasses, never straightened up the living room or kitchen. The housemen on our floor was always on his phone having very loud conversations with phone in pocket and eaerbuds in. I guess that is allowed? Check out: We went to check out and the computer system was down! What a way to end this stay. When we finally did receive an emailed folio, they did refund one night due to the down issue (though they never told us they were doing this and, quite honestlyMy new favorite hotel in St. Louis. Has some great history behind it. Featured on Showtime's Masters Of Sex, it shows the hotel being called the Chauncery Park Plaza and scientific refuge for Masters &amp; Johnson. The staff is very professional and helpful. It has prime location to great eateries and boutique shops. Some features include several gourmet restaurants, a movie theater and phenomenal fitness center and spa. They also have a beauty salon. Parking can be an issue. Best to valet. The last 2 times I stayed there, they messed up the final bill. They present you with a final bill, then check your credit card statement to find out they slip in some additional charges. That part is a little suspect. The last time I was there, they forgot to charge me for one of the nights. In that case, I think we're even with those extra unknown charges. They also have a concierge floor and lounge with free wine and beer in the evening, continental breakfast in the morning. A bit pricey, but worth every penny.Arrived at around midnight with a tired family. Got a room that was not what we reserved. We tried to ask the front desk to change rooms, but the only solutions they had were to bring a blanket for 2 of us to sleep on the floor. What a joke. We asked to see the manager, but apparently s/he was dealing with another problem. Unsurprising. Looking at some previous reviews, it appears other people have had similar, disappointing experiences. A representative of the hotel responds about how ""deeply sorry"" they are, but based on our experiences, I doubt they've actually done anything to address their concerns. For the money you're paying, stay at the Ritz Carlton.I too wish I could give a '0' star-review....was unable to get in touch with anyone at the front desk 2 days prior to stay. The hotel pool should be featured on a Spring Break reality show....after 30 mins....had to leave bc of all of the drinking, cursing and 'hooking up'....NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY!  Apparently, according to guests...this is what goes on every weekend!The Cafe...food was served cold...waitress, manager and chef agreed...room service is worse!!! Can't imagine...but...thank you Jason...evening Manager for understanding!  The Club Lounge...you have to ask for everything...including hot water for tea and/or oatmeal...no drinks are readily available besides juices in the am...all wine, beer, water, and hot water must be requested through the on staff person...really? That's Club Level? And why you pay more ???There are a few employees that were wonderful...Eric and Jason...other than that...stay somewhere else.Chase Park Plaza is the girl in Junior High that's really pretty and really popular that everyone wants to hang around with. But then, you get to know her, maybe even go on a few skating or movie dates and suddenly you find out she's kind of a bitch. Like she wants you to pay for everything, and asks you to buy her a lot of stuff that just doesn't seem reasonable.After two different stays and four nights at the Chase Park Plaza, I know enough to see a pattern and it's really unfortunate. The location is probably one of the best in St. Louis if you're not looking for river cruises and to see the arch. If you've done all that and want a culturally rich experience in a thriving, metropolitan part of town, the Central West End is a great choice.The Chase Park Plaza is an enormous hotel, it's kind of like an urban Overlook Hotel, sans ghosts, mountains, and Jack Nicholson. The grand halls, adorned with marble and wrought iron, speak of an unmistakeable heritage of grandeur and class. Somewhere along the way though, something went awry. In short, rooms are reasonable enough to upgrade - no sense in skimping. But I'm not sure what it takes to get an outside room, during both my stays, we had inside rooms overlooking an asphalt roof and parking garage - a tragedy really, given the Forest Park is directly across the street. My first stay, I ordered breakfast - fruit, toast, two orange juices and coffee - that was $40.00. Okay, lesson learned. I was also unfortunate enough to feel like I needed wifi access - you guessed it, that's extra.Second stay, I avoided room service, not JUST because I don't want to pay $40 for fruit and toast but it wasn't $40 toast, fruit, and coffee. Even with my newfound wisdom of their up charges, I got hit with $17 a day parking, then I unsuccessfully tried to print event tickets from the business center ($7.50 per 15 minutes plus prints). The concierge did arrange for a credit, printed the tickets, and we tipped her instead. During my last three night stay, house keeping came once and it was a really underwhelming difference. Essentially, they kinda made the bed and gave us new towels. Bed pillows were left on the chair and beside the bed, bed spread was haphazardly arranged on bed and used glassware left in place.So the experience wasn't awful, no one did anything that was worth getting into any sort of trouble over, our experiences at Chase Park Plaza just seemed like that housekeeping job - underwhelming and haphazard.Best location ever! Park your car in their 24 hour lot and forget about it ($18)! This giant hotel sits across the street from the incredible Forest Park and just down the street from tons of great shopping, restaurants and bars. Didn't spend a dime on cabs and that makes me happy!Inside they have a really gorgeous outdoor heated pool, a couple restaurants and bars, a 5 screen movie theater, a spa, some shops, and of course, the rooms! Rooms were really large, we were on a corner facing the park- great view! Bed wasn't super comfy but nothing out of the ordinary for hotels. WiFi for one device was $7.99 but we got this room on Hotwire so we were living large! ;) Great bathroom with separate tub and shower, large vanity, very clean. Elevators were fast and the common areas were very classy and upscale. Minus one star for a very long and complicated walk from the parking deck to the front desk with some areas of stairs only- makes for carrying luggage a real pain. If you can, drop off a person &amp; luggage at the front and then have another park the car. They also have valet. Also, the front desk was really busy both at our check in and out, they could use a few more hands on deck there. Would love to stay here again soon!!Stayed here while visiting my girlfriend's family over Thanksgiving and was mostly pleased with the experience.  While it doesn't really compare with a nice hotel on one of the larger coastal cities, I found the suite which we were upgraded to to be clean, comfortable, and reasonably spacious. All of the staff were extremely helpful, professional, and curious, especially those working the front desk and the concierge.  This would also be a great place to stay if you're a regular business traveler as there's a movie theater located in the hotel on the ground floor that serves beer and wine.  So after a long day of travel, you could go downstairs and enjoy a beer and a current movie to unwind.Long story short, don't expect to be blown away, and the room decor feels a bit out of the 80's or 90's, but all in all you could do far worse if you're looking for a decent place to stay.  The neighborhood is also great with many walkable restaurants and bars within a few blocks around the hotel.We arrived at the hotel on 7/25/2015. After entering the room, I found bugs in the railing of the sliding glass door ( Door would not lock), and cigarette butts on the balcony.  Stains on the comforter and on the decorative pillows. The plastic back of the tv was broken off and laying behind it.  Stains on the carpet through out the hallways. For a 4 star hotel not very impressed. The staff was very apologetic and did discount the a little.  Their was a difference in price from the reservation quote and the actual bill of $ 15.00 that no one could explain. Ended up leaving 2 days early.My husband and I attended a wedding there this past week-end.  The hotel and facilities were lovely.  BEWARE if you should use the valet service!!!!We checked out went out to get our car, gave the valet a tip, what a BIG MISTAKE!!!!Upon getting home the front right fender had a large scrap and multiple scratches.  My husband called them right away.  The valet manager said he would check their cameras and get back with us.I begin with the last sentance:  The valet manager said he would check their cameras and get back with us..............WHY!!!  He calls back only to say that he should have check the car before we left there was nothing he could do.  My husband asked did you check the cameras?  His response, that is proprietary and no he would not view them.  Again I ask, WHY did you say that you needed to check them in the first place.The Chase reponded by saying that the valet was a private service!!  If they are private I highly recommend that anyone who uses the Chase to check out their car before leaving.My daughter is getting married and we were going to use the Chase......NOT ANY MORE!!!  If they can't stand behind their emplyees and their mishaps they will just have one less weddng.  Not that they care, BUT ANYONE WHO VALETS THERE SHOULD!!!!Had a suite Saturday night for a family wedding on the Starlight Roof.We arrived around 12:30 p.m. to check in and were told the suite would be available around 4 p.m. Well, that's not going to work. We're three females who needed to get ready for a 5 p.m. wedding. Making mention of that (thank you, Miss C.'s friend), they acknowledged and express-cleaned, and I got a call around 1:30 p.m. that the suite was ready. THANK YOU!!In the interim, we left our belongings with the very hospitable porter (didn't get his name), while we walked around the CWE. He also brought our luggage up to the room in incredibly quick time, and he was so wonderfully cordial and offered to help if we needed anything.On our way to the room, we snagged a housekeeping cart for extra towels, shampoo, body wash and conditioner. We asked and were happily accommodated.All very helpful, but there was still only one bathroom. Not even a powder room off the living room, which had TV, free wifi, refrigerator, coffeemaker, desk, pullout couch, 4 occasional chairs; ice service close to the room; lots of glasses.There was a refreshment bar of beverages and snacks, but we brought our own stuff.The Chase has been around since 1922: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chaseparkplaza.com%2FourHistory-en.html&amp;s=26f6ddbc490b90f30f34bed2c1a885a566d9b0c96b3232d0328f7ec74676f5a4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">chaseparkplaza.com/ourHi...</a>. I know it's had its day. It's incredibly opulent, there's a movie theatre in the Grand Lobby. The Tenderloin Room, Cafe Eau, lots of luxury seating around the lobby area. Marble floors. It's just spectacular.I've been to the Chase for numerous conventions, meetings and huge luncheons in the Starlight Room and other banquet rooms.But this was the first time I've ever stayed there.I know the rooms have been updated, but there was nothing particularly spectacular about our accommodations.The couch and chairs were hard, hard, hard. The bathtub didn't have no-slip strips (dangerous). The water pressure was OK, but marginal. Even with all the lights on in the living room, the room was a bit dim.The walk-in closet in the bedroom was huge, and had a safe, iron and ironing board, and ONE bathrobe. I found that odd -- one bathrobe in a suite.But it was great to have a room to return to late at night, rather than driving home. And as it turned out, we returned to the room at different times. And I slept on that hard, hard, hard couch with a dirty blanket (in numerous places, the nap was flat and felt like something had dried on it) and a too-soft pillow.Had to pay $17 for parking. That just irks me.This is an update to my prior review. The hotel is lovely and well located. The rooms are well appointed.  We had a terrific breakfast at the hotel.  The staff was attentive, gracious and the food beautifully prepared and presented.  I requested items that were not part of their regular menu and the staff could not have been more gracious and helpful.  Truly first rate.However, our experiences with the front desk were abysmal and mirrored my first interaction with the hotel.  Much of the frustration involved the simple act of calling a cab.  The cab was not there and we were told to go out to the front and see if we could locate the cab.  No one seemed to follow up or have a record of whether a cab had indeed even been called. This happened several times.  In this age of computers, it was surprising.  Would I stay at this hotel again?  Probably not but i would go back for breakfast!We stayed here for July 4th weekend at the first Fair STL in Forest park. Perfect local for the event. Hotel was great. Staff was great. Don't do valet parking as each time they get your car it's a charge (valet to take away and  then go get your car = $70).Great for CWE access.","I stayed here with my best friend about a month ago.  I got a discounted rate because I work in the industry, or else it would have been out of my league.  But, out of my league or not, this hotel is worth every penny.  Being a hotelier myself, I looked for and expected a variety of different things, from parking to outlets to food to bathroom size...the works.  This hotel exceeded ALL of my expectations.  My only disappointment was in their parking attendant...and that was only one of the shifts of the 3 days I was there.For a historic hotel, this property has far more than I expected.  Part of the building is actual condos/apartments.  The hotel has its own bar, very upscale/young crowd hanging out in there.  They also have a theater, which, inside a hotel, is insane to me.  I hope that next time I'm there some good movies will be out so that maybe I can take advantage of this random feature.  If you self park, the trek from the parking garage to the lobby is pretty confusing.  But, once you've gotten lost once, you don't get lost again.  GORGEOUS outdoor pool and sundeck.  And the Gym/Spa....HOLY CRAP.  I thought the athletic club at my hotel was fantastic, but this place takes the cake.  Not only are they a fully 'stocked' gym, but they staff around 8 personal trainers AND they have classes ranging from yoga to cycling.  I wish I lived in STL.  I would pay big bucks to be able to use this gym on the regular.Staff here are fantastic.  Again, working in the industry, I know how difficult it is for hotel staff to maintain the mindset that each guest should feel like the only guest you've seen all day, but the management team is clearly highly involved with their staff, or else their staff really like working with people....I mean, I haven't been so well treated in ANY business in years.  I would like to think that it had nothing to do with where *I* work, so I'm going to hope and pray that this is the norm every time people check in.All in all, if you have the funds to treat yourself while in STL, splurge on Chase Park Plaza.  Worth every single penny.  Tell them Mandy sent you ;)While the service at this hotel was wonderful, I was disappointed with the house keeping and hotel management. After repeatedly confirming that I would be able to check in early, I arrived at the hotel only to be told that I could check in ""if a room was available"". Additionally upon entering our hotel room we were dismayed to find that there was a half drank wine glass, a case of finished beer bottles and a coffee cup with a cigarette bud inside of it. Additionally there were no extra towels besides the ones hanging, there was half a roll of toilet paper without another roll to replace it, and the bathroom mirror was considerably dirty. I was very disappointed with these things.Stayed here for our wedding, asking with about 30 rooms of guests.  Everyone loved the charm of the hotel, convenience, and pool.  It also made a great location for photos.  The staff was considerate and helpful.  The only downside I noticed was that Checkout on Sundays can be slow, and rooms above Cafe Eau can be a bit loud.We stayed at the Chase Saturday evening following a great wedding in Forest Park.  The wedding party had a block of rooms which was really helpful as we got a great rate on a suite.The suite was very well done and the size of a small African republic.  This was great as we had the girls with us and it gave them the opportunity to play in some space.The appointments were luxurious as well but not over the top.  Our suite had a kitchen in it which was great as we kept a few drinks for the morning in the fridge for the girls.It looked as if the bathroom was recently redone as well as we had a large stand alone tiled shower and bath.The only minor complaint that I had echoed those of Patt C.  The couch in our suite was as snugly as a slab of granite.  I would have thought it would have been a bit more comfortable considering the rest of the surroundings.This is an elegant hotel with outstanding staff and many amenities, and it's located right next to the wonderful Forest Park area, which is home to several excellent free museums and a free zoo.  Also, being situated in Central West End puts it close to a great variety of top-notch restaurants and bars, and it's a decent walk to a Metrolink station.Special round of applause goes to Stephanie at the check-in desk, who offered us a ton of excellent and very helpful information about the hotel and the area, and who put us in a beautiful suite.I'm taking away one and a half stars from what should be a nearly flawless review, because the Chase Park Plaza isn't cheap.  It's well worth the money, except that the hotel charges $8 a day for wireless internet.  It's $8 for 15 minutes in the business center.  I've been to cheaper hotels that don't charge for internet access.  (I was taking a break from working out, so I'm curious about whether the hotel charges extra for use of the fitness center, which looks excellent).  Perhaps the hotel is accustomed to hosting business travelers who can charge such amenities to the corporate credit card; but for savvy tourists who like to plan their limited time on the fly, paying extra for wireless internet at an expensive hotel is a dealbreaker.I'd like to recommend this place, if only for stellar employees like Stephanie, but Chase Park Plaza really needs to rethink the nickel-and-dime amenities routine.Came for a conference.The rooms are a little outdated but well kept and relatively big (750 sqft) with a separate living room area.Bed is a little too soft for me.No free wifi but 24 but it is only $8 which is not bad at all.  There are a couple of restaurants downstairs which are nice options to have.The front desk people were a little overwhelmed by the number if guests in the conference I think.  But they still try to be cordial.I can't get over the mediocre level of customer service at this hotel. I put up 4 guests there, including a world famous blind Chinese human rights activist. The folks at the front desk were incredibly gruff and unaccommodating. His room wasn't ready when he showed up at 1:30 pm. Ok, not the end of the world, but could you a) offer an apology, b) not assume that everyone in the world understands everything in the terms that you are explaining it. The guy was obviously blind, obviously didn't speak English. The people at the desk (including the manager, who was the unfriendliest of the bunch) just stood there like robots talking as if their words had been pre-programmedThen, they tell us they have to have a credit card for incidentals. This even though my university was paying for the room. OK, not the end of the world, but the folks at the front desk (including the manager) didn't even seem able to consider the possibility that people from a country other than the United States might not HAVE a credit card. Then there are the idiotic charges. Why can't a hotel that pretends to be modern, uptodate, business-friendly offer free wi-fi?! Why the insane cost of parking. Hellooo? We're in St. Louis! Land of the $6 all-day parking. And they want to charge $17? I've actually pushed my university to use this hotel in the past, because I'd like for our guests to stay in the Central West End. Not anymore. Better the bland, empty streets of Clayton, than putting up with this nonsense. Grrrrr.The Chase feels like an old-fashioned idea of luxury.  The lobby is stunning, gracious, and lovely (and endless!), and the rooms themselves are, well, suites.  Mine had a small foyer, a living room (a sofa, two chairs, tables, a desk, a television),  a large bedroom, a walk-in closet, and a spacious bathroom.  There were some minor quirks in the room, mainly around lighting - some of the switches are in strange places, so it took me a good 15 minutes to figure out how to turn on my bedroom lights, and I never managed to figure out how to turn on the heat lamp in the shower.  Mind you, this is not the Kimpton - it's not super-trendy, whimsical, or daring.  It's a very old-fashioned idea of a hotel, and that can be charming too.  Added to it, most of the staff is exceedingly friendly and welcoming, the hotel has a movie theater in the lobby (in case you get bored) and is walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  If you're headed to St. Louis for a few days, the Chase really is a good hotel option.Its nice, but I didn't like it.  Its a ""secure hotel"" which means getting anywhere on the elevator is a PITA.  You need to insert your hotel room key in the elevator to get to your room.  Even if someone gets on at the same time as you, you both need to insert your keys in order for the elevator to take you to your room.So, that sucked but so did a couple other things.  The hotel bar is pricey, the rooms need at least 2 rolls of toilet paper in case you don't want room service to clean your room and they need to stop nickel and diming their customers for everything.  I had hoped to use the business center to print something out, but at $8 plus the cost of printing, I had to skip it.  This hotel is so cheap, you had to pay $10 to listen to music on the tv.  I couldn't even figure out how to watch free tv, so I didn't want it at all.It was nice, but didn't offer much more than the room you slept in for the cost.Yes, as Dave says, there is new management at the Chase. However, as an executive apartment guest, I feel I was severely overlooked. I had stayed at the Chase for 4 months as a hotel guest every week (I commute from Austin to STL for work) and then chose to get into an executive apartment at the Chase because the experience had been great and the option to get a full apartment rather than a hotel room was very appealing. And for a while, it was totally acceptable. However, when I had tried to get housekeeping to come to the apartment more than the standard 1x/weekly for the apartments (which is outlined in the lease document up front), after giving four days notice, housekeeping did not come. And this event happened TWICE.--AFTER new management. The apartments are very expensive for what they are...even with a discount, breaks down to over $100/night over the course of a month. I'd expect that I'd get better treatment. Not to mention, we (the apartment residents) are like the forgotten children. Valet keys have been lost, lack of speedy service, reminders that needs should be met. If it weren't for the leasing agent Angie, the concierge Jeannie, and the bartenders at Cafe Eau, I'd give a much more scathing review...as I was at the Chase a total of 9 months and thousands of dollars. Especially considering I wasn't earning hotel points (a huge bonus for a 100% traveler like myself), I wanted top-notch.I've stayed at The Chase a couple of times. It's a nice hotel. The people who work there are generally pretty good (except for the service in Bistrot Eau - which has been TERRIBLE every time I've eaten there). The movie theater in the hotel means you can get popcorn and take it to your room to watch a movie or whatever.The pool area is very cool, the gym is really great for a hotel, and the rooms are nice and in good shape. The hotel is located in a great spot in the CWE, right at the edge of the park and within walking distance of tons of great stuff to do - restaurants, bars, the MetroLink, etc. This is probably the place to stay in St. Louis.Currently staying here for 3 nights, on our last night now. I will have to say this is the nicest hotel I have stayed at before. The rooms are large and impressive . I'm deducting stars simply for the quality of housekeeping and attention to detail. With a higher quality hotel I expect certain things to be taken care of without my oversight. We did not try the fitness room or the restaurants so  I can't comment on those. My wife did see a movie at the hotel and was happy with the cinema although she went to a 9pm show and they close the bathrooms and concessions at 10pm and her movie did not end until 11pm. Regarding the hotel day 1 of check-in:Got to room...very impressed with the size of the room and furnishings.The alarm clock was unplugged and when I plugged it back in it didn't work correctly and had to call someone to come fix it.Noticed a piece of paper in the living area with prices of drinks and such from the refrigerator, but noticed the refrigerator was missing. I called the operator and was told they are phasing out the refrigerators, but would send me one if i wanted. I asked for one because I have two toddlers and wanted to keep them some drinks chilled. When they brought the refrigerator they brought it stocked with champagne and water and drinks and such. Not really a complaint, but I told them I wanted it to put juice and milk for my kids in and it pretty much came full already.Two of the glasses they provide with the ice bucket were dirty.Day 2:About to head out for the morning and went to put some things in the safe in huge room. It had a low battery message so I called to let them know and they said they would send someone up. 15 minutes later someone comes and looks at it and says engineering will have to come and change the battery (which is what I told them needed to be done when I called) so I had to wait another 15 minutes for him to get there and then fix the problem. Not a huge problem, but it did set us back 45 minutes.When we returned from our day out the room had been cleaned and I was sure to have moved all of the glasses so they would be changed and cleaned. They were changed, but two more of the glasses were dirty again. Also, they left the plastic bag with now melted ice in the ice bucket so I had a bucket full of water and no bag to put clean ice in. I had to call downstairs for them to send up a new bag. When my wife took a shower her towel had a yellow tint to the majority of the towel and her wash rag had multiple brown stains on it (definitely needed to be cleaned).Day 3:Glasses again were all set out so they would be cleaned and changed. Three of them were changed out and clean, but one glass that had milk sitting in it was left on the table...not sure if they missed it or what.Only one towel was replaced on the hanger with a wash rag draped over it and another towel placed under the sink. We have had 4 towels every other day but today they only gave us two so I had to call and request more towels.The balcony has cigarette butts on it that have been there the entire time of our stay. We don't smoke, but no one really looks outside to make sure it is tidy as there are several areas that have something sticky spilled on it and it is obviously dirty.I will have to say every time that we have called down to the front desk (unfortunately it has had to be several times) that they were polite and someone always came up within 15 minutes or so. The problem lies with the lack of attention to detail in the cleanliness of the room.We have always wanted to stay at the Chase on previous trips to St. Louis but never had the chance until recently--boy was it a disappointment! The room was dated, dusty, and dirty. We had specifically requested a king bed and got a double so we politely requested to move. It took them 2 hours to accommodate our request so our day revolved around waiting for our room. When we finally did get our new room it had a king bed but the faded and dated elements remained. The air conditioner sounded like a freight train all night long. Plus, they were hosting a wedding which resulted in loud music being played beneath us until 1am. Sadly, we will most definitely not be returning.What an amazing place to stay!Ultra-comfortable and delightful environment.  My wive was having a procedure nearby at Barnes, so we came the night before.  It was the treat before the test.  The first extremely pleasant, the latter extremely challenging.  We are grateful for the restful surroundings of the Chase Park Plaza and their awesome Salute To Heroes program!  Thank You!Beautiful hotel Loved the exterior architecture and the grandeur of the lobby.However, the service left much to be desired.  Front desk help was hospitable and helpful, room service, not so much.  Food was wayyyyy too salty the multiple times we ordered and ate at the restaurants.The rooms, on the other hand, were a plus.  We stayed in a fairly roomy one bedroom suite with a separate dining area and a remodeled bathroom with pleasant toiletries.  Parents: just know that if you ask for a crib they supply you with a portable pack-n-play.  Not really a ""complaint"" but something a little shabbier than one would expect given the caliber of the hotel.Maybe I am used to the intimacy and whimsy of boutique hotels, but we might give The Chase another go the next time we're in town just because of its location (next to numerous cute boutiques, restaurants and bars).  Definitely one of St Louis' gems.The Chase is a Saint Louis landmark, and I am happy to see it thriving.  I arrived with some friends a couple of weekends ago to celebrate my birthday, having reserved several suites for all of us.  Check-in was smooth and painless, and the lobby was bustling.  I was happy that we had reserved early since the hotel was sold out and had three events going on that night.  Of the rooms, mine was actually the smallest and would have been better being the biggest since I was entertaining in my room before and after we went out.  I had asked for a kitchenette and one of the other groups wound up with that.  Not a big deal, and we could have switched if wanted.  The rooms are well appointed and maintained, but as some other reviews mention, could be updated a bit.  There is comfy furniture, a TV in both rooms of the suite, a large bathroom with an oversize soaking tub and great toiletries that I used both days.  A little office nook and a huge walk-in closet complete the space.  The large walk-in is a bit confusing...you would literally have to move in the room forever to need a closet that big.  I know many of these rooms were formerly apartments.  Just seems that the space could be better reclaimed as something else since it's part of the hotel side now.  We had plenty of seats and room to hang out, and I turned the desk into a nice wet bar.  Got back to the room late, played some music and surely got loud, but no complaints- awesome!  A great reason to have extra space as a barrier between rooms.  The bed was comfy, and it was amazing to roll out of bed and walk downstairs to a top notch brunch.  Had it been warmer, I would have hit their stellar pool.  There is also a gift shop, several high quality restaurants, and a really nice theater.  if it was bad weather or you were just wanting to hole up, there would be no reason to leave here for days.  That's a nice treat sometimes.  If you do want to leave, there are so many options from Forest Park to the Central West End, many within walking distance.Sunday Chasing Summer Pool party. Don't miss it. Not like a city crazy hydrate party, but better. Great dj's, waitresses and sun. The best cabanas in town.Like Shari d, I am bouncing between 2 and 3 stars here.  The Chase is in a great area of St. Louis, walking distance to all the cool bars restaurants and shops in the Central West End.  The hotel itself is a little lacking.  It's nice that it has a kind of all contained within vibe with restaurants, bars, a movie theater, etc. but the rooms are just so tired and dated.  A major refresh is definitely warranted.  The room service menu is quite limited and the overall amenities are lacking.From the service perspective, check-in took forever with only one person at the desk and a line out the door.  There are people who open doors for you as you come and go but it would be nice if they smiled and spoke in more than grunts.Call it a 2.5 and yet, because of the location, I will likely return.We've stayed at a lot of hotels, this was by far our favorite! We are from St Louis and went for a night out. Fun atmosphere, felt like a cocktail party in the lobby! Loved it here!Upon first (and all other) look, this hotel is really nice.  I am a guest there right at this moment to attend a family members' college graduation.  It is a busy week and weekend for the hotel and they seem to be handling it very well.  The accommodations are upscale and enjoyable. So why two stars?I just asked the front desk where I can get a cup of coffee in the hotel (not available in the room).  Had to go to a cafe in the hotel. $3 for an 8oz cup that they filled up 2/3 of the way.Want to park (of course you do!)?  $28 valet. $17 self park on a garage with a significant walk back to the lobby.Starbucks has free wifi.  Chase park plaza? Hah.  $8 per 24 hours. Room service breakfast? Sure, knock yourself out.  Pancakes are $10 and there is a $3 delivery fee.For a place that is so nice and upscale, they don't really take care of you very much.  The front desk will help you out with the average, but you never get the feeling that your patronage is appreciated. The wifi thing is ridiculous.  On their website it says something along the lines of, ""if you need to catch up on some emails, our hotel has high speed internet for you!""  They conveniently leave out that if you stay for a few days it may cost you 30-something bucks.So enjoy the hotel. Bring your wallet. Or go somewhere cheaper where you will certainly get more for your money.UPDATE 5/19To be fair, I did end up finding a coffee maker in the room.  That begs the question though, why did the front desk not tell me this information when I specifically asked where I could get a cup of coffee?  It would have been relevant information.  Instead they directed me to buy it at their cafe.  Not really a surprise...","Positives:I love the lobby of the Chase. It's very grand. All of the staff I have encountered are very friendly. It's in a great location for the shops and restaurants in CWE.  The movie theater is cute. Not so positives:I've stayed here 4 times in the last 4 years and I can say that I will most likely not stay here again. I would only stay here if I REALLY had to stay in the CWE. The first two times I was really happy. I used to live next to the Chase and would sometimes come here for dinner or to the bar with friends. I always wanted to stay here and honestly, my first two hotel stays definitely lived up to my expectations. However, I wasn't thrilled with our experience the third time we stayed here. We decided to give it a chance one last time on my fiance's birthday a few months ago. Unfortunately our stay was very disappointing. The couch was so gross.. had the nastiest stains all over it. Usually don't notice or care about stuff like that but this was ALL over the seat cushions. The bed was really uncomfortable. Not sure how this happened as I would assume they are all the same bed and the previous stays were fine. This one was very lumpy and uncomfortable. And honestly, I'm not one to complain about a bed so this was pretty bad. Someone tried to come in our room at 7:30am on one of the mornings, but couldn't because I had the deadbolt on and they kept trying to open the door. I'm not sure what happened there - was it another guest..why did they have a key that worked for our door? Housekeeping? Why did they KEEP trying? I don't know. The TV wouldn't work, kept turning off after a minute or two.  Front desk said they would send someone but nobody came. Pretty unacceptable. For the price, I'll spend a little extra and stay at the Four Seasons downtown.Best I can give it is 2 Stars. Management must be off for winter. At breakfast had to remind server to bring my toast as I was halfway done. No bellman at check in. Room was still not made up at 4:00pm in afternoon and I was gone since 9:00am. Room is just okay, view lousy. Best part of service was valet! They did a great job. Room was never serviced. Return at 10:15 pm to in cleaned room. Requested clean towels and got rags.Really nice hotel in the central west end. If you have family in town (and act reasonably in advance) you can book on a local rate (MO/IL resident) which is usually ~$150-$190. Great location on forest park.It's important to know that the Chase Park Plaza Hotel is under a  NEW management team and things are on the right track. After having some problems with the Hotel, I called and was contacted by the Hotel Manager. We discussed my issues and he informed me that he Chase was under new management. He then explained my options and was very apologetic and took care of me. I know there are some bad reviews on this place, especially from those of us who spend $220 a night and get let down. Try and look past those. I was worried that nothing good would come out of this, but once I voiced my issues they took care of me. It's a really nice place. With Central West End and Forest Park right across the street your night options are endless. You can go downtown or stay local. The nightlife at the bar inside of the Hotel was a good time.I'm sorry but for the money my husband paid this should had been a way better experience...got there on Friday 12/05/13 and the room smelled like sewer. I  called to report it and they said they will send someone, none came. We went to bed. Then on Saturday, I called again and told them that the whole room smelled like sewer, again they said they will send someone to fix it... Nobody came. The breakfast at the 9th floor, which was supposed to be the upgraded rooms didn't even have waffles, or pancakes, just some pastries and smoked salmon... Very disappointing. We booked two massages at the spa for Saturday, and hour before the appointment they called us to canceled our massages... Never ever going back!!!Outstanding stay. In an amazing area. Top tier service, and they have a wonderful admiration for members of the military. Devon &amp; JB at the front desk were exceptional throughout my entire stay. Have fun!/JRFThe room is a 4, the staff is a 5, housekeeping a 5, room service a 1. Very nice place to stay. (Don't get room service, food is just fair, but the price is YIKE$-O-RAMA!)The Chase Park Plaza is a beautiful hotel, I recently had the opportunity to stay at this facility while on company business in St. Louis.  The room rate is a bit high for the average family however the location is great.  Another real plus for this facility is its access to the highway although still far enough away so that you don't hear road noise.I thought staying so far from downtown would be weird but it turns out, this is the nice part of town.TV - Small HDTV with HD programmingBed - AveragePillows - Various levels of fluffiness were provided Bathroom - Shower pressure could have been betterView - Residential backyards Internet - Really slow wireless, defaulted to 3G tethering with my phoneOn Site Food - Next reviewThe best part was that it was walking distance from a very nice strip of bars and restaurants. Other than that, the hotel served its purpose of housing our conference and all the staff were more than helpful.I stayed here this past weekend for a good friends wedding (the reception was also at the Chase PP), and overall had a great experience.  The room and hotel itself was beautiful and the staff was outstanding.  The location of the hotel is also in a very nice area, with great restaurants and bars located within two blocks (or less).  Room rates may seem pricey but it was well worth staying there.I did not stay here, so I cannot comment on the quality of the rooms or restaurants.  However, if you are a tourist, this is an interesting historicall building to walk through.  From the famous Khorasan Room to the main lobby to Chaser's Lounge to the private residences lobby-- the Chase Park Plaza is all class.  I would love to come back for a drink at Chaser's Lounge followed by dinner at the Tenderloin Room and maybe a film in the cinema.  After years of neglect, it is so wonderful to see the Chase flying high.I came to The Chase for a wedding this past weekend.  Visiting my cousins' hotel rooms, and the bridal suite I got a lay of the land.  The regular rooms were pretty normal in size, but had 2 shower options in the bathrooms, a bathtub with shower and then a freestanding glassed in shower.  Nice to have options I suppose.  Some of the rooms had separate living rooms and dining areas, very nice to entertaining a group of people or to be able to spread out.  No free breakfast.The venue space for the wedding reception was outstanding.  We had the whole top floor with seating around the dance floor, a live band on stage, and a great place for speeches with mics on stands.  Two outdoor decks for fresh air, and GORGEOUS views of the city.  The staff was very nice and always accommodating - even opening the hotel gift shop late at night for last minute purchases.After the rehearsal on Friday, and the reception Saturday, many people from the wedding party and guests met at the hotel bar downstairs for drinks.  There was a live band inside both nights playing covers and rocking their own faces off - a little over the top for me but it was fun, and live music is always appreciated.Outside was lovely.  Next to the outdoor pool and fountain there is a large fireplace and tables in the courtyard.  A great place get some fresh air, have a chat, have a smoke if you are into that, and relax.  The bar closed around 1:00AM and many people were sad to leave.  The pool during the day is heated and my family had fun swimming.We kept exploring the hotel and found an amazing auditorium which had maybe 500 chairs set up, a stage, artful chandeliers, a plexiglass podium, and a grand piano.  Pretty epic space for a particular kind of event.  There is also a movie theater in the hotel, which a local told me you can drink alcohol in there and eat regular food - sounds like my kind of place.  Cool spot in St. Louis to host a wedding - everything at your fingertips.What a fabulous historic boutique hotel.  Friendly people, good food, a weekend of music, they even have a movie theater on the first floor.  I'll be back!!!!I'm very fond of the Chase, as I lived on the apartment side for awhile when I was in grad school.  Back then, I was too naive to realize how good I had it (and I definitely didn't have enough money to really take advantage of what the Chase had to offer!!!).  The Chase was arguably my favorite thing about living in St. Louis - I loved hanging out at the pool when the weather was nice, having lots of on-site dining options, and being able to go to the movies without going outside...  I recently came back to the Chase during my five-year reunion, and stayed on the hotel side.  The hotel side is much as I remember it (the apartment side was converted to condos and majorly upgraded!).  We left our car with the valet, the lobby was still lovely, and the front desk staff was exceedingly polite.  We had a suite, which was very spacious, and overlooked the pool.  The bed was comfortable, but the room looked like it could use a face-lift - a new coat of paint and modern TV's would go a long way.  I was a little irritated that they charge for internet access.  The bathroom counter was very tiny, and sort of annoying.  Also, the hotel side could use a few more elevators....  Outside of the room, I was very happy to catch a movie at the theater.  The theater may not have stadium seating or the best sound system in the world, but they serve alcohol and Ted Drewes custard!  There was a reunion event at Chasers, which was very convenient.  I was disappointed to see that the Marquee Cafe was not open for business - that was my favorite on-site restaurant.  Finally, I was pleased to see that the CWE has developed quite a bit over the last five years - there are lots of new restaurants and it seems like there were more people out than there were when I was in school. Overall, I still think the Chase is a great place to stay if you find yourself in St. Louis.I'll start off by saying that had the Chase been a more affordable hotel, I would have given 3/4 stars. However, given the reputation and guests its supposed to attract, I was greatly disappointed. On the positive end, the hotel's exterior and lobby are beautiful. The pool looked really cool and a DJ was playing in the evening. The gym and spa are the best I've seen in any hotel. The attached theatre is cool and convenient. There are plenty of choices for restaurants/bars in the building. The location is great - right across the street from Forest Park. Lastly, the employees were all very hospitable.On the negative side, my room and everything about it. First of all, it was tiny! There was typical queen bed, a desk, a bureau with a TV above and fridge below, two side tables and a small circular glass table. Not much else fit in the sleeping area. There was very little room to maneuver through the room. I was the only person staying there and it would have been miserable if there was another. The sheets and comforter were rough and the pillows were lousy. On the first morning, as I was getting ready for all-day meetings, I realized there was no iron. I called the front desk to have one sent up. 45 minutes later it still had not come and I had to leave. Next complaint, room service. I ordered their salmon dish for $22, a side of fries, and two Coronas. My bill was $55. I was in shock and after studying the bill realized that the hotel automatically adds 20% tip to your order. Additionally, even though they make tip mandatory, there is still another line to add tip on the bill making it very easy to inadvertently leave double tip. Now, this was room service and I'm well aware its always expensive. I wouldn't have been so irritated if the food was decent. It wasn't. My salmon was much smaller than the standard small fish plate. It included string beans as a side. There were less than 10 string beans. I laughed. The food took up less than half the plate. It was sad, I was sad. As if I wasn't already irritated, I had no bottle opener for my beers. I searched everywhere in the room. I called room service back for one and was told it would be brought up. 5 minutes later I got a call back from the person who delivered the food and was told the beer is twist off. Umm no, Corona's are not. I was told one would be brought up. It was, some 20 minutes later. My food was done and my beers were warm by the time the bottle opener was brought up. There was simply nothing luxurious about staying at the Chase. It seems to provide great night life for locals or guests, but the remainder of the hotel is not on par with other luxury hotels. The hall carpets are dirty, the TVs are dinky, the decor is old, the shower is super small... not worth the price to stay.We stayed here after the Food and Wine Experience.  The room was very very nice, spacious and comfortable.  I also love the location, near many restaurants, nightlife and of course, Forest Park.   I did a quick rundown of my bookmarked restaurants and probably 30 of them are within 5 miles of the Chase.  This is definitely a central spot for awesome dining.   The only complaints I have would be that the lobby area is not very plush or impressive - you don't feel like you're in a high-end hotel at t all.  We were not attracted to the Eau Cafe (badly in need of an overhaul), the Marquee Cafe (no signs of life, just blah), or the Eau Bistro (pricey yet uninteresting menu - we didn't bother trying it).   This is easily one of the coolest buildings in the city when it's lit up at at night.  I might have given four stars, but I thought the price was high given the overall ambience of the hotel.This hotel is a joke. How they can claim to be a four star establishment? There are no amenities. You have to call the front desk to get your room cleaned. There is no turn down service at night. I could go on and on. If you're coming to St. Louis, do yourself a favor: book a room at the Ritz in Clayton.I've stayed here a couple of times and the location is ideal. Walk to the park, shops, restaurants and if you're up for a 1.5mi trek... To SLU. Nice accommodations, good food, great staff. They definitely need more people and supplies on busy weekends ie graduation.. however it's clear the staff is doing their best with what they're given. (owners take note: purchase more pool towels and robes, hire a few more folks and appreciate your staff because without their fantastic attitude and work ethic... The CPP would be lost and what's with the extra charge for Internet? Especially for us paying for suites!!?)  I recommend  the concierge floor as the upgraded room, breakfast and lovely evening fare is well worth the price and it's so nice to have their services for reservations, tickets etc. if you appreciate tradition and a 'grown-up' atmosphere this place is for you.I have to stay here a week every month for work &amp; there are always issues. From crappy service to crappy rooms. Old hotel and it shows. If I didn't have to stay here I wouldn't!Having personally worked at the Chase for 8 months I saw a lot of the behind the scenes action. Such amazing passionate employees. I have been back a couple times since I resigned and I still see the passion in the employees eyes. Still amazing food in the Bistro and all other areas of the hotel. They have a phenomenal gym and a movie theatre in the hotel It is so large and beautiful defiantly some where to visit when in the Saint Louis area.","What a disappointment! The heater wasn't working in the pool and the pool bar wasn't open. But there were no clean towels at the pool anyway. My niece was having surgery at children's the next day and wouldn't be able to swim this summer so the heated pool was a main reason we chose this hotel. So between that and the unimpressive furnishings in the room we weren't happy.This is toggling between a 2 and a 3 for me.  If you went just by the website you would think that you were getting more than what they offer in terms of amenities and overall ambiance.  Don't get me wrong...it is a nice place but it didn't meet my expectations.  The room was a little dark and for some reason I had a closet that was actually a maintenance room.  I mean litterally there was a water heater and a bunch of cords and wires in the closet which would be a safety hazard if there were any children staying in the room.  The bathroom was dark and either the toilet kept flushing every 2 hours or the walls were so thin it was the person next door. The lobby and bar area is very nice and the staff was very accomodating.  The surrounding area is also very nice with a selection of restaurants and bars in the area.  There is a movie theater attached and the outdoor pool area is very impressive. I don't think I would stay here again unless it was on business which is too bad because I really like the neighborhood.We stayed here because we were a part of the Joyce Meyer Women's Conference 2012. This hotel is beautiful inside and out. To our surprise, we were upgraded to a king suite when we arrived and mentioned why were there. Our suite was located on the 9th floor and we were told that the 9th floor guests get a free complementary breakfast everyday! We had our own lounge full of juices, cereals, pastries, fruit, and much more! It was an amazing hotel with amazing customer service. I would give 5 stars but there tons of people running up and down the hallways at all hours of the night with no security helping calm them down :(.Oh and we loved the built in movie theater downstairs in the lobby showing current movies! We loved that! Thank you Chase Park Plaza!You'd think that a hotel billing itself as the one of the best in Saint Louis would have at least as many amenities as the Hampton Inn. Well, if you were thinking of The Chase Park Plaza, you'd be wrong. What they do have, however, is $8.00/day wireless Internet service and a pretentious Front Desk staff that will inform you that if you have forgotten any key toiletries you can feel free to pay an exorbitant price for a small travel-sized replacement at the gift shop. Even if it's late in the evening and your pregnant wife is all but ready for bed before realizing the toothpaste is still at home.Last time I was on a budget-minded company trip, I was able to get an Oral-B branded toothbrush and a tube of Crest toothpaste at the front desk of a midrange, midpriced chain. Then later while I brushed with my complimentary toothpaste and toothbrush, I was able to FaceTime with my wife using the complimentary Wi-Fi. When my wife and I decided to spend a weekend in St Louis at the famed Chase Park Plaza, not so much.It's a nice place, don't misunderstand me. It is also likely to have more character than any other in the city. But what really separates the best from the rest are the small things. The attention to details. The ability to make guests feel like nothing is going to come between them and the most relaxing, carefree weekend away possible. And in these regards, The Chase misses the mark.Considering the amazing location, the great spa, the charm, character, and history, I'd love to give The Chase FIVE STARS. But unfortunately the pretentious staff, the wall our room shared with the elevator engine room, and the lack of anything complimentary result in a less-than-perfect showing.Wow...gorgeous! Great location, nice staff, clean rooms.This review applies to the executive apartments for long term stays. First of all the room we (my husband and I) have is spacious and comfortable with a view of the park and the gated community adjoining it. I also love the neighborhood and the local dining. Forest Park is immediately accessible by foot. The architecture is beautiful and so is the design scheme in our rooms. There is also a heavenly Aveda salon at the north entrance with hip and skilled technicians.  That's where the glitz ends. I've had some sketchy encounters with service. In fact the Valet and Door Persons seem to be the most professional members of this staff. Front desk is.....odd. Not obviously rude, but odd. Very reluctant to have a conversation with you about anything. I called the main line to return a missed call of theirs on my cell phone and got some annoyed woman saying ""Well we can't do anything about that, I don't know who called you from this number"". She was so eager to hang up. The Executive Concierge is helpful and friendly when she's in, which is rare. Are 3 hour lunch breaks a ""thing"" in St Louis? It took days for us to get our mail box key. Then there's the gym and ""spa"". The gym is nice with fun classes and clean, well cared for equipment, but there is NO SPA. No sauna, no steam room, no jacuzzi (which is technically what the word spa refers to) and no lap pool. This wouldn't be such a problem if the hotels ownership would stop shamelessly declaring the word SPA on their brochures and website. Room amenities are also cheesy. The TV's get what I assume is basic cable, which in the midwest is dozens of sports and ""news"" channels. We don't have Cartoon Network, TV Land or Disney, just more sports channels in place of their numbers. The in-unit washer and dryer are cheap. It takes at least 2 full drying loads to get a load remotely less damp. We still have to lay things out after to get them truly dry. This is the case with everyones machines. It doesn't feel consistent with the prime location and aesthetic. The once a week maid service doesn't replenish our toilet paper or clean off mirrors and glass. The tub is also untouched. Room service will not deliver food past midnight and has a really sparse menu. The restaurants will not deliver you their food. Lastly the restaurants are good, not great. Cafe Eau is decent in low priced food with nice bartenders and some (but not all) rude waitpersons and hosts who really eye stab you. Eau Bistro has an excellent Sunday buffet. Chasers Lounge and the Marquis Cafe are almost always closed. The late night crowd at Eau Bar is loud on the weekends, but I wouldn't call them ""young"" or ""rowdy"". A lot of drunk moms and accountants. If you want a cooler scene walk to Sub Zero or get a Taxi downtown.We've stayed in this hotel a couple of times, and I've always been impressed.  The service is great and the rooms are clean and lush.  The beds are fantastic!  I did forget my hairspray on my last trip, and called concierge to see if they had any.  Of course, they had some available for sale in the gift shop.  So, I go down there and ended up paying $4 for a travel size of low-end hairspray.  What a rip-off.  I understand prices will be raised a bit for some things, but I guess they know they've got you over a barrel on some things, too.  Otherwise, the stay was enjoyable, and the area around the hotel are great as well.  I'm excited to go back and check out the park across the street next time.So this was our third yearly trip to St. Louis. The first time through, we stayed at the Hilton downtown by the ballpark. Last year, we stayed at the budget-friendly Hotel Indigo in Central West End (which is now a Comfort Inn, by the way). This year, we decided to be a little more classy, with a stay at the Chase Park Plaza.Overall, I would say that the Chase was A-OK. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite that was actually larger than our entire apartment, so...yay for that. But not everything was roses:- Dripping sound from air vent in bathroom all night.- Hard/stiff couches and chairs in the living room area.- Mediocre TV's in both the bedroom and living room.- $8/day for internet (which wasn't exactly blazing fast either).- Extra fees for the gym (I'll run in the park, thanks).- $24/day for valet parking, or half that for self-park.- Checkout did not work through the TV, it apparently was broken.The internet and parking situation really irked me. The room costs are high enough, but if you're going to nickel &amp; dime me every chance you get, that makes it seem even worse. If the room was $220/night instead of $210/night, but included internet, I feel like people would actually like that better than having to be charged extra for the internet. But maybe that's just me. I WAS very happy with some things, however:- They opened up the closed hotel shop so I could buy some aspirin after hours.- Awesome building overall - seems very historic.- Cool pool area.- Plenty of restaurant options, including a night club/bar.- Close to Forest Park.- Grocery store across the street.- Walkable distance to Central West End nightlife, and also Metrolink station.- Friendly staff, good room cleaning.Would I go back? Yes I would - but I would also tell people that the Comfort Inn right down the street is half the price (with free parking), and in just as good a location. But if you don't mind paying a little more, Chase Park Plaza is pretty decent too.Thank you, Chase Park Plaza, for energizing yourself, and renewing my faith in the Greater St. Louis Area.Your grand entrance with fresh and fragrant Star Gazer Lilies told me I was in for a top notch experience....Your incredibly kind and informative check in included an upgrade to a suite, which really made our stay special. Your housekeeping crew couldn't have been more friendly. I've stayed in many top notch hotels, and never have I heard so many genuine ""hello's""....I thought I was in Oregon for a minute :PYour rooms were nicely appointed, with down pillows, fluffy robes, and flat screen HDTV.... the living room was classy and large enough to entertain 6 ppl graciously. I found your bathroom to be roomy and clean, and who knew how luxurious a walk in closet could feel during a 4 day stay? LOVE!Our room was quiet enough that Hubs slept through a rather large and loud thunder/lightning show.....he missed out, because the city lit up by lightning is both classic and awesome!The neighborhood felt incredibly safe, and I enjoyed walking through the Central West End Neighborhood adjoining Forrest Park...Hubs and I even took a bus down Lindell to the Taproom with no problems. I love how close you are to a wonderfully clean and quiet public library, and I really love how close you are to the Central West End bar scene. Bar Louie's Happy Hour was hard to beat, and just a quick walk.Oh, and having an nice deli/grocery across the street like Straub's? It really couldn't get more convenient.I don't know that I would've sought you out had Hubs not had meetings at CPP, but I'm so glad he did, because we now look forward to coming again and just hanging out with you and all your fabulousness. Next time I want to sit by your pool and pretend it's 1947....Fabulous is really the only word for it. I'd give you 4.5 stars, but I'm""m rounding up to 5....So, why not 5 stars? No Wi-Fi in room, no turn down, and wired Internet costs $10 per day per device, and iPads are not an option...Coffee Cartel was open 24 hours a good place for free wi-fi, but I think a hotel of your grandeur should have more choices.Oh, and next time I come I will partake in the movie theater...the smell of popcorn was tempting me, but I had too much family to visit.....Very nice and extravagant hotel.  Very classy , swanky jointLove it ! My favorite place to stay in St. LouisGreat location, beautiful well kept rooms.  And Jon at the front desk was a delight.  Parking situation leaves much to be desired,  and charging for WiFi not good!Great food, pool, and rooms. Walking distance to plenty of restaurants and a $7 cab ride to the STL zoo. Great location and service. Will stay again!After reading all the history of this St. Louis landmark, we decided to give it a whirl and stay here. The hotel is housed in a 1920s era building and has a great location; it is next to the major hospitals and the hip, trendy Central West End neighborhood, which has plenty of nightlife, food and drink, and boutique clothing options within walking distance. The rooms are very standard for a so-called luxury (AAA Four Diamond award) hotel. They are smaller and have experienced some wear and tear over the years, and in need of a renovation. There are two hotel bars, the lobby bar, which has live music from 9pm-1am on Friday and Saturday and Cafe Eau, which had VERY unnecessarily LOUD music. The volume was so unbearable at Cafe Eau, we could not hear each other without yelling at the top of our lungs. Needless to say, we walked out the moment we stepped in and went for the calmer, lobby bar with a live, pleasant jazz band. Self-parking is available and was $17.00. Overall, great location, but if you are looking for a glamorous and memorable stay, I would stay elsewhere.Just spent two nights at the Park Chase at a conference. We got a great group rate. (January is obviously not the high season in STL.) The hotel is beautiful, my room was large and very comfortable. But what was really outstanding was the service. Everyone at the hotel from the desk clerks to random employees walking down the halls were extraordinarily friendly and helpful. Is everyone in St. Louis this nice? If so I'm moving there. The gym was the best I've seen in any hotel anywhere. Loads of brand new equipment. Very clean. And the TVs built into the treadmills and ellipticals all worked. (Note: In late Feb. I stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Denver, which takes the prize for the best gym I've ever seen in a hotel. It even has a basketball court and climbing wall!!) The valet parking guys were great too. I'd call down and they had my car waiting for me by the time I got to the lobby. One tip for breakfast: if you don't want to cholesterol pack with eggs and bacon and you don't want coffee that tastes like the pot at your office, the gift shop around the corner has made-to-order coffee and espresso plus croissants.The only place I ever stay in STL. Beautiful hotel, great service, beautiful real flowers in lobby. This time my AC didn't work but a call to engineering had it fixed quickly. Stayed on the 3rd floor of the tower and had an abysmal view of ductwork on a lower roof (minus 1/2 star). Food was great, dinner last night and especially breakfast this morning (Huevos Rancheros!) at the Eau Bistro.The banquet room was loud during our meeting. There was lots of banging around in the service halls and it was distracting.The food was not very healthy or diverse. I don't expect too much from a buffet but the eggs were undercooked and there have been no diabetic or vegetarian alternatives at breakfast.   Thankfully the lunch included some vegetarian options.Do not stay here.  This hotel is one of the worst I've stayed in for years.  Horrible service from valet to bellman to front desk to room service, outdated and stale rooms, tiny closets, a charge for wifi, on and on.   Stay downtown at the Four Seasons when in STL.  Do not waste your time or money at the Chase Park Plaza.My mother stayed here last night. She valet parked her car.  This morning the police were there when she came downstairs.  Her car was one of several to get broken into last night.The concierge woman was very rude.  The manager would not speak to my mother at any point during the day.  They wouldn't compensate her room, or give back to her in any way even though many things were stolen from her car.  The least I would expect was that the people who run the hotel would be sympathetic and kind when a crime happened under their watch.The people at this hotel do not care about the people who stay here.  AND don't bring a car, or there is a good chance your car will get broken into and the hotel won't care.   Stay elsewhere.The hotel is absolutely beautiful, and there is a lot to do - bars, restaurants, a movie theater, a gym, a spa, etc, etc.We tried the massage and manicures at the spa before a wedding and really enjoyed it, and the Sunday brunch was outstanding. You can see the 3-4 level dessert tower from about a mile away, and they had just about everything you'd want to eat along with unlimited mimosas and bloody marys.  The crab macaroni and cheese was great as was a yogurt and cassis-glaze dessert.The hotel is next to Forest Part which was great for a morning run, and isn't far from the metro system - on arrival we took a short bus ride from the metro because it was raining but on leaving we walked (~10 minutes) as it was a beautiful day.As for wedding facilities, the ceremony was downstairs in a chandelier-lit ballroom; the room itself was pretty, though a bit dim.  The reception was on the roof of the hotel and was OUTSTANDING.  Floor-to-ceiling glass, with a view of pretty much everything - big space with area for drinks, a photo booth, a dance floor, dining tables, and a huge outdoor patio (view of the Arch and all) -- just gorgeous.  It was really a perfect location for a wedding reception.Cons:The one big downside, and it was (eventually) remedied by the hotel staff - as with the many other amenities, there's a club/bar downstairs that runs late and the sound goes right through the walls.  Our first room was beautiful but we just couldn't sleep the day before the wedding (even on the fifth floor -- and the club is on the first floor -- it was kind of nuts).  We upgraded to a two-bedroom on the seventh floor that was silent, and the hotel staff allowed us to look at several other rooms to see which would meet our needs.  I liked that that they gave us that choice, but actually would've preferred that they better-knew their rooms so we didn't have to personally evaluate them (we just asked for a room with two beds and two desks that was quiet).Oh, and no wireless internet :-/ In our first room the plug-in connection was on a desk, but in our second room, it was oddly located on the buffet.The room service menu is fairly limited, and at least according to Yelp nothing delivers (odd!), so we opted to eat out or get takeout, which was just fine - Rasoi, an Indian place nearby, was great -- as was Crepes Etc.","['normally', 'come', 'town', 'visit', 'son', 'however', 'undergoing', 'renovations', 'recommended', 'comparable', 'property', 'well', 'truth', 'different', 'types', 'hotels', 'park', 'plaza',

( midly annoying ) cool interior design and style, very contemporary. bar inside hotel and casino attached via skywalk.hotel was a great value for the quality and location.This is my first time gambling in St Louis. This review is purely about the casino area and gambling tables.I played craps, my usual game. Craps dealers were on point, knew their game and all the slang very well. The clientele was about as good as an Oklahoma casino, but when you bet at a 10 dollar table, what do you expect?The drinks were also stupid cheap, but for a good reason.... They sucked. Bar service was very unnattentive. Cocktail service was non-existent as well.Aside from the drinks/service... I'm knocking a point for two other glaring flaws..... 20 bucks to park? Have you gotten high lumiere? I've never seen a casino charge to park.... Yeah yeah you get is validated and the cash office gives you the 20 back, but seriously.... Wtf? Annoying.Also, your selection of slot machines is garbage. I know you're limited on space, but you've got none of the machines I typically ply when I'm up on craps really well..... Fail, epic fail.I'd give it a lower rating if possible. No actually canceled my reservation and booked a room at another hotel. The carpet is dirty and stained, there are no outlets in the rooms to plug chargers into (unless you want to move furniture).At least the staff was accommodating when I asked for a refund.I'm not much of a gambler but I do love to get out and about around my city.  I've played a slot or 2 or 3 or 4 however, I come for people watching, food and amenities.I've eaten at The Kitchen Buffet restaurant which wasn't bad; the food was pretty fresh and well rotated, the also make fresh omelets and waffles to order in the mornings.  There is sushi, chicken (fried &amp; baked) pork, turkey, beef. Plenty of salad options and a small fresh fruit area.  Desserts consist of pies, cake, cookies, gelato and mini tarts.Lots of seating and not disturbed by the nearby casino crowd.  It 's nice if you're with a large group and don't mind buffet style dining.The Diner at Lumiere Place Casino &amp; Hotels in Saint Louis:Too much good breakfast food for the price ! You may say where I can get this at; well if you're into slingers then: the Diner at Lumiere Place Casino &amp; Hotels in Saint Louis is your place.So what's a slinger simply put it's a Saint Louis styled garbage plate for more info on versions: (<a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSlinger&amp;s=6014af32c6b82d1cc8482b19b4104f55d2c3f5146858318e1beecc99c9b25aca"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sl...</a>) I ordered my version with chill, eggs over easy cheese, hash browns, sourdough toast, and skillet potatoes. It was good meal no matter if it was 2 am. The only complaint: I asked for no jalapeno peppers and the food took all day.But hey, it was early am: I was too tired and hungry to complain and good things come to those that wait.... and even with the jalapeno peppers...This was a good thing!!The casino interior is very nice and modern. Design and architecture get an A+. Cleanliness, a D-. But dear God the staff is a hot mess and have two speeds, slow and slower than molasses. The ""welcome"" counter is more like a ""why are you interrupting me"" counter. The gate keepers at the entrance of the casino carded me and then made me wait for 10 minutes without explaining what was the problem. When I asked, ""Sir, what seems to be the problem, I was ignored. I was finally allowed in but no explanation as to why I was held up. One of the restaurant inside, The Diner, had two tables seated, yet it took a waitress 10 minutes to seat us. I didn't eat but my husband said his waffle and bagel were good. The GM needs to be fired immediately and all managers need some customer service training. Next time we're in town, we'll make the drive to a different casino.I'm not much of a gambler, I just visited to meet some friends but the atmosphere of this place is pretty depressing.  The restaurants have terrible service and food to match, the restrooms were disgusting, and I could be wrong but it seemed like people were on the verge of fighting when I was waiting for a stall to open.Don't stay here. I had rather high expectations for this hotel but it did not meet any of them. While it's ok clean, it is not a luxury hotel. And don't bring kids here, just don't don't do it. The pool is bigger than most  hotels but much smaller than a luxury hotel's pool. The pool area is extreme plain and drab and if you have small children, 5-9 yrs old, they can only stand in the first 3 ft of the pool as it gets too deep very quickly. The attendant would not allow the kids to jump into the pool although it's not posted anywhere. The attendant will just tell them to stop jumping. I understand no diving, but i don't understand no jumping. Another guest with four children, was as confused as I was on that one. We were the only two families in the pool area, couldn't have been disturbing anyone yet the kids were not allowed to jump off the side of the pool, into the pool. Although the rooms are two rooms divided by a door and decently spacious, the bathroom is by far the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in a hotel. You can be sitting on the toilet and reach the doorknob to open the door. The lighting is horrendous. Two lights over the vanity, nothing in the shower.  Also missing is the fan to take the moisture that builds up quickly in this tiny bathroom. The shower head is pathetic also. I've had much better bathrooms at the Holiday Inn Express or many other hotels. Although the room is made to accommodate 6, with 2 double beds and a sofa sleeper, they don't provide enough towels, pillows or blankets and when you call for them, they say they will bring them but don't. Had to call again the next day. Housekeeping never came to tidy up the room. The front desk was courteous upon check-in. (That might be the only friendly person we met there.) Management was unavailable to take a phone call from me at 7pm and the voicemail that I left about a few concerns went unreturned. Paint chipping, wallpaper pulling up, and stained furniture were all present in our room. Lastly, they actually charge $50 deposit to your card per night for incidentals and it's not put back on your card until 10-14 days later. I've heard of authorizing your card but I've never seen an actual charge happen at a hotel. If you're wanting to stay here to gamble, then buck up a little more and stay at The Four Seasons which is connected to the casino and is truly a luxury hotel or go to the Ameristar in St Charles.  There are lots of really nice options for hotels in St Louis, unfortunately this is not one of them.Checked out The Diner in the casino... It was decent. The buffet was too crowded so we checked out what used to be the burger bar. My waitress didn't seem interested at all. The food was just okay how do you cook to order and the food is lukewarm? The pancakes were decent. I'd probably try lunch next timeWhat a dump!Need an update  bad!Rooms look like they  were  furnished  by leftovers  from  the Brady Bunch set Nasty stained carpet Found a sock behind  a door Small bathroom Dont walk around  the neighborhood  at night unless  you  want to get robbed Poor service  at restaurantsThis review is for the hotel only...Decent hotel, friendly staff, great location but feels like the 1970s. For the most part the hotel was clean with the exception of some of the hallway carpets. The rooms are spacious but could use some serious updating. The old decor made the room feel very stale and old school. The walkway inside of the hotel offers easy access to the attached casino. For those of us who don't gamble, the best thing about this place is the proximity to Laclede's Landing and the free shuttle nearby. I don't think that I'll be staying here again as I'm the kind of person who enjoys more of the upscale and updated hotels. Overall a solid 3 stars.Avoid this casino. The ownership change from Pinnacle to Tropicana has produced the worst customer service and experience I've ever encountered in a casino under 10 years in age. First, they are taking every advantage they can to make a penny here and. Their slot return is  poor (2% liess than the Casino Queen just one mile away across the river). But the coup de grace was beginning the inclusion of Top 3 side bets on their blackjack tables. This is the WORST ODDS FOR A PLAYER in the casino - the house advance is 27;1. Worse yet, while other casinos held the minimum to $1 play on Top 3, not Lumiere - their Top 3 minimum is $5. A player can easily lose $50 in 15 minutes playing this $5 minimum. During off-peak times, they'll have just 4 blackjack tables open (excluding the high limit room). Casino Queen during off peak has 6 tables open. The people who work at the Trop Advantage players member desk are often short and rude.The player rewards are the worst for any casino in the area. If you are primarly a table player, your rewards are next-to-nothing. The facility has just once entrance so you have to walk forever to get in. The Diner is very nice, that's about the only positive. The sports bar/restaurant was taken over by the firm that markets Ozzie Smith restaurants. It's ok. The buffet is no value - food is average but prices exorbitant - $34 on Saturday night. Ridiculous for a casino. There are some nights they charge $20 to park! Security is asleep at the switch - a murder was committed outside the casino a year ago. NEARLY FORGOT THIS: I tried to tip a porter $5 for being helpful to me when I was recovering from a broken ankle - he said Lumiere does not let employees like him accept tips. What does that tell you about management and ownership?Now you know why it gets one star from me. I will go occasionally - only because I've made some good friendships with some of the dealers and pit crew.I loved this hotel. The hotel room was awesome and it had nice atmosphere. I called and had some car trouble on way to delay my arrival time. However, the manager was not very understanding about that even though my room was already paid in full. Just a little added stess but overall nice hotelI have to admit that service at Lumiere Place has really gone downhill ever since the sale from Pinnacle Entertainment to Tropicana Entertainment. I have been on a handful of occasions ever since the sale last year, and I have noticed subtle ""improvements"". Most notably is the addition of mandatory parking fees enforced every Friday and Saturday night. The fee is $20, which can be reimbursed, however the process is a bit of a headache forcing you to gamble first, then visit the MyChoice Center to get your parking pass stamped, then trek over to the cage to collect $20. No offense, but that is a lot of work to get back your money. I am not sure why this process cannot be as simple as visiting the cage to get your refund after gambling. Then again I believe the reason behind this is that the average customer will forget leaving the casino never cashing in their parking voucher.My most recent visit was on a Friday night, I had a voucher for a B1G1 meal and decided to give it a go. I didn't realize that until I got in line for the parking lot that I had forgot my card. The parking attendant was rude and less than helpful and informed me that I had to pay $20 to even park or have a Gold Players Card, unfortunately I had neither on me at the time. I informed her of such and that I intended to use the ATM inside and gamble a bit after by dinner. She could have cared less, and told me that I could park somewhere downtown, walk to the casino, use an ATM, walk back to my car, and then park in the lot. I decided to try my luck at the garage, since the parking lot attendant was a lost cause. Same problem was encountered in the garage, with both attendants telling me that I could park elsewhere to come inside the casino to use their ATM, and then park in the garage. Now parking elsewhere might not have been a bad idea if Lumiere didn't turn North 1st Street into their own ""Private Road"" taking away all the parking spots and replacing them with ""No Parking, Private Road"" signs.  While I was waiting in line to even get to the parking booth, I watch 4 cars have to turn around because they either had no cash on them or they didn't have a players card, this leads me to believe that this is a common occurrence that could be solved by a ""CASH ONLY"" sign. Common sense, right?Needless to say I didn't end up visiting Lumiere Place that night, but I did try to call and voice my concern. Which ultimately was a waste of time as the lady that I spoke with informed me that I would need to come into the casino to file a complaint. ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!!!!!  I am not paying $20, to complain! After a few minutes she decided to take down my information and I provided her with my contact name, only to be told that they do not call people back. When I asked about calling and reporting this to Tropicana Entertainment, she said that all complaints are handled at Lumiere Place and that calling corporate wouldn't matter. Well we will see, as I will be drafting a letter to Tropicana Entertainment later this week. Now with all that said, I totally understand the need to prevent others from simply parking in the casino in an attempt to score free parking during peak hours. However with that being said they need to better educate their employees, and offer alternative ways to pay or offering some customer service at times. One would think with all the money they are bringing in collecting $20/per car two nights a week that they could afford some top notch security team to patrol the parking lots and that the area would be devoid of any crime. Think again.2015-06-16 - Police find sleeping man in stolen car at Lumiere Casino<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffox2now.com%2F2015%2F06%2F16%2Fpolice-find-sleeping-man-in-stolen-car-at-lumiere-casino%2F&amp;s=c578af8f6138e9a87d0784b90686c762bb78bd7cb281930b012a22b33907beae"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">fox2now.com/2015/06/16/p...</a>2015-06-06 - A robber shot and killed a man waiting for a party bus near the Lumiere Place Casino and Hotel early Saturday<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stltoday.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fcrime-and-courts%2Frobber-fatally-shoots-man-near-lumiere-casino-wounds-a-woman%2Farticle_9ce8ed54-72e9-585a-a6cb-89f63943ac42.html&amp;s=089fd403ade3134bc2c43ea8d6f7d05936db3760897b4b8176ae9a340991e483"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">stltoday.com/news/local/...</a>2015-05-18 - 10 spots most St. Louis car break-ins occur (92 car break-ins at Lumiere Place over 4 years)<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ksdk.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2F2015%2F05%2F18%2Ftonight-10-spots-most-stl-car-break-ins-happen%2F27537775%2F&amp;s=afe4a42a118157fc72c5fccb1dd3428a06b5b5644708baf68f0035cd2cfff341"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">ksdk.com/story/news/2015...</a>2014-12-30 - Construction worker hit by stray bullet<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ksdk.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fcrime%2F2014%2F12%2F30%2Fconstruction-worker-hit-by-stray-bullet%2F21079039%2F&amp;s=abb874d96b3a646d44031b1cb19f6501ba5be1e54f28602afc9d2570aacae522"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">ksdk.com/story/news/crim...</a>2014-10-01 - Affton women robbed after trip to casino<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffox2now.com%2F2014%2F10%2F01%2Faffton-women-robbed-after-trip-to-casino%2F&amp;s=7af0a71421b93e80b91aaec97bfb24c81ccb3094f3259b6ed973364609b54bb0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">fox2now.com/2014/10/01/a...</a>2014-07-05 - Two killed, two wounded in overnight St. Louis shootings<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffox2now.com%2F2014%2F07%2F05%2Fovernight-shootings-in-st-louis-wound-three%2F&amp;s=4e99f53d5d03425fbe6d0642a3fdad0d13532b26d57e827267ccfd4891f4d3a9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">fox2now.com/2014/07/05/o...</a>2011-12-28 - Couple robbed at gunpoint in Lumiere Place Casino garage<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ksdk.com%2Fnews%2Farticle%2F293260%2F3%2FCouple-robbed-at-gunpoint-in-Lumiere-Place-Casino-garage&amp;s=e572f760d1e5c50cc679890cd73fa45991d952e4740cae7f0a1a9901b520f057"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">ksdk.com/news/article/29...</a>Use some common sense if using their ""secure"" garage , and most importantly arrive with cash &amp; your players card. I however will be taking my business elsewhere!Hotel review: Upon checkout, this joke of a hotel has gone from 3 stars to 1 star. The first room we were given on the 8th floor had no AC, so after attempting to sleep in a room that was 82 degrees when it was set to 50, we moved rooms.2nd room: Shower doesn't work. When you pull the lever to change it from bath to shower, nothing happens. There's also a mini fridge where we stored our leftovers from dinner. What a surprise, that is broken too, completely spoiling all our food. Front desk says they can't fix the shower or mini fridge. Onto room number 3.3rd room: No apparent problems until checkout. We did not eat or drink anything from the mini fridge, however, each time you open the mini fridge door THEY CHARGE YOU! They charged us money for opening the mini fridge door where we had kept a bottle of water. You've got to be effing kidding me.. Hot tub in the pool area doesn't work (what a surprise nothing works in this shit hole) so don't even bother unless you want to sit in room temperature (not even hot) water with a bunch of strangers.Avoid this hotel at all costs. All the employees and managers are uneducated, rude, idiots who don't know how to handle guests relations. I guess that's what you get when you hire people with no more than a high school diploma to run a hotel. I hope someone from management reads this review because I would be mortified to have my name associated with this joke of a hotel..They discriminate against whites. They're 5'2"" state trooper couldn't ride half the rides at great America but was acting like Ali. This shithole wouldn't last In Chicago.MOST HONEST REVIEW FROM SOMEONE WITH CONTINUED EXPERIENCE AND DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Let me start with this first complaint... NOBODY KNOWS WTF THEY ARE DOING! I've never seen a more unorganized operation in my life. I continued to give this piece of shit casino (WORST CASINO IVE EVER BEEN TO) business time and time again ONLY because it's a few miles from my home. NOT ANY MORE. ANY restaurant you dine at expect a wait even if there's NO ONE fucking there. Most poorly managed restaurants I've ever been to and I've been around the restaurant business for many years. On top of the fact, you will OVER pay for BELOW average food that you wait WAY too long for to be disappointed. I've had CONTINUOUS problems from wait times, to poor food quality, to rude employees, etc. I have STORIES FOR DAYS. It's truly embarrassing as it is impressive how they are still in operation with such terrible businesses?!? They solve their problems by avoiding and not addressing them. Hence what has brought me here today. This is only the beginning....On top of ONE STAR restaurants, they provide a HALF star hotel. My first stay at Hotelumiere I moved rooms TWICE before getting a room that satisfied BASIC needs (proper room temp and working mini bar). So then they ""upgraded"" me to a room that just had more space for, pointless. Be careful of their SNAKE room charges because they don't tell you at the front desk if you take something out of that ""mini bar"" YOU HAVE THIRTY SECONDS OR YOU HAVE BEEN CHARGED. The mini bar has sensors that time when items are moved. When I expressed my feelings on how my stay went the hotel manager she said that she thought my words were ""belittling"" to her... SORRY YOU FUCKING SUCK AT MANAGING A HOTEL! I could tell she did NOT have the education, experience, or knowledge to be running such a position. The hotel is not worth it. I HAVENT EVEN STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE CASINO YET! I tried to block out the outside casino experiences and have some fun inside but what is awful on the outside is still BAD on the inside. The door security checking IDs are SO FUCKING DUMB, hence why they check, then tables have to re-check, and re-check inside the casino! It gets FUCKING ANNOYING. One time they weren't going to let me in because I was TOO INTOXICATED, I didn't have ONE drink and finally talking to this ignorant terrible fucking manager they were going to ""let me in."" You stupid fucks I'd probably start with an apology for your employees being so FUCKING RETARDED! But, nope, another INCOMPETANT employee. I had a room booked for that night and the next just for a mini getaway and I CANCELED because I was too pissed off too sleep there. The table dealers are 50/50. Half hate life and have an attitude for no reason and the others are so fake they might as well have manikin dealers. The pit bosses are nice and respectful for the most part (which is standard) but they solve ZERO problems/complaints so WHAT IS THEIR PURPOSE?! How anyone gave more than 2 stars to this place must set their standards LOW for how someone should be treated when entering a casino. I went out to AMERISTAR tonight and let me tell you for a first time player they treated me with more respect in ONE night than Lumiere has in YEARS! FIVE STAR experience!! That's more than Lumiere has EVER GIVEN and they fuck up ALL THE TIME!!! FUCK THE LUMIERE! WORST CASINO IN THE ST LOUIS AREA AND BEYONDDD!!! Go to RIVER CITY if you want to stay close or make the worth it drive to AMERISTAR! I hope this casino goes BANKRUPT sooner than later. End of rant. I feel better now...This is the worst casino I've ever been to in my life. And I lived in Vegas for years so I'm judging from a wide base...this joint is the worst. First off, you have to go thru this stupid ID check with security guards before entering the casino floor. They inspect that shit like they're looking for ebola molecules. Then I swear this is what the security guard asks me while holding my drivers license: ""What are you doing here today?""  Ummm...well this is a casino with gambling, bars and restaurants, I think everyone here is obviously throwing away money in one of these areas. They didn't like my response of ""Stimulating the economy"" and for a second it looked like the pseudo-cop was going to prevent me from going inside the dump, but finally the dark forces prevailed and I was allowed inside the joke of a casino known as Lumiere Place.There are only a few tables on the floor to play card games. Of course there are rows upon rows of slot machines, but they're all as old as my grandpa's balls. Seriously, the machines are ones that Vegas retired in the 90's. We posted up at one of the bars and took in the grossness of the joint from a proper perspective..liquored up and elevated a few steps above the ground. The customers were sad. The bartenders were sad. The atmosphere and vibe were sad. The place was just fucking sad. I only came here because we made the mistake of staying in the Hotel Lumiere next door on a cross country road trip. That hotel sucks balls too. Just be smart and stay away from this property as a whole.I beelined it to the blackjack table and got smoked out by a dealer called Dizzie. She was puerto Rican I think, and dished out more 15s than a high school pimp. I hung on by my teeth while she pulled out improbable runs of impossible cards with her fast hands and her poker face and what the hell could her real name have been? Desiree? Deirdre? Just Dizzie? I should have asked, it's bugging me now. Casinos are kinda all the same, with their no clocks and their how-long-have-I-been-here's. I liked this one, it was cozy in a down-home sort of way and lacked the high-roller sophistication and technological innovation of, say, your Macau money dens, which was comforting in a way I can't describe. Felt like I could run into a friendly aunt or uncle here on their weekly lose-the-pension run. Pro tip: play the Alice in Wonderland slots. Holy hell. 3D graphics, dancing fairies, lights and sounds and free spins for no reasons at all.Me and some friends went it was our first time being at a casino. So I don't have others to compare it to. It was fun tho, and in a good location, you can gamble for a bit then go for a drink/dance at the many bars there on the landing.","truly awful service especially by the manager. my food was never given to me at The Kitchen and was still charged for that and double charged for cocktails. will never come back.Highly impressed with the value of this place.  Perfect location and connected to tons of restaurants and a casino plus walking distance to rams stadium and many other bars/restaurants.  Uber is a great choice to get anywhere else and cost only $5-$10 per ride to almost anywhere in the downtown area.  The lobby of the hotel is very impressive.  Our room was a suite (2 rooms, 2 tvs, wet bar, couch, table and chairs, etc.) and I still can't believe it was only $89 for such a huge room right downtown!  You can tell the place is older and had some older type smells, but nothing that bad.  Can't beat the price!  Checking in and out were very smooth and we went right in.  I highly recommend!Ate at the Kitchen,  I have actually had better food at less expensive prices.  The only very good food was the crab legs and the boiled shrimpI love going to the casino, but I will never ever ever go to this casino again ever. We went in expecting to get our players card and comp's but nothing in the matter. Just play for 1hr or so and 5 dollars will be given back plus you have to use a dollar to start that comp.. So here I wanted just a something to take the edge off of losing. Maybe a free drink. Nope!  Most of the drinks are 5 an up so I might as well go to the club for over price water down drinks.. So please, just please go somewhere else.I will say that I did like the connection (Lumiere Link) between the Stadium and Lumiere Place.  I didn't have to try and cross that crazy traffic, just ride on the people mover conveyor belts.  Nice touch.  After that, however, things went down hill.  The One Star rating is for the Lumiere's casino .  I didn't stick around to try the food or stay in the hotel.  However, I did pass by the sports themed restaurant and the hostess had her head buried in the podium, never once looking up to acknowledge us and invite us inside.  Instead, she was as inviting as a Do Not Enter sign.  The good vibes from the Lumiere Link were gone.Then came the hazy smoke.  The thick, acrid smell surrounded us.  I think management must pridefully point to the fact that they have air filtration systems, but those machines certainly didn't eradicate the problem.  Everywhere I turned, there was someone with a cigarette in their hand, puffing away. I was resigned to the fact that my clothes would stink and the joy I once felt of spending some time in the casino was crushed.At this point, my wife and I had already decided that spending the evening here was out of the question.  We decided we'd simply play $20 each on the Wheel of Fortune slot (an old favorite) and head back to our hotel.  We found the machines in the back of the casino.  There were three.  One was broken.  One was occupied by a seemingly innocent casino guest merrily spending her money and the last one was open.  My wife sat down next to her.  Within moments, we saw the error in our decision.  My wife put in her money, played one round and the woman lit up her cancer stick.  Smoke wafted across our machine, into our eyes and in our lungs.  We immediately ""cashed out"", took our ticket and found another machine to play - far away from any other human lest they too decide smoking in such close quarters was socially acceptable.We each played one machined for $20, then left the casino.  Fortunately, I won some money from my original $20, so the smoky experience only cost us a total of $8.25 (my wife wasn't as lucky this time).Look - I don't really care someone smokes or not.  As the saying goes, if you want to kill yourself, go do it as long as it doesn't affect me.   As a non-smoker, I do enjoy going to restaurants, shops and malls without inhaling someone else's second hand smoke.  But casino's get a special pass on the no-smoking ordinances and their patrons are free to puff away to their heart's destruction.  I find that to be a shame...The hotel is fine.  I travel for business quite often and contrary to some business travelers don't want to put the most expensive hotel in the area on a charge just to say so. I've been to this hotel once a quarter for the last three years but won't be going back which is sad because I love their staff. The hotel staff is by far the friendliest of everywhere I travel.  I don't really order room service, I do here the guy who does the breakfast deliveries regularly, is so freaking courteous it's beyond compare. I actually rebooked.  Their bar staff has bartenders who are organized and nice, great people skills.  The hotel front clerk is pretty kind, they can get a little disorganized when its prime check in time but that works. The hotel itself could use some structural improvements including newer carpets and tables but that's not a biggie with me especially given the cost.What really irks me here is the casino side, I enjoy having something to relax with after the business day is ended.  I dont game huge but enjoy going places where I can play a few hundred and most importantly have a good time.  The Casino's staff is by far the rudest individuals on the planet.  Three years ago they were fine.  My past three trips there though, its taken a huge decline.  I've seen it with the dealers and casino floor personnel.  Top that off with the front security, which doesn't actually label in and out ropes, yet yelled at me when I was leaving for going out the wrong ""roped"" aisle.  It wasn't just that but its a good example, I eventually complained to one of the managers this last time.  I was told all Casino's were like this (an inherent lie since I've been to several) ....he recommended If I didn't like it there I could go elsewhere.  I'm taking his advice.I've been to a lot of casinos and this is the worst, by far.  Just a dud.  The only cool thing was the gentleman at the entrance; very polite and let me right in.First, the walk from downtown.  I actually walked from the Cardinals game and when I finally got to the place was met by a large cement wall that apparently surrounds the complex.  I walked and walked and walked around this thing until I got the Four Seasons.  And I'm the only one on these streets and it's getting more and more remote along the way.  Not very inviting.  I'll bet this is the world's only Four Seasons surrounded by a prison wall - I'm surprised there wasn't barbed wire.Once inside, looked like a great place, though largely empty.  There is a decent selection of table games and I did a route around them looking to see what was there and what I wanted to play.  Craps looked okay, couldn't find any real blackjack and came across Three Card Poker and decided to start there.Remember the scene from Casino where the cowboy has his feet on one of the chairs and De Niro asks his bouncers to ""open the door with his face?""  Well, that's who was occupying the seats at this table, though much rougher looking.  Six chairs, three guys, two with feet in seats.  Here I am wanting to donate money to the casino and these guys are taking up two chairs.  The dealer paid no attention to me or another guy also hovering, looking to play.  I thought about saying something but there was just no feng shui so I just left, as did the other guy. I walked around a few more minutes then left.  It is certainly the only time in my life I've walked into a casino and didn't wager a penny. Not a penny.  It just had this awful vibe, didn't seem like fun.  Almost felt like the ""last resort.""  Made me question lots of things about my life!  What the hell am I doing in this hell hole?And it's attached to a Four Seasons?  For real?I can't imagine ever stepping foot in that place again.  I do a bit of business in the city and will save my money for Vegas or anywhere else.This cannot be real life.  I came here almost a year ago with my wife, and fellow yelper, and everyone was run out of the Casino under the guise of a threat.  She swore she would never return, since the employees were wiping down the machines as we were shuttled out.  I convinced my wife to come here tonight for her birthday, and it's closed from a power failure 5 hours earlier.  What?????  Closed after a cards game ends?  How can a casino be profitable doing business like that???  Sooooo disappointed.   Never again.  Hollywood or River City from here on out.We came here randomly while we were downtown. Large and modern casino.  Tons and tons of slot machines. I never got to see what tables they had but I had a great time. We had a cocktail at the sports bar and they had some of the most reasonable prices for drinks that I've seen.Had a small issue the staff went above and beyond on accommodating.   Definitely will refer everyone to these two hotels.  I'm in sales.  And not often that I say I was impressed.  Great job guys.Ate at The Wok for supper. Took 20 minutes for the server to notice me and get my order. Took almost an hour before they serve the food. Staff were not friendly.I bought tickets to an event at Lumiere Live and was very excited, however my experience at this venue was just one disappointment after another. It started when I arrived and I was made to pay for parking...excuse me? I had already spent 70 bucks on the tickets. Then I was told by the parking attendant I could be reimbursed if I spent 25 dollars in food, okay fine with me. So I spent 60 on the buffet for myself and fiance with intentions of getting 20 back. So we went to the show and had a decent time. Then we ate and got our parking voucher validated and were told to give it to the parking attendant to get the 20. WRONG. When we got to the lot with the ticket we were scolded by the man working the lot. He yelled at my fiance and I and said we needed to get the refund inside at the Trop Advantage counter. This made me furious. So I went back inside and ended up waiting at that counter for an hour only to find out he'd sent me to the wrong place. I only needed to go straight to the cashier cage. So long story short, Lumiere stole an hour of my life for 20 bucks I should have never had to pay in the first place. I spent hundreds of dollars that night and was treated rudely by the staff, especially the parking attendant. The young man who was working the lot on September 12, 2015 at 11 pm needs to be reprimanded!Zero stars. Terrible in about every way. Pit bosses to food options to customer service  I would rather sit at home, warm up a frozen meal and flip a quarter.Slots are somewhat tight with the exception of quarters and nickels. The service is mediocre at best I do like the free slot play they give me every month which is the only reason I go there. Casino is very smokey and hard to breathe. I personally prefer the casino queen across the river. It's nicer, cleaner and smoke free and I've won many times on their slot machines in the past.Gonna lay that money . . . dooooowwwwwn!!!!I love to gamble.  I love to smoke, drink, and gamble.  You can do all these things at Lumiere Place.  Even though this casino is the closest to my home, it would never be my first choice.I was asked to meet up here on Friday night.  I decided to cab it over, trying to avoid the inconvenience of finding parking on the Landing.  Lumiere seems to have its own lot, but I wasn't sure if it cost money or not.  After the fact, I discovered that they actually have a garage that was free.  Either way, driving around the Landing doesn't appeal to me.  A few weeks back I had to drop off some friends there and ended up in East Saint Louis, a result all too common when trying to navigate that area.If you are at al claustrophobic, this casino is not for you.  Everything is right on top of each other.  It's about the most uncomfortable setting to gamble in, especially with the spread out River City is not too far down the road.  I have a specific game that I like to play, but I never found it.  There was just too much commotion on a Friday night to get comfortable.The beer is a little expensive, $4.25 for a Bud Light.  Everyone else was drinking it, so I went ahead and followed suit!  I felt giving that evening and bought my buddy a mixed drink.  That was $6.25.  Perhaps Lumiere should adopt the Vegas style where gamblers get free drink.  Perhaps I would have been more inclined to throw some money into a machine!Sadly, I didn't gambling Friday night.  I was just uncomfortable in that setting.  I don't see me patronizing this place.  It is a rare case where I would rather spend time in St. Charles County than fight the crowded and unappealing atmosphere that Lumiere Place has created.I should give this place a one star, but some of the employees are really nice, others are a nightmare, let me explain.So we come here a lot actually, have since it opened, was there the first night, etc.  It had so much promise when it opened up, it was the Vegas of St Louis and all of that, but now it has turned into what every casino eventually becomes, a evil smoky nasty cesspool.One night, we rolled up in here and because my teal and silver plaid pants were plaid, and I was deemed to be in my pajamas and in strict violation of the dress code, this woman who worked there looked me up and down and told me I ain't getting in there dressed like that.  I felt my blood pressure rise, but I actually didn't say a word and went home, and put on a pair of effing pajama jeans and got right in.  Now, looking at their website, you will not see a dress code, its listed no where, but the woman security guard took great pride in embarrassing me in front of people.  Another fun fact about that night, after we got in, I saw a woman in red plaid pajama pants chain smoking and beating on a machine, and that was cool.  Also some guy was sagging his jeans in the bar, but that was ok as well.  Ridiculous.So lets go back to last Sunday where once again, I got treated like crap from some woman employee, all because we were victims of theft, so its also a place for a bunch of scammers.While my friend and I played our machines my husband went to get us drinks and had about 60 bucks or so in his machine, he had put in 100.  Well while my friend and I were obsessed over the Wizard of Oz machine, which is pretty effing fun, some street urchin, slid into my husbands seat, played with his money, then took it out and went and cashed it out.  We never noticed a thing.  Its very scary to think that someone was watching us and was bold enough to do what they did.  So my husband comes back, notices the money gone, and calls security.  This security woman came over and sat in the machine and she had the biggest attitude towards us.  She was so mad that I was kinda upset about what just happened.  The way she was talking to me was atrocious.  When I asked her to maybe review the cameras before she gets all crazy with me, she shot me a look that basically would have killed me.  I seriously thought John Quinones was going to come out and we were part of some joke.  Then we discovered my friends wallet was missing out her purse!The casino basically would not admit what happened and explained that the woman who took the money out of the machine it was just an accident, I mean are you serious?  My friends wallet was recovered in a bathroom, but we were supposed to just believe she dropped it, which was a crock, she never would have done that and her purse was in a position to be thieved as we sat there oblivious.I would never take anyone to this crime ridden astray.  What a disgrace this has become.  I miss Cecil and the boat.Do not waste your time if you can go somewhere else!! I was there last night and had a terrible experience.  The place is under renovations of some sort. Half of the slots were not open.  They have moved their table locations and they are directly in the middle of the entrance. It was a complete cluster mess.  Nothing can compare to the amount of smoke in the air.  They have always allowed smoking but also had non smoking sections.  This was not the case apparently and I left reeking of smoke and I'm a non smoker. Disgusting! My last experience was also awful, so I don't think I will be returning.  Tropicana, I thought would be better for the Lumiere but I am thinking not so much. Skip this place and head to a different casino. I recommend the Casino Queen, great prices, more payouts, and send lots of mailers with room discounts.  You will be glad you didn't waste your time.I don't really like to gamble, so my experiences here are limited to say the least.  I've gambled here maybe twice.  I cannot stand to lose money so usually my experiences here are limited to events or to parking in their garage for a local event.  That said, the parking here is borderline horrid.  Borderline.  Not quite full blown horrid, but borderline.  The problem is that this garage is easy to get lost in.  I never find my car right away.  I never seem to return from the same door I left from.  I don't know why, but it happens every time!My biggest issue though is the people that use the garage.  It is NOT a NASCAR track!  The last visit I had here, I was nearly hit by three different cars that felt a need to whip around corners at high rates of speed.  The security team needs to do something to enforce these reckless drivers!As for the hotel, I think it is a nice place to stay.  I couldn't tell you if the price is worth it because the rooms I've seen have always been comped.  I have family from KC that gambles all the time, and they seem to be in town a few times per year thanks to comp vouchers.  The restaurants, bars, and other little shops are ok, I don't spend time in any of them, but they always look to be full of people having a good time!Hotel--Disgusting.  Our room looked to be from the 60's, the decor was outdated, stains all over floors, bathroom is tiny, rude employees, overpriced, no vending machines, horrible wi-fi connection, no cable, no free lunches, breakfast.  All food is way overpriced and taste like a frozen dinner.  Horrible experience.  Casino--Was with 4 of my friends, got into the casino after being interrogated by security for far too long.  Went in and each of us had ONE drink, decided we wanted to get something to eat.  We left for about 10 mins and came back, 3 of us got through the security but 1 friend got turned away for being too drunk.  Yet we were okay to go in 10 mins prior.  BTW, my friend had only had 1 drink at the casino, and maybe 4 drinks over an 7 hour period.  Ridiculous.  Give the wrong people some power and it really hurts your business.  I will never return to this casino.  Stick with Hollywood, much better employees and they treat you like they want you there.I think the hotel only has 1 person responsible for bell hop and valet, so valet parking consistently takes 10-20 mins for drop offs and pickups. Self parking is also a paperwork hassle.Elevators also did not work half the time.Overall, the worst hotel I have ever been too.","I'm a gambling enthusiast so this review is of the casino only. It has that Pseudo-Vegas feel to it when you first walk in, flashing lights, thin film of smoke, the works. I've made it my business to go to all casinos in the St. Louis area but this one is sadly my least favorite so far. The dealers at the table while mute at first will engage you after pulling their leg. If I wanted automatons for dealers I would play online casino games. Another note to add to their table issues for me: the day I went the table limits started out higher than other casinos norms. I'm not sure if this is them trying to be more ""high profile than the competition or what but that should have been my sign to leave from the beginning. Next we have the slots. Personally I just have horrid luck with slots and usually stick with table games but being at a new casino I had to test it out. A few wins, but while I was there for 3 hours I heard no jackpot excitement. That made me wonder what was I doing here?All in all I did have fun losing my money but would not go back to gamble personally. Especially since their whole ""New members play up to $500 on the house"" rule is only them sending you coupons to their restaurants; which I've yet to see in the mail. They know I don't want to come back.Heh. Lumiere. I love your free parking garage and your free fountain soda drinks in the casino area. I don't really much care for your smoke, though. That's my number one gripe with casinos other than the fact that I just don't really gamble. EW SMOKE. It agitates my lungs and sometimes causes my allergies to flare up. But anyway. I went there knowing it was a smoking establishment but thankfully the show I went to with Stephanie S. and Christine F. was totally smoke free! Yay! I was so glad to be able to enjoy a great show with these lovely ladies without worrying about casino smoke. When I get home from going to Ameristar (usually visiting my BF at work or going to a restaurant), my clothes REEK of smoke. Like hella bad. Sometimes it takes two showers and products to get the stench out of my hair. I can't believe Sean has to deal with that every night he works. (All Poker Rooms in STL are nonsmoking btw. The smoke permeates through.)  I'm seriously worried he's getting lung cancer from second hand smoke. I didn't not smell as strongly after leaving Lumiere! In fact, my hair didn't smell at all but that's probably because I was upstairs the entire time, away from smoke! Anyway... mini rant aside.... Lumiere isn't a bad place to go see a show, that's for sure. Finding the garage can be confusing as balls if you've never been before so the only piece of advice I can give is that it's on Carr street. Go down toward the Landing and make a left onto 1st street, then another left on Carr, and then it's up on the left before you hit the next intersection. It's easy to miss so don't fret if you do! They also have parking up front outdoors but it can fill up mighty fast and I believe it's free as well.The concert area is near the Hamburger Bar but upstairs. It's kind of a smallish theater but still decent sized. There's a bar in the back. I think you have to be 21 no matter what to get in the concert area if the bar is being used but I could be wrong on that. The acoustics could be better but that's a minor gripe.Also, protip: The Lumiere garage is connected to the Four Seasons Hotel. So if  you want to grab drinks at Cielo but don't want to pay for parking at that hotel, just park in Lumiere's garage and take the elevator to the 8th floor to get to Cielo!!PS: Poker has the best odds in the casino so if you've never been and you're at a loss for what to play (casino newb, like me?) play poker. No, not that E-Z poker stuff. I mean like, Texas Hold 'Em. And tip the dealers, please!! Okay I may be biased because I live with one, lol, but apparently a lot of players don't even realize you're supposed to do that because otherwise they make like 3 bucks an hour! O__O;If you can make it to Ameristar, GO THERE!!!! Not the best of crowd, very cramped and a SLOW, inexperienced dealers whom add nothing to offer to the experience. After I spent a bit off time on the Roulette Table, my wife moved on to play Blackjack, so I decided to walk around to see what this place might have to offer in the lines of acceptable entertainment.. Hard to find on Casino Floor, So I left the Casino entrance to walk around the restaurant court.. Found nothing, so I proceeded to re-enter the Casino Floor. Well, after the Doorman viewed my license, he then proceeded to ask me if I had been drinking, I replied ""yes"". He asked how much I had to drink, I was honest and said ""4-5 Beers"". He then stated that I would not be allowed back onto the Casino Floor. I politely said ""OK, I understand Sir."" (Was ready to get the heck off this place anyway), so I asked to speak to a Floor Manager so they could inform my wife, whom was unaware of my whereabouts and current situation. The manager kindly agreed to find her for me and stated that because I said to have consumed a large amount of alcoholic beverages, I couldn't be allowed back in. He returned with her 10 minutes later. First time for everything.. In my opinion, not a very effective Management Model for a Casino.. If I owned a casino, I would place an entrance  ban on any and all Sober and Sane people. Well, in this case, Lumiere actually did that..Thanks for making it an easy choice next time we decide to partake in such entertainment. GO TO AMERISTAR,, SO MUCH BETTER!!! TRUST ME.What a deceiving casino! Don't get me wrong, I know that the House always come out on top majority of the time. But this not what I meant by Lumiere being deceitful. The front of their entrance stated ""No Smoking"", yet smoking was allowed inside and the lack of ventilation left me smelling like a walking cigarettes within an hour of just being there. This is only the beginning... a group of us decided to shoot craps. I'm new to the game so I wanted to watch first while the rest played. I had my money exchanged into chips and placed them in front of me but I waited a few rounds to get a feel for the game. As I was there, it started to get busy with onlookers bc the shooter was ""hot"". It was a small crowd that gathered but they didn't have any chips nor where they interested in playing. One of the staff that was running the craps table announced that if anyone wanted to play, he'll ask me to move.... Mother#$%^er! Rude! My chips were on the table, and there was a second craps table, so why didn't he suggest they go fill up at there vs asking me to move since I'm ""taking up space"". What kind of low quality casino are you running Lumiere? Is that how you've trained your staffs/dealers? Pass! My friends could tell that I was upset and we decided to take our business elsewhere. After we left to grab the free fountain drink, we've noticed that the table we were at was completely empty once we left. Hah. Shame on you!Stayed here 9/17-9/19.Location is excellent for Cards, especially Rams games. The casino itself isn't mind blowing as  it looks like any other mid/large size casino floor. Slots, table games, that one 'Asian place' to eat like every casino, and a bar. The staff was friendly , and I thought parking was simple. It's cool to see a casino like this parked right down town on the Mississippi. Almost like a modern twist to the old style of that area in STL. Some rooms have cool river views, and it does have a mini mart &amp; small bar. There is a skywalk connection to casino across the street, so you don't need I go outside.The area outside the casino at night. Wouldn't let any girl I know walk around there. Period. The casino is located right across from East STL which is the worst area in the entire country, literally. If you don't believe that, I double dare you to cross that bridge after midnight. A lot of people make that mistake as downtown STL is tough navigating. There are nooks and alleys around the casino, and the walk to the landing is short but sketchy. Very dark, lots of lingurers and troublemakers kinda just walking around with nothing to loose. I was alone and over 6ft and was approached 2x by guys that weren't kosher. Again, if your used I the area it's cool , just don't talk to randoms. Just don't be that drunk lost idiot on his iPhone 5 and polo tee and your totally good. If you with a group nothing to even think about. Hit this place if your in the LouDo no pay to park on special events, they claimed that they would refund if more than $25 were spent on food or gambling but since the person giving out the tickets did not mark it, no refund was givenWe actually liked this place.  It was clean and comfy.  We got a good rate.  If we were ever in the area again we would stay here.  I did find that the people (workers and visitors) were rude but maybe its just not the mannered people I am use to dealing with.Decent casino. Not too big, but pretty modern. It looks like it could belong in Las Vegas if it were bigger and had more amenities. They have plenty of restaurants like Burger Bar and Asia. I personally don't gamble so I wouldn't know how it was like at the casino. There is a line to get into the casino. I'm not used to that. I've been to Vegas and I've never even seen a line to check IDs. It's right next to the landing so you have a bunch of bars and restaurants to eat and drink around.3 stars is about right. I go here quite a bit, but the main draws for me are its location and the generally loose poker room.Pro tip: If you're looking for a classy meal while here, head to Cielo next door at the Four Seasons. Cielo's outdoor terrace is also a great place to have a few drinks while overlooking the Arch. Absolutely love that terrace.Casino: Pretty decent layout. Great party atmosphere on the weekends (weekday atmosphere, not so much). Plenty of table games (I don't play slots), and they give decent comps. The poker room is by far my favorite in St. Louis -- generally very loose tables. Very smokey throughout the casino, though.Food: Pretty lacking. The sports bar is a good place to watch a game, but the food itself is so-so and definitely overpriced (along with the beer). Beyond the sports bar, there's an Asian place and a buffet. Not into Asian food, and their buffet doesn't look all that appetizing. They used to have a very nice steakhouse and a decent Italian place, but those both closed in the last several years. They really need an option for nicer dining, but obviously the nicer places they did have didn't do well; so I understand why they don't. Hotel (this is for Hotel Lumiere, not the Four Seasons): the rooms are big and would be great for Bachelor/Bachelorette parties. You can get rooms with 2 queens and a pullout bed in the living room, which hold 5-6 people. One negative: I've stayed here many times and a few of those times have smelled some weird smells in the rooms. In a world where weird smells = poop. If you're looking for a romantic getaway or something of that nature, stay somewhere else.Overall: Lacking in some areas, but a good place for a night out. The location enables you to go here before or after Cardinals or Rams games, or to combine some gambling with going out at Laclede's Landing (right down the street) or the classier Wash. Ave. area (short cab ride).What's  wrong with the black people on the entrance into the casino? they welcome the white people and ignore and even sometimes turn their backs on majority of blacks.. I don't get it, are you ashamed of yourselves ? Are you ashamed of us?  Well WAKE-UP if you haven't looked in the mirror lately you are BLACK TOO!!!!  Other races notices you too. You can at least while you are being paid act as if the WILLIE LYNCH letter  doesn't apply to YOU...... And if you do, BELIEVE ME, I will act like it too!Should I give more stars since I have such a good winning streak at Lumiere?  If Lady Luck forsakes me during my next visit, should I revoke some stars?  I think I'll just leave it at 3 and not consider luck, even though it obviously makes or breaks a casino experience.Lumiere is a flashy, classy place, but in this category is has strong competition from River City.  But the Big L has the good fortune (or maybe we do) of being within walking distance of the Landing.  The Casino Queen has cheaper drinks, but Lumiere gives you more bang for your buck, in my opinion.  Big L also has better food.  Parking can be tricky, but I've never had a problem finding a spot on the street or in the lot.  Security has been friendly, and the dealers talkative.Bottom line: I haven't got a lot of money to burn, but if anyone recommends going to a casino, I'll recommend we go to Lumiere.I like this Casino, its a fun place, personally I prefer their other casino ""River City"" - I liked the open atmosphere of this place, the music is nice, lots to do. Had the buffet not to long ago, its good! I would say try it and see.This place is always busy when there are events, i would try the queen or just deter away from it.  The remodeling going on you can expect a long wait if your younger to get into the casino.  The line gets terribly long.The smokiness in here when its busy is horrible, if your a smoker your in heaven!I do like the high limit room here and the poker room is really good.  They have raised there daily mid-week poker fees, which i am not a fan of.They do have a few fun tables such as black jack switch.  If you want less crowded and less smokey try there sister River City.What do you expect from a casino that is part of the Pinnacle family?  I have only visited L'auberge but I knew what to expect.This place is a top notch, high class kind of casino.  Meaning they have fine dining, higher end tables, pretty lighting, and decor.  But as soon as I saw POKER ROOM, I was done.  No where else I needed to go.  It takes a bigger casino to be able to host and hold poker tables.  They had $1/3 NL TEXAS Hold Em.  The tables were actually more loose than I was expected.  Meaning I got a lot of calls, they thought I was a tight player so folded to my bluffs.  I enjoyed it a lot the people were friendly, the dealers talked a little too much for my liking but I felt like I was at a home game.Really really like this hotel and casino!! This is my first pick of places to go if you have an itch to gamble. The casino is very clean and nice and all the things to play there are awesome. They have a great poker room and the buffet and Asia restaurants are awesome. The parking for this casino can't get much better because its attached and its also free to park. Again this is my first choice of casino's in the St. Louis area and every time I go there its a great experience.It was A-Ok...Here is the good stuff:The shuttle bus driver was awesome and told us all we needed to know about the casino.The drinks were cheap.The bathrooms were clean.They had the little soda fountain drink machine that is free for allThe slots were loose, I probably won close to 100 bucks and yes...I was playing the penny slots and yes, I gave it all back - the whole point of going right!?The music and vibe was cool - lots of folks running around and trying to win money...the craps table was pretty live with cheers...sounded like folks were winning.Here is the bad stuff:The security dude that I asked a question to - told me he was dealing with an emergency, I did not see anyone near him or I did not hear any sirens but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that perhaps he knew something I did not.The ladies that bring you the drinks seemed to just be going through the motions all night long - I smiled at all the ones I could make eye contact with and got nothing back - just trying to brighten up their night :)The smoke is out of control man - I get it though...smoke and casinos go together but shit dude I had to send all my clothes to the cleaners to get rid of the smoke.The shuttle bus that picks you up at the hotels was ending the week I was there :( No more shuttle service to and from the casino - I guess it's up to the hotels to get you there now - I hope they make that happen.I'll go back but only due to lack of options, I'll also be sure to wear crappy clothes.The casino itself is very nice and new. The crowd...well, not so impressive. It is right by the landing so you end up seeing some really ""interesting"" people, so to speak. I gambled here twice and didn't win a thing. LOL. The table minimums are $10 on weekends I think. That's the lowest I saw anyway. They have a hangover slot or something, which I did not play, but it looked fun.Lumiere let me in when River wouldn't.This was my first experience with real live gambling (MA is Puritan as fuck, and the one in Rhode Island is all electronic to bypass a stupid law), so it was fun to actually see a real live person be a dealer, and not some scary computer generated piece of shit dealer designed by a University of Phoenix graduate. Hundos got won. Drinks were cheaper than expected. I was used to spending $6-$9 for a drink at Twin River in RI, and a whiskey diet cost me a mere $3.50. Tree fiddy.Black Jack dealer was amicable, and even gave me a heads up to finish my martini so it wouldn't be thrown out. Solid.'Twas the night after Christmas and I felt like celebrating,Now, I wanted something to eat to counteract the long inebriating3 in the cold morning and not a creature stirred on the downtown areaThe search for food is like the looking for water in dessert of SierraA slinger is usually best, but I have been eating heavy for daysThe meats, cheese, &amp; richness of the desserts has put me in haze""Off to Lumiere"" my friends said for rallyingRiches to all was the actually callingI wanted food and got a large iceberg $5 saladSo this ends my small attempt @ a bad ballad""The hill salad"" @ the Kitchen inside the casino was iceberg lettuce covered with shredded cheese, tomato &amp; peppers.  Served in about 1 ft square container with large amount of black olives, ham, pepperoni &amp; salami in the corners.  In the middle of the night for $5, I was quite happy.Smokey place to gamble and pay for watered down drinks (MIssouri state law - that you have to pay, not that they have to be watered down}.  Casino is actually not that bad with a lot of slots, a poker room and reasonable amount of table games.  Tends to be pretty packed on Cardinal game nights.Overall, Lumiere is an ok destination if you want to do a little gambling in St. Louis.","Just a heads up - be careful if you're going to the Four Seasons, you might land in the casino instead like I did!Lumiere is very  nice and presentable.  It does get confusing as its connected to everything around it but the people are very friendly and will guide you in the right direction.  I'm not a big gambler but I do love me a slot of two...I didn't win but it was fun.What better way to spend the 4th of July than gambling? Exactly...Mike T and I spent yesterday afternoon wandering the streets of downtown doing an impromptu bar crawl. We quickly realized that many of the places we wanted to hit were closed (probably due to the fact that it was a national holiday and Fair St. Louis was taking place just blocks away) so I joked that we should hit up the casino. He admitted that he'd never been to a casino before, so that settled it!Timothy G is right - Lumiere is no Bellagio. I've been to Vegas many times and although Lumiere looks and smells like any other Vegas casino, it's not nearly as nice as the high-end spots on the Vegas strip.. But hey, they don't claim to be the Bellagio or the Wynn, do they?We hit the penny slots and ended up making a few extra bucks, which was a sign that we should probably cash out and leave before losing it all. Mike T's eyes had also started to glaze over and I knew that he would be hooked if we didn't get out of there soon. Plus, this casino is smoky and filled with toothless hoosiers... which is fun for an hour or so, but then it just gives me the jibblies. Nevertheless, it was a fun way to spend a few hours, especially since it had rained while we were inside. If you've never been to a casino before, definitely check out Lumiere. Is it the nicest casino you'll ever see? No. But it is pretty new and they do A-OK for a STL crowd.Free coffee and soda is a plus.  Also we got two vodka/Sprites for $6.50.  TOTAL.  I have no idea where that number came from.  Looks decent enough for gambling.  Biggest problem:  ventilation.  The nice thing about other, nicer casinos is that you don't come out reeking of cigarette smoke.  St Louis has a no smoking in bars rule now, but casinos don't have that rule.  BUT there are ways to prevent it from becoming so horribly smoky in there.Also, first time I've ever been carded and had to go through a turn stile to enter a casino.....very bizarre StL...Compared to everywhere else in St. Louis, this casino is by far the best. The closed the awful steak house and replaced it with a sports bar/restaurant.The place is clean and open. Be prepared for the smell of smoke on the casino floor if you don't like smoke. I smoke, so what do I care?This place is bright, has new machines, and a small poker room that rarely gets any high limit games but is a fine room. They have their own hotel (the only Embassy Suites) which is fine with small bathrooms as they tried to make the two-room suites luxurious. There is also a Four Seasons Hotel and Spa next door that rocks if you can afford it.the one way in one way out has been a nightmare for getting inside during busy times of the day and night! that may be my only complaint about this place, they are really good about parking and have some nice restaurants inside and places where i can even sit with my daughter while me and my wife baby swap as we call it to take turns gambling.the inside is very nice, free pop at the fountain, and they have plenty of table games as well as a nice big poker room.. there is usually a wait but you can get in a poker game pretty quick.  the dealers are pretty friendly overall and the pit bosses are always in a good mood, but that may be because I'm donating a lot, haha, sometimes i walk out of here a winner, but the table games starting out around $10 a hand can cause a short visit sometimes. even though i usually play the $25 BJ..... that's really the reason, hahai will continue to gamble here since its such a nice clean establishment, only problem is that they allow smoke so on busy nights i don't like that.Supposedly, this hotel has a 4 star rating. Someone needs to take another look before they continue to give it that rating... Terrible experience. Came here for a small work meeting and had endless problems. First one being that when I called to book using the group code, you can't book online with a group code, they spelled my name completely wrong and wouldn't give me the full three days under the discounted price. I had contacted our coordinator who confirmed I should be able to, and the customer service rep once again told me it was not possible. It took the rep calling the hotel and the coordinator calling the hotel to get it straightened out and I had to make a new reservation as they couldn't find what name they booked me under in the first place. When we arrived, my ""non-smoking"" room was really just a ""not-smoked-in-recently"" room and it smelled like old smoke. I shouldn't be too surprised because it is connected to a casino, but I can't stand the smell. It was late so we didn't ask to switch because we'd traveled all day. The next afternoon, it had this terrible mildew/rank odor and when we complained, they said they would have it cleaned. It did smell better after that, but I'm not sure why it smelled funky in the first place. The carpets clearly had burns from cigars, they were huge burns, and the carpets in the hallways were stained all over. When it came time to check out, I asked that they charge my nights on two credit cards, one for business and one for personal because we stayed a day extra to sight-see. You would have thought I was asking for the moon! When he finally did charge me correctly, he couldn't print out the full set of charges to my room and it only showed me staying one night for each card.Well, for anyone with a corporate credit card, you have to show receipts for all charges. I was in a hurry and didn't notice it until we were halfway through Illinois, headed back home. The next business day, I called asking for a full list of charges and payments to my room for that night. When I spoke with customer service, they sent my to the front desk. The desk clerk emailed me the print out and it was the same I had received previously. She even tried to tell me I was wrong and that I had only stayed two nights. She said she'd have to call someone else to get it figured out and that she'd call me back. Two weeks later, still no response. So a few days after that, I called the front desk again, a different clerk answered and was completely confused as to how to help. She sent me to the customer service, and around and around we went. Finally I got to the ""front desk managers"" voicemail. I left a message asking for help and still haven't heard back. I called and left another voicemail for another 'manager' and haven't heard from them either. I finally called the front desk again today and got hung up on, but when I called back again I think we finally got it figured out. Overall, the hotel was in poor repair, the casino was very smoky, and the food at all of the restaurants was just okay. Not what I would expect from a place so close to the arch and river in downtown St. Louis. The extra hassle to get my charges sent to me made the entire experience not worth it. Next time I'll stay at the Marriott nearby, regardless of the price. The cost difference for knowing my folio will always be emailed to me, clean &amp; smoke-free rooms and helpful staff is worth it.Strictly written for the buffet. Get dragged here ever so often on a friday by my mommy dearest accompanied by my father and husband whenever the craving for friday night crab legs occurs. One bc it's the closest casino and b bc it's the cheapest casino buffreeet.This place is ok (and just that) for reasons listed:The crab legs will kill you. They are tough and prickly as hell. My mother in law was literally stabbed and bloodied the last time we went. Perhaps there is a technique for said crab legs but i've never experienced this problem anywhere else before...ever. My husband loves the creamy, cajun pasta and he is typically a very picky man. It's surprising to me when he finds something he really enjoys eating. There's of course shrimp cocktail, nasty green beans, potatoes, cold salad bars, etc. All mediocre.Sushi selection is, eh-american sushi....in the midwest....at not even it's greatest.Of course there is an asian food selection which is pretty good. Fried wontons, egg rolls, sauteed mushrooms, noodles, fried rice, etc.Wide array of hot sauces.Fried chicken, baked chicken, gravies....and they even have hot dogs and french fries for the kiddies. Got excited when i saw fried catfish nuggets. But....there always raw in the middle. i don't get it...how hard is it to fully cook a damn cat fish nugget. Ugh!Excellent looking (ok tasting) dessert bar. They even have sugar free options for the diabetic. (Should they be at a buffet anyways?)The best part the pizza is yummy and the thick fried pork chops. The sorbet bar is TO DIE FOR! Pistachio, chocolate, pineapple, mango, cherry, green apple, plus toppings! I'll stick to Ameristar for my crab legs. Don't mind the drive.I just got cheated at blackjack tonight with Yolanda as dealer. I was playing blackjack switch with a 15 and a 16 showing with the dealer showing a 4.  The dealer gave me a card when I said no on both and when I busted she took my $50.00.  I immediately stopped her and told her I didn't hit and my bet should still be valid. She argued back and said I did. Luckily the pit boss Derek was two tables away so I called him over. I explained the situation and he said sorry, the dealer was right though. I told him it was my right to have him look at the video with security so he obliged.  After reviewing the security tape they confirmed that I shook my head no AND waved for no bet.  They gave me my bet back but disqualified the hand.  I won both hands as the dealer busted, but was not paid out on it.  I expressed my concern but nothing was changed and Derek told me I could file a complaint if I wanted. Yes, it was only $50 (2 $25 bets) but it could have been $2500 a piece.  I will never return to this casino and I hope you think twice before entering..What does Lumiere Place have going for it?Proximity. To legions of drunks on both Washington Ave. and the Landing. And in St. Louis, we know that cabs are rare... very rare. To be able to walk to a casino is golden.It's also a shiny new quarter. Glistening and delightfully tacky, as casinos usually are.I'm a roulette player myself and immediately scoped out the $5 minimum roulette table. But not tonight baby. I talked myself into watching my friend throw down at the blackjack table and staying out of trouble.The dealer was cool/friendly/funny, and didn't even mind me sitting next to my friend for a few hours despite not playing. Then again it was 4 am. Cocktail service was tough to come by, but I was damn near gleeful when I discovered Hoegaarden on tap at the bar. Was it expensive? I think $6 and some change? Not terrible by my Chicago standards but overpriced for the Lou.No wait to cash out. 50/50 odds that I'll return.(this is NOT a review of the 4 season property next door) The old Embassy Suits. This is my ""go to"" location due to the close proximity and walking distance to Lacedes Landing. When traveling I spend little time in my room and all my time experiencing what the city has to offer.Liked it better when it was the Embassy Suits. Inclusive Happy Hour and Breakfast are always perks to a hotel stay. This hotel offers nothing.... literally nothing.  The ONLY reason we book here is the ability to walk to the landing. I tolerate a mediocre experience for that reason alone.  No reason to give it a 5 star... and nothing negative to give it a 1 star. It is what it is.... a place to sleep.I assumed Lumiere Place to be somewhat of a classy place since it's connected to the Four Seasons, but no, not at all.The casino was very smoky with a poor ventilation system. It was also small and not that nicely decorated. I even prefer Casino Queen right across the river just because it's not as smoky.A casino is a casino is a casino. Lumiere has slots, tables and whatever else you can lose your mortgage playing. But....Lumiere does have a better looking crowd and younger than most casinos in the area so the people watching is awesome! And did I mention insanely cheap drinks? I have never gambled in Lumiere. I only go there for the drinks at the bar. Staff is very friendly and attentive and if you are lucky you may get to overhear a juicy conversation from another patron.Don't let the name fool you, this is an Embassy suites. I'm sure they didn't spend a penny on room remodeling outside of upgrading TVs and the lobby. With that said, I should mention that at least you get breakfast at an Embassy they offer breakfast from the casino for 12.00 a head. They even tried to charge me for my 1 yr old. Valet service was a joke, you can call ahead, but the valet flat out told us after waiting for 30 min after we called to proceed downstairs that they don't go and get your car until you come down and hand them the ticket. Whats the point in that. Not to mention we stayed over Christmas and it snowed, they didn't even clean the car windows off. I'll never stay here again, I only stayed because my family also booked there and didn't want to spend the money for the Four Seasons. This place could have been free and I would still call it overpriced.My review is for the HOTEL only.  I have never gambled at the casino, but it looked fairly busy and brand new.My friends and I decided to book a room at a hotel in St. Louis since we would be partying in the area that night.  We called around to various hotels but Lumiere seemed to offer the best rate for quality in the vicinity.  The quoted price was $169 for a Sat to Sun night stay.  But I worked my charm and the front desk person discounted it to $139. (^_~) *wink* The front lobby does not look very fancy and pales in comparison to the rest of the hotel.  But on the main floor there is a chic-y looking bar and lounge area.  The plant pots light up and they have cute ice cube looking blocks which can be used as stools that light up also (see pics).There are 8 floors in the hotel and the casino is connected via the 4th floor.  We got a room on the 4th floor which came with a small living room, mini bar, bathroom, 2 plasma tvs, and 2 queen beds.  The room is decorated in a contemporary style with wood furniture and red/orange/beige upholstery.  The bathroom is tiny but it does have a full size bathtub, toilet, and sink.  The minibar is stocked with sodas, water, vodka, gin, and other alcohol.  And to alleviate the hangover from the night before, you can help yourself to some free gourmet coffee (you just have to make it yourself with the mini coffee maker).The hotel offers other ammenities such as a spa, but it is currently under construction.  However, for $20 you can use the facilities at the Four Seasons Hotel - which is also connected to the casino.  There are 3 locations for parking.  One is valet which is $20 and unlimited in/outs.  The second is a parking lot across the street from the hotel, it is free but uncovered.  The third is a parking structure which is connected to the casino and free.  If you don't plan on going back and forth to your car and you don't have a lot of luggage, parking in the structure is fine.  However if you have a lot of baggage and/or will be wearing high heels, I'd suggest you park closer because it is quite a trek to the structure (you have to walk through the casino).I wish we could have stayed longer but we had some sight seeing to squeeze in and a plane to catch.  If we do come back, Lumiere is definitely once place I wouldn't mind staying again.A fine casino and addition to the downtown area, a visit to Lumiere has quickly become a Fourth of July tradition for us, as well as a great spot to take friends and family who don't live within spitting distance of a million casinos like we do here in St. Louis.Comparing L.P. to what's probably my favorite, the Ameristar, what we have here is pretty decent. Things are a little more expensive here, but you can still come and play cheap slots all night or maybe -- correct me if I'm wrong -- bump into a $5.00 blackjack table. The floor is comparable to, or maybe a little smaller than, what I've seen at similar locations.I never come out ahead here. Last visit I noticed that the slot machine payout was under 91%, which strikes me as a little lower than it's been previous visits. I wonder why that is or what it might mean for the casino. (Obviously, I'm no expert in this biz.)I am not sure I'll ever get a chance to sample the restaurants or bars in this building, but maybe one of these days! They all look very sleek. Send me a message if you want to know where my favorite slots are.After dinner over at House of Savoy us girls decided to try our hand at the casino. It was a bit uncomfortable  between the clouds of smoke and the distant rumble of f bombs while a group of people fought with the security guards. The gaming floor is large and nicely spaced, but don't look for any of the those Vegas slots, all these are off brand (not like it matters, but it was humorous). No Wheel of Fortune, just Wheel of Luck. I guess if you are a gambler it's probably nicer to you. If you are looking for Vegas, you are in the wrong place.I am not a lucky person in any sense of the word.  I never even won bingo in grade school.  Most of my gambling expenditions have resulted in failure, to the point where I limit myself to losing a predetermined sum (a low one at that) before giving up and not gambling any more.That said, I have done very well here.  I have hit 4 of a kind on video poker the last THREE times I have been here.  Now that is luck.  I also have won the section roulette promotion the St. Louis Blues do at games where every person in a specific section wins a free buffet.  Twice.  And that's only going to like 6 or 7 games last season!  Compared to other casinos in the area, this is by far the luckiest one for me.  And isn't that how people *really* measure casinos?  I mean come on they all have the same slots, table games, bars, etc.  And let's be honest here, the Lumiere is very sleek and is a lot more modern than other area casinos.  For the most part, the clientele here is higher end than other area offerings too, as there are far fewer old ladies hooked to oxygen machines smoking cigarettes than other casinos.Other neat things about the Lumiere is the parking is free, or at least it has been every time I have gone.  You can usually get a garage spot.  So park here, gamble a bit and head over to the Landing or Washington Ave, and you will have a great night.  Only Ameristar in St. Charles has cool stuff nearby you can walk too.  The staff is usually prompt and friendly.  Now my biggest complaint with this place is the lack of table games versus slots, and the fact that they have no video roulette or speed roulette.  I friggin love roulette but there are maybe 2 or 3 tables, that fill up very quickly, and go very slowly.  They used to have a whole wall full of video roulette machines, but no longer.  You expect about 5 to 10 minutes per wheel spin on Friday and Saturday nights.  Bummer.The drinks are expensive, which is just another way casinos rake in the dough.  This isn't Vegas, where cheap drinks make for for more compulsive gambler. Everywhere else, it's more like compulsive gamblers want drinks, no matter the price.  Still, it is a bummer spending close to 10 bucks a for a couple of boring ole' Bud Selects.  So the Lumiere is my favorite gambling spot in St. Louis.  I think compared to other casinos in the area, it is top notch.  Ameristar in St. Charles is another great one, but that's much further from me.   I think if you really compare the Lumiere to the areas other offerings, and not Ceasers Palace, you will see it is a great addition to St. Louis.  Once I get around to using my free buffet voucher, I will update with a review of the food!""I'll Make Love to You."" No, that's not what the lady at Lumiere Place said, but it is the name of a class Boyz II Men song. And that is exactly who I went to see at the Lumiere Place on Valentine's Day this year! I went with a couple friends who also share a love for awesome harmonies and classic hits! Boyz II Men is the group that got me loving singing. When I heard their ""II"" album, it was over. It wasn't so much WHAT they sang about (a lot if it is kinda cheesy), but HOW they sang it. I could go on and on about Boyz II Men and how they are the best singing group in the history of all singing groups. And I could talk about how beautiful it is when every note comes together to blend into a perfect union of sound and soul, but I won't. Why? This is a review of the place, not the group I went to see. With that being said, this review is for the concert venue, not the casino for games and whatnot (not a gambling man). The venue was one of the big lounge rooms in Lumiere Place. I'd recommend going to a concert there because it is pretty intimate if you get there early. The stage is pretty close to the actual seating, and it was awesome being able to see my favorite group of all time from just a couple rows out. The only time there were some issues was when these girls got up and started dancing in front of some of the other paying patrons. They couldn't see past the girls and became a bit frustrated. I could understand both sides: the girls were excited because hey, it's Boyz II Men!! The ones behind them were older and wanted to sit down and enjoy and reminisce. The seating is not stadium-type seating, so everyone is on the same level. Again, go early if you can to whatever show you go for. Overall, the place was clean, the workers were friendly and I got to see my favorite singing group of all time. I even got to shake Wanya's hand! Sweet. For a smaller concert venue, Lumiere Place wasn't bad at all.Ugh. I am torn between two and three stars for so many reasons. And to not keep you waiting here they are:1. It is so freaking cold in here it is unreal.2. This place gives off an air of class that it does not deliver.3. People can still smoke here.4. I won some money playing black jack.5. It is pretty clean (aside from the smoking) in here, including the bathrooms.Three negatives, two distinct positives, the rest is maybe neutral? I was kind of expecting this place to be a bit less hoosier than River City, which is the only other casino in the area I have been in. I would say that it is really only the second casino I have ever been in, not a big gambler, though I see the fun and joy in it.  I assume that there are delinquents at every casino, so no deductions for that except for the standard delinquent deduction I take out of every place I go to.The building itself is the architectural epitome of being built in the zeroes.  Sorry Lumiere, but you stuck a curve on the top of an element that is supposed to look like it is slicing through the building and then projected images on to it, or off from it, either way... you know the way we make fun of 1980s office buildings today? Yeah, thats gonna be you in 20-30 years. Parking isn't great. We parked across the street, and it was pretty cheap, the line for the garage was too long for us.  I don't know if this is a problem on typical nights, but NYE it was.Inside is fairly standard casino dreadful. There is no light, I guess everything is supposed to look a bit better (including the huge fat guy I saw eating, or making out with, that skinny girl he must have paid to be there).  There are tons of people.  You have to walk around for a bit to find an empty table to play at (I have been taught that I like $10 blackjack tables). Oh, and I know this is an annoying thing to mention, but really, why weren't all the cocktail waitresses in the same outfit? I like consistency.  Plus, I get it, they were all as skin tight and pushed up as they could get, but maybe for those of us that aren't staring at all of those places, you could at least all wear the same thing.  So much for class.... All in all, it was a fine establishment I guess.  But I had my hopes up.  I guess if I should blame anyone, I should just blame myself? Or the giant flames on the outside...Blah blah blah blah.  Casino casino.  Same old same old.Casinos always have people in them that look like they haven't slept in weeks and are smoking cigarettes that have three inches of ash on them.THOUGH,my mom did win $1500.00 here tonight on a penny machine.I guess that's worth two stars.If you don't mind taking money from the devil.","To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, ""Lumiere, I've been to the Bellagio.  The Bellagio is a friend of mine.  You Lumiere, are no Bellagio.""OK, maybe it's not a fair comparison.  But you know, Lumiere had some potential, especially compared to its nearly competition. But...Damn!  I've inhaled my fair share of cancer sticks, but this place does get wicked smokey.  Not to mention it gets really crowded.  Maybe more casinos in the area will spread out the population.  Yeah right.The dealers here have that wonderful robotic I-am-only-here-to-deal attitude.  No humor.  No recommendations in tough spots.  (Guess what?  No tips).And finally, the gatekeepers/ID checkers.  They used to be nice and friendly.  As of late, if you're even slightly wee bit buzzed, you're going to get grief from them.  WTF?  Doesn't that automatically make me a VIP player?  I'm guessing that some moron came in, got wasted, lost a ton, and managed to threaten them with a lawsuit if they didn't get their money back.The only pros are they have some decent slots and some decent cheap blackjack tables.Beyond that, my recommendation is to save your pennies, buy a deck of cards, some chips, and invite some friends over for casino night.  It will be cheaper, more fun, and bound to get a better review.I've never had so much fun, while losing that much money, in my life. Kind of Tricky to get to, but definitely worth the trek. Beautifully designed, super relaxed atmosphere, and damn good burgers in The Burger Bar to boot. Everything I could ask for in a gambling den...will be back next time I'm in townSt. Louis has a very nice upgrade from the riverboats that dominated the casino business on the riverfront from my past visits.   I'm not a much of a gambler.  This however is a very modern, clean and comfortable casino with some surprisingly good eating options.  Smoking is allowed, but I was really impressed with their ventilation system. Vibrant and lively.  My traveling companions enjoyed hours and hours of slot, card and table games here and I was able to enjoy some exceptional Asian cuisine immediately adjacent to Laclede's Landing.Mannnnn...  I've been to Lumiere a number of times.. maybe 3 or 4.. and never found myself impressed with the setup.I guess it's cool for St. Louis, and since I'm not a big gambler, I don't really find it being that great.  The restaurants aren't bad as I've eaten at Asia a few times.  The casino floor is pretty standard as well.  There's nothing here that catches the eye.  I guess I'm just being a negative Nancy here, but that's just my opinion.PEACE OUT!Yes, it's smoky. Casinos in st Louis probably aren't going to change that anytime soon, unfortunately.However, the casino itself is nice. It's the closest thing to Vegas that we have here.Friendly dealers, entertaining clientele, and lots of table games and slots. Their VIP lounge is pretty fantastic as well.I recently booked a room here for my little sisters 21st Birthday. From the moment I walked through the revolving doors I was greeted, all of the personnel was professional and courteous. We had left and came back to our room to find a card that was slid underneath the door. They had given my little sister a hand made birthday card with some free drink coupons for ""The Falls"". Can we say....super sweet and thoughtful! I have never had any hotel go out of their way or care before, we were all really impressed. The hotel location was great access to get to the Landing. It wasn't too far and it was nice to not have to worry about driving. I will say the one downfall to the hotel is the parking lot. It's so hard to find a spot!! I swear I got cut off and had my spots stolen by 7 grandmas going to blow their social security checks that night. GRRRR! I do have to give the hotel props for putting up me at 4am-drunk. I couldn't get the key to work and after going up and downstairs about three times they finally came up and helped me get in. Bless their hearts!! I will definitely be back! I'm already planning my birthday bash there in January!!Pretty nice hotel, and right in the middle of the action, which is what we were looking for - base camp for a bachelorette party.  The staff was cool and weren't bothersome, but we also didn't get too out of hand either.I actually got a Cardinal's package deal for the same price as just the room.  The Cardinal's pack came with free parking, so that was a no brainer.  It also came with two free drinks that we didn't end up using (fail!).  The beds were comfy.  I didn't get charged for the mini bar after hitting the counter over and over again going ""Gee...what's that...?"" which I was concerned about.  Special, I know.We also went to the casino after hitting Laclede's Landing until bar closure.  The people at the front were a little lame and sobering, but I guess that's kind of their job.  Once we got to a roulette table, the staff was pretty cool and put up with a lot more from the drunken bachelorette than they probably had to, so props to them!I'd consider going back but don't usually have the need.I'm not a big fan of gambling but still decided to try it out since i was on vacation and wanted to explore St Louis. One thing I didn't like was the cigarette smoke, which made it very hard to have fun and enjoy the atmosphere. I did as much gambling as i could before i couldn't take the smoke and left. They have some shops inside along with some restaurants. There is a lot to choose from in machines and tables and plenty of TVs to watch sports or what have you. Wait staff seemed nice and pleasant. Seemed as if this place was busy with all the people trying their luck for the ""big"" jackpot, lol... This would be a cool thing to do if they banned smoking...I am not a huge gambler but sometimes you just get in the mood. I played black jack this past Friday night and walked out the door with an extra $200 so I was a happy camper. The only dislike about this place is that smoking is still allowed. I wished the casino could do something about that!Make money, lose money, make money, lose money, make money, lose money, make money, lose money, make money, lose money, make money, lose money, make money, lose money, make money, lose money, make money, lose money. Lose money, lose money, lose money, lose money, lose money, lose money, lose money.They do have some really good fresh baked goods at the bistro. I also enjoyed the burger.I enjoyed the Price Is Right slots, featuring full surround sound and vibrations. I also enjoy certain styles of Wheel Of Fortune slots. The roulette tables are nice.When I come to visit family, we usually end up spending quality time in casnio's talking, catching up or just having meaningless conversation. I will down rate Lumiere because of the smoke environment, and the games just don't seem as fun as the ones at Alton Belle. If you're immune to smokey environments, and don't mind crowds sometimes, then you'll enjoy this. The architecture is great.This Hotel is poorly maintained. You can see this immediately when leaving the Front Desk. The carpet throughout the Hotel is badly stained, and looks like it has not be vacuumed or shampooed in years. The rooms have an odor. The carpet again is stained with large, heavy dark spots. The sink in the very tiny bathroom had 4 large cracks which ran the entire width of the sink.  The door handle was falling off and just barely clears the toilet when opening/closing door.  The floor had not been washed as there was dental floss on the floor from a previously guest.  The sheets had holes in them and one was badly torn.  The mirror above the sink in the sitting area had 2 large black magic marker circles on it.  The airconditioning could not be set, and the room was warm.  And to boot, each room is PRE charged a $ 50.00 room destruction/damage fee --- really.  Apparently this is a ""Party Hotel""  and Hotel  assume everyone staying in their hotel are the type of low life's that would destroy the room, so the charge up front for damages!!There is a terrible smoke in areas of the Hotel and Casino that allow smoking.  It was so strong in the Casino area, while eating The Kitchen my eyes began tearing from the smoke. The food is not good and pretty expensive for poor food.I am disabled, and my son pushed me up the steep hotel drive and the Hotel Staff were laughing watching us come up the road and said ... did you finally make it!! One person in my group was attached outside the hotel by a drunk. He left the weekend with a badly blacked eye and had to file a police report the next day.It is not safe, it is dirty, smelly and the staff do not seem to care. When I called about the why my credit card had been charged 80 dollars more per night than my contract amount -- that is when I was told I had to pre- pay a 50.00 room damage fee. (the rest was tax). When I tried to find out more about this charge I was told that ALL HOTELS everywhere charge this.  Well I travel for my job -- that is not the case. This is the first hotel that has charged a damage fee BEFORE any damages occur!  Wonder what they do with all the extra money- put it in a bank in Switzerland?  They do not use it to repair damage.This is NOT a place to spend a night or visit.  And I agree to other comments -- pictures imply you are making a reservation at the Four Seasons -- which by the way was simply a WONDERFUL Hotel and CLEAN!  Next time in St Louis I may stay there instead.  But I will never stay here again.A couple of notes about this Hell on Earth:1. There are multiple swindlers in the parking lot trying to hustle everyone with some hidden wasabi pea trick.  Either take his money, stick him in the face, or congratulate him on a job well done2. This place gets smokey by 7pm and has very little ventilation, you'll have to deal with it if you are going to gamble for an extended period of time.3. 5$ burgers, hoagies, grinders and some other weird shit at the burger bar, or at ""the kitchen"" for those in the know.  Pretty good food op for drunkards. 4.  All $10 dollar tables on the weekend (craps &amp; blackjack).  Don't know about the hold 'em tables because I don't live &amp; breathe WSOP fantasies like some other people.  With that in mind, make sure you have either a fun or knowledgable dealer.  If your stuck with an asshole, which 6 out of the 13 I had were, it will feel even more like rape then it normally would.Overall, this casino is not in any of my ""best of"" lists, but it is a viable option if you're looking for some entertainment in the STL and wanna get smokey.This might sound weird but I actually enjoy the smell of smoke at a casino!  Reminds me of when I was a kid and the adults smoked everywhere.  I was sad to see another casino pop up in STL, but I liked this place, very clean and the sushi place was great.BAH, Yelp just lost my nice long review that I wrote about Lumiere Place. So here is my abbreviated version:Very nice casino for St. Louis...like a mini version of some of the big casinos in Vegas (Caesar's, Bellagio). Valet parking was only $5 on a Friday night and drinks were cheap as HELL at Glo Bar - the bar straight back from the entrance. $15 for 2 beers, a cranberry vodka, and a glass of red wine.There are tons of slot machines - both the regular 'old' kind and the newer digital kind - plus lots of roulette and poker tables. Not sure if they have other games but I think I saw craps tables too.Smoking inside sucks, but I know that's a city issue not the casino's issue. I felt like I had smoked a pack myself from all the secondhand smoke I inhaled in my four hours there. So be forewarned.So smoky. I don't know much about gambling so I can't really speak to that. I did gamble when I went and I had fun but that's about all I can say. The blackjack dealer I had was really nice and taught me how to play and I actually ended up winning money so that was cool. The waitresses wear the funniest trashy uniforms. They crack me up every time. It's like they were trying to go for a sexy Vegas look but ended up making the girls look more East St. Louis than Las Vegas.Those of you who are engaged or planning to be engaged, the casino is attached to the Lumiere hotel and also the Four Seasons so it might be a good idea to list those two hotels on the ""accommodations"" list on your wedding invitation. I'm sure your guests would appreciate having something to do while they're in town.The restaurants are open really late so if you're driving around St. Louis desperate for a place to eat a late dinner, it may be a good time to head to the casino.The hotel was clean and comfortable but that's about the best I can say for it. The rooms are far enough away (plenty far enough away) from the Casino so you aren't bothered by all the bells &amp; whistles in the middle of the night. The biggest dissappointment with this hotel is the front desk.  I've never seen such a group of depressed and depressing people in my life. Now I stayed there for four (4) days &amp; nights so it's not like I ran into a bad apple. It was as if they put an add in the paper for help that read 'grumpy, pain in the butt and generally unpleasent people wanted. Nice hotel UNLESS YOU NEED ANYTHING FROM THE FRONT DESK! I'm talking about everything from having difficulty w/ the Business Center card key (that didn't work twice) to asking for change for the soda machine.  You walk away saying 'sorry to have bothered you, you can go back to sleep now'The Casino:Typical. Slot machines, tables. Eh. Wasn't digging the set up or ambiance, really.  Been to much nicer casinos. The Buffet: Decided to check out the Lumiere Casino one evening, and eat at the buffet. HORRIBLE experience. We expected the price (around $20 per person). But the food, not only in quality, but their selection? For that price, I couldn't believe it! First off, there was only ONE type of meat to choose from, which was prime rib. I tried a piece, and it tasted as if it had been sitting around all day. Much like most of their food tasted. Everything that I tried that evening tasted like it had been sitting around, and it was all very dry, and tasteless. The desserts looked fabulous. The cookies? Hard as a rock. The pineapple upside down cake? Rubbery. The chocolate mousse? Yeah, that was just jello pudding out of a container. The ONLY good thing on their ""buffet"" was the mashed potatoes, and you had to scoop from the bottom of the pan, so that you didn't get all the dried up potato from the top. I was disgusted not only by the food, but they had the audacity to charge TWENTY dollars for it! NEVER again, and I highly recommend that NO one visit their establishment. We went to Golden Corral the next night, and had much better food there!Oh, and something that kinda pissed our group off. They had a sign near the entrance that read ""Like us on Facebook, and receive a free buffet!"" A bit misleading. You have to sign up for one of their casino cards (which, that's free, so no biggie). But you cannot sign up for the promotion from your smart phone (either with iPhone or Android, we tried both), so you had to do it on your computer, and come back for the free buffet. I wouldn't even eat there for free, after our experience, so needless to say, we did NOT sign up when we got to a computer.The only good thing? Parking was free that particular night, because of the World Series being in town.We decided to book a night at the Lumiere for our overnight trip to STL. I was pleasantly surprised by the look of the place. It's a remade Embassy Suites so it's very open with a nice lobby, bar, couch area. Our room was quite big. It had a separate sleeping room and a room with a couch and a tv. So 2 flatscreens.The hotel has a casino attached to it which was quite fun. Biggest complaint with that is that St. Louis hasn't gone smoke free yet and the smell was nauseating. Lost $25 on the slot machines but it was fun.  In the casino area there are a number of restaurants to choose from. I got a late night hot dog and fries from Kitchen which were $10 but I appreciate that they were open when I needed food. See my other review for Asia.The worst part about the hotel was the service. When we checked in the girl behind the desk was super bitchy and claimed we didn't have a reservation. We eventually got it straightened out but she was full of 'tude. The next day, I realized I left my Marc sunglasses in the room after we checked out. I rushed to the front desk ( we were in a hurry because the 49ers game we came for was about to start in 40 mins). The guy claimed it would cost me the price of another night's stay to go back and look in the room for my shades! He said it 3 times and right as I was about to explode we was like ""just kidding!"" His female co-worker also started cracking up. Not amused.I sh*t you not.My girlfriend (28) and my grandmother (75) had a drinking contest in the upstairs 5-star lounge here.Gf won - 8 to 7 chocolate martinis.Probably one of the funniest and strangest things I've ever seen.Hooray for booze!And at least all of you won't question where I got my alchohol tendencies from anymore...","['booked', 'using', 'com', 'amp', 'target', 'rel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/marriott-st-louis-grand-hotel-saint-louis-2,Marriott St. Louis Grand Hotel,3.0,$$$,144,"Pretty swanky Marriott. Modern, clean, Starbucks in Lobby. Excellent downtown location. Room rates were pretty reasonable midweek.My only gripe was the size and setup of the room. I was in a standard king and it was teeny-tiny. They somehow managed to cram a desk, couch and coffee table in there. Moving around the room is like playing Tetris - Push the table over to pull out the desk chair, push the table back to get into the bed. The bathroom is small as well. They tried to do a lot with very little.Bed was super comfy and I loved the extra plush pillows. Overall very nice hotel and location can't be beat.We had a wonderful experience at this Marriott. We were in town over the weekend for a wedding so stayed Thursday to Sunday. The wedding block was booked in the hotel next door but it was very expensive and we wanted to use some rewards points. We are so glad we did! We heard terrible things about the wedding hotel while we really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The hotel is in a great location - walking distance to all of the shops and restaurants on Washington Ave, the Arch, the City Museum, etc. The decor is fabulous - everything is modern with lots of hues of greys and whites. The room was very, very nice and spacious with extremely high ceilings. It had a king bed, sofa, coffee table, desk, bar area, etc. The bathroom also was very nice. From other reviews it seems like this hotel was very recently remodeled - it definitely shows! The room also had a TV with connections to streaming services so for once we could watch Netflix on a hotel TV instead of a laptop. Nice touch! We also thought the house keeping did a great job - no complaints here. Everything seemed very clean and up to par. The lobby is very large with a huge bar in the center. There is also a small convenient type store that looked very nice and a full Starbucks right off the lobby. We did not check out the fitness center or bar so can't say much about those. The front desk staff was very professional, friendly, and helpful. There was a small issue on our final bill which they fixed immediately and happily. Our first night in I ordered a panini from the room service. It came extremely quickly and I thought it was a pretty decent sandwich. It was expensive but it's room service - you shouldn't expect anything different if we're being real here. The menu seemed a bit small but adequate enough.Our only complaint would be the parking. They offer valet or self-park so we opted for self-park which was $20 a day. The garage is located right behind the hotel but from the elevators to your car is a bit of an endeavor. We kept losing our car in the garage! Maybe this was user error but it's kind of a confusing set up with two sets of elevators and two completely different levels of access depending on where you enter from. The garage isn't exclusive to the hotel but it is well attended with security and other employees. Overall it was fine, just kind of felt like a pain. Guess we could have always gone for the valet! Without using points, the room rates do seem a bit pricey. But, we had a great experience here and would definitely stay again.We have stayed at this location several times and had a good experience though it is a bit pricey for the accommodations.  On my last stay here which was for a conference, I had 2 rooms booked and during the online booking I had entered my AAA code and not the promo code for the conference so after I entered it I realized it was a different price.  When I tried to change it, it would not let me so I thought I would just have them change it at registration.  When I checked in I told the registration clerk that I needed it changed and was informed that they had no power to make any changes.  I ask for a supervisor and was told I needed to talk to the people in charge of the conference.  That was not and easy thing to do so I wound up paying an extra $130 something for the second room.  To top it off, I had requested two rooms with king beds and neither room had king but instead each had 2 doubles.Great location and service - easy access and logistically best location for events and shows this large. Excellent location for a Starbucks coffee in the same buildingI am rather torn with this review as I was very pleased with the service we received from the entire staff but especially the housekeeping staff. My wife and I never use housekeeping when we stay at hotels. We are rather clean people and clean up after ourselves and only use housekeeping to get the bare essentials. However, on this trip when we arrived to our room late in the evening we noticed something on one of the duvet covers requiring us to request a new and clean one. The staff was extremely helpful and in no time we got a new cover and had a very pleasant conversation with both the housekeeper and the housekeeping manager. What I am torn about is the fact that the duvet was dirty in the first place, and not just a little dirty but disturbingly so, and the decor of the room leaves very little to desire. Good staff, bad decor, tiny room.Staying here on a business trip. The hotel is very nice with a historic feel. Rooms are great. A little small but everything we need. Staff was friendly. Everything you need in the hotel or within walking distance. Parking is expensive.The Renaissance St. Louis Grand was undergoing renovations when I stayed, and just like every other hotel in the Marriott chain, when they do renovations, they start with the lobby first, so that people arriving at the hotel think it's beautiful and have the surprise of their lives when they open the door to their hotel room to reveal the most hideous, outdated hotel room they've ever laid eyes on. This is the best part of the arrival experience during renovations: Some fool thought that the best way to block off the lobby during renovations was to stack up a bunch of old suitcases within feet of the entry to block off the lobby, so that when you walk in, you're practically smacked in the face with what looks like the American Airlines Lost and Found Department. Apparently, it's supposed to be artistic, but it looks like something that belongs in a trailer park, not a fancy schmancy hotel.The second best part of the experience was check-in. I used their mobile app and my room key was ready when I arrived. The person who checked me in was very friendly and there was no wait.My ""city view"" room had a view of a hideous building across an alley. That part really didn't matter because it was dark and gloomy, anyway, so the view wasn't important. The room, however, was just icky. There is no other way to describe it. It was pretty small, had ancient hideous furniture, carpeting and window dressings. I'd be willing to bet that the last time they did anything with the awful rooms was sometime in the 1980s. I woke up with a snootful of snot and a sore throat, probably from the ancient carpet. I cannot imagine what kind of scary antigens and pathogens reside there.I was working, working, working during this trip, so I ordered room service for dinner and breakfast and it was expensive, but fast. My chef salad with sparkling water cost almost $30 and my french toast in the morning cost about $25. Just keep in mind the outrageous fees they add in if you're going to order room service. The food is edible, but not worth the cost.Check out was freaking awful. I was hoping to get an updated receipt with my room service charges, so I went to the desk to check out. There was only one person working the desk. I was behind a small group of women trying to check in early in the morning for a wedding. I presume one of them was the bride. Apparently, the room they had requested wasn't ready when it was promised. I didn't hear all of what was going on, but it was apparent the hotel wedding planner had dropped the ball. After almost 10 minutes of waiting, I gave up and left. Valet parking here is not well-organized. Why, oh why, don't they do what every other hotel with valet parking does and give a # for guests to call in advance so they don't have to stand in the cold to get their cars? For what they charge for valet parking, they really ought to offer this service. Unfortunately, when I went out, I had to stand there with a bunch of smokers inhaling their second-hand smoke for 10 minutes while waiting. That did a lot of good for my clogged nose and sore throat.I chose this hotel because my company requires us to use Marriotts and this was the closest Marriott to Barnes Jewish. I will not stay here again. Given the amount of time I wasted with this hotel in the morning, I could have selected a hotel further away. But next time, I will just request an exception and stay at the Chase near Barnes.Let me start by saying that I am a Hilton Member and have been for years.With that being said, I recently had a conference at the STL Renaissance Grand Hotel. (Essentially a Marriott location) The PROS:The rooms were very comfortable and clean.The Lobby and bar area was very inviting.A full Starbucks off the lobby area.The CONS:Undergoing construction that was extremely loud at all hours.Check-in was a complete nightmare. Both the wait for my room as well as the wait in line was totally unacceptable.With all things considered, not a totally unbearable experience but something I will take into consideration when back in STL.I had a lot of hesitation when booking this hotel based on all the negative reviews....but I thought I would give it a shot....First of all the location is spectacular, it is located across the street from the convention center, walking distance to the Bud stadium and Arch, and it is surrounded by great restaurants.  The parking is just adjacent to the hotel and is $18/night with unlimited in/out.The check in process was smooth like butter.  The lady that checked us in, Kay was extremely friendly and because of our Marriott status we were upgraded to a presidential suite on the 19th floor.  The lobby area looks nice, and has a coffee shop, lobby bar and an attached Starbucks.Now the room......The presidential suite was HUGE....I mean truly HUGE.  We had a conference table, kitchen with full sized fridge/freezer, one bedroom with windows on two sides, and one full size bathroom, and a smaller 1/2 bath.  The windows make this place amazing with great views of the city.Despite the huge size of the room and being recently remodeled, its just not impressive.  It lacked any art work or finish that would take it to the next level.  Even the full bathroom had a big ugly tub, you would think they would have a spa shower instead of a bathtub.....I have to say the bed is EXTREMELY comfortable and there were 4 climate zones which were very good at getting the temp in the room just right.We had a rollaway bed delivered, and the weird thing is, the guy literally dumped the bed in the room and left, did not say a word, just left the bed and walked out.  I was trying to ask him to set it up and if it needed additional sheets, but the guy bolted, didn't even hesitate enough time for me to give him a tip.We did frequent the concierge lounge twice, and both times it full stocked with food.  If are too lazy to get food from outside, this place has enough alcohol and food to get you through the night.  Even the breakfast was very good, with an assortment of muffins/bagels and standard hot food.Overall, the hotel renovation is nice, although not spectacular.  I love the location and the front desk staff. and the stay was pleasant.  I feel like it just needs some finishing touches to make it more classy.  I would definitely stay here again, especially given the proximity to all the local sights and restaurants.Bummer! I'm a loyal Marriott person and this property looked great in the pics. Too bad it didn't live up. Concierge lounge is nice but food is blah!  Smoked chicken risotto just tastes like bacon. And then there was salad. And that's it. Order ""room service"" which I picked up from downstairs at the little store. They just pressed a pre made sandwich in a pani press. And it's not very good. And I can't see the tv in the room which is probably my biggest complaint!  Why put it on wall to the left of the bed?! Fact is there a plenty of other marriotts to choose from. Choose the others.Not terrible. The rooms are excellent, but attention to detail is definitely not something they focus on. The mini fridge had food in it from the previous guests, and they only gave us one set of towels for a two person room. However, they more than made up for their oversight with their friendly service. Every single employee I walked past made sure to greet me; it definitely made my mornings better.Loved the room itself. Beds were extremely comfortable! I actually managed to get good sleep, which rarely happens at hotels. Also, I love how the TVs come with different streaming apps (Netflix/Hulu if you have your own account, Youtube/Crackle if you don't). If you get a room on the top floor, you can see much of downtown St. Louis from your window. This hotel actually has two buildings; one is mostly for guests to stay in, and the other is used for conferences and business things. They're connected by an underground concourse, and the staff will happily show you how to get from place to place.Great hotel! Definitely enjoyed my stay here.Beautiful hotel for a wedding in a great location in STL.  The ballrooms are exquisite with remarkable views of St. Louis!   They do not have any specialty coffee and when we asked for a cappuccino at the bar in the lobby they directed us to the starbucks that was closed.  So that was not great but everyone who has been to this hotel for a wedding has never been disappointed.  From a guests' perspective, I have to agree, they offer nice celebration options!The newly renovated rooms want to be nice... But the hotel is greatly lacking in many facets.1. No desks in the new rooms.  No chair.. Nothing to sit on just a big empty space where a desk and chair should be.  The front desk says that it's the design layout and done on purpose.  I call bs, the rooms aren't done but they need the revenue. 2.  The wifi is deplorable.  Even at $14 a day for premium, it's slow and drops out all of the time.  3.  The renovation is lipstick.  They left the old thermostat and ac/heating guts.  It's extremely loud when it turns on.  They reglazed the tubs instead of replacing them.  Fine, but they are still rusting.  They didn't bother replacing doors just painted over all of the chips and crap.But everything is ok, they gave me An extra 500 marriott points since I'm staying while the front lobby is under renovations..This hotel will probably be nice once the Reno is done, but I wouldn't expect that to be anytime soon.Epic fail in new room service. Was taken aback at the limited menu when I arrived in my room after flying from LA, called down to ask if this was it and the individual said yes, it's a new take on room service. A panini, bottle of water and bag of chips for $22. That includes a $5 delivery fee plus a gratuity. First bite of sandwich, won't finish it. The chicken tastes funny. As a Marriott Elite Gild or Platinum over the course of the last 20 years, this was really bad. Very disappointed in the quality, offerings and service.Used to be the Renaissance in June 2015, now they rebranded it to Marriott. Great location in the very center of the city. Walking distance to all major sights including the Arch, restaurants, bars, supermarket. Spacious rooms, but some pieces of furniture a little bit beat-up I'd say. We had a package on the concierge level, which included complimentary breakfast, featuring decent buffet even with smoked salmon and after 5 o'clock delicious amenities with something like cheese selection, cooked chicken, soup and salad for instance. No alcohol drinks were included though.Really excellent fitness center, fully equipped with all that you can dream of, weights, even the stairs machines and special cycling bikes for cardio.It's a decent hotel with a great location. I stayed here one night for business over a weekend in September. Check-in was fast and efficient with a very helpful clerk who helped me figure out where I needed to go for my conference. My room was clean and updated, but had a very odd smell -- almost like sweat. Gross! Between this and being on a low floor that overlooked a busy street by Raymond James Stadium I wanted a room change. I called the front desk and they turned me down flat, which put me off a bit since I have an Elite Rewards status. I guess that and a $1.50 will get you a cup of coffee. However, I go out of my way to stay at Marriotts and do expect something above and beyond for my loyalty. /endrantThe rest of my stay was fine and did not end up being noisy at night. The smell eventually went away, but it still creeped me out a bit. Overall a decent hotel, but not nearly as nice as other Renaissance hotels I have stayed at.My sister had her wedding reception at the Renaissance Grand this weekend and I have to say it was a fantastic event. The event staff did a superb job with the space and the servers did a great job with the meal. The food was all top notch and I heard nothing but rave reviews. The hotel itself was undergoing a lobby renovation which was bad timing for us but they did their best to accommodate under the circumstances. As an event rating, they get 5 stars!The rooms in this hotel have seen better days. They are clean but rugs may be threadbare or curtains look old. Some of the televisions are still tube. It seems like the hotel is working through updates. We had a really fantastic weekend at the hotel and again I cannot say enough about the service, everyone from the registration desks to the valets, servers, and event staff were awesome. Thank you!!Loved this hotel.   Lots to do downtown.  St. Louis Cardinals stadium right across the street, not to mention tons of good places to eat within walking distance.   Be prepared to park across the street which isn't bad, just know you will need to leave a little earlier if your in a hurry.The staff was friendly as well.Although in a great location, staff was extremely unhelpful.  I was also told room service was not available after 11pm but that the bar serves food until 1am. There I was told it would be a while before I could even place an order. This has been the only hotel I have ever stayed at where I've had to try multiple times to reach someone at the front desk to help me. Also, when I did reach someone, they seemed uninterested to help even with a simple task of extending check out time by one hour because I was attending a conference AT THE HOTEL that finished at the checkout time of 11am. You would expect staff to be more helpful for the price you are paying. Rooms are pretty standard so not worth the price. After having walked 3 blocks down the street at 11pm to sit at a restaurant bar to just get some appetizers to go, I'm in the latter group. I did pass other hotels along the way - I would definitely look into those first.Love the newly remodeled rooms giving it a newer and more modern feel compared to the previous look.  There are still a lot of construction as the hotel going through the transition (lobby, gym, rooms, etc), but was minimally felt.  A day prior to checking-in, I received a letter from the hotel staff giving me a heads-up on the renovations and that I may have to go to an off-site gym (Fitness Factory).  I did not mind this since it was a 3-story fully operational gym less than 10 minute walk from the hotel.  The hotel is located within walking distance to a grocery store, multitude of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, movie theater, shopping, etc.  Valet park or self-park, which the garage is only a block away.Added plus, since I find myself staying loyal to the Marriott brand, I was generously upgraded by an eager to assist staff.  I will definitely stay at this hotel again and looking forward to when the hotel is complete with the renovations.","Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE. With the new renovations, the walls are PAPER THIN. you can literally hear the person next door talking, even with voices lowered. I don't recommend this place at all. (I hope the college kids next door do well after practicing their speeches at 7:30 this morning!) Also, the beds are SUPER FIRM. For someone who works in the mattress industry, a plush feel on a mattress is better for everyone because it's kind of a happy medium. I woke up to my right side SCREAMING because the firm mattress was too much pressure on my side.If you are a business traveler I recommend staying somewhere else. Im here for a huge event for a client. Really important trip.I checked in and was given a double bed. Bad start. But it happens. I was then told the fitness center is closed. Bad start gets worse.I get to my double bed room and need to get some work done. No desk. To work I have to stand and type on the bureau. I'm not kidding. Then the drilling noises started. And this is all in the first thirty minutes of arrival. What next? Bed bugs, no hot water?  I'm at a loss. I thought Renaissance hotels were premium properties.This was somewhat of a disappointment for us. We drove in from Cincinnati that day, trying to make a symphony. When we arrived at the hotel, we had about one hour to clean up and prepare for our event. The valet and parking was a complete nightmare. Traffic was backed up to the intersection from the disorganized mess that the valet was creating, and it took over 30 minutes to even get someone to take our car.  When we finally got inside, we waited an additional 15 minutes trying to check in. They only had four people manning the desks, while another employee chatted away on the phone in front of us. The staff was very cordial, but when you have a line of over 12 people waiting, get someone else to come help!   Because of this, we weren't able to do much but change our clothes to head to the concert. On top of this, our hotel room wasn't up to par. The room itself was lovely, but maintenance was shabby. The bathroom floor was filthy. The bathtub had rust stains on it, and outside our room sat used drinking glasses (which remained there until we checked out.) Two of us stayed in the room, but we were forced to share the same towels, since there was only one of each.   It's a shame, as I really was looking forward to our stay here. We'll definitely book elsewhere next time around.Bed bug Ridden hotel! Stay away and please do go look at the pictures. My roommate and I both had bug bites on arms and legs. The hotel staff acted like I was a liar and did nothing to help the situation at all. My boss found an old dirty sock in his room. Stay at the Drury they offer free breakfast!Newly renovated rooms are awesome. Just stayed here two nights and I was the first guest in the new room. Been staying here for over 15 years and the renovation was due. Beds are super comfortable. Glad they are renovating this entire property. Great location in downtown STL close to the arch, the stadium and a ton of cool, great restaurants.This is a great hotel. Only reason it's a 4 is it gets a bit too busy sometimes.Here is why I like it. It's off of Washington street which I think is underrated from what I've read. We found lots of good restaurants within a 5 minute walk so it's super convenient.The lobby itself is quite grande and the front desk and concierge is super helpful, providing us with tips on where to go and the essentials when we needed.They offer shuttle service to some business in the area, the guys who drive that are hilarious and super cool. And they went out of their way to get us from A to B safely and quickly, even when ""traffic"" wasn't on our side.But what is great about this place is the concierge lounge. If you can get into this, it offers a great breakfast and snacks during dinner. And when I say snacks I mean ribs, chicken wings, mexican. And then they serve dessert later on too. And the staff up there are super nice and helpful too.The gym itself, I'd say for a hotel gym it's quite good. They got at least 8 treadmills and several ellipticals, headphones to use because each exercise machine has a tv. And there is a ""stretching room"" across the hall that has weights. It's easily overlooked.So I'd stay here in a heartbeat.Called to get corporate information for our business where we have about 200 nightly stays in downtown St Louis per year. The sales lady on the other end of the phone was extremely short and overall just rude. I've never met a hotel salesperson that really had no interest in selling rooms in bulk.We'll be sticking with other hotels in the area.3 1/2 stars...I wonder what is going on downtown? Usually not very much. But the grand Renaissance Hotel in St. Louis Missouri certainly lives up to its name of grand.What I'm gonna say is the best part of the hotel is the staff- everyone from the front desk to the folks cleaning the room are uber friendly.  I appreciated them always asking how I was doing- I mean, like really asking as if they meant it. The swimming pool was kinda lame, but the workout room was pretty decent.  Hey- as far as downtown hotels go, you could do a lot worse.  I think the rooms are probably a tad overpriced, but you are within walking distance from the arch, the stadium and the sculpture park.  Overall the rooms were pretty clean though some of the amenities- like the TV sets (which were literally from 1997), wall paper, and bathroom could use a serious overhaul.I loved this hotel - I will def be saying here again the next time we come visit St. Louis. The hotel itself was being renovated when I came so it's hard to really speak about the decor, but what I will say is that the staff that was working was extremely nice and helpful. They went above and beyond to make sure that you had a great experience despite the inconvenience of the renovation. I was fortunate to have an updated room. I really liked the decor - very simple, sleek, and clean. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious. I also really liked the lighting in the room - I know it sounds strange - but I liked how they highlighted certain aspects of the room.  The only negative thing about this hotel was the restaurant. The menu is limited and the costs of the meals are a bit on the high side. Also it takes you FOREVER to get your food. I was there with a party of 8 and it took over an hour to get our food and 7 of us got salads. And when we finally got our meals they were incorrect.Friendly staff, great rooms, the bar is nice great drinks, the food is delicious. The rooms are clean. Nice flat screen TVs. The bathroom is really nice and clean. Nothing to complain about here. Only thing is the parking deck is a bit of a walk of you don't get valet service. Great location to everything. Stayed here for a Cardinals game. Will definitely come back.Thanks homies!Stayed here during a business trip. A long. Ass. Business fucking trip.  We arrived super early on a Sunday and check in wasn't going to be until 6 hours later. Fml. Lucky, when we got there, the nerd halloween convention was ending and they were checking out. In costumes.The hotel staff were very accomodating and were able to check all 4 of us into our rooms. Amen!Beds were comfy, linens fresh and crisp, bathroom was although schmall, it was nicely decorated.Food was great, staff was great, the only drawback I would see with this hotel was their lack of local brews. Boo. You're freaking close to a brewery and don't even carry theirs? WTF? And $7 to do 1 laundry item? Are you mad?Oh and the conci-concigli-conciglier-conciglieri couldn't tell me how to get to the City Gardens. Really? Thank God for smart phones. Can you work on smart conciglieri?Points for the Starbucks in the lobby. God knows I needed some strong coffee most of those mornings.Other than that, our stay was great. It was conveniently located and could get to most of the downtown points of inteterest relatively easily-with or with out the aid of the conciglieri.The bar service is painfully slow and they generally seem sour. The halls in some areas smell like a chainsmoker lives here, and we saw two half-eaten bacon cheeseburgers sitting in the hall for more than 18 hours - they were still there the last time I passed. The parking is abysmal. The attendants were obnoxious, and they moved the location further away during our stay but did not tell us until after we waited in line and pulled in. The front desk never warned us either. That's bad planning and communication. The common areas feel chaotic with people everywhere and buses blocking the streets. It is a good thing that the place looks modern and new.Convenient location. Spacious rooms. Friendly staff. I think the remodel was definitely needed judging by previous pictures. We just spent one night and didn't spend too much time at the hotel but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.it's a solid hotel, modern enough and with a great location.the America's Center is right across the street, and within a few blocks you have a nice grocery store, several restaurants, and a Metrolink station. the latter was really clutch, since I didn't need to waste money on a rental car that I wouldn't be using anyway (conference events from morning til night).I was very glad that they allowed an early check-in at 1 when I got there, versus 4 which was official policy. guess I lucked out. room was moderately sized and clean, and the standard wifi plan was actually reliable enough that I could stream the latest Doctor Who episode in HD from Amazon on my laptop with no problems.the hotel gym was great. a room for stretching and free weights, then a separate room with plenty of treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and machines. I was surprised and impressed.the bar was alright, and the only time I ate here was during some of the conference events. surprisingly good.I have no complaints!!!! None!!! The room was small but perfect for our party. Amazingly  friendly staff, clean areas and all amenities. If you have business at the Convention Center, stay here!!!!!On a positive note, the staff here is excellent. Very friendly and patient with customers who were spoiled and entitled. The parking was ridiculous. Overpriced and we had to go to overflow parking . I've stayed at the Renaissance in Baltimore and now here. Their amenities for guests are meh. Expensive wi-fi that's slow. Bad, expensive parking, expensive breakfast. I won't do a Renaissance again. I can get better for a comparable priceAll previous reviews mention the need for remodeling and given our experience (refer to pictures) we have to agree. For the same cost we would recommend the Embassy Suites which is across the street which is where we also stayed. The rooms are more spacious and the TV is watchable plus they have free breakfast and happy hour drinks so definitely more value for your money. The only advantage of this place is that there is a StarBucks in the lobby area and taxis parked outside if you need a ride.Marriott Grand Hotel St. Louis, MO...  Although I have stayed at this property many times in the past, and had great experiences, this time I was booked at another hotel.  Because of great past experiences I recommended  to meet a group of colleges here. The property has recently  gone through a major renovation which looks great.  Since I was told the renovations were completed 6 months ago, one would think that kinks would have been worked out.  Lets just say service at this hotel does not have the word ""CUSTOMER"" anywhere near it.  And our experience here was anything BUT grand.Terrible front desk and cafe service. Cafe employees stand around looking up prices and gossiping vs serving. Stood there behind ONE other person trying to get coffee and gave up.Room service menu only has pre made nasty items No desk in room? How is this possible when they claim to be a business hotel!!!If you are interested in feeling safe please do not visit this hotel.  Security is a real problem.  My daughter attended an event sponsored by her company and the Mayor of St. Louis was the guest of honor.  All of the female attendees were told to put their purses in a certain area while they visited different areas of the event.  My daughter and another woman had their purses stolen.  A Marriott employee told them that they had seen a suspicious man stuffing something in his backpack but neglected to call security or confront him.  It is unclear as to why security was not assigned to this event particularly with the Mayor in attendance.  The person who came to check out what happened promptly told the women that after all, this is downtown St. Louis and what would you expect?  Also told them that the employees get their things stolen out of the office regularly.  They not only refused to compensate them in any way but also refused to apologize for their great inconvenience and blamed them for being negligent!  This ended up costing both women approx 500.00 apeice out of pocket with phones, keys, medications, etc!  Very disappointed in the Marriott staff!!!!","We had meetings scheduled in Chicago, but because of conventions, rooms were scarce so we quickly changed to St. Louis.   I booked early and the rate at the Renaissance was outstanding.  I saved the company over $400 which is always nice.The hotel on the outside is very nice, but the inside is undergoing a renovation so checking in was on the Mezzanine level.  They were very nice, took my Marriott rewards # and I was on my way.Get to my room, to find that my requested King was two double beds.  I was one person, and always make sure to request a King. Besides the comfort, I like to stretch in the morning before my run and with that configuration there simply isn't any room.  I called down to the front desk but they said my reservation didn't specify and they couldn't accommodate my request.  I had paperwork to the contrary, but was tired and just let it go.   I slept well, but again in the morning couldn't adequately get stretched which re-annoyed me all over again.They said my room was one of the renovated one's, but I found that hard to believe.  The LG TV was very nice, and the bathroom seemed modern, but the room itself looked like it was from the 80's.  And there was no desk to work at so i basically had to sit in bed with my laptop to get a few things done.Location wise, this hotel is very good.  I had a 10-15 min walk to my office and about a 5 min walk to my hotel.   Given that it was about 55-60 degrees I enjoyed the walk both ways.Rate=4 starsStaff=3 stars.  Only b/c I am sure they had a king room if they had wanted to give it out.Room=2 stars.I probably should give this a 3 star review, but the room really is the most important thing so I'm going with 2.Weekend away in a new city.  Great place to stay.  Walking distance to a lot of shops and eateries and only a cab ride to the concert we came to see.  Will definitely return.Nice hotel for business travel. Sometimes hard to get into because of it's location convenient to the convention center. Lots of good restaurants within walking distance. The staff are very nice, and the breakfast and evening food selection is better than at most Marriott properties. Whole fruit in abundance at all times, and crackers and cheese and salad assembly are standard in the evening. The hot options are improving with time, looking more like real food rather than crummy bar food. The gym is well-equipped, with a regular workout room, a stretching/weight room separate, and an indoor pool. The one time I tried to swim laps at the pool, I was over run by rowdy children, so I have not tried to do a swim in the evening again. I stay here regularly for work, and it's become a home away from home for me. I would recommend this hotel.I had a great experience at this hotel. I was a little worried because the day before we checked in, I received an e-mail that the hotel was under construction. I was pleasantly surprised to see the hotel was 90% renovated. The hotel staff was polite and courteous. The rooms were beautiful and the bed was very comfortable! I loved the downtown location and it's within walking distance to the arch and the baseball field. I would definitely stay at this hotel again!Hotel has great Customer Service. Lobby is amazing and they have a Starbucks. Valet parking is great. And if you wish to park on your own the garage is right across the street.Only bad thing about this Hotel is that they still have the old TVs that if you put it on Tag Sale for Free no one would take it.This hotel is huge, complete with an entire overflow building across the street (the ""lofts).  It's in prime downtown St. Louis location, meaning it's easy walking distance to a variety of prime tourist locations, including the Gateway Arch, the Edward Jones Dome, and the Convention Center.  There's a full fledged Starbucks in the lobby, and a variety of restaurants within a three block radius, so you certainly won't go hungry (or un-caffeinated).The service at the registration desk and concierge/information stand was fantastic!  I was a bit harried when checking in (running late, and straight off a long flight and a gross MetroLink ride), and they literally took less than a minute to check me in and get me my room keys.  Noticing my frazzled state, I was also offered a bottle of water, which was a nice touch.  The lady running the information desk was also on luggage storage duty, and she was a breath of happy, helpful and enthusiastic fresh air.So why just four stars?  The hotel is just a little bit dated and rooms themselves feel very ""standard.""  Nothing special, nothing luxurious, just simple and clean, thus the definition (to me) of A-OK.Vintage Crt tvs.... no fridge or microwave.Not too bad - nothing else to compare it too in St Louis sooooo.  The lobby area, bar, and executive lounge are all pretty nice but the hallways and rooms are looking their age with stains and wear.  The executive lounge is the best thing about the hotel thus far, full meals at breakfast &amp; dinner (instead of just snacks) and super friendly staff.First hotel in a looong time that did not have flat screen TVs - sometimes retro is cool but big-assed heavy TVs is not one of those times.  The staff are decently friendly and the location is pretty good too (especially if you are seeing the Rams) but I would not venture out after dark - even the staff says so.I'll reserve my final decision until after I check out a few other hotels here.Overall had a very nice 3 night experience...kids liked the indoor pool.I booked through priceline and received free breakfast buffet for 2 adults and 2 kids...wait staff was kind enough to include 3rd child at no additional cost.The only meal we had at the restaurant was the breakfast buffet at their Capri restaurant.  It was very plentiful!  I want to highlight the performance of one of the 'busboys'....'bus service' guys... however they are labeled these days.Jamell Lewis was the friendliest, most attentive person I have ever experienced.  He is an example of what the waiters here (and at ANY fine restaurant) should strive to emulate.He did the job of the 'waiter', as they stood and watched.  He moved tables for our larger party, he made pleasant conversation with adults and the kids at our table....appropriately themed and timed....not being overly involved,  and I watched him walk an older patron toward the bathroom, as it was around the corner and a little confusing to explain.On the 3rd morning, I asked to be seated in Jamell's section...and the hostess was surprised and said he was a busboy and not a waiter...but she did so accordingly.Please do the same.....slip him a couple of bucks if you experience the same.I wish that I was in a position to hire this guy.....his personality and outlook are what is lacking today in most people.I will be ending a note to hotel management as well.....this guy needs to be moved up.I was here for 5 days and enjoyed my home away from home.... Hotel is a bit old (they are renovating next year)... Rooms were clean, beds were semi-comfortable.. Food wasn't really all that &amp; their selection was a bit weak. However, the staff members were really nice.. Kay at the front desk was so sweet &amp; helpful!Let me start off by saying that this is the first Marriott-run hotel I have stayed at in a very long time. I usually have my employer book me for Hilton hotels when I travel because 1.) I generally have a positive experience at their hotels, and 2.) I have managed to save up a lot of Hilton Honors points and have this deluded idea that one day I will be able to cash in for the portable basketball hoop I've been eyeing on their website. After my experience at the Renaissance last week, I will NEVER set foot in a Marriott-run hotel again.I had a conference at the Renaissance with an organization I am affiliated with. At one point during our meetings I went up to my room to put my phone on my charger. The person I was sharing a room with was downstairs the entire time because he was presiding over the meeting. An hour and a half later, I re-entered my room to discover that my phone's screen had been shattered. I went down to the front desk to speak with a manager about this, in which the manager told me that it couldn't have been housekeeping because there was a Do Not Disturb sign on my our door. Seems like a cover up, as we did not touch this sign at all.This hotel is essentially a circus. The workers are a bunch of clowns and there are many, many games to be played at this hotel. Aside from the previous game (""Which Of My Belongings Will Housekeeping Break?""), another fun game that we played was ""How Long Can We Clean Ourselves With One Bar Of Hotel Soap?"". We had the opportunity to play this game because, aside from the time housekeeping came in and destroyed my phone, they decided not to bother showing up to our room for the remainder of our stay. It goes beyond the housekeeping destroying my phone and the front desk playing cover up. One of the workers/clowns who works at the convenience store was too busy chatting it up with a manager to ring me up. When I finally flagged her down, she rolled her eyes and spoke to me in an ""annoyed robot voice"" (I'm not making this up. Like I said, its a circus and the workers are clowns). The manager found this funny, which was cool because I love being insulted while I try to pay for overpriced bottles of water and other miscellaneous junk. I noticed she had a stupid looking hot dog tattoo on her wrist (again, not making this up. Circus. Clowns. etc..) so I guess I shouldn't expect any less from her.I filed an insurance claim with the hotel for my phone. Some shithead from Marriott's Shithead Department called to ""investigate what happened to my phone"". I had already read the yelp reviews and noted that a few customers got sent to the hospital because this hotel has BED BUGS and Marriott didn't comp them either. After ""investigating"", the Shithead Department called me to inform me they wouldn't comp me. Color me shocked.Every morning when I turn the alarm off of my phone I am greeted to a shattered screen that seems to get worse and worse by the day. Another cool feature that Marriott's housekeeping imbued into my phone is ""random flash"", where basically my phone's flash for the camera will go off without warning. Doesn't seem too big of an issue, right? Imagine the flash going off on your phone when you are stuck in an elevator with an 8 year old girl and her mom. I had a real fun time explaining to them that I am not a creep, that the Renaissance's clown staff broke my phone and that the Shithead from Marriott's Shithead Department wouldn't comp me for the phone that they destroyed. Imagine the flash going off at the gym when you are working out next to a girl doing squats. I had a real fun time explaining to her that I am not a creep, that the Renaissance's clown staff broke my phone and that the Shithead from Marriott's Shithead Department wouldn't comp me for the phone that they destroyed. Imagine...well, you get the picture.In short, do not come here. You are better off hanging out with the homeless in downtown St. Louis for a few nights than booking a room at the Renaissance. It will be much cheaper, and I'm sure your belongings will be much safer.I usually make an annual trip to St. Louis is see the Cardinals play. This year, I stayed in this lovely hotel. the staff was wonderful and very helpful. My room was great. OMG! I feel in love with their bed linens and pillows. It is within walknig distance to the ball park and a varity of restraunts. The breakfast buffet is probably one of the best ones that I've seen in a while. a wonderful selection of items to choose from. I will be back next year.The Renaissance St. Louis Grand should be called the Renaissance St. Louis ""kind of grand.""  Not that it's a bad hotel (it is not).  It's just that it could be so much more.  This hotel is in fact in a grand old building in downtown St. Louis.  Having stayed there several weeks, I learned that this building used to be part of an early hotel chain called the Stalter hotels, which catered to business travelers back in the 50's.  Since the shuttering of the Stalter in 1987, it has gone through several cycles of decline, sitting empty, repair and ownership changes over the years and now sits on National Register of Historic Places.  Now operated by the Marriott Corporation under the Renaissance brand, the hotel has glimmers of grandness in some areas, but often falls short.Walking through the front doors, you encounter a lobby and atrium that is indeed grand, with its marble floors grand staircases leading to the basement restaurant and intricate original molding work.  The ball room and other meeting and assembly spaces will make you feel nostalgic.  I can envision a lot of weddings are held here as it has that kind of feel.But the rest of the hotel is a bit dated.  The carpet and wall coverings look like they belong in someone's grandmother's home rather than a classic style luxury hotel.  And the rooms themselves, though spacious with 10+ foot ceilings, could use some renovations as well.  Furniture is worn and tired looking.  And many--if not all--of the rooms have tube TVs.  TUBE TV'S!    Another interesting quirk is the peculiar fake tropical foliage in the otherwise super lux lobby.  I mean, palm trees...in St. Louis?  Really, this is a bit cheesy.  But the weight of the lobby itself makes up for this faux pas.  What I like most about the Renaissance St. Louis Grand is the location.  This hotel is smack in the middle of downtown, and directly next to the convention center and Washington Ave., the heart of dining and entertainment in St. Louis.  It's also only blocks from the St. Louis Metro and a really great downtown gourmet grocery store called Culinaria.  The hotel bar is a nice place to relax after a hard day of work.  It's classy and comfortable with good service and decent food and drinks.  Also, as I mentioned above, the rooms are fairly large and have super high ceilings.    I was told that there may be yet another renovation and change of hands in ownership, though it will remain a Marriott brand.  This is not confirmed so don't hold me to that, but someone on the staff told me this.  And, I'm told, this includes the renovation of the vacant and equally grand high-rise building across Washington Ave. which used to be a Marriott Suites hotel.  Stay tuned for that one.  Lastly, another thing to like about this hotel is the price.  You can get a fairly nice room (albeit with a tube TV) in downtown STL for between $130 and $140 on most nights.  Not bad.While it's not the best, for the money, it's a pretty good deal.  You'll only do better in STL if you stay at the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton.One of the worst places I have ever been.  I thought the service in the bar and restaurant was just a fluke....until it happened on every visit. Over an hour wait to get a beer and nachos. Bar is understaffed. Multiple tables un-bussed. Bar littered with empty plates and glasses.  Hotel is okay but bar/restaurant will make me never want to come back. Terrible. Trust me. Don't do it.As a business traveler this hotel is very convenient.  It i' located within 2 blocks of the Metrolink.  The concierge lounge is the best I have seen.  The breakfast was much better than the typical oatmeal, eggs, &amp; cereal- they also had  fresh fruit, and quiche during my stay.  The evening snacks included a quesadilla, chilli, 2 types of salad, cheese &amp; crackers, and veggies.  I will return!I'm in awe of how rude the front desk has been. We requested an early check-in, but they were unable to grant (understandable, they are very busy). But the reason we needed to check in early is because I'm a breastfeeding mom traveling without my baby. When I asked for some other option of where I could pump for 20 min I was told to ""go find a bathroom"". I asked if there was any place in the hotel where I could just close a door that had an outlet she told me no because my room is not ready. I kept asking for options the only thing she just kept saying she can't check me in. I walked away in tears after many inconsiderate comments and she yelled after me ""I've been a mom for 20 years"". LAST STAY HERE EVER.To put it simply, I had a really bad experience here. Let me break it down:Day 1:-Beautiful entrance and design of hotel-I checked in and inquired about any Marriott Rewards promotion that was currently available. The concierge said he'd check for me and let me know. Never heard from him again.-Get to my room and the door handle is tricky. I had to push up and it kept getting jammed.-Called the front desk asked him to bill me and bring me disposable razors. Never got a knock at my door.-The free Aqua Fresh toothpaste was a nice addition to the other small bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.-I pop open my lotion bottle and... [wait for it] it's a used bottle. Yes, used. There was a piece of hair twirling with lotion in the cap.-TV (as others have mentioned) is an old-school tube TV. This didn't matter too much to me since I don't watch TV often.-Rooms are decent-sized. I had a king-size bed.Day 2:-Worked all day and finally got back to the hotel to see what? My room hasn't been touched.-I had no refill lotions, nothin'.Anyways, I'm sure you get the idea that my stay was not pleasant. Overall, the building is gorgeous and the staff is nice, but does not follow through with what they say they'll do for you. I had to stay here for work for four nights and would prefer a different hotel next time. The upside to this location, however, is it's great location.If you do end up staying here, try out Park Avenue Coffee, which is famous for Gooey Butter Cake.This hotel was built in 1917 as a Statler Hotel. It was the first air-conditioned hotel in the United States.  Over the years, the hotel's name has changed.  It even sat vacant for many years, later it was slated for cleanup work.   It was added on to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  Finally, the hotel was renovated in 2000 to 2002.  And later renamed the Renaissance Grand Hotel.There was a time when a Renaissance Hotel was known for being the place to stay for the upscale traveler.  Times have changed.  This hotel joined Marriott over a decade ago and has most likely not lifted a finger since to refresh, renovate or redo any of the corridors or rooms. Plenty has been yelped about the tube TV's in the rooms.  I can understand them not undertaking their replacement due to the expense of updating the armoires.  But things that I cannot understand is carpets that need to be at the very least, cleaned or shampooed. Even replaced. I do not understand furniture that is worn out or damaged.The front desk, lobby, bar, and restaurant are all fine and actually very beautiful.  But the whirl pool needs to be emptied and scum needs to be cleaned from the walls and tiles.  The pool also needs a good cleaning.  I can stand you.  But is that the way you want your customer to feel?  You can feed all of your employees sugar cubes to keep them super sweet and paint smiles on their faces and teach them all about CS 101.  But what you really need  to do here is some good cleaning and a little refresh.This hotel will always be filled to capacity.  They have a great location.  Name brand recognition.  And wonderful employees.  I am a Marriott faithful.  But this hotel is barely passing by my standards.  Did we enjoy our stay here?  Staying here was okay.The hotel is under renovation and offers only one bar area for food and drink.  The small rooms are bare, not even a chair to sit in. The beds are doubles, not queen, and are really uncomfortable.  The bathroom counters are very small. Even the toilet paper is extremely thin. There are no spa services, no shopping nearby, and located in an uninteresting area. From my ""city view"" room I see only rooftops. I would not stay here again.Disclaimer!! This is a review of an experience I had while attending a 3 day conference here.  I did not see any of the rooms, so this is based on the ballrooms and a conference experience.First the conference rooms were gorgeous. From the plush carpet to the chandeliers to the tasteful colors.  The conference was for about 400 people and we were separated into different rooms based on the talk we chose.  Each room was as nice as the next.  It was a little cold, but don't they do that on purpose to keep people awake?  :)The sound systems all worked well and I never saw any problems.  The staff was very attentive during breaks making sure everyone had plenty of drinks and candy to get us through each lecture.  They were also very quick to serve lunch and clear plates away when appropriate.  I am not sure if the food was cooked in house or if each day was catered from outside.  But each lunch was different and delicious.  If you are reading this and considering booking this establishment for a conference, do so without hesitation.  The hotel was gorgeous and the staff very attentive.","This hotel is a hit!!! Beautiful victorian era decor conveniently located across from the American Convention Center and 4 blocks to the Gateway Arch, reasonably priced garge self parking ($18.00/nt.), and a staff that aims to please with very attentive service. Clean, spacious, attentive staff.Very nice and spacious hotel. Bathroom has Aveda products along with plenty of towels. Staff was friendly and attentive. I will say there is NO free wi-fi at the hotel. Parking is also kinda interesting as it's not attached to the hotel but across the street. It's $20 a night for in and out privileges.  Hotel is within walking distance to Busch Stadium. Overall a nice and reasonably priced place to stayHad a nice experience staying here. Room was nice and the bathroom was very big. Staff was helpful and provided places to eat/try during our visit. The only bad things are that there was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. Our room was on the inner part of the hotel next to the AC/heating units. During the night you would hear them turn on and off which was annoying. Other then that We enjoyed our stayi think this hotel is beautiful and has great aesthetics. i would love to give 4 stars, but for various reasons i cannot. here are the pros:-beautiful lobby, nice and spacious.-spacious rooms. nice bathrooms. -super convenient if you wanna be a hipster on Washington Ave (which, btw is not really poppin)-bathroom products are AVEDA. I LOVE AVEDA-they have a big pitcher of fruit-infused ice water at the entrance. VERY refreshing when it's hellacious weather like it is now.here are MY cons:-incidentals at hotels are usually $250-300 (or so I thought?). they placed the entire stay's cost + $25/day for an ""incidental"" authorization on my credit card. NOT. a fan. - my pillows smelled like they had been sitting in the washing machine too long - you know that smell you get? Yah. That. -the phones are the old style phones. which wouldn't bother me but it looked really dirty and grimy.-the TV was a big giant old school tv. Maybe I am a snob. But I would think a flat screen LCD would be something reasonable enough to upgrade for the room? Not sure.Like I said, the hotel itself was beautiful. People friendly. The Grand Bar has a delicious cobb salad. They also have delivery menus and can give good recommendations depending on what you want, if you find you're hungry and needing food past the hotel food places' closing times.I'd stay again, but definitely want to upgrade - in hopes of better room amenities.Overall this hotel was a really great experience.  The primary problem was with the fact that it was so busy-- hosting at least three weddings the night I stayed. This caused the staff to look a little thin... They could have used some support so that non-wedding guests could have their own experience and be more a part of the space.  The lobby is impressive.  The Bellhops, food runners, maids and concierge that I interacted with were all really helpful and had great attitudes (also some great recommendations). The room was large enough and clean... Only thing that was funny was the totally out of date TV.  The bathroom was also comfortably sized... I felt pretty much at home with everything!We ordered breakfast in the morning and the lox bagel plate was nothing interesting; however the granola and yogurt was great!!Overall I would absolutely stay here again, and I had a great time in St Louis!Got a great deal on a room due to a credit from Expedia, and I appreciate a room for $34 total ($79 room). No city view to my room, just tall buildings. It's located a bit less than desired, away from ballgames and to Scotstrade Center. Self-parking at the hotel was $18.Regarding the room, loved the mattress!  Comfy bed. The bathroom was large - I liked it!  R provides Aveda bath products and leaves a tube of Aqua Fresh. Nice!  Linens are white.  One note - the chair and lamp table stuffed btwn the bed and in the curtains need to be removed. No one can sit in the chair, unless one wants to look at the lamp.The hotel has a nice atmosphere to it in ways. It looks nice. R provides a person to assist with tourist information (restaurants, transportation, maps, anything) and is handy. Staff were friendly. The cocktail lounge was ok, clean, but rather pricey - $6.09 for a domestic draft beer.  The ice machine was empty! The hotel used to be entertaining with a fun open area with music and more; no longer. The hotel met the needs of a good night's sleep and decent quarters to clean up. I cannot complain.I guess with this hotel you are really paying for the location. It was convenient to be across the street from the convention center.  But other than that...We arrived at 11am and were told that the room would be ready in about an hour and took our cell number. We waited until after 4 pm, which is check-in time, still no call. I went to the manager at this point and she said the room was still not ready. Mind you, tons of other people are coming and checking in throughout these hours while we waited. The manager said she would switch our room so we could check in, so we finally were allowed to go to a room. The room was extremely small and cramped. There was a small desk but no table so we had to eat on our beds, which were full sized, not queens. The tv was not a flat screen and the picture was pretty fuzzy. It was in a cabinet with doors on it, but the doors only opened 90 degrees, so even though the tv would slide out a little bit, there were positions on the bed that couldn't see the whole screen. The positive features were that the room did have a mini fridge and the pool and hot tub were nice. On my way to St. Louis I stayed at an Econo Lodge that I liked much better.Great hotel, and very accommodating.  We stayed at the Renaissance Grand for a bachelorette party/bridal shower weekend.  A standard room with two doubles was spacious enough for four of us comfortably.Staff was friendly and very helpful from everything to breakfast room service to drink vouchers at the bar, to extra towels.To top it off, we were able to get a VERY discounted rate on Priceline.Cheap-was $89/nightRoom- Was small but had all the essentials. Had an old cathode ray tube tv, but had an empty fridge that we used every day = good tradeoff for me. Overall (not counting tv) it was nice enough. Toilet paper placement is in an ideal location for a person to bump their arm on the toilet bowl and/or their hair to touch the sink. Gross. What the F?  This taken into account, maybe closer to a 3.5 star room.Noise- There was a party in the two rooms next to me. It was loud until long after midnight. Hotel, why did you book me next to a wedding block? What the F. Noise insulation terrible.Exterior of hotel-Meh. Maybe 3.4 stars. It was kinda funny, one side was painted to look like a hotel. Weird...Interior of the hotel-Nice. A solid 4. Maybe a 4.2 stars. Was user friendly. Had a printer and computer to print boarding passes. Had free fruit at front desk. Sometimes there was water at the lobby-this was not dependable and it was inconsistent.Customer Service- 4.8 stars. Got in a car accident and concierge doled out useful advice, offered me waters, even offered to buy me a drink, and comped me some of my parking. He remembered us the next day and helped us travel back to the airport through public transportation. When I asked another concierge where there was a grocery store so that I could buy waters, he gave us directions and also offered us waters. A different concierge who greeted us on the first day was patient with us and gave us good recommendations for food. Overall Experience: 4.2 stars. Would return.Pros:- Great location. Downtown St. Louis, central to bars, shops, and stadiums. Felt safe.- Service was great. Staff was very friendly.- Lobby is gorgeous &amp; there is a restaurant, bar and Starbucks.- Aveda products in the bathroom! I love Aveda!Cons:- No free wi-fi, anywhere. It's a $9.95/day charge.- No free breakfast.- Tube TV's.- No HBO, Showtime, etc.- No refrigerators The workout rooms, pools and stretching room all looked nice when I walked by, but I never had a chance to check them out.All in all, it's certainly not the worst. It's an okay room in a great location. But, location is exactly what you're paying for. For the price I'm paying, I'd certainly expect SOME ""extras"" included and I really felt that there were none. Next time, I'll pay a little less to be a block or two away from downtown and get some amenities!This is now my favorite St. Louis downtown hotel. Great location within walking distance of some great restaurants and lounges. They have one of the best concierge floors I've visited. In fact, I just changed my rating based on reflecting over the concierge service in the morning and evening. For breakfast, they have a great variety of hot and cold meals including smoked salmon, hard boiled eggs, fruits, cereals, bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs. For the evening, they have nice salads, fruits, and usually nice hot meals such as flatbread pizza or fried ravioli. They have a nice LifeFitness gym with about 5-6 ellipticals and 6-8 treadmills. They also have a nice stretching room. Pool and business center are very good. The rooms are a bit small and this last time, I had an old TV as well. Very good for business meetings. Their restaurant and lounge were very good. I put down paid internet, but for gold and platinum Marriott Rewards members, it comes free.Decent property. Older in town hotel... the rooms are a little smaller but not a deal breaker. Concierge lounge service was outstanding, and the breakfast options were fresh and well done.Property is clean and the staff was very helpful. The only thing that holds off the fifth star is that on two of three occasions that I needed my car from valet it was late even when I called 15 minutes in advance. They had to get it when I hit the lobby.Aside from this, nice hotel.Getting a GREAT deal on a great location.. I love the location and how close this is to everything downtown.. Gorgeous building and LOVE the Starbucks on the first level.. Cause I gotta get my Pumpkin Spiced Latte..  The room was clean, set up nicely, but one thing i wish for a two bed room is ..  Why can't the room be a little bigger??  It seemed the bathroom was half the size of the room ( NOT COMPLAINING about that.. ) and having 4 people in a room was very crowded..  The view from our room was still fabulous and fantastic..  But there was one more thing I did have a little problem with..PARKING!!!  paying $17 to park while staying at the hotel.. it's a block away and have to park, walk, and then turn the corner to get in the hotel.. it wasn't a hassle but I'd like to not carry my stuff ALL the way from the car to the hotel when I have 4 bags of luggage.. Yes, that is just MY luggage.. no judging.. ;)    So for a one night stay it was good, but I wouldn't stay there that much longer if i didn't have to..Also.. We didn't have a book of mormon in our room, but apparently got charged for one at the end of our stay..  I just don't understand why there are charges for things we had nothing to do with..  oh well.. I guess I'll have to say thank you for not being charged to use the elevator as much as I did..Downsides: Room size...not great. I expected a bigger room considering the rate. There are also box TV's with really bad reception and like 20 channels...I mean, really? In 2012? At a base rate of over $200 a night?  That's lame.   I was told they were in process of upgrading the TV's,  starting from the 23rd floor and were stalled at the 16th (which we were on) to finish the grand ball room.   Also, showers have very bad water pressure-part of the green movement.  The beds while I enjoy the softness are just too soft for multiple people to sleep on the doubles. We got a room with two double beds and my husband and I were literally sunk into the mattresses with aching backs in the mornings. Maybe it is better to get a ""feather free"" room so you will get a better mattress.   Lastly, the lady at the attractions and getting around town desk- in the lobby...well, I am really wondering how she has this job when she literally didn't know much of anything or how to get anywhere. She couldn't even tell us where the closest McD was for the kids. The guys in valet were much more helpful all the way around.  OH! and there was no microwave for the guests to use anywhere!   That is crazy!  There is a hotel ""store"" but it closes so don't expect to run downstairs at 2am and grab a snack like you can in most hotels of this caliber.   PS: charging people for wifi nowadays at a hotel such as this, is absurd!  $9.95 a day! Esp considering you can walk a block either way and get free wifi everywhere.  It is just not showing they appreciate their guests very much.  This is the only hotel I have stayed at downtown that charged for wifi, didnt have a 24hr guest store and had no safe in the room.~ I didn't do room service, buffet or drinks at the bar after reading other reviews on here about quality and price.Upsides: Well it isn't called Grand for nothing! From the moment you pull up it screams ""Grand!""  The entry is gorgeous and the architecture is spectacular.  I cannot even put into words how accommodating the staff is...they were all fabulous. The valet guys especially.  In today's world it is hard to find an entire staff that appear to enjoy their job and don't give off any negative energy.  Well they have that here. Everyone was just great!  And a good point on the beds: the linens and duvet and pillows were extremely comfortable! If I were sleeping alone I would have thoroughly enjoyed the mattress, as well.I never heard a peep from the hallways or through the walls.  I also liked that the pool hours were so late - til 11!  The floors were incredibly slick though.  Fitness center was clean and 24hrs. Pool towels are actually soft too.  I wasn't impressed with the bathroom towels but they could have been worse. Bottom line...if this place had slightly firmer beds, caught up with 2012 and got flat screens and HD on the TVs, Safes and free wifi it would be a slam dunk no question about staying here.  I will probably be back, if I get another god rate through AAA, as we did this time. But I will keep my options open until they get it a little more tweaked.  If anything pulled me back it would mainly be the valet and front desk staff.Notes:  ~Be sure to put the change linens card on your bed, if you want new sheets during your stay.  Throw towels in the tub if you want fresh ones. ~I heard about some thefts with the cleaning staff,  so I strongly advise to take valuables to the front desk safe when going out during cleanings. IDK if there is any truth to it but why chance it?~The Starbucks is slammed in the morning...expect to be in there for 20mins.~Pepsi products only at this hotel so pick up your cokes before checking in. ~You can request rooms with a mini fridge, they do not all have one.~Sign up online for Marriott rewards...you get perks instantly!****Suggestions:  **STAY AWAY FROM 12th ST diner.  I see the great reviews on these sites but I firmer call BS.  I think the owner has friends and workers do so...that place was one of the nastiest restaurants I have ever eaten at and as I state in my review I would eat off a waffle house floor before eating at 12th street diner again. * Old spagetti factory...is what it is but much better places to spend your money in ST Louis. Expect to be rushed through your meal but if you go def get the cheese bread!* Pi Pizza- is a must do for pizza lovers, it's one block over!* Prime 1000- a block up is AMAZING but it is pricey.  *Culpeppers- fabulous!!!!*Cuerso's- super yummy!!! Serves breakfast too.*400 Olive - good!* I strongly advise everyone to visit the City Museum...look it up, it's spectacular fun for kids and couples that enjoy climbing and being a kid at heart.  Not the best for kids under 3 or pregnant  mamas - Magic house is a good choice too!  Also check out The Fudgery at Union Station and wait around for the show they do every hour and 3 for price of 2 fudge bars and 5 for price of 3 bars following the shows.We used this hotel for our son's wedding in October of 2014, and we were all very pleased with the way everything was organized. Both the reception and the rehearsal dinner took place in this hotel. The rooms were great, the food was excellent, and both events went flawlessly. A special thank you to Robert Osterholm who was in charge of coordinating and setting up the events. Very professional and very thorough. We had guests from all over the country and from abroad and almost everyone also stayed at RGH, and very very happy with the rooms and service. All in all, we would highly recommend it.On a recent trip to STL, I decided to check out a hotel that I hadn't stayed at during one of my many previous visits.  I chose the St. Louis Renaissance for it close location to Busch Stadium, since the reason for the trip was to see my beloved Cardinals.My brother and I pulled up to the hotel in a scene that could only be described as chaotic.  The line for valet was so deep that you couldn't even turn right to get to the main hotel entrance.  We waited for about 6min. before some cars were cleared out of the way and we were able to leave our vehicle with the valet.  Valet parking is $28.  Upon entering the lobby, we were again greeted by a slew of people all waiting to check in.  The line was easily 20 people deep and I don't want to imagine how long check-in took for those who don't have status with Marriott.  I was lucky and asked a bellman which line was for Gold/Platinum access and was quickly taken to a line with only one other guest; sometimes hotel loyalty has its perks.  Check-in was quick for me, but looked pretty painful and time consuming for everyone else.When we got to the room, it was very nice.  The 2 bed room was spacious and the bathroom was rather large... It appears that the rooms were updated recently and that most fixtures were newer.  There was limited noise from the hallway and neighbors as well, so I think they did a good job sound-proofing.  An added bonus is that there is a mini-fridge in the armoire, so we were able to keep our beverages cold.  I had no idea that the room had a fridge so I was pleased.  The mattresses were very nice compared to recent hotels I have stayed in and I was able to get a good night sleep.The walk to and from the stadium took less than 15 and was very well travelled even late into the evening; it was a quick and safe walk.   The following morning, my bro and I enjoyed the continental breakfast.  There is no Concierge Lounge on the weekend, so we were able to get the continental portion of the buffet for free, if we wanted to add the hot food it would have been an extra $6.  In all honesty though, fruit, oatmeal, and muffins/bagels is more than enough for me.  There were many options to choose from and we both walked away happy and full.Check-out was a breeze.  When we walked outside to the valet to get the car, it was again a scene of chaos.  There were a ton of people waiting for their cars and the valet guys were running to get people in their vehicle and moved out for the next round of cars.  It took about 15min for us to get our car and I thought it was a total mess!  Overall, I really liked this hotel.  It was clean, modern, and the staff was very friendly.  They do need to figure out a better valet solution though because entering and leaving were both a mess and neither experiences were pleasant.  Yet another beautiful weekend in St. Louis, home of my favorite baseball team and the friendliest place on earth in my opinion.I obviously travel a LOT.  I can definitely say that I had not experienced the inevitable horror story until I stayed at this hotel.  Firstly, I landed at1035pm so I did not arrive here until just about 11pm.  It was busy with several patrons crowding the entrance and the hotel exuded an interesting rustic vibe.  I went to my room and ordered room service.  The lady was a lil rude stating that it would take an hr to an hr and a half.  I said okay, I was starving after my 3 hr flight from the west coast plus the 2hr time difference!  So I do a lil work, hop in the shower, and the towels are dirty!!!!!  I find one that seems clean and am already peeved when I find the lotion bottle is half empty.  What's the standard???  Finally, I pull back the sheets and there's 2 hairs on the sheet!  I'm not talking about head hair either.  I call ""0"" and I ask if there's another too available.  The operator rudely states that they are sold out.  So I explain what happened and he just says to hang on.  He transferred my call and it rung and rung until the answering machine finally picked up.  I hung up an dialed 0 three more times only to be automatically transferred again with no answer.  Hey operator, I wouldn't be calling you back again if someone picked up.  It's now 1am and I notice room service never arrived.  I call them and no answer.  Finally, the operator picks up for my next call.  He simply says people prob aren't picking up the phone since they're busy.  I get dressed and get my butt to the front desk.  The lady working must've just been called in cuz she was in sweats and not dressed appropriately.  She was a total sweetheart tho and put me in a new room while apologizing profusely.  I really just wanted to get to bed so I didn't make a big deal of it but seriously.  Everything was obviously in disarray as people weren't aware of who was working what or managing what.  Flash forward to the next morning and there is no record of my situation marked as I was checking out a night early.  She was nice enough to take half off the stay which doesn't really matter as m traveling on business but wow!  I will never stay here again.  I much prefer the airport renaissance.  The food is better, the service, and it's updated.disgusting hotel.  Carpets old and dirty.  furniture looks like it was purchased at a garage sale.  I expect better from a Renaissance property.We went here for a banquet and it was produced VERY nicely.  Great Venue for event having to host HUNDREDS of people.I stayed here last night and booked it through priceline! Great price and exceptional service when I checked in since they knew it was my birthday Orlando at the front desk wanted to make it special for me and my sisters! He got us a room on the top floor with a pretty view! The beds are amazing and its very luxurious like especially the lobby! Only downfall is the shower was really hard to operate and we called for assistance and it took them 30minutes to arrive. When the guy did he told us we had to pull the lever really hard and hold it for a long time. Then it only worked when the water pressure was on medium!  No exhaust in bathroom and other than that amazing stay I do recommend!","went here for a wedding this past weekend and the Renaissance staff was great.  During the dinner we did have a couple people complaining about sassy wait staff but I didn't notice anything.  The hotel bar is a cool spot.  Not sure about $6 bud light draft though this is STL after all.Our hotel room was nice and clean and bed was pretty comfortable.Used points for the stay so did not have to pay the higher costs. It is a nice hotel with clean rooms and friendly staff.Stayed here for a friend's wedding and was initially impressed by the hotel's grandeur but left with a sour taste in my mouth.Was unfortunately disturbed in the hallway by some intoxicated and foul-mouthed guests who insulted and provoked my boyfriend as he and I passed them after returning from the (lovely) wedding reception. After an insuing altercation, we left ASAP the next morning, seriously disturbed. Was not happy the hotel did not accept my request for a full or partial refund, via a well-thought out email and telephone conversation with a manager, after this traumatic event. Their reasoning was that we were part of a disturbance to many other guests and the other (uninvolved) guests had to be refunded first.Also found the room size rather small for a hotel of this price in a mid-sized Midwestern city. Valet parking was also quite pricey  - this is St. Louis, not NYC or LA.Will never recommend guests to stay here when they visit my hometown.We stayed at this hotel for a friends wedding over Memorial Day weekend, which was one of the 13 weddings this hotel was hosting according to the reservation desk. I'm just going to get to the point because even thinking about it right now puts me in a bad mood.Pros:*It's a pretty hotel. Very elegant when you first arrive *VERY nice reservation desk &amp; staff*Convenient. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go*Huge bathroom with Aveda products*Door staff was very prompt with bringing up our luggage*Valet was quick to bring our car aroundCons:*When you walk in, there is infused water in the lobby, which would be a nice touch if it was full. Both days we stayed, it was empty at all hours*The bathroom has no fan. After a hot shower you have to wait for the steam to leave in order to use the mirror; also would be nice for when people have to ""use"" the bathroom.*The bathroom was right across from the bed- RIGHT ACROSS- hardly no space in between which means NO PRIVACY.*Very thin walls; We could hear people walking around above us and babies crying*There must have been a race in the stairwell at 10 am one morning because we could hear herds of people running up/down the metal stairs. At the same time there was a warning alarm going off outside so we really thought there was an emergency and no one at the hotel was alerting us. *The website says they have free wi-fi in the ""common areas"" and in your room. NO they don't. No free wi-fi. Very disappointing for the price we had to pay.*No refrigerators in the rooms or available for use unless it's for something the size of a pill bottle.*SMALLEST pillows in the world, unless you're between the ages of 1-10yrs old. *They do not change your sheets everyday because they want to be more of a ""green hotel"" which is awesome, unless you have holes in your sheets like we did. *Our first night we had to ask the reservation desk at :4:45pm to have someone come to our hallway and remove the breakfast tray from the room across from us that had been sitting all day. GROSS. *This also meant our room had yet to be cleaned at 4:45pm*They're super quick to wake you up to get you to leave when they know it's check out day. Our door was knocked on at 8:00am!!!! and my biggest complaint: NO COMPLIMENTARY BREAKFAST. Would it kill you to offer some free fruit or something? At almost $300/night I think giving a banana or an orange wouldn't be too much to ask for, instead of sending people to their restaurant for a $50 meal.We stayed at the Renaissance Grand Hotel for just one night on our way to Nashville, but we certainly would have enjoyed staying longer. The hotel is beautiful, and everyone from the valet to Orlando at the front desk check in, to Zoe at check out the next morning, were helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel. Also great location- would have loved to try the restaurants!Great service and staff. Didn't have any issues except for a gal that works in Starbuck ""Latrice"" name on her uniform. She was nasty attitude or just having a bad day . She needs to be reminded that customer service skills and that the consumer pays her bills!!! Other then that the hotel was great!!!!These people are so nice!  The hotel is very old, but that's ok since it's got historical value. (which you can read all about in your room). We are here for a convention for a week. It's clean &amp; our room with two double beds is roomy, as is the bathroom. This hotel is also convenient to many restaurants and shops. The only drawback is no view out the windows.I would have written this review while I was actually staying at the hotel, but they don't have Wi-Fi in the rooms. In 2012. Yikes. Even staying in the Presidential Suite, we were still unable to get anything but Ethernet connectivity. I guess the Prez won't be updating the White House Facebook page or launching any nuke attacks the next time he is in St. Louis!The hotel is in serious need of updating. It looks like it's been about 20 years since it was last done and with newer hotels in the downtown area, they are being left behind. The service was great, however. Rolanda at the front desk went above and beyond when it came to taking care of a small problem we had. Great employees like her are one of the reasons we are loyal to the Marriott brand. The room service and Capri cafe food was average to decent, depending on the dish. Parking is $14 in a garage across the street from the back of the hotel. It's an easy walk and convenient when needing to leave and return. Overall, there are worse hotels in STL, but there are also some better. Top notch service keeps this property from getting two stars.Great downtown hotel.  Close to the subway stop.  Next time I'll take the sub from the airport and not rent a car. Excellent service at the hotel.  Great fitness room!A two-star hotel masquerading as a four-star.I recently attended a four-day conference at the hotel.  Certainly the exterior architecture and grand lobby arre impressive, but it's all downhill from there.The rooms are small and unimpressive, with dated furniture that's not particularly comfortable.  The beds are fine, the desk is about a foot too high for the chair even when the latter is fully extended.  A corner armchair is cheap and hardly luxurious; no ottoman. The bathroom is archaic.  A tub with shower, no stall, and no vanity counter.  There's a glass shelf above the sink that's barely deep enough to rest a dop kit on (and the shampoo smelled oddly like turpentine).  A noisy heating system NEVER stopped spewing noise (if not heat) the entire time I was there.  Relatively small flat-screen TV with very few channels.The room service menu is very limited, and the food is lousy...not just mediocre, but lousy.  A perfectly cooked omelet came with frozen Ore-Ida potato cubes (that were cold and soggy) and burnt toast.The restaurant fare is identical to in the in-room dining.  Spare menu, poorly executed.  At lunch a simple turkey club was among the driest, most tasteless I've encountered.  An evening ""filet"" was about 4 oz. resting on a bed of stiff, starchy garlic mashed potatoes, accompanied by an iceberg lettuce ""Caesar"" salad.  You won't want to eat at the hotel, even if you really don't feel like going out.The staff are friendly and eager, but in the end they fall short.  The 18th floor ""lounge"" for concierge-level guests reminds one of a hospital waiting room.  Plain-jane atmosphere that doesn't remotely resemble a lounge, staffed with a few friendly but completely incompetent (elderly) waitresses.  There's no bar, so you wait for one of them to emerge from an alcove kitchen-like area to offer you a drink.  The selection is limited, and you're best advised to order two at a time: the lounge barely accommodates 25 people, but the odds of getting a refill within 30 minutes of finishing your drink are very, very low.  Everything moves at a snail's pace.In-room wifi signal is weak, so they provide an Ethernet connection, and you have to pay for access regardless of how you access it.In short, this hotel is all about facades: the exterior of the building and the lobby area.  Apart from those, this is Holiday Inn quality at best, and not always even that.  No way I'd stay here again.*Tourist Review* So we wanted a hotel that fulfilled these requirements: 1. Close walking distance to stuff downtown 2. Affordable 3. Better than 3 stars. Well, that's when we found Renaissance St Louis Grand Hotel Downtown. And it filled those 3 desires. This is a massive hotel but close to the Metro/Train/Tram, close to where the Rams play, and some bars/restaurants. We paid $109 per night on priceline. What other items do you get for that price-dated tv - tube tv-funky older furniture -not the most prompt or clean housekeeping. But the concierge needs a raise (super helpful) and gave us some great recommendations (even as a yelper!)  there is a Starbucks, indoor pool and hot tub. In the middle of the night some drunk ass was banging on the doors, but by the time we woke up, got out there staff was there to handle the situation - so that was cool. Looks - its not the Ritz, or some boutique hotel but for location it was great and the staff took care of it. I'd stay again. For that price.We have stayed at this hotel five years in a row and we are never disappointed.  Outstanding service including taking care of me after I had an accident a few blocks away.  The staff made sure I had the care I needed and even directed me to a dentist to repair my broken tooth- yes, I hit that pavement hard but that is another story.  Point is, this hotel has always been exceptional and now, when I needed them most, they didn't let me down.  Friendly and efficient staff and exceptional service.   We could possibly stay at a cheaper place each year but why bother?  This is where we will be found.  NO reason to look any where else.Enjoyed my stay here quite a bit.  Were it not for my addiction to Starwood points this would be my go-to in St. Louis.* Starbucks in the lobby is convenient* Flexibility to let me check in @ 10am was very helpful* Mostly good experience in the lobby restaurant.  The ham, egg, cheese and apple butter breakfast panini was stupid tasty.  Smoked chicken salad wrap for lunch was also excellent, but unfortunately they just pulled it off the menu.PRICELINED IT!I got a great deal naming my own price. FiftyFive bucks for the 4th of July. Great deal. Really nice, huge hotel. Really friendly staff. The room was standard size. Very tall ceilings which I liked. Comfy bed with nice sheets. The bathroom was large and had some really fancy wallpaper. Also, I like that there is a starbucks in here. Parking was somewhat of a pain. There garage is across the street and it costs 14 bucks and you still have to pull your luggage across the street. You could valet it but it costs 30 bucks. Also, they don't have WiFi and I couldn't even connect using the cable. Other than that, the place was great. I would stay here again for sure.I spent the weekend recently and had a very good experience, overall. The valet was very prompt. The check-in process was very quick. Room was very quite, even with  full occupancy in the hotel. The suite was very up- to -date, with flat screens in every room, refridgerator, Wi-fi through ethernet. HVAC system kept us comfortable. The bed was excellent. The shower lacked the wide curtain rod that you find in the simplist of hotels/motels in today's day. Not sure why they missed that simple detail. In summary, I would definitely come back to this hotel again on my next visit to St. Louis.I attended a conference in the area and stayed with two other women in the same room. This hotel could not get the bill straight. It was to be split three ways. I had paid a deposit but they credited it a roommate and placed a hold on my card for another night. This caused my account to be overdrawn. I was without funds for 36 hours and missed part of the Keynote Address while straightening out this mess. They refused to compensate me and I didn't have any money for food. When it was time to check out, the bill was still wrong. I went to get it straightened out and the front desk worker said, ""That's why we don't like doing business with you people."" Then he quickly apologized. I'll think twice before returning next year.Decent though dated Marriott in downtown St. Louis, the location is fairly good and convenient to a number of things, like the Arch. Parking is a little bit of a hassle across the street, but it works. The rooms are not awesome (where are the flatscreens?) but comfortable enough. The lobby is attractive, did not try the bar or any of the restaurants.For $220/night this place sucks.1. No wireless internet. WTF, folks, it's 2011 and you're a Marriott chain.2. That's $16.50 per day for SLOW WIRED internet access. MY SMTP email timed out once, and I wasn't even DLing Adult Love Stories. I feel like I'm in a major metropolitan city in the EU. Except, I'm in lame ass STL.3. Business suites across the street from main lobby, NP, just walk a ways in the rain.4. 15 bag boys but one person at the counter to check in. Had to wait 10-15 minutes to check in.5. Elevators suck.6. Workout room mediocre, looks like someone stole half the dumbells, until you realize they bought one set and randomly distributed them between two workout rooms.Everyone is super nice and polite, solid service as $220/night should deliver. The hotel lobby even looks promising.The rest...meh. I'll be trying another chain next STL trip.I stay here when I travel to St Louis on work. I am a Marriott Gold member. The perks for elite members are different. The lounge on the 18th floor is good. If you are not going out for dinner with co-workers or clients, the lounge is a good place to grab a quick bite. They have an entree, a soup, salad bar, cheese and crackers. Service is excellent. If you are an elite member, stay on the 21st floor. Very private and only a handful of rooms.Overall, the hotel is acceptable, but not grand as the name might imply. Like most Marriott brands, you really can't anticipate what you will get. Renaissance should be a step above other hotels in the portfolio (e.g. better than say a Courtyard) but that is simply not the case here.1) Small rooms - the rooms are definitely on the smaller side. Some are interior facing so there is nothing to look at but your neighbor. The decor is dingy and my CRT tv buzzed when displaying bright colors2) Great bathrooms - the bathrooms look recently renovated. Bright and clean. Only complaint is that counter space is lacking but I managed just fine. Plus Aveda makes the best products!3) NO WIRELESS INTERNET - I called the front desk because I thought the router was down. Nope. The hotel does NOT have wireless internet in guest rooms. Only Ethernet access. My laptop doesn't event have Ethernet cord!As a frequently traveler, my standards are definitely higher than those of 'leisure' travelers. It is fine for a night, but not for a week. Doubtful I would choose to stay here in the future...","['pretty', 'swanky', 'modern', 'clean', 'lobby', 'excellent', 'downtown', 'location', 'room', 'rates', 'pretty', 'reasonable', 'midweek',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-st-louis-at-the-ballpark-saint-louis,Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark,3.0,$$,168,"Business trip with my partner. It was OK, the room was not clean, and decorated poorly, half modern, Half old, actually the whole hotel is like that. Everything seemed uninviting, as in the pool workout room and the bar areas. It was not easy to get extra towels, however the room service food was quite delicious very authentic and well worth the price.  If you smoke cigarettes, be prepared for a very long walk. And just because you're staying at the Hilton, does not mean you get the simple luxury of a mini fridge or microwave, may I add,  if you would like to fill up your ice bucket even need to take the elevator to the next level and if you would like to get anything out of the vending machine, you'll have to hunt for those. There's no cheap eats, especially breakfast. This hotel is nothing to brag about. I have stayed at nicer super 8's.Yep, one star. Three elevators and one doesn't work? Oh wait, it does? Make up your mind! It's like the hotel has gone through a remodel of the front lobby and everything else is waiting it's turn. The rooms are terrible. Not as good as any other Hilton I've ever been to. Meanwhile the fact that the bathroom had hair in the tub and all over the floor and toilet makes for a seriously piss poor situation. Oh, and the ""official rate"" posted on the door is a laughable $899. Hahahaha! And to top it off many people come to the roof-top bar, because, you know why not? It's cool, right? Um, no. The bar is likely all this hotel has going for it. But make no mistake, whether you go to it or not, if you are in a room anywhere near the top of the hotel you will hear the blazing thump of music well past midnight. Yep, you heard me, you can hear the music from the bar in your room even if said room is multiple floors below. Moreover, the aforementioned crap elevators are filled with the bar hoppers so you better expect to wait in line for at least 20 minutes up and down. Or, just take the service elevator around the corner.Wow buddy. That is all I can say. For a manager, your ability to handle simple requests without investing emotionally is nill.The Hilton used to be the place where stress was left at the door and everything was taken care of... now it is more of a mix of Jerry Springer and Southside with a taste of Vidor TX...Simple requests I wish I would have requested instead of leaving due to your unprofessionalism Have a key that worksHave a shower that worksDo not automatically presume an interracial couple has bad intent (specifically directed at the on duty manager last night and in no way reflects the amazing work the other staff did in an attempt to overcome the damage he performed in a matter of minutes)Do not show your attitude around childrenUse common sense when dealing with customersLearn from your staff and do the Hilton name a service and remove yourself. Please understand, it is not because you are white... it is because you are ignorant.It started with a great check in. People were pleasant and the room was clean. As the night went on, we found out the shower was not working. I went down to address it and the manager agreed to switch rooms. It was then that things went downhill. When I went down, I handed him my key card and through the process I said that I would need the key back. He insisted that I show my id to get the card back. I told him to stop playing games and took the card. At the room, I was greeted by security asking for my id as I was standing in the room with my family. The situation brought me to leave and bring my family to the Hyatt down the street.When he cancels the room, he never asked for id. It was obvious that he did not want us there. I am Edward using my finances phone to post this. The most thoughtless, inconsiderate and power hungry person I ever made the mistake of doing business with. I just wanted a mellow, problem free night. What I received was a stack of problem on top of problem from the manager. His worker was professional and polite... Him... Not so much.Stayed here for a week.     Good choice as it is right smack in the center of downtown St. Louis.    Just a few blocks of a walk to the Mississippi River and boats, and that huge Arch.   Excellent service, totally top notch.Even though it was all business, my stay at Ball Park Hilton was great. Definitely top notch. The rooftop bar is a must experience.      Team O'ReillyDear Ryan Cantrell of Hilton at St.Louis at the Ballpark and to whom this concerns,I am emailing you to see if you can help me.I love the Hilton hotels I usually never have ANY issues and if I do the staff is pleasing and solves the situation. UNFORTUNATLY The Hilton at the ballpark is a misrepresentation of the HILTON name. I usually stay at the Hilton at the Arch, and I Love it there, I always wanted to stay at the Hilton Ballpark because I heard great things about your rooftop bar. I finally reserved a room at your hotel on Tuesday 10-2-2015 confirmation #******************* 1st problem was when I arrived to my room, there was 2 garment bags in the closet. I called your desk and they said they will handle it. They couldn't give me a reason why someone's bags are in the room. I then call back and they said there was a mix up with the room, and asked to give me another room since I was sure someone was going to try to get into this room, The clerk ASSURED me that wouldn't happen, and the room would be fine. An hour later someone tried to get in the room, I opened the door, and It was the owner of those bags! Why was I Lied too? I told the gentleman that the front desk has his bags, he was upset saying that this wasn't the first time this happen! What kind of security issues do you have here? I should have checked out after this.2nd problem, as I stated earlier, I wanted to enjoy the rooftop. Unfortunately there was a private party that booked the entire floor, with NO WARNING TO GUESTS. If I knew that when I checked in, I would have went somewhere else. Why don't you inform your customers of what is going on in your hotel?3rd problem. The room was horrible. I have stayed at hotels for 40.00 that were nicer than this. The sink was cracked, drapes were dirty, the carpet below the beds looked like they were never vacuumed. I was disgusted! Also the hvac fan was as loud as a truck. The shower took over an hour to drain. The remote didn't work, so I didn't watch tv. Your elevator system is confusing for anyone getting on. I'm sure all guests complain of this. How can you CHARGE 200.00 a night for this?4th problem. As I get ready to have a drink at the rooftop and wasn't able to enter the elevator, I discussed the issues I had with the gentleman clerk at the desk, he apologized and said he can give me a 50.00 credit for food n drinks and 40,000 hilton points for my troubles. I said thanks and I should see them on my bill. Well, I check out in the morning, and YOUR SYSTEM WAS DOWN!!!!!! I couldn't get a receipt. 5th issue. Not entirely your fault, but the Arch Park was under construction? I didn't read or hear about this when I booked the room. Again, I would have not stayed here if I knew this before checking in.Please respond to all email or call me about these issues, and let me know how you are going to rectify this situation. Depending on this outcome determines if my staff or family will ever stay at another Hilton property again.Looking forward to a response.Spent one night following my husband's company party which was held at the hotel.  We checked into our room, which stank like an ashtray.  I called the front desk and waited on hold for 30 minutes.  Finally spoke to someone who very kindly moved us to a new room (the hotel was sold out)... which stank like an ashtray.  Received breakfast voucher.  Had an awful night of sleep as it seemed like someone was hovering above me smoking all night long.  Since the company party was held at the hotel, discounted parking was part of the group rate; however, my husband was denied this when he spoke to the front desk.  Tired and reeking of stale cigarettes, I took over this task.  Received $50 off the room and a parking voucher.  While the hotel itself was disappointing, the customer service was outstanding which is why this is a 3* review instead of a 2* review.I am a loyal customer of Hilton hotels. I have to say after staying here this last weekend I never will stay at a Hilton again. The security they had there were very rude. The rooms were really dirty and a fight broke out in the middle of the lobby. I rented 2 rooms and payed decent money for them. I will not be staying here ever again.This hotel is fabulous!   Beautifully appointed lobby, bar, and restaurant on the first floor.  The rooms in the West Tower are defnitely better, and the elevator is faster because its less busy. My room had a pristine view of the Arch, and  the 360 Lounge does have wonderful views as well.  I had delicious breakfasts every day.  The customer service was the BEST I've ever experienced.  Each and every staff person was friendly, welcoming,  accomodating, and helpful. Thanks Hilton.This last trip to St. Louis I really hopped around when it came to where I was staying in town. I planned on a ball game so I decided to stay at the Hilton. I also knew that I was going to be having some drinks and 360 is gorgeous. Home to me is overlooking that gorgeous Busch Stadium so I was in heaven. I typically like Hilton's in general. This one doesn't disappoint. They have a Starbucks as well which is convenient. If you stay here definitely check out 360. It's one of my favorite restaurants in the city with the best view.Arrived at 4:30 pm and was told that our rooms were not ready. I'm a diamond member in hiltons rewards program and that didn't help. Had to wait till after 5 pm to get in our rooms. Then I asked for a late check out the next day, I was told no. I was in my room for about 14 hours before getting kicked out. No compensation, no drink vouchers, no extra points, no NOTHING.  Will NOT stay here again and I am considering changing hotel brands. I told them that I stay in Hilton properties like 100 times a year......they couldn't have cared less.Update:  I received a yelp response from Hilton faster than I got into my room.  Just an apology nothing else. No give us a call and we will make this right, NOTHING again. Just a please try us again when your back in town. If the management would use their people correctly they might not have these problems.  Six people at the front desk trying to explain why you can't have a room.  We were told that they had rooms ready but didn't know which ones because housekeeping wasn't answering their calls. Here is a bright idea, get off the front desk and go check to see if the rooms are ready........If I could review the service staff separately from the hotel itself, I totally would. The valet/luggage team is fantastic. They are very attentive to all guests and help everyone feel welcome from the moment they arrive in the driveway. The elevator and hotel rooms, however, leave something to be desired. We visited for a baseball game and the elevator set up is an absolute nightmare with a stroller. We were waiting over half an hour before finally just using the service elevator. Unless you can use stairs, good luck getting to and from  your room. The room itself wasn't too bad, The quality was just surprisingly low for a Hilton. For example, only one of the outlets worked. The staff obviously was aware because they had utilized the cheap extension cords run under the bed to power the lights in the room.Update: received an email from the assistant GM yesterday aknowledging my yelp review and condition of property. I was also offered compensation for my stay.Place was clean and the view was great. Got room on points and saved a ton of cash. Room service charge is higher than any place I've been too. To drunk from game to walk down. LolI honestly expected more for the Hilton name in the hotel. The two hotel towers appear to be worlds apart. While the tower we stayed in had an exact view of the beautiful Arch, our room itself was not so beautiful. It might have been clean but decor came straight out of the 1980's. Being a rewards member in St Louis means nothing apparently. The other tower was a bit louder, didn't have the Arch view, but the rooms were a complete 180 from where I stayed. Disappointing to say the least. It seems that Hilton has updated the public areas, the amazing rooftop brew-pub, and the other tower. Everywhere but where I stayed. The valet guys [staff in general] were superb though.Tiolet seat is peeling and still had urine on it. Sink was filthy. Bed sheets had stains. Floor needed vacuumed. Spent most of the night cleaning up this dirty room. Do they not clean the 15th floor and above? Gross. Super Gross. No more Hilton for us. Guess Hilton does mean trashy like the hiltons!!This hotel does not live up to the Hilton name.First off, if you are someone who loves getting fall down drunk at baseball games, communicate with your friends exclusively via screaming, then throw up in public, this hotel is HEAVEN for you. You can stop reading here.If that does not describe you, then read on.The first room I was put in was in the East Tower, and it was gross. Mismatched floral furniture, broken fixtures, spots of black mold in the shower, and an air conditioner that rattled and shook. (507)Thankfully the front desk staff was nice enough to switch me to the West tower. The room was much better - clean, airy, with modern furniture. The paint on the bathroom ceiling was peeling, but I'd take that over mold any day.After a game be prepared for perpetual crowds of hollering drunks hanging around the hotel. One night a drunk girl even threw up right outside the lobby doors. I didn't stick around long enough to see if it got cleaned up.The rooftop bar is cool, but you can't get to it from your floor. Instead, you need to head back down to the lobby to be let up. It's an annoying inconvenience, but I appreciate there being some screening of the crazy drunk fans after a Cards game. The view is spectacular, and there are two free standing binoculars available so you can see the action.Staff was couteous and friendly.  Hotel amenities are great and a perfect location.  Love club 360 on the top floor would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone.Also got a great shoe shine in the lobby. Can't go wrong with the Hilton.Horrible experience for the most part. We came in to eat at the 360 Bar overlooking the city, Gateway Arch, and the Busch Stadium, and don't get me wrong--the views are spectacular. The staff was very welcoming, and the bar offers both indoor and outdoor seating. But right after our order was taken, we had to evacuate by stairwell and descend around 30 flights of stairs. My family consisted of me, my teenage sister, my five-year-old brother, my parents, and my grandparents. We all took the evacuation seriously, and I was surprised that my grandparents were able to reach the bottom without any complications along the way. My little brother was extremely frightened during the ordeal as he did not know why we were suddenly going down those flights of stairs. I carried him halfway down, then my father took him the rest of the way. Although this experience was terrible, another major reason I am writing a review is because the employees did not know what exactly was going on. The employees upstairs handled the situation well and evacuated us almost immediately, but some staff members were constantly asking each other if whether or not this was a drill. On the way down (the 5th floor I think it was) three housekeeping staff members opened the door to the stairwell and asked us if this was a drill.  When I told them that I did not know, they simply said ""Oh"" and appeared apathetic to the whole situation. Another employee in one of the higher floors stood at the stairwell doorway with a bewildered expression.After what seemed like eternity, we finally reached the main lobby, and to my surprise, the only people I saw were the lobby staff members and the 360 customers. Where were the other hotel guests and employees--everyone else? I was baffled. I was also worried for my traumatized little brother and my grandparents, and even went as far as assessing their vitals to ensure they were okay. An hour later their hamstrings began to strain, and my grandmother suffered a headache and nausea. Shocked and flooded with adrenaline, we decided not to return. And we probably never will.Indeed, the evacuation was unexpected and somewhat nerve-racking, but it was made even worse by the confused staff members who seemed to not know how to follow emergency protocol, even if it was just a drill that they were not aware of. The only patrons downstairs were those from the 360 Bar, suggesting that some hotel guests were probably not even evacuated from their rooms. No one told us to exit the lobby. No one apologized for the inconvenience. No one seemed to care. Whether or not this was a drill, The Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark needs to better train their staff members in dealing with emergencies. If this is what Hilton Hotels and Resorts had in mind regarding ""global hospitality,"" then I would not want to step foot in one ever again.","The hotel in general is nice. The rooms need updated. Both the room and bathroom are covered in wallpaper and bland prints. The tv in the room is entirely too small for the room size. I did like the roof top restaurant but was a little annoyed how small every item was. It took 3 things to fill me up which is rediculousI can't really say anything terrible about the hotel.  I came with a group of hockey fans, and the hotel placed us in the back tower, facing the ballpark.  Unfortunately it was in the middle of December, snowing, and I think it was 19 degrees, so no ballgame for us.The rooms were nice, and I don't think I've stayed in a crummy Hilton.  There was a coffee machine in the room, which is always nice.  In the hotel, you can take a special elevator to the restaurant, and have a great view of the Arch.  There's outside dining, but again, at 19 degrees, my Southern California thin blood wouldn't be able to take it, even with my parka.The lobby was nice, plenty of sitting area, and walking distance to some bars and restaurants, including Hooters, which was open late for our post hockey game snack.MInus one star in that St. Louis isn't all that great of a city after dark... but I'm guessing you need a car to find the hot spots in the city.  In this part of town, Hooters and some bars didn't quite cut this as a ""happening"" town.Stayed here twice and had no complaints. All of the staff is extremely friendly and the rooms(stayed in West tower) were great. Breakfast buffet is overpriced, but there are vouchers to be had if you ask around. I heard the 22nd floor had great breakfast, but that was on my last day. :-/I really like the 360 bar upstairs. The food was pretty good and the drinks aren't too expensive. I went up at least once per night! LolJayson (GM)-I've never in my life been a victim of blatant police abuse or discrimination until an encounter with Sgt Walls tonight in your lobby. From 40 feet away, with our back to him, the officer made a blanket statement about he friend I was with. He stated that she was visibly intoxicated and then said to me that ""you probably are too."" This claim is ridiculous on several level. Mostly because the friend I was with is a friend's wife and who is breastfeeding. We are both paying ""guests"" of your hotel and were treated like random drunk garbage stumbling into the hotel. Fact #1- neither of us were drunk. We left two drunk friends in the rooms so that we could experience the rooftop bar for a single drink. Fact #2- Sgt Walls got in my face when I asked what the reason we couldn't go upstairs to the bar was. He taunted me asking, ""What are you gonna do, hit me?"" I obviously said no, I'm not going to do anything to you but I would like an explanation for your blatant assumption and denial of entry of two hotel guests from 40 feet away (our backs were to the officer). Sgt Walls acted more like a childish toll road operator than a police employee. You, Hilton Hotels, and the STL police department should be embarrassed to have him on your grounds. I've been a loyal Hilton traveler for two years now and I've never need treated so disrespectfully and with malice in my entire life's hen I confronted the manager on duty about the situation he cowered to the ""police officers'"" call. I think it's pretty obvious that officers in STL have very publicly known issues, I never dreamed that they'd be brought into your property. I will be filing a formal complaint with the St Louis police department, Hilton Hotels corporate office, and you via your work email. I'll also be writing a Yelp, Facebook, Travel Advisor and Google review telling this story. It is completely unacceptable that you'd allow such scum into your property and allow them to treat your loyal guests with disrespect and taunt them public without a viable reason. He worst part, had he talked to either of us face to face, he'd have seen that we were far more sober than he assumed. His actions were blatant discrimination and he acted with malice, aggression and hostility towards two paying guests that simply wanted to see the rooftop bar-- one of the sole reasons we booked our stays here with an entire wedding party. I highly doubt I'll ever stay at your property again, but if I do and see Sgt Walls in your lobby it will absolutely be the last time I stay with Hilton. I hope you do the right thing and remove home from your property. He's a liability that your company cannot afford given the numerous options for lodging nearby. Regards,NickLet's get this out of the way right now: how can a hotel this expensive NOT offer free WiFi in the guestrooms?  I've said this before and I'll say it again: even Motel 6 offers free WiFi... get with it, Hilton!Other than that, not a bad place to stay.  Obviously, it's a bit pricey for a hotel during the off-season of a town very few people visit, but the amenities were nice and the rooms were comfortable.  I had a view of the ballpark from the window of my room, but it mainly overlooked a parking lot east of the ballpark that had a ton of gross construction material in it - not really a great view, in my opinion.  The room was large enough, king bed was comfy and the bathroom was nice.  There was a Keurig-like machine in the room and a refrigerator if you wanted to bring in your own stuff.  Desk was helpful for some work that I did and there was a small sitting area for reading, if that's your thing.  The room service was expensive and the food wasn't very good.  At least they were open late when I decided that I wanted to eat dinner one night at 11 p.m.  The room service was also a bit slow, especially when they quoted pretty generous times and still couldn't make it in the window.  Get with it!  The conference space here is nice and there's a lot of room to spread out and see a bunch of stuff.  The NCAA March Madness tournament was also going on during my conference, so some of the rooms housed pep band practice, which didn't interfere with our conferencing.Great restaurant/bar at the top of the hotel, but it is apparently the classiest place in town so there's A LINE to get up there beginning at 4 p.m. and going into the wee hours of the night.  I went up at 5, which was fine, but felt like we were getting shooed away since we weren't super club ratty or drinking enough cocktails.  Good view of the city and the arch, though.  Parking was super expensive, but the valet is worth the extra $7/night because you can grab your car 24/7 from the nice confines of the hotel lobby.  Hotel is centrally located, so you're about a 20-25 minute walk from the City Museum and other fun restaurants and bars. My biggest issue: housekeeping services.  I get that this is a big hotel, but there must have been a bunch of people trashing the place or something because the housekeeping service sucked.  One of the days, I had to call the front desk TWICE at like 4 p.m. to get someone to come upstairs and do a clean-through of the room.  If you know you're going to be inundated with drunk college basketball fans (which happens here every March), plan ahead and get more people in there. All in all, an OK experience for a person whose company reimbursed the expense for staying here, but I'm not sure I'd ever willingly pay full price to stay here at any point in the future.Clean and comfy. Every employee from the valet to desk attendants, elevator guys, and rooftop bartenders were incredibly friendly.Can't beat the location.This update is due to Jeff Moll, the manager at Hilton Ballpark for reaching out to us.  He addressed our concerns and was able to offer solutions.  Hilton should be lucky to have such a manager on staff.  It was unfortunate he wasn't working that weekend, if he was I'm sure he would have been able to solve our problems.The staff is nice and friendly and very helpful. The manager of the hotel basically gave us free parking for the rest of our stay after we had only paid for a days worth which is a plus in my book! Our room had a breathtaking view of the arch and the rooms facing the arch are in the east tower which is the tower that really hasn't had any major remodeling done to it. Both the pool and Hot tub are nicely kept and are located on the 2nd floor and close at 11pm. i just loved the fact that the pool was indoors and I could float around in it while gazing up at the night sky! I can't really say that I had much of a problem with this place. it's located in the heart of downtown St. Louis and it takes about 5 minutes (maybe less) to walk to the arch. The only problem I had was the elevators which seem to make everyone mad. The way the elevators are set up is just... weird. You can end up waiting 20 minutes just to get to your floor and the problem isn't the fact that the hotel is crowded it's... well there's really no way that I can explain it unfortunately. Also don't expect very modern rooms...Too add to this review, there is a Starbucks in this hotel that is very nice, but they increase their prices since they are located in the Hilton. there is also an Imo's Pizza located in the hotel that has good service, but the food tastes terrible.Great experience! Staff was wonderful, room was nothing fancy but was big and clean. Bar and restaurant had great service and good food. Internet is not free but loads fast if you pay for it. Workout room was standard and has a kids pool.Stayed here recently with my bff, as we intended to go out for her sister's birthday, and didn't want to drive back to the 'burbs afterward. Her sister wound up deciding not to come out, but we were still happy we stayed here!Price was reasonable (coming from Chicago, I thought it was cheap for a downtown hotel!), and the front desk staff was pretty nice. The elevators are digital, so you select the floor you want on a digital screen before you enter, and there are no buttons on the inside (except the standard emergency call button). This looks cool, but I didn't love it. If a group gets on the elevator with you, and you're on a high floor, you have no idea how many times or on which floors you will stop before you get to your floor. Alternatively, you don't know if someone getting off on your floor is actually staying there or if they're following you. Since I was staying here with my friend, it was fine, but if I were staying here alone, I would actually be a bit concerned. I strongly prefer to see other people get in and push their floor themselves, so I can see where they're going and know if they are doing their own thing or being creepers.The room was large and had a nice view of the arch. Beds were comfortable and there was a large desk we took over for the purpose of getting ready in front of the full-length mirror. The bathroom was pretty cramped and the shower was not nice! This was actually the low point of the stay- the showerhead was coming off the wall a bit, and the walls and fixtures were tired and not totally clean. The pipes were clearly jammed from usage and not being properly cleaned out, so the tub backed up while I was showering. In my relatively short shower (seriously, probably only about 7 minutes), the water was pooled up above my ankles. Location was awesome, and we loved being able to get drinks in the 360 bar upstairs without leaving the building. We also went over to Ballpark Village and were able to leave our coats in the room and just dash across the street. Perfect! If we go out in St. Louis again, I'd definitely want to stay here again, but I'd probably shower at my friend's place instead.I am a bit conflicted on this hotel.   There are parts that I liked, some that I didn't.Stuff that I didn't like:1. Valet parking.  Really sucks around game time.  I had to park in a garage 2 blocks away because it was unavailable as they allow parking for non-guests.  Even when you do park there, its ponderous how you get there and get your car.2.  Strange setup.  There are two towers.  The 2nd tower is a hike and can be a pain to get to from the lobby.  Getting to the rooftop bar is also kind weird.3.  Noisy.  Given that I was there on a game night, there were plenty of folks roaming the hallways and talking loud.  Not the hotel's fault, but it kinda stunk regardless as I needed my beauty sleep.Stuff that I did like:1.  Front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant.2.  Coffee right in the lobby3.  Proximity to ballpark.I have nothing bad to say about this place. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom just what you expect a hotel bathroom to look like. The city views INCREDIBLE, I mean they are across the ballpark so you can't go wrong. Now, the rooftop is perfect! If you are coming to St. Louis, definitely consider staying here.Bathroom door barely clears front edge of toilet, dirty windows and mirrors, dusty everywhere and food crumbs all over desk chair, outdated, no USB ports and very few outlets.Great hotel great staff great location....  If another staff member asked me if there's anything they can do for me I'm going to scream that's how nice and professional they are here.. A must stay for anyone....breakfast was delicious and a must stay for a cardinals game.Very clean lobby. Nicely updated rooms. Within walking distance to everything..Will definitely stay here again.The hotel is very nice but I'm not a fan of the security. My wife enjoys the fitness center which has a secured card access ...  UNLESS you enter from the pool. Both the pool access and fitness center door from the pool do not have any security - this is not cool on the downtown area.A group of us recently stayed here for one night to attend a baseball game and wish we had chosen one of the other area hotels.The hotel should be ashamed of the elevator situation.  The wait to get up to our rooms and back to the lobby was ridiculous.  There's a bar on the roof that is very popular so they have a separate line for sending people up there.  Personally I would give preference to those staying at the hotel, but time and time again they would fill the elevator with people heading up to the bar and make us wait.  This is very frustrating.  I guess they're more concerned with having people spend money at the bar since they already had our money for the rooms.  There was even a police office standing near the elevators at night.  What hotel needs a cop?!!  We actually checked out earlier than we wanted because we figured if we waited until closer to check out time; it would take 30 minutes to get an elevator down.Aside from that you can hear everything through the walls.  There was a party going on in the room next door that woke me up several times.  The bathrooms are also incredibly tiny and outdated.This is a party hotel; not a quality hotel.  If you aren't into the party scene; I would advise staying at another location.  There's plenty to choose from.If you request a quiet suite bc you're staying with your kids, expect them to put you directly under the 360 night club where the band plays until 2am. They'll offer you another room, in the other wing for $100 off that's not half as big. And if you happen to eat at 360 for Valentine's Day expect your raw oysters to come with live worms &amp; dead crabs - that the manager will assure you is normal (I've eaten hundreds of raw oysters &amp; THIS IS NOT NORMAL). If you call Hilton honors to complain, expect major attitude because you just awoke the customer service rep from her nap. The Internet in the rooms is NOT GREAT EITHER, just like the bathroom lighting. BOOOOO.Was in town all the way from Philadelphia for my brother's wedding this past weekend and we decided to stay here for the night of his bachelor party. Lobby is nice and beautiful. But once we got to our rooms I noticed that the shower in one of our rooms didn't get hot. Didn't worry about it too much because we booked a few rooms and most had already showered previously to arriving so it didn't delay us. The next day we checked out and I accidentally left my expensive shoes in the room. I called 45 mins after we checked out to inform the staff I left them and would return later to retrieve them. The lost and found department informed me that no shoes were found in the room. Baffled, I informed them that there was absolutely no way they were anywhere else aside from the room because I arrived wearing them and left wearing my only other pair. He told me he'd forward my concern to the management and have someone get back to me. That did not happen as it's almost a week since the incident. I know I am at fault for leaving my property, however that is no reason for my shoes to be stolen. I stayed at several hotels that were a lot cheaper than 200 bucks a night where I left glasses, books, watches and such and upon realizing it called back and every time they had them. I can't see myself staying at this hotel again and if you do, make sure you retrieve all of your belongings otherwise they will go missing.Tip:-self park is $20. Overnight valet is $27. -wifi is not free The lobby is gorgeous. The elevators are high tech. The rooms are mediocre in decor however large in size. The bed mattress is too springy and the pillows are a bit big. The fitness center is above average with free weights going up to 50 lbs and a large dual cable machine.I arrived really late on a week day and check in was a breeze. I showed my credit card and my Hilton rewards card and I was up to my room in minutes. My room was very clean and overlooked the arch. I am extremely picky when it comes to hotels and expect them to be clean, and this one earned it's five stars from me. They gladly held my bag for me after I checked out and they quickly got it out for me before I left to catch my evening flight. I only stayed one night without a car, so I can't comment on parking. There was a lot of surrounding construction, but that is no fault of the hotel.","We stayed one night at Hilton Ballpark.  My husband is a diamond member.  The room was very small and in need of some upgrades or redecorating.  The bathroom was very small and the door would get stuck on the toilet if it was open all the way. We had 4 people in our room and only 2 towels.  When we asked the house keeping staff member on our floor for some more towels she was very put off and extremely rude.  Just to be fair the front desk and one of the mangers were very helpful and polite.  The breakfast buffet was good.  Fresh fruit and made to order omelets were delicious.What a strange hotel.The elevators are a mess. They rely on a touch pad system that is comically unnecessary. There are no buttons on the inside of the car. Once you get in, you're at the mercy of patrons outside the shaft. It doesn't help that the cars have the same footprint as a Fiat.Wanna go to the rooftop bar? Wait on your floor for 10 minutes (and I'm not exaggerating) for an elevator. Take the elevator to the lobby. Wait for another 10 minutes. Oh, good! It's here! Er, no, wait. There isn't enough room for your group. Gotta wait for the next elevator. Wait another 10 minutes. Finally, you're stuffed into one of the elevators and shuttled off.In the time it took us to actually get anywhere in this place, we could've walked to a local bar in a totally different building.It actually makes me laugh that they have the nerve to charge for parking in their garage.The walls and doors are waaay too thin. I could hear parties down the hall until 2 in the morning. I didn't bother calling the front desk; it would've taken them at least half an hour to get up here thanks to their unnecessarily complex elevator system.While on my way to check out, I came across a flap of wallpaper folded up in the hall. There was a disgusting amount of mold growing on it and the wall it was peeled from. Blah. Wish I would've seen that before checking in.About the only redeeming quality is the hotel's proximity to popular attractions. The Gateway Arch and the Cardinals are both close. You'll pay with more than money to make use of this place, though.Ugh.Great looking hotel on the inside. Looks kinda dated on the outside. At the time I stayed there, I was excited to see they had a St. Louis 250th anniversary cake on the outside. The checkin process was smooth. But, what irked me to no end was their iPad-ish elevator system. They have a guy outside the hotel bank that pushes buttons on the outside because there are no buttons on the inside! That means you can only go into an elevator that is going to your floor. The views of the city from the room were great from the 22nd floor and the beds were soft. But, the shower head was a complete mess. It was difficult to operate. And apparently prior guests had problems because the shower head was loose from the wall. Otherwise, the staff was responsive when we asked for additional towels and they were helpful with loading our luggage.If you are in town to see a baseball game or two, this is THE place to stay.  We stayed in the west tower with an amazing view of the stadium and ballpark village.  The room was recently renovated and the 360 bar upstairs was a big plus.  There are many restaurants within walking distance and laclede's landing is a short drive away.  Over-all our stay was wonderful.  We were even comped parking.  We are planning to stay again this summer (and everyone after) when we are back in town for another series.If you are staying on the Broadway side of the building, remember to close your blinds. The reflective of your room can be seen on the KPMG building from the 360 rooftop bar. I say this because I've seen about 3 naked people while my wife and I were on a date.No. At least not on the weekend, when the place is filled with drunk people partying downtown. Being shoved into a half-sized elevator filled to bursting is not what I want to deal with after a day of traveling, nor a lobby filled with shouting. A nightcap on the rooftop might have been nice but the clerk who checked us in and told us about it didn't mention that you can't get to it from your own floor--you have to go back down to the lobby and wait in line and get put into a different overcrowded elevator. Luckily since we accidentally went up to the top floor, we could hear how loud it was so after going back to the lobby we decided to skip it (so much for that amenity). Went to the lobby bar instead--uncrowded but still pretty loud because of aforementioned partyers all over the lobby. The room itself: the window was dirty, making the view we paid extra for a lot less enjoyable, and the bathroom door wouldn't open all the way bc it's blocked by the toilet. Excellent down pillows though. The only thing that reminded me this was supposed to be a high-end hotel and kept me from feeling like I was sleeping *in* a ball park rather than just near one.""I expected more for this size Hilton in the Heart of downtown St. Louis!""We visited this Hilton for 3 nights in September while doing a mid-west baseball tour. I picked this Hilton for it's proximity to Busch Stadium and the fact that I am a Hilton Honors Diamond Member.We checked in, no biggie but I guess I expected more as being a Hilton Diamond member. We got to our room and it was a ""deluxe"" room, I asked later, and the ""view"" made it deluxe. There was a huge bump in the middle of the room where the carpet had bunched up and needed to be cleaned and stretched at minimum, there were actually places as you walked across the room where the floor had divots, i guess broken concrete? Anyway, the room was large but the bathroom was like a postage stamp! You could barely get in there and close the door, and I'm a small person! The Sunday Breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about, it was minimal. For that price I would expect a lot more there was not anything offered as to cook to order eggs or omelets, not sure if they were even offered, anyway, I did not like the breakfast at all! Yet the waiter who only brought us Juice and Coffee made a point to note the gratuity was not included in the ""complimentary breakfast"".The only saving grace was Vincent in the executive lounge where the breakfast was better than the Sunday brunch and he gave us some hints about where to go for dinner, etc. If I were to go to St. Louis again, I would not stay at this Hilton hotel, and I've stayed at Hilton's around the world and this is bar far one of the worst.I am conflicted with this rating. The first night of the stay deserves ONE star and the other two deserve at least FOUR. When we arrived on New Year's Eve there were no upgrades available which was expected but when we got to our double arch room view in the east wing, I have never been so disappointed and disgusted. The room itself smelled like mildew or as if there as been water damage somewhere in the room at some point. The heater didn't work and would only let out cold air. The bathroom had black areas on the wall that may have been mold, but I wasn't really interested in picking at it to find out. Even the outlets didn't work! I had to unplug the coffee maker from the power strip behind the dresser to another outlet for it it work. Ugh. I think one of the elevators may have been broken because it took us 15 minutes to get up to our room on the 23rd floor and another 15 minutes to get back down! There was no way I was going to spend at least half an hour on the elevators just to ask for another room that same night. We just suffered in the terrible smelling room. The next afternoon I went downstairs and requested a change and was quickly accommodated. Then rooms in the west wing are in a different planet. Clean and nice, no smell, many more power outlets that work, and a heater that works! Hard to believe Hilton thinks the room in the east tower are to hilton standards when they have rooms like this just on the other side of the hotel. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND JUST RESERVE ROOMS ONLY IN THE WEST TOWER.  All of the staff we had interaction with were extremely friendly and very helpful. The dining room staff was incredible, especially the hostess. While I was happy to be upgraded on the second night and everything in the second room was excellent, I was very disappointed that there was not an offer from anyone to maybe comp our parking or maybe a reduced rate for the first night for our inconvenience and unhappiness. Any gesture made at all would have made the entire stay pleasant, but no one offered anything, not even a free in-room movie or something. Very disappointed in this Hilton. While I might stay again if I could guarantee the west wing, I am not sure I would want to take this risk. I will wait until they have both towers remodeled and hopefully deep-cleaned before I make a reservation here again.My Dad and I started our Father - Son vacation with a night at the Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark. The hotel is located right downtown, very near the historic Gateway Arch and the Mississippi River.We flew into St. Louis on a rainy, foggy night, so we couldn't really appreciate the location until the following morning. We knew the hotel had two towers with 20+ floors in each tower, so there were plenty of rooms - which was a very good thing since there was a HUGE religious conference happening in St. Louis, and the Hilton was one of the key hotels for their delegates.In addition, Dad and I were part of a travel group that was boarding an authentic Mississippi paddle wheel steamboat the next morning for a 7-day journey from St. Louis to New Orleans, and there were 400 or so of us also staying at the Hilton.The hotel was packed, and as a result the elevators were atrociously slow, and the on-site restaurants were packed with hour-long waits for tables.We didn't really appreciate the view out of our 17th floor room until the next morning when we pulled back the curtains, and realized that we were looking straight down onto Busch Field. (See the attached photos).The hotel seemed a bit dated, and smelled musty, but we couldn't argue with the location -- and the view was just amazing! You could easily sit in your room and watch an entire baseball game with no problems.PRO's: The views are great.  The 360 bar is amazing, and at night we got to catch a game from the rooftop, it was awesome.  The lobby is nice, staff is friendly and helpful.CON's: Okay this was one of the most OBNOXIOUS places I've ever stayed.  IF YOU STAY HERE, STAY IN THE WEST WING!  It is newer or remodeled.  I was in the East Wing, and my air conditioner was so old and rattled all night long even if it was turned off!  I was here for two nights for a conference and I hardly slept either night!  It wasn't until my last day when visiting a coworkers room (so she could keep my bags for me so i didn't have to check them and she was staying an extra night).  I realized in her room, the air conditioner was a quiet wall air conditioner!!!  It was like night and day.  They had stylish decor and furniture.  My headboard was a wooden slat nailed to the wall.  Gross!  The elevators suck.  The system isn't as hard to figure out as everyone says but on multiple occasions I would select my floor, and it would be lit up in the elevator and it skipped it anyways!  I had to go all the way down to the lobby and come back up 21 floors.  This took a while as they are slow.  Really REALLY obnoxious.This review is for their restaurant. I met my family here for breakfast. This service was so slow. And, the food was terrible. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. The hash browns had no seasoning and were lukewarm. The ""hollandaise"" sauce was the color of Mountain Dew.It was sour and also lukewarm. I ate a few bites of my breakfast. I pushed the food to the side. During our meal, the manager stopped and talked to every table but ours. He looked at our table and walked away. This was very disappointing.I would not eat here again.When I stay at a hotel, I really have pretty minimal needs.  Clean rooms.  All the systems work.  I can get a decent breakfast.  Decent exercise facilities.  Maybe the staff is friendly.  I mean, really, when I go someplace and stay in a hotel, mainly the only thing I use it for is to get some sleep.  I'm not there to hang out in the hotel.This time was somewhat anomalous.  I was in St. Lou for business, but I had a fair amount of downtime over the three plus days I stayed. It was butt-cold, so I ended up spending more time than usual in my room.So the Ballpark Hilton.  What can I say.  My room was clean and spacious. The shower was great, the view of the arch was nice, and everyone was super friendly.  I forgot my sneakers, so I never even looked at the fitness room, and it was so cold out the pool seemed completely unappetizing.   The heating system in the room was a blower by the huge window that was constantly on, so there was always a hum of white noise.  I suppose that could be a good thing, since hotels are always noisy.  But my bed had the thinnest of comforters, and I was cold at night, no matter where I set the thermostat.Finally on the last night I found a blanket in the closet.  So that was better.I only had breakfast there once.  The oatmeal was fine, and the yogurt and fruit were fine, thought they used one of those dinky little tongs for the blueberries, so it took forever to get a decent amount.  The coffee was pretty good and they put a huge thermos of it on your table so you never have to ask or wait for refills.I should mention the guy who checked me in (and out) was really nice, and referred me to the Broadway Oyster Bar, which I loved.I suppose a Hilton is pretty much a Hilton.  The place had a generic feel to it that reminded me of the days I used to spend a lot of time in such hotels.  Everything was serviceable and fine, but it all lacked character and specialness.  Next time I might seek out a boutique hotel or BnB.Don't be fooled by the cool, modern lobby and hip 360 Restaurant and Bar. This hotel has a good downtown location, but the rooms in the East Tower are older and in need of a facelift. The inefficient electronic elevator system often makes you wait for a longer time period than necessary. Moreover, if you want to go to 360, you have to take the elevator from your room floor all the way back down to the lobby, wait in line, and take it all the way to the top floor. Talk about complicated!The room was very anticlimactic after seeing the lobby.  The room was decorated with heinously patterned wallpaper and grandma's furniture. I suppose with the Hotwire rate of $90, we were satisfied with the mediocre rooms.On the plus side, the hotel's 360 Restaurant Bar is impressive. It offers sweeping views of the city to soak up the sun and watch a Cardinals game, with binoculars, of course!Note: Self parking is $18.00/nt and there is a $75.00 non-refundable deposit for dogs.Bed Bugs. Takes 5-15 minutes to get elevator. No towels in pool even after multiple guests called over a half hour period. Unauthorized charges that they did not even tell me about. Rude people at the desk. Zero stars would be more accurate.I am staying here now. Happy with our room and our location (going to the Cards' game), but had the worst welcome EVER to a hotel. Valet was full (for hotel guests? huh?) so they sent us down the street to a random garage. Very very poor. The experience begins at arrival and that is just lame.The staff was great, the room and view of the ballpark spectacular.  Everyone was very accommodating, and made for a great family weekend in St. Louis.  Great recommendations for restaurants, getting all of us together on 1 floor, very attentive, like a second home !Booked this hotel because of its proximity to Busch stadium. But, we stayed in the west wing, which is supposedly better than the east.  Not impressed!  Small double room, no queen beds!  Awkward mirror location in room, so you can't use it for makeup or hair!  Bathroom was small and no exhaust fan, so mirror was not usable after a shower. Great views, not enough power outlets for the 21st century!  Very noisy near the elevators. At least there was a Starbucks in the hotel, we paid extra to be on the ""executive"" floor, with ""free"" breakfast and evening snacks...to find out that feature was closed on weekends!   Really?Would stay elsewhere next time.We had a room here in the east tower on the 21st floor. The view was great and the room wasn't bad, but I've seen better. Pros:* Being a block away from the ballpark is awesome, and not having to deal with traffic after the game is also awesome.* Decently sized rooms.Cons:* We had to fix our toilet. Twice.* Tiny bathroom, as in the door actually hit the toilet seat when you opened it.* We also had to fix our curtains: the pull rod fell off, then the curtains got stuck on the track multiple times and it was hard to open them again.* Our thermostat changed temps randomly. We set it at 72, left, came back and it was set to 65 and our room was freezing. It happened again while I was showering in the morning, it went from 72 to 68.And then the bell hops... I realize they're trying to be helpful, but I've never had so many people try to take my bags from me and be so confused about what was actually going to happen to said bags. Were they wanting to hold them until my husband parked? Were they going to deliver them to my room? Did they just want to get them out of my car? We just wanted to carry them ourselves, but no one would leave us alone.And about the elevators everyone talks about. It's a touchpad, it's different, you just have to think a little more about what you're doing. But the fact that they had 1-2 staff constantly helping people with the elevators makes me wonder if their fancy-shmancy setup is even worth it. They're really NOT that confusing. Instead of pushing a button inside the elevator, you push it (rather, touch it) outside of the elevator. You can still see the number for your floor and the other floors you're making stops on inside the elevator, on a screen near the doorway. The system helps coordinate the elevators and make the stops more efficient, that's all. And even with that, it still takes a long time; three tiny elevators is not enough for the size of that hotel. The part that sucks is if you want to go to 360, you have to go down to the lobby, hop in line, then go back up to the 26th floor. That part seems kinda silly, but I guess they're trying to ensure minors don't get to go up there since they ID you in the lobby.Another thing with the elevators: I was disappointed they didn't have the whole ""slide your card key to prove you're staying here, then choose your floor"" setup for extra security. Especially in a city, this surprised me. Maybe it's not a huge deal, and I know it's not a ""bad"" part of town, but it still would have been nice since there are so many people who come thru the hotel to go to the rooftop bar.This hotel comes with a heavy price, the location has to be the big factor in that. Otherwise, the rooms are just standard. I MIGHT stay here again? But I think I'd check out another hotel or two before doing so.I mistakenly booked a room here that coincided with opening day.  If you are a Cardinals fan, this is the place for you.  I arrived at exactly the wrong time.  I had to circle the building twice in order to get pulled in to the semi-circle drive. I called the concierge, as I was having trouble, and he said to go ahead and pull in as close as possible and the staff would assist me.  Once I finally got close enough, the gentlemen informed me that they had no valet space, and directed me to the parking garage.  45 minutes later I was able to park and walk back to the hotel.  Once in the hotel, I ordered room service.  I had a sandwich with fries, and it did not come with ketchup.  I had to call down three times, and it was about an hour wait until the gentleman brought a bottle of ketchup, which he then dropped onto my tile floor, causing a glassy mess. I'm currently trying to finish up work for the day, and get to bed early since I had to wake up early for a flight to travel here, but that isn't going so well, as the stadium is blaring hard rock music.I had planned to stay through Friday, but I'm checking out tomorrow and moving to the Embassy Suites downtown.  I will NEVER stay here again.Nice central location for everything. Rooms are tiny with a,weird layout. Not a new place, but we'll kept. Staff was excellent. Probably over pricrd, but the location is the key.","Meh. Doesn't live up to the Hilton name. Yes, it's a great location and has an awesome rooftop bar for Cards games. The service was also great. This warrants my 3 stars. Other reviewers have mentioned the rooms need updating - UNDERSTATEMENT. I couldn't close the door to the bathroom without lifting my toilet seat. My bathtub leaked continuously. The A/C couldn't get colder than 70 no matter what I set it on. And getting to your room in the East tower on game day? Fuggetaboudit. The whole city lines up to get to the rooftop bar. Many people were taking the stairs - fine if your room is on the 5th floor, but unless you're training for Hustle up the Hancock, you won't want to huff it up to the 17th floor. Bottom line - the stay was fine. But don't expect a Hilton experience.This is an average hotel. Rooms were OK, nothing special, but they were clean. My bathroom was about the size of a closet, but it served.One odd note, their elevators have a keypad where you input the number of your floor, and it will assign you an elevator to take! Very different, and a little disconcerting to know that you are blatantly in control by the whim of a computer! Once inside the car, there are no buttons, but of course I looked to push my floor every time I stepped in! LOL!!Service was friendly enough, no real complaints...it was what it was, a hotel.I never really got past the front desk. I had a reservation, and got an email 7 days prior confirming my stay, but when I got there, my room showed canceled, and after traveling from LA all day, was told that they have no availability. No help, I even was told to maybe try a different hotel, so Holiday Inn 12 miles away it was! Pretty sad when someone accidentally canceled my room, all 5 nights, though I did get an I'm Sorry, thats why they got one star instead of none.Great hotel with excellent hotel staff that are everywhere to help. Rooms are really nice and the view of the arch is incredible. I would come back and probably will in the future.This experience reminded me that not all Americans have equal rights under the law... but I'll get to that.In town for a wedding, it was my first time visiting St. Louis, and of course checking into a hotel was my first experience of the city. I walked up to the counter and generally pleasant young girl greeted me and ask for my info upon check in. I gave my name, and they had nothing.So here's the backstory... I booked this trip with my husband with my husband's Hotwire account. When we booked the trip, we put my name down as an additional guest who may check in as well. I was arriving before my husband and would be the one checking in. Prior to the trip, and upon booking, we called Hotwire and confirmed that I may check in. We then called the hotel and had my name added to the reservation, explained I would be arriving first, and they confirmed, stating absolutely that it was taken care of.So, here I am at the counter and I say ""Maybe you have the reservation under my husbands name? If so, my name should be listed as the one checking in."" The at first pleasant girl looked and said, ""Oh yes, I see the reservation but you are not allowed to check in."" I explained the backstory, which she responded, literally ""You'll have to wait or call Hotwire."" I asked for the manager. The manager did not come over, he told the receptionist to tell me that I could only call Hotwire.Frustrated, I called Hotwire, and as I was on hold for 20 minutes, I explained to the receptionist that I felt that this was unfair, as IF I SHARED THE SAME LAST NAME OF MY HUSBAND, they would allow me to check into the room that WE had already paid for. But because we both decided to keep our own last names, and that our relationship is not legally accepted in Missouri, since ""same-sex couples and families headed by same-sex couples are not eligible for all of the protections available to opposite-sex married couples."" I was extremely disappointed with the Hilton brand, the same brand that ""scored a 90 out of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) 2012 Corporate Equality Index.""After getting nowhere with Hotwire, I called my husband who was still at home and he called the hotel. Again explaining the situation to another very tall, young man with brown hair (I saw the guy pick up the phone and immediately rolled his eyes to his younger, and shorter colleague). They were laughing and not taking the situation seriously at all, until they saw me starring at them obviously pretty offended... took them a minute to connect the dots. He then went to the manager, manager gets on the phone, hangs up and finally comes to me.The manager approaches with NO solutions other that I must call Hotwire, at that point I was already on hold with them still and explained it was a Friday at 6:45pm and I didn't know if I was going to reach anyone and all I wanted to do is take a shower and go to the wedding event. He said ""My hands are tied, sorry there I nothing I can do.""Not one person had the common sense or the interest to say ""I am sorry you are experiencing this and I will try to help you, let me talk to the manager, and we'll get Hotwire on the phone.""I got, ""Hotwire is a separate company"" and I'm basically screwed.45 minutes at the desk - after my pleading, showing all my receipts, invoices and whatever else I could get except my actual WEDDING CERTIFICATE, Emily (the 5th person I've talked to) comes over and IS THE FIRST PERSON to actually sympathize with me, addressed the ridiculousness of the situation, personally called Hotwire (AFTER MY HUSBAND HAD TO SUPPLY HIS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TO HOTWIRE OVER THE PHONE), apologized for everything, checked me into the room and gave me two drink tickets for my troubles.Now I'm not sure what Emily's position is at this hotel, but she is THE ONLY ONE who actually offered excellent service. The rest of the team, including the manager, shockingly offered bare minimum help, so much so that I wasn't sure if I had a place to sleep in a city I've never been to.While that deserves ZERO STARS, I look to Yelp to report such a horrible experience that not only was way beyond subpar but reminded me that not everyone has the same rights in this country and that a company as large at HILTON should be more responsible with how they train their staff to accommodate all guests as its an overall reflection on their brand.I'll be making a formal complaint with their corporate office.(On a side note: the view is nice, the bed is comfortable, the cleanliness is gross, I was out of my room from 8am to 6pm and there was no maid service, and I intentionally avoided the hotel lobby so I wouldn't have to see any of the people who were pretty much useless and carefree in helping me.)Great rate with Hotwire. Bar 360 at the top is a must see. Was able to accommodate request for arch view room despite low rate. Nice hotel..Noise:I stayed in the east tower and my room was in between two others on a corner next to the elevator. I had a common door with one of the rooms and my neighbor had a phone conversation of which I could hear both sides. Possibly speaker phone but still... I didn't wake in the night, but sleeping pills and earplugs were definitely necessary.Customer Service:Lobby service was 4 stars and prompt. Phone service was curt and abrupt. Housekeeping:I had to call housekeeping because there was almost no toilet paper when I checked in. There's a place for 2 rolls and the one roll was 90% empty, so this clearly was not an oversight from one guests' use unless they stayed for more than a few days.Location:very convenient. The conference was in the hotel but it was convenient for downtown sightseeing/business. Walking distance to the courthouse (medium), Union station (a decently long walk) and the arch (short walk).Business visitors:paid wifi in the room, free throughout the rest of the hotel. No USB plugs for i-devices.  Food: I'll review 360 separately but that was excellent and well worth a visit.  OtherNo shuttle to airport but saw a shuttle in front of the lobby so maybe I was lied to when I called last week?I stayed here for a business conference. I was given the wrong room  Once I got there, I had to call down, and get them to prepare the correct room for me. My package included breakfast, I was never given the breakfast coupons at check in and had to go back down and ask for them. The elevator system is extremely slow, and is managed by an employee who said I could not go to the top bar because was wearing a tank top. I said okay then I will go to my room and told him the floor number he began to harass me, telling me all the reasons that people can't go up to the bar, my response was I heard you. He continued harassing me, I once again said I heard you, went back upstairs to my room.  the hallway on my floor smelled like mildew. Not a good experience will never go back.Mostly great hotel until you notice the details. Dirty bathroom door. Soup scum in tub. Brow grout. I would come back but hope they work I details in maintenance. Location was great as were the people. Super comfortable bed!Recently, I attended an awards dinner that started out with hors d'oeuvres and live music in the Arch Ballroom (with an excellent view of the Old State Capitol), then moved to the Grand Ballroom for dinner. I think there are ceiling-to-floor room dividers to section off a large portion of the space, but I'm not sure just how much our group occupied. We were at table 28 out of about 35, ten per table, so about 350 guests. I'm always amazed that food can be so evenly good when that many plates come out at once, but it was. The ""Cupcake Wars"" chef (from Jilly's, I think?) was there, so dessert was as spectacular as a cupcake can get.Employees are very helpful &amp; friendly.  The rooftop bar for hotel guests is beautiful &amp; lovely during game days or wonderful weather.  The problem with this hotel &amp; the reason I give it three stars is had to park two blocks away as parking was full for a room that was $300.  The ballpark view rooms are also dated &amp; in serious need of a remodel from so much use.  Location is great price doesn't fit the accommodations.Always a must when in the city.  The customer service is awesome, not doubt about.  You get St.Regis attention and detail at a Hilton price point. Food is okay, not spectacular, and the wait time for a meal at the bar can be long. They sure that up and we are looking at that 5th starThey did a great job hosting our convention. Room in the east tower was nice and clean. Great staff that strive to make everyone feel at home. Rooftop bar was amazing and lower level bar has the best pizza I have ever tasted. Many negative reviews are on the guests, not the hotel. Read between the lines.I came here for a business trip which ended up being a waste because I came down with a cold before I arrived.  Once I did arrive, the staff was very receptive to all of my needs without even needing to ask.  I received extra tea at breakfast, as well as in my room.When I found out that I had to check-out at 11AM and my flight wasn't until 7PM, the staff at the front desk was gracious enough to let me use their business center until I had to go so I could at least attempt to get some work done.The only thing I would change is that the housekeeping staff knocked on my door at least 5 times to see if/when I was leaving, well before the checkout time of 11AM.  I had a conference call I needed to sit on so that constant interruption, even with the Do Not Disturb on the handle, was a little annoying.Otherwise, everything else was great and I appreciate everyone's help and professionalism at this hotel.Great hotel. Im a diamond member and I got a nice room in the west wing. The concierge lounge surprisingly had a full dinner. Pasta + chicken + salad + some appetizers. Most other ones I've been to are just appetizers. Staff was very friendly. Check in was quick and easy. Fitness center was clean, has dumbbells up to 50. 2 pulleys, benches and cardio equipment. Location is great. 5min to the arch and 2min from the ballpark. Definitely a hotel worth staying at, especially if you're a Hilton diamond memberI liked staying here. Apparently the rooms in the West Tower are renovated and the ""main"" tower with the 360 rooftop bar has the older rooms. The down side to staying in the West Tower is that it's a further walk from the main lobby and feels a bit removed. All (and I mean all!) hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. My room was clean and comfortable. I have previously stayed in other dated, older, very large Hiltons similar to this one, but somehow this property felt different. More personal and welcoming. One downside being the adjoining hotel rooms - when you don't want to adjoin with your neighbor. The door may be closed and padlocked but you may as well be in the same room. Unfortunately, I woke up at 4am to someone next door on an angry phone call to China. Yelling. In Chinese. At 4am. I think I've learned my lesson to request hotel rooms without adjoining doors!I didn't really care about the elevator problem. Whatever. The one around the corner (West Tower - the former housekeeping elevator) was always available and I never had to wait for it. Just follow the big signs saying, ""additional elevators."" I had it all to myself during my stay.Meh...from walking into the lobby, I had great expectations for my room...east tower is in SERIOUS need of updates. The bathroom is tiny and had to squeeze by the toilet to close the door; mirror was broken &amp; dirty. Rooms not soundproof at all. Bed is comfy &amp; good view. 360 bar is nice. Elevators are unnecessary. There is another Hilton a few blocks down that looks more modern and will check that out next time in town for work.Maybe it's just me, but I keep staying at great places downtown.  I've stayed at the Millennium, the Hyatt Regency, and this last weekend I stayed at the Hilton at the Ballpark (not to be confused with the Hilton Downtown, which is literally 2 blocks away...yeah, don't ask me about who figured that one out).Room was great, service was courteous, there's a freaking self-serve frozen yogurt place adjacent to a Starbucks in the lobby.Oh, and there's the pretentious rooftop lounge for people who need to stand in line for an elevator because they want to pretend they are in Vegas or LA, instead of a city with its own character, style, and pace.Note to the management: Just as a marketing question, why wouldn't you give guests at the hotel premium/accelerated access to 360?  You could even get away with charging like $5/$10 a day for it, but to think that your hotel guests have to stand in the same line with the people off the street?  Just a bit ridiculous.Lots of cool places to sit and just have a conversation, all throughout the sprawling 2-tower complex.  So close to Busch Stadium...seems like the no-brainer choice for out of town fans coming in for games.I've stayed here a few times. Sadly the building is old, they've done some renovations, but they don't make up for the age of the property. There's the east tower and west tower and I always get the west tower. I find the room very average.Once inside the room you don't get all the amenities you expect from a full service hotel: no mini fridge, no free bottled water, my room had no laundry bag, my room's clock wasn't even plugged in. It got worse, the bathroom sink easily backed up...a simple plumbing fix. Two thirds of the wash cloths in the room were stained. Then there was a stain on the big bath towel.Upon entering the room I smelled a heavy odor similar to mold. Then the old Soviet era HVAC control only went as low as 65. St Louis in the summer is brutal, usually in the 90s.The icing on the cake is that as a Hilton Diamond I was overbilled for Internet access.One cool addition is the 360 bar on the roof of the east tower. Great views. The hotel lobby has a Starbucks and an awful froyo frozen yogurt shop.=====================================================10/9/12I think a better, more sincere reply from management would be, ""Look, we're sorry there was no mini fridge, sorry you were left parched without so much as a water, sorry you were left with no laundry bag and had to pack your dirty clothes next to the clean ones, sorry you had no working clock, sorry your bathroom sink backed up, and sorry none of your towels were clean.""  ""As a make good on your terrible experience, we'd like to give you a free night stay at the Motel 6, because obviously that would be more on par with what we strive to offer our guests.""  ""Sir, you may know this location to be a dump, but we're going to somehow try and convince that it's not.""  ""After all, that's why we're rated #1 hotel, by our own rating system for 5 years in a row.""  ""Don't worry sir, we'll be happy to throw off your rating averages with fake reviews from our staff, and highly edited pics by VFM Leonardo.""We were in town for just a night to see a ballgame. The location is perfect if you're going to see a game at Busch Stadium as it's just a short walk to the stadium.I love the lobby, with its Cardinal baseball memorabilia; especially the huge framed baseball card collection outside the Market Street Bistro and Bar.Staff was pleasant and accommodating and the room very nice, though we'd have loved a refrigerator. We were on the city side, with a nice view overlooking the courthouse and a view of the Arch.It really annoys me when a more upscale hotel charges for wifi. I paid $9.95 for the privilege of checking my email on my iPad, only to find that it was going to be another $9.95 to connect on my phone. If Holiday Inn Express can provide free wifi for guests, I think Hilton should as well. It's just a tacky, nickel-and-dime way to squeeze a little more money.Irritation with paid wifi aside, we'll definitely stay there again, as everything else was great.Don't miss the 360 bar on the 26th floor - at least head up in mid-afternoon to catch the view. We were planning to go for a drink after the game, but were too tired to deal with the crowds, and a staff member told us that our best bet for getting in for after-game drinks was to leave the game a couple of innings early -- a no-go for these rabid baseball fans. So we have yet to see what we can only guess is a spectacular nighttime view. Maybe next time!","We stayed here for a night and had rooms in each of the towers. I agree that the elevator situation was odd and a bit unusual but not that bad. Overall we had a great experience, great views, and clean rooms. We were close to the ballpark, the Arch and enjoyed the parks, etc. My only sadness was that I couldn't take advantage of our location since we were busy with our event.Stayed here for a conference recently and was impressed. Lobby looked like it was recently remodeled and all the staff was very friendly. Got a free upgrade to a suite on the 25th floor and had an impressive view of the Arch.Friday and Saturday nights are very busy in the lobby with lines of people going to the 360 rooftop bar. But if you're a hotel guest you don't have to stand in line. The bar is very trendy and popular with the locals. Upscale, young crowd. But great views of the city and Busch stadium.Beds and room were comfortable and overall a great stay. There a couple of restaurants and bars and even a Starbucks at the hotel. Only bummer was paying for parking. But the downtown location can't be beat.I gave this hotel another shot despite my disappointing first experience here a year ago, and I have to say, a year made a huge difference in this case...I stayed in the front tower and my room was much nicer than I recall my room being last time.  (Still missing a robe and a mini bar and a bottle of water, but much more comfortable for sure).  The staff has been super friendly this time around as well.In addition, I ordered room service and sure, it was a bit on the slow side arriving, but it was very tasty once it came.  And the highlight of this visit was an event I attended on the 26th floor rooftop restaurant, 360, aptly named for the 360 degree incredible view of the city.  The food, drink, and service were all amazing...At this rate, I'll be back again in another year, and hopefully bump up this Hilton to four stars... that is, if they can work on getting me a robe and a bottle of water in my room!So nice wish I could stay in this hotel more than one night.Walking distance to all great destinations like the ball park village and busch statuim, union station, the arch, and hard rock cafe, also the brewery etc.It looks nice on the outside but the bathroom was gross. The window to look outside of the hotel to the arch had finger prints all over it. You could tell that they had not clean it as we'll as the pictures. Room service did not make our beds and we had to ask them twice to get towels. Although I must say that the view of the arch and the ballpark where amazing. As well as the rooftop diner.A bit of a puzzler, this Hilton.The lobby, she is modern style with a flair for the dramatic. Monochromes, shiny things, modern retro art of the baseball persuasion. She looks cool, sophisticated, thoroughly with the times.But just head on over to the elevators and the tragic consequences of a social life out of control become apparent. You can press her buttons, tell her what to do, but she'll go unresponsive on you for long periods of time. The fancy get-up is great and all, honey, but if I can't get an elevator to show up for five minutes+ at a stretch, I don't care about the packaging. And your chihuahua just peed on my shoe.Get to the room, and it's a freakshow. Like her sister Paris, this one's all over the place. The mod trappings, gone - all that makeup and dressing faker than a grape-flavored diamond ring. She won't shut up, either - she wants you to hear everything - from what's going on the next room over to the party down the hall. Poor, broken down hag, you should get that AC looked at - it rattles and sloshes like a drunken socialite in a too-high set of heels.Your only saving grace so far is that the tangy taste ""downstairs"" is self-serve froyo.You need rehab, baby, and fast. But you say ""No, no, no...""Not bad. But here are some thoughts:Free WIFI in the lobby. You need to pay for WIFI if you want to use it in the rooms.The new ""high tech"" elevators are absolutely... stupid, to be honest. It's a gamble. You're either in and out within seconds or you're waiting for 20 minutes because only one of three cars are running. The new 360 restaurant on the top of the hotel brings a lot of customers that clog up the elevators. Oh yes, AND they're tiny.I just wanted to take a nap.Speaking of naps, the beds are fluffy as freak. Love the beds. Speaking of beds, the room service and cleaning was spot on and on-point. The cleaning woman we had we the HAPPIEST person in the world. I loved seeing her every morning - she put a smile on my face :DGet that elevator fixed yo. Or just downgrade to traditional elevators. Those seem to work just fine.Not a bad hotel in the heart of St Louis.  The downtown is kind of dead at night so don't expect things to be very lively unless there's a baseball game that night. This was a hotwire purchase and the first room they put me in had a heating unit that sounded like it was giving birth.  I complained and they quickly got me a MUCH nicer room.  The beds were super-comfy and I have to say I liked the ""talking"" elevator.  I would come back here.Would I go back - maybe.  This property has excellent location in regards to Busch Stadium and is great from that standpoint if going to a game.  However, while the room was clean and up to date and the lobby modern the room is small and the bathroom even smaller.  The shower curtain was not designed for a curved rod so it was too short and I had to watch how I moved so as not to push it out of the tub when showering.  After I showered the wooden door to the bathroom apparently swelled due to the humidity and would no longer open all of the way as it hit the commode.If you are staying there hope for a room on a lower floor.  The elevator system is confusing and slow.  We had to wait several times for 10 minutes to get an elevator.  When trying to go down the elevator system kept giving us an error when trying to select the lobby as our destination causing us to use the stairs from the 15th floor.The service was friendly and I have no complaints there.  I would stay here again only if I caught a good deal online.Expected more based on the name, price and first impression. The valet guys are very friendly and helpful and the front desk was also friendly. Very close to Busch Stadium which is nice. Parking is across the street in a garage, $20 in-and-out a night isn't horrible. Breakfast buffet is very overpriced. Pretty cool and interesting elevator system. Hotel room was below average. One of the lamps didn't work, some plaster from the ceiling was falling off, shower head came apart and the shower drain backed up. First time at a Hilton and probably the last time.I stayed here last night and read the reviews, wondering why the hotel garners generally low ratings.  Yes, the hotel exterior looks tired, but the lobby is very nice, and my room had a great, super comfortable bed with soft fluffy pillows in front of a 40 inch flatscreen pulling in about 50 channels of which half were true HD.  I love the Lavazza coffee in the rooms, and wireless Internet is now complimentary, a rarity for a Hilton.Oh, and staying at a hotel adjacent to Busch Stadium (yes, that ""Ballpark"") on the eve of the World Series opening had the place buzzing.  But then reality hit.1. I grabbed the glass next to the ice bucket and almost heaved.  The glass (see pic) was filthy.  Come on Hilton, you can do better than this.2. When I went to take a shower, I realized there were no wash cloths!  Plenty of body towels but not a single wash cloth.3. In the morning I went to the bell station to check my luggage for the day.  No one was around.  I waited and waited.  The shoe shine set up about 25 feet away finally came over and tried to help but he didn't have access to the storage room.  After about 5 minutes I went to the front desk where a clerk took my bag.What could have been a 5-star rating quickly deteriorated to 3 stars.  Will I stay here next time?  Will try the Marriott over by Union Station instead.This place is pretty nice. It's huge and the service is great! So of course I read the reviews before I got there (got it through hotwire so I didn't chose it) and i was scared of the elevators....we arrived the day after a huge snow store during a football coach convention/clinic thing. so the lobby were full of HUGE football guys and our first night there there was a crowd in front of the elevators but there was a guy maning them and it wasn't bad at all..less than 5 min wait. Went up to our room...nice bed, clean room, spacious, but very small bathrooms....and the most impressive thing Peter Thomas Roth products in the bathrooms. Wow! I got excited!  Our stay here was very relax. We hung out at the bar in the lobby by the front doors one night and I had an awesome conversation w/ the bartender. She was super nice. I used the fitness center it was nice and the pool looked nice but I didn't have the time to use it :(...I wish I could have gone up to the 360 bar but I didn't know what it would be like, so i didn't pack nice clothing....The people I saw going up there had suit and ties on and the girls had at least 5 in heals...pimpin in my nikes, would have probably been frowned upon. So I just stayed at the bar downstairs. it's a good locationHilton's motto is ""Travel is More than Just A to B.""And then they go on: ""Travel should take you places.""In this case, I'd add, ""travel should take you places other than the Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark.""Why don't we start with the positives:Comfortable bed with plenty of pillows. A Hilton standard and what you come to expect. Decent gym (though dismal view of a wall from the cardio machines). Room and common areas are kept very clean.  Concierge and door personnel are very outgoing and helpful. Awesome view of a ballpark if you're in the West Tower. Oh and if you're a baseball fan, you'll dig the vintage baseball photography they have for art.Sadly for me, the negatives far outweigh the positives:""Travel Should Pamper Your Every Whim."" Really? I assure you it's not an outlandish whim to desire a bathrobe, yet there are none to be found here. Surely this should be standard at a Hilton?Products: Crabtree and Evelyn. Who chose this horrid scent? I made the mistake of using the hand lotion and it left a perfumey stench that had me compulsively washing my hands throughout the day. It's rare that I don't product-horde in a hotel, but it was easy to leave behind the unfinished bottles of mouthwash (really? mouthwash? but no face wash or shower gel?), shampoo, conditioner and lotion.Shower: awful water pressure. Barely any hot water to be had. You bet your a$$ I was screaming bloody murder at 7 am when faced with a cold shower.Pampered. Not.Next, let us recall the altogether strange experience with the front desk locking us out of our rooms one night due to a staggering bill of 50 dollars from buying the internet for three days AND 2 glasses of wine in the bar. They claimed this was because they didn't have a credit card on file for the room. Not only had we given a card at check in, but come on! You can't call our cellphones to verify? I've never been locked out of a hotel room before. I felt like a criminal. I felt like Janice Dickenson coming down from benzos and ready to rip someone a new a$$hole, because the layout of the hotel meant that if you were in the West tower, getting to the lobby would be a five minute drag when you are dead tired and just want to go to bed. I love me an hour or two spent at a hotel bar, only this hotel bar seemed to close with no rhyme nor reason. It closed at 1am on a Wednesday, yet on a Thursday, they decided to close at midnight, despite the fact that the place was packed with Bikers Against Child Abuse. There was a convention, so the hotel was quite populated with people looking to socialize the way people do. What hotel bar in a downtown local closes at midnight on a Thursday? On that note, there is no mini bar in the room. I don't normally use mini bars, but when the lobby *snack stand* (I kid you not. It's a snack stand. In a Starbucks outpost or something) closes at 11. So, the hotel bar closes at midnight and you're hungry...you're kind of SOL here because there is seemingly nothing around the hotel that you can even run out to grab a quick bite.This may be nitpicky, (again, we're talking a Hilton which until the other day I was going on about being superior to Kimpton Hotels) there's the dated decor...the Hiltons need to give this gal a makeover because it's looking awfully early 90s up in here.I would never stay here again and do not recommend it, although if you can get a really good rate, it's not the worst hotel you can stay in, I suppose. I realize that's not a glowing endorsement, but if the above issues are not things you'd find issue with...then it's fine.I hate writing negative reviews. But from a Hilton, I expect more. See my review of Kansas City's The President for a glowing Hilton review.Don't expect to get any sleep while staying here. I understand that it has a high level of activity with its proximity to the ballpark, but the noise level is subpar in the rooms. I could hear everything that was going on next door, the loud housekeeping staff and everyone walking down the hall. It kept waking me up all night, and I am a heavy sleeper. The lobby at night it highly atrocious with drunks waiting for the elevator to go to the rooftop bar.  Clearly not classy at all, very tacky and certainly not worth the $300 per night price.  I recommend the Drury on 4th.Earplugs anyone?Hilton Ballpark has a great location, beautiful lobby, reasonably nice staff.  The beds are great, reasonably clean rooms, great night life at the 360 lounge.  Why not a happy camper.  The noiseproofing is TERRIBLE.  Premium room, west tower (17th floor), not near the elevator, I can hear every sound above me, next  to me and in the hall.  The heating system won't set to continuous fan so there is no white noise to drowned out the nose blowing, baby crying, elevator conversation, ice machine churning, intimate interludes.  I drove out to walgreens and bought ear plugs.  Maybe that should be part of the check-in premium package.What a dump.  Stayed as part of a large team offsite meeting.  Had to move rooms the first night due to a huge blister filled with water leaking onto my bathroom counter.  A colleague had to move THREE times.  The place just looks kind of old and dirty but I have to at least give it props for its location near the ballpark.  The staff tries to please which is appreciated but are undone by the overall dumpiness.The only reason for 1 vs. 2 stars is that sitting atop the place is the very, very cool 360 bar.  Would love to have a place like that in Charlotte.The hotel was good. Stayed here for the Joyce Meyer Conference. Very centrally located. Elevators area  bit sketchy when things get busy. Had a view of the ball fiend. Loved the Starbucks and Yogurt shop in the lobby. Ordered Room Service and was pleasantly surprised how good the food was.I stayed here one night after a Cardinals baseball game. The hotel itself is really nice inside. I liked the modern feel and contemporary art that they used to furnish the hotel. The bed was comfy, the amenities were standard. One thing that really irked me about this hotel was the fact that they did not have any complimentary Tums or anything like it. The only thing they had was in the gift shop and costs some amount of money. Well, when your stomach is hurting at 12am in the middle of the night, more likely than not, the gift shop is not going to be open. There also isn't a local Walmart to drive to because you are in the city. I went to the front desk to ask after waiting 20 minutes in line to find this out. However, the manager was nice enough to open the gift shop and ""charge"" the pepsid ACs to our room. Really? Two pepsid AC tablets aren't free? I feel as if this type of service should be complimentary. I guess it's just another way the hotel industry can nickel and dime you along with the random tax fees they charge. I just figured that a hotel at this level, a ""Hilton,"" would give away complimentary Tums like your local Holiday Inn.If you have an event with a lot of out of town guests don't go here. We blocked rooms with them in the promises of a comp'd room for newlyweds and after wedding availability at 360. We booked 40 rooms. Yes...40. Newlyweds charged for the room and no one allowed up 360 with. 25$ cover.  We were told this would all be taken care of. It wasn't. No one would help. No calls or emails returned. Very disappointing.I had a good experience here. Easy check-in, nice stay, and an easy check-out.Other details worth mentioning:* Allen the doorman... SUPER helpful.* No fridge in the room. They offer food at 360 or via room service but don't expect to save leftovers. :(* The elevators up to our room were so tiny and they're shared with bar 360, so you have to stand in a line to get to your own room or you end up packed in like a sardine (if not both).So yeah, I enjoyed it. It was a nice place but there is room for improvement.","['business', 'trip', 'partner', 'room', 'clean', 'decorated', 'poorly', 'half', 'modern', 'half', 'old', 'actually', 'whole', 'hotel', 'like',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/moonrise-hotel-saint-louis,Moonrise Hotel,4.0,$$,205,"I attended a wedding reception Sunday, October 11, in the New Moon Room, with access to the rooftop. The sliding glass doors were open, and it was a glorious setting with the breeze wafting through the room.Color schemes are amazing. Moon and astronaut stuff is everywhere -- mostly in glass cases, so quite tastefully done.The actual wedding took place July 19 in NYC, where the girls reside, as does one set of parents.The other set of parents lives in STL. They're the ones I know, and I've known their daughter since she was 7 or 8, so nigh on 20 years.The mother is my frequent lunch and movie partner girlfriend. And my husband stood up for Marvin when they got married, some forever years ago.It was a glorious three hours. Bartenders were at the ready. I drank Diet Coke all afternoon. I saw old friends. Met family members from out of town.The food was a spectacular array. Hummus with pita and gluten-free crackers. Shrimp cocktail. Two sliders: pork and burgers. Two ravioli with marinara sauce: one beef, one cheese. Vegetable skewers. Mini-cupcakes. All made in-house.I had hummus with pita. Shrimp cocktail (3), and the horseradish sauce was fabulous. Slider burger without the bun. Cheese ravioli without sauce. Great food! I was stuffed.Incredibly gracious teammates.Stayed here for business and was very impressed by the amenities and customer service of this hotel.  The moon theme is very pervasive all throughout.Food at the restaurant was good and the ambience was very warm and welcoming.  Views from the rooftop bar are spectacular.  My room was terrific - shower was awesome, bed was comfortable.  My only complaint was that the hallway light was very bright and, due to the short distance between my door and my bed, illuminated my room which is not an ideal sleeping environment for me.All in all though, I would definitely recommend this hotel.This is really a review of the rooftop bar more than the actual hotel itself.Pros:+ Separate entrance for the rooftop+ There isn't actually a cover to go up+ Great Drinks+ Gorgeous view of the arch+ Lots of space to loungeCons:- Drinks are around $10 for one though- Parking is a bit tough hereGreat hotel..... Eclectic... Valet.... Bar on top,,, nicely appointed rooms... Great restaurant called Eclipse on bottom floor... Had breakfast there... Off the chain really.... Staff for moonrise were friendly.... And the final straw.... Great bar on 8th floor/ roof.... Great views,,, better drinks... Peace...Came here for a surprise 40th birthday party on the top floor--everything was fantastic. The food, band, service, space, decor, etc--all great! Awesome spot for any type of party and in the summer they can open the windows to the rooftop to accommodate more people. The staff was very attentive and everyone had what they needed at all times. Great venue!This was a tough review. One of the better views in STL period. Great atmosphere but the drinks were pricey especially for STL standards and the parking is pretty bad any where you go in the loop. I wanna go back but 3 stars solely for the prices being way too much for what it is. I personally know from experience working at HOME nightclub people will eventually stop coming because of prices. This is St. Louis, not NY, Miami, or LA.This review is not for the hotel itself but for the bar on the top floor. Went to a 40th bday party there.  Hap approx 60 people with a small band and it was a good size for that.  View is great.Did you guys hear about the great new restaurant on the moon? The food is excellent, but there's no atmosphere... nyuk, nyuk, nyuk. Okay, for real, I didn't event eat at Moonrise, but I did stay there a few nights and it was great.Unfortunately, the lobby when you walk in is pretty boring. That is, if you consider a crazy light up stairwell to be boring, and if that's the case, I don't event want to know you. The welcoming staff was over the moon and had me checked in and up to my room for a cat-nap in no time.Once I settled in, I closed the darkening blinds to block out any moonbeams and was about to dive into my pillow filled crater of a bed for some shut eye. First, I did the full on George Costanza pose in my underwear on the chaise. I slept like a moon rock and woke up refreshed and ready to moonwalk my ass out of there to dinner.The best thing is, if your looking for a great bar nearby, you don't have to travel to the moon and back. Hop on the elevator and press 8. Next thing you know, you're in the belly of the beast as far as moon-geekery goes. You'd be a lunar-tic if you think I'm gonna tell you that a spaced out decor can take a hotel bar from standard Marriott to out-of-this-world watering hole. For that, you'd need to be fixing some out-of-orbit cocktails, with top notch bartenders, and sporting a seriously impressive beer program. Well, the moon room has it all!I Apollo-gise for not telling you more, but this should help you realize the Moonrise is for you!Great hotel and a wonderful break from the standard chains that offer rooms that are very neutral and as a business and recreational, I traveller appreciated the unique feel of this property. Outstanding staff, service, and amenities. I recommended this hotel tonight to several people. I'm ready for my next stay at this great place that provides delightful titillation for the senses. Also great food and unique area of town where there are always someplace to go and check out. A destination hotel and area, for sure.This review is long overdue, but I did have a fabulous stay at the Moonrise Hotel when I was in STL for business a few months back.A few of the most memorable fun facts from my stay:*My room was spacious and had a sound machine!  If you've never tried sleeping with one, try one ASAP; it's life changing!*My bathroom was both spacious and had an awesome shower (with both heat and pressure).*The staff was sweet for the most part aside from not being very helpful when I tried to get a cab to the airport early on my departure morning.*There was a comfy robe for me to lounge around in!*There is a decent fitness center, which I did visit.*There is supposedly an awesome rooftop bar as well, but I will have to hit that up next time...*There were plenty of extra quirky touches that you won't find at any other hotel!I'd absolutely stay at the Moonrise on future visits to Saint Louis and recommend you do the same!What a cool, quirky hotel. Situated right in the loop, close to Forest Park, loads of coffee shops, and the best part of all - two Thai restaurants within eyesight. (And I'm not one of those detailed hotel specific reviewers who is counting electrical outlets so I'll just say the staff was extremely friendly and the hotel was clean.)The draw is the huge rooftop patio bar, where I got to kick back for a few nights. The outdoor to the rooftop stayed open despite it being a bit cool and there were quite a few people up there for a Tuesday night. I'd definitely look to stay here again.The bubbles from the shampoo were out of control luxurious and the conditioner instantly transformed my crispy auburn stands into seriously soft, shiny locks, the body wash was like a Florida orange juice commercial except more lemony, and the green goopy body lotion made me feel, for a moment, like I was about to get on the catwalk. I think that was the moment I thought, ""I'ma gank all these products, all week long."" This is really rare for me. I don't go through the effort of swiping travel size soaps most places, it's not really worth the effort, but at the Moonrise this level of pimpmanship, er, stellar customer care, is just endemic of how they roll. Everything in the joint is just a tad elevated (heh heh), nothing elitist but oh, they fancy, huh? Free headphones in the fitness center? Check. True mixology on the rooftop bar? Bling, and they're open 'till 3am. Really helpful employees, colorful artwork, smoove wi-fi, great location, a sort of Wes Anderson feel. The next time I'm in St. Louis this is definitely my go-to.And now I have, like, a week's worth of bomb-ass product to remind me of the days that were.I usually love staying at this hotel thanks to the fun theme and vibe, but this review is specifically about our stay over this Labor Day weekend. At checkin, we were not warned that there would be a massive ""drink exchange"" party taking over the hotel that night. As a result, there was constant music blaring from 6pm-midnight. This was a major disappointment for us because we had an exhausting day and we were looking forward to some R&amp;R in a beautiful setting.The hotel seemed to care more about pleasing their event guests than hotel guests and when we voiced our frustration, we were simply told, ""sorry.""This was a disappointment to say the least.Really a different kind of hotel.  The moon theme runs though out the hotel. I enjoyed the front lobby a lot. The rooms are clean and have several nice amenities.  Outlets are every where which makes charging our phones, tablets  and computer easy.  Liked the modern bathroom.  It had nice robes and good shampoo.   They had a Homedics sound machine.  Erica checked us l in. She was nice and professional.  She gave us a map of the loop which made it easy to figure out where we wanted to go. As we were leaving to go to the Muny, Joe Edwards drove up in his antique convertible.  Nice to see the owner shows up at his own place.Five stars for the magnificent Moonrise! What a fun, cute little hotel that pulls of unique while staying safely outside of kitschy. The moon theme is just a fun little extra icing on the top of a boutique hotel that gets everything right. And I totally loved that it reflected a true, lifelong passion of the owner. We should all have something in our lives we love as much as this guy loves the moon. The hotel itself is impressive inside and out, with a good system for arrivals, taxis, etc. I was greeted quickly by the staff, who happened to know that the rest of my party had gone on to the restaurant - pretty slick! The rooms were perfectly appointed, and I absolutely loved the bed and all the bedding. I have to agree with Howie K on the bath products too - so good! Probably second only to W Hotels Bliss products. That said, I'd stay at this place over an Aloft any day. The hotel was quiet, even though a Hozier concert let out late next door and sent concert goers spilling into the hallways. Being a well-built hotel, you couldn't hear much from the revelers. You know how, at less impressive hotels, every door slam rattles your bones? Not here. My room was the right size, and even managed to have somewhat of a little foyer, and the right amount of functional furniture (a chaise that served as a great place to lay out my clothes, a nice long desk, and a few separate shelves and cubbies that all served a good purpose. Housekeeping, room service both did a great job as well. I would stay here again in a minute and hope I get the chance to again someday. Thanks to all who made it such a memorable and relaxing stay.I visited the bar at the top of the Moonrise Hotel on a Saturday afternoon. Even though this building is only 8 stories tall, you still get a great view of the city and it's a great place to relax and have drinks. The Moonrise Hotel building also has character. It's a fun place to check out!Drinks are standard and prices are pretty much on par with any other classy bar you'd visit in STL. Please note I've never stayed at the hotel....this is just a review of the bar on the roof of the hotel.The bar does have Boulevard (a KC beer) on tap, which can sometimes hard to find in STL (more of a Schlafly town).I plan to visit this bar again the next time I want to have a relaxing night at a classier bar and the weather is nice.Very nice. Right in U-City. The rooftop bar was cool and had an amazing view of St. Louis. Lots of great places to eat nearby.Lee at the reception desk is amazing.  Best hotel experience in recent memory.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  I'll visit again most definitely.  The place is clean, modern, and located next to many area attractions.I had the privilege of staying at The Moonrise Hotel on a business trip to St. Louis. This is my second experience staying here. The first thing you experience is a nice overhead heater as you walk through the glass doors. Very refreshing for an Alabamian lost in the snow of the midwest.Every time I have gone to the front desk for anything, I have been met with a smiling, helpful employee. They make the whole check-in process as seamless and quick as possible.The decor is out of the dream of a space/sci-fi nerd who opened a hotel. It provides a unique, fun atmosphere. This theme is carried over to the very large clean rooms. Two things make a hotel for me. The bed and the shower. Both are EXCEPTIONAL here. The bed is large and comfortable. The shower is a waterfall shower with plenty of hot water. The soaps and shampoos are a step above your typical hotel giveaways. There are other complimentary items that show that they truly care that you have a great experience. Even though I don't use them.Lastly, the bar upstairs provides a continuation of the fun atmosphere and goes even further. We could utilize the outside because of the weather. But I can imagine how nice it would be during the summer. The beer selection and knowledgable bartenders make your drinking experience top notch. I highly recommend for anyone to stay here if you are going to St. Louis.My husband and I decided to take a romantic stay-cation at the Moonrise, hoping to spend the evening staring at the stars in their lovely rooftop bar.  The room was modern, and very clean.  The bed was so comfortable I wanted to move in.  I had absolutely no complaints about our room, the staff, or the room service we ordered (try the moon pie).  Everything was top rung!  My one complaint was that the rooftop bar was closed to the public due to a private event on the night we were staying.  We were disappointed, but these things happen.  After our stay I filled out the online comment card, and mentioned that we were unable to visit the rooftop during our stay.  To my great surprise, the manager promptly sent me an email apologizing for the inconvenience, and offering us a voucher for a return stay, and even offered to upgrade us to a suite.Very rarely do you run across this kind of customer service.  Bravo Moonrise!  We will be faithful patrons for life.","I never been so upset with a service experience.I pre-paid my stay at this hotel.  I arrive a day later because my flight got delayed and I lost my connection, to my surprise my room was given to another person. I was in shocked becausee how is it posible that my pre-paid room where my CC was charged in full, was given to another person?  Bottom line if my room is pre paid I am entitle to show the last 5 minutes of my reservation if I feel like to, it is up to me how much I use my room as long as it is paid.I was forced to find a hotel near by for 2 nights until they find me a new room, I been trying to get a refund for the nights I was not able to used,  but I keep getting excuses such as "" Your room was given away because you didnt showed up on time"".This hotel charged 2 different individuals for the same room and they are not willing to reimburse,  very dissappointed with their management.My mom and I loved our stay in this charming little hotel! The quirky details really made us feel welcome. What a colorful and cheerful place to stay...and an awesome price, too!Our room was very clean and well designed, with thoughtful toiletries like a mini sewing kit (useful on the road!). The bed was super comfy.The hotel staff was informative and professional. We visited the rooftop lounge for a drink, and were momentarily harassed by a drunk guy who we think had wandered in off the street (no big deal). The staff made sure that he was shown out and that we felt safe. We did appreciate that the room floors were only accessible by keycard, so we felt secure (and the safe inside the room was also appreciated).The neighborhood, although under construction, seemed very quaint and charming. We had breakfast at a delicious pastry shop next door, and then I headed over to get some work done at Kayak Coffee. My mom enjoyed one of the free museums close by.Thanks for making our short stay so enjoyable!Hubby planned a staycation/date night at Moonrise since he heard it's a quirky, unique and highly rated hotel in STL. I must say, I was SUPER impressed and LOVED it. All the little touches are fantastic -- a welcome drink (and welcome snacks for pups), fabulous lounge and atmosphere, all the free, thoughtful toiletries, waterfall shower, Wolfgang Puck coffee, super beds, and more. I was blown away. Our room was clean, well lit, spacious, beautifully decorated, and thoughtfully arranged. The decor around the hotel is cool -- warning, they really stick with the moon and space theme. They have a better than concierge service (though we didn't use), thoughtful and dedicated staff, a fantastic rooftop bar,  lounge spaces, and delicious 24 hr room service offerings (from the restaurant on site, Eclipse). Not to mention right on the Loop with tons of things to do! We moseyed around the Loop during the day, went to the rooftop bar for a pre-diner drink, went to Eclipse for dinner (that review is forthcoming :)), hung out in the room, and had room service for breakfast. Everything was fabulous. The rooftop bar is a gem in it's own right. The view is amazing, the bar is well stocked with unique offerings, and the vibe is relaxed/chill with some lounge-y spots around. The room service was fab -- the food was plentiful, delicious, and wonderfully presented. The staff is so impressive as well. I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and while it's a bit on the pricey side the boutique hotel experience is worth it and I would return. My ONLY beef is that we got a jacuzzi king room and the tub was a little bit of a let down. It's not actually a jet jacuzzi tub like we were expecting. More like a bit bigger than a regular bath tub with air jets. If we came back, we probably wouldn't spring for that upgrade.Great experience here on a recent quickie biz trip. Nice boutique-ish hotel w most of the amenities of a larger place but with the charm of a smaller one. Well-appointed rooms, thoughtful, efficient bathroom, and tasty, reasonable room service. Connor checked me in - and out - and, unlike most lodging places, seemed genuinely happy and eager to help. Helped bookend a nice stay well. Only downside: It is in a bit of a college-student drinking area, so there was an instance of um, happy, people yelling on the street.Although this hotel is very comfortable and the amenities are amazing, it is ridiculously loud. When people are in the hallway it sounds as if they are in your room with you. Stayed here for a work trip and had a very hard time working with all the noise from housekeeping and hotel staff in the hallways throughout the days.Definitely a cool place though and an amazing location!Every time I visit St. Louis I check the Moonrise prices, and it is ALWAYS way out of my budget ($300-$400/night for a hotel? In St. Louis? Get out of here.) ... however, this time, I randomly looked a few months in advance &amp; found a room on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> for $149/night. I booked that shizz straight away, not even knowing if we were going to visit that weekend or not.Turns out, we did visit &amp; I got to see what all the fuss is about. I've stayed at some swanky hotels and this one isn't as amazing as the others I've stayed at for those kinds of prices... basically there's no way I'd pay ""full"" price here. But, considering what I did pay, we got a deal. Front desk staff were super nice, we were offered a cocktail upon check-in which is always lovely. We self-parked, I find no reason to valet when the self-park is free &amp; is only 30 steps from the front door. Also: note, St. Louis, the land of massive amounts of free/supes-cheap parking, hooray! My boyfriend thought we'd gone to another planet.Great location, only a block-ish away from the Delmar Metrolink stop, walking distance to all the fun stuff to do in U-City. One complaint there is that there are not a ton of breakfasty joints nearby... do you people not eat breakfast? We waited it out 'til 11am and went to Blueberry Hill one day, and hit up the little pastry shop on the corner the next.The bed was super comfy &amp; cozy, blinds were crazy dark allowing me to get some much needed zzz's. The bathrom is nice, though that door is kinda funky &amp; doesn't allow for much privacy when one needs to, um, use the facilities. Talk about stage fright. The shower itself was small-ish but had a lovely rainfall showerhead so that's a win on my end. My only complaint is that it's not the quietest hotel ever, I had to bust out the earplugs I always travel with to stop hearing the music/noise/talking/whatever it was from outside (or was it the room next to us? I have no idea). Also, free wifi that actually works in-room, exciting stuff.Overall I'd definitely stay here again, but only if I got a deal like this time. I personally don't mind staying on the east side of the river in O'Fallon, etc., to save some $$ and driving to the city for whatever we have going on. But, to spend a full weekend downtown, the Moonrise is a good bet.Funky and cool and clean and new... Just quirky enough to be memorable and clean/new enough to have had zero problems on my trip.  ...Also had drinks on the rooftop bar last night and that was hopping for a Wednesday night!  Recommend :-)The hotel and staff are awesome. The room service food is disgusting. We stayed here for an event that was at the rooftop bar. The room is great. It was clean and offered more amenities than most hotels such as a sound machine and an umbrella, just in case. The bar was wonderfully decorated in a space theme and had amazing views. All of the staff were excellently trained. The front desk people were nice and knowledgable. The bartenders mixed drinks with expertise. The room service people were very nice and courteous. But the room service food was just plain disgusting. I got breakfast - first of all I didn't get all my food and the order was slightly wrong.  The pancakes tasted like cement and the sausage looked and tasted like dog turds. The only decent food delivered was the coffee and pineapple juice. Stay at the hotel, eat out!If you are in the area it is worth going up here to partake of a drink or two on the rooftop bar....drinks are going to be around the 8-10 dollar range but they don't cheat you on the pour which is nice and let's face it you are getting some pretty neat atmosphere.....I did not have any food but other people around me told me  how good the cheese and pretzels sticks were....It is a really funky space and it is less uppity than a lot of the rooftop bars that are in the heart of downtown.  This is the rooftop bar for the blue collar man....as you can go a little less dressed up and you don't get any less atmosphere or swankiness....or attitude from any of the patrons or servers....I went to the rooftop bar with Aimee K and a coworker last week for drinks and apps. It was a perfect evening. I mean the weather was PERFECT. It could not have been a better St. Louis summer night. The weather wasn't too warm or humid and it was even a bit cool.  It took a while for us to get service but it wasn't that big of a deal. We weren't in a rush.  I had my first Dark and Stormy (cocktail) and I highly recommend it. I can't wait to order this drink again. We got a lot of their appetizers. None of them stood out but they all did the job. The best thing about this place is the decor and view. They do an awesome job of making the place swanky and relaxing. All the bright colors are so fun and appealing. I can't wait to bring more friends here :)Love this hotel! I can't give it five stars simply because of what it lacks that a 5-star hotel should have: a pool! One of my favorite activities when at a hotel for vacay is hanging for a bit at the pool area, so I really wish they had one, but otherwise, nearly everything was stellar.One of the really cool things about this hotel is that it doesn't feel like a corporate hotel. I stay at Marriotts all the time as it's my employer's preferred chain, so it was nice to spend some time at a hotel that was a bit different.The location was fabulous! Close to Forest Park and in walking distance to some cool locations in The Loop. The decor throughout the hotel has a lunar/space theme. It's a bit kitschy but I liked it! There's a great big rotating moon on the building that lights up at night and is really cool.The hotel makes a special point of being pet-friendly which I like. Every person who worked there who we encountered was simply a joy to speak with. Everyone truly seemed to enjoy their jobs and it showed.The fitness center is a bit sparse when it comes to equipment, but it was very clean and they have fresh fruit and filtered water available.They have a rooftop bar which the hubby and I visited. We didn't stick around long because apparently they allow smoking up there even though it's supposed to be a smoke-free hotel. But that was a relatively minor annoyance since we likely wouldn't have stuck around for a night of drinking, anyway.The bedding was comfortable, but the pillows were just slightly beyond their prime. While we were there, they took delivery of a bunch of new mattresses, so if you stay there, you might get a nice brand new mattress to sleep on!Next time we have a St Louis getaway, we'll put this hotel at the top of the list.Great hotel! Very friendly staff and clean, comfy rooms. We also enjoyed a drink on the roof at the bar which was very cool!One of my favorite places in STL. The hotel decor is very cool, and pet friendly which is awesome. The rooms are unique and spacious and the staff is beyond friendly. The bar at the very top is amazing and just a really fun atmosphere whether you're staying or just visiting.Loved this place! PERFECT if you are going to a concert at the pageant!! Food at the eclipse restaurant was good and staff was very friendly!Oh my god, I LOVE this place!! What a terrific little boutique hotel!! Everything is perfect from the quality and location of the hotel all the way down to the little details of the room. I'm so impressed! This is such a clever, thoughtfully derived hotel. A gem I tell you! And the staff couldn't be friendlier or more helpful. I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in St. Louis!Had the opportunity to stay here as part of a weekend getaway with some friends. From the valet out front to the desk staff to the bartenders, everyone there epitomized excellent service. The rooms are solid, they went for aesthetics over practicality but the resulting look is clean and very nice. The rooftop bar was perfect on a breezy Sunday evening and the hotel restaurant made a great breakfast. I enjoyed my stay here and plan on using the Moonrise on future trips to St. Louis.We were thrilled with our choice of hotel in STL. The Moonrise Hotel was in a great location- minutes from Wash U, Forest Park, the Delmar Loop, and just a short drive to anywhere else you would want to go. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful (they even greeted us upon check-in with a cocktail), and the rooms were very clean and comfortable.The rooms had everything you would need to be comfortable during your stay, including: a VERY comfy bed, a noise machine and iHome alarm clock, mini fridge, bathrobe and H2O bath products...am I forgetting something? There are moon themed paintings and art throughout the room and whole hotel, as well as a whole collection of moon/space themed objects displayed on the hotel's main floor/lobby. Don't forget to check out the rooftop bar to get a cool view of the area- and of the rotating moon!Staying on the 6th floor, we didn't have any noise complaints from the upstairs bar. However, the noise from other guests in the hallway (the little that there was) traveled  easily into our room. We had no issues with self parking, even on the holiday weekend. Although there is no complimentary breakfast (which would have been icing on the cake), there was a Keurig with regular, decaf, and tea cups each morning we were there. They also have an attached restaurant with decent prices, although we didn't dine there.I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in STL- especially if you are a space geek!We always stay here when we are going to The Pageant. In the beginning when we first started going they always had my favorite beverage (Diet Coke) and a snack of my choice. It was usually something on the healthy side for me but every now and then we would get the famous moon pies. That is something they discounted that I miss. We love the fact that the staff remember us by name, especially Eman (I hope I spelled that correctly). He even remembers our son who would also stay there when enjoying a concert and asks about him if he hasn't seen him in a while. To me that is special since we are from a small community were everybody knows everybody, to go to a city and staff remembers your name and personal information about your likes and dislikes. We recommend the Moonrise to anyone who is going to see a show at The Pageant as it is only a very short walk away. Thanks Eman for making are stay always pleasurable!!!!!Mrs. CerneyThe most eclectic hotel I've ever stayed at.Obviously the theme of the hotel has to do with the moon. You see it everywhere. This hotel is quaint I would say. Not necessarily small, but cozy.The front desk staff were very nice and prompt. They did give us the wrong key to the wrong room at first, but someone rushed upstairs to switch them out so we didn't have to go all the way back downstairs.This hotel allows pets. I thought the cutest thing was that they had a chalkboard on the floor next to some doggie bowls. The chalkboard had a personalized message and the names of all the dogs that were checking in that day. So cute! A hotel that loves man's best friend.The rooms are modern, clean, and pretty standard. It has a fridge and a chaise for lounging. The restaurant is open late so you can get drinks and eats until 2 or 3 am. Parking is free when there isn't an event at the Pageant Theater. Otherwise I think it's 25 bucks for valet.Recently visited the Moonrise with some friends. I will say, it looks awesome from the outside, but that is where the allure ended.We made our way to the top balcony area and tried to order a few drinks. The drinks were expensive, very weak and took 1/2 hour to get. Already starting on the low side. To make matters worse, the clientele was NOT classy, and it seemed kinda like a gathering zone for ""creepers"". At one point I turned around and some biker looking scumbag was smoking pot on the balcony. I looked at him disapprovingly and he said, ""What are you looking at?"" I didn't feel like arguing, fighting and eventually arresting him, so I just shook my head and walked on. I was definitely not impressed.","I haven't tried all the hotels in St. Louis but I have tried nine and I now have a favorite. Located on the Loop, and near more than enough restaurants, entertainment, and shopping to keep you fed and entertained for a good weekend. It's a quick drive downtown if that's your thing and an even quicker drive to Forest Park, the Zoo, or the Hill. I was a little hesitant because the decor looked way out there but it's much more understated than the website makes it appear to be. True there are moon art and photos, and space exploration memorabilia about everywhere.All the staff, from the front desk and valet, to the restaurant and rooftop bar staff was professional and very helpful. The bed was perfect, everything was well maintained and clean. Just in time, we were running out of hotels to try.The hotel itself is in a great area if you don't want to travel far. We booked one of the celebrity suites as we enjoy having a little extra space. I was disappointed when we entered the room as it smelled like cigarette smoke. The celebrity suites also do not have any tubs. Just a small stand up shower.  The rooms could be cleaner and just kept up more. A lot of paint xhips, dirty walls, something gooey on the bathroom wall and grout lines in bathroom need some work. The beds are comfy but the pillows are small and flat. The suites do have two tvs and separate thermostats which is nice.Paying for location here. They need to do better cleaning and maintenance though.This place is awesome! The hotel staff are super welcoming and nice. The valet guys really need some credit due to the fact that when we stayed it was WELL below freezing but by their attitudes, you'd never be able to tell! The hotel is also AMAZING if you plan on bringing your pet, we are definitely planning a trip back just because of how nice everyone was....and for the dog :)This place is amazing!! So nice and extremely dog friendly. They gave a welcoming gift to my dog with cookies, water bottle, food bowls. Awesome bathroom, view, bed, decor, hair products, etc. a definite must stay!!Good location, Strong Rooftop Bar, Cool Decoration.  This is a haven of uniqueness sitting amongst all the look a likes.I've only interacted fully with a valet here while visiting the rooftop terrace. Dino was incredibly kind and helpful, pointing us in the right direction to the roof. When I came back down to wait for my party, he casually straightened the floor mat so it wouldn't be crooked while waiting for cars. It's people like this that make or break hotels. People who have an attention to detail and have excellent customer service is something that doesn't come by too often these days. I love this place. I'd definitely come back for the atmosphere, drinks, and service.I have mixed feelings about Moonrise's rooftop bar. On one hand, it's a great view and an excellent place to hang out and meet new people, and is definitely an experience everyone in STL should have. But on the other, this place isn't really worth making a regular haunt; it's too expensive, the view is good but not amazing, and the allure is quickly lost. But once again, it's worth going at least once.I visited the rooftop bar, and let me tell you, it was awesome. The view was fantastic. I loved the chill atmosphere of the place. There were plenty of comfortable seats to sit and enjoy a drink. Will definitely come back here again.Our experience with the Moonrise Hotel was horrible.  I mean utterly shocking.  Then their response. Completely inappropriate.    The part of us trying to seek out compensation really blows our minds. I mean, we spent thousands of dollars there on a previous happy visit.Good Evening,I am writing to give you some feedback on our stay in the hotel this week. We checked in Monday and have been staying in room 726. We are checking out tomorrow. We have previously stayed in the hotel, and have had a fantastic experience, but are thinking this stay may be our last. Let me explain why.We had no hot water for bathing Tuesday. We reported this to your front desk, and an engineer began looking into the problem, but we had to get to a funeral by a specific time, so we had to take cold showers that day. Very unpleasant.We called room service this morning for breakfast and were greeted with an unfriendly male voice. While taking our order, I became increasingly annoyed at his monotone communication style, which is entirely inconsistent with what one wants from someone talking on the phone. Where was at least a hint of friendliness in his voice? Not to be found.By the time the order arrived, the Eclipse Breakfast was cold. A cinnamon roll that should have been included as an appetizer was missing, so we had to call again, and when it finally arrived, the rest of our breakfast was cold too.Housekeeping left a bag belonging to someone else in our room. We arrived home to see this bag and were concerned that another guest was in our room during the day, but concluded it must have been a housekeeping error.One of the side tables in our room hasn't been wiped down the entire duration of our stay. The dining table has dirty and grease between the glass surface and wood frame. We took care of fine tuning the cleaning ourselves.On entering the hotel today, an empty bottle of ""personal lubricant"" and other trash was present outside the main door. I was surprised that this was not swept up immediately.Room service trays and other trash items left outside guest rooms on our floor often remain there all day or all night. I would think an hourly sweep at a minimum is reasonable. We have had to leave notes on items outside doors asking for debris to be picked up.The material covering the sofa gave both of us a rash and feels ""cheap.""The pillows are very low quality and provide no head or neck support. We wanted to watch a movie on television this afternoon, but we found you do not offer an on-demand video service, which was disappointing.Finally, in addition to the distribution of this message, we wanted to include Joe Edwards, but were told ""he doesn't have an email."" Of course he has an email address. It is 2015. It is insulting to be told he doesn't have one. At the very least, tell us the truth and say ""he refuses to share it, but we'll pass along the message.""I am staying with a former employee from 5 years ago who saw the hotel at its prime. He is shocked at the decline in quality of the hotel, and I am equally surprised myself at the decline even over the past year since my last stay. This is supposed to be a boutique hotel providing the finest service, according to your website, printed materials, and branding, so we expect to receive that level of service.We thought you should know about all these problems because the hotel industry is very competitive, and your competitors are looking very attractive to us right now. I'd like to mention that I am a Director in an IT Consulting firm based in St. Louis with extensive travel needs, and have recommended the Moonrise in the past, but am unable to do so now because of these issues.We'd appreciate a prompt response, including one from Mr. Edwards. Please send this along to him as we were unable to get his email address.Thanks,Dave ScheeleNicholas RodgersMoonrise Hotel Dave and Nicholas:Thank you for reaching out to me and sharing your experience.  Seems the issues you encountered were many, you did however exaggerate more than was necessary.  Sure, some of those things listed may have occurred, your threats at the end only served to put your whole note in perspective.  Nicholas, having previously worked in Eclipse as a busser does not give you the right to even to get an employee/friends and family rate, had that request crossed my desk as is our policy, it would have been denied. Consider the compensation you seek as the variance of what the suite normally runs for, $389 and what you paid $199 under the family rate per night, a $190 per night savings times 4 evenings equals $760 saved.  Jonathan did not lie to you on Facebook when he said Joe Edwards does not have e-mail, yes even in 2015, I did however show him your email this morning. You are not welcome to patronize Eclipse nor the Moonrise Hotel in the future.Sincerely,Paul J LauritsenGeneral ManagerMoonrise HotelThis is indeed as good as it gets.  We had a wonderful, top notch experience at the Moonrise both times were there.  First of all, from the moment you arrive, you are bombarded with awesomeness in regards to the beauty of all that surrounds you.  I felt transformed into magical the minute we walked in, even wearing my yoga pants &amp; baggy t-shirt.   The moon theme, and all other decor around the entire hotel are just beautiful.Customer service was top notch as well.  We had absolutely no problems with anyone, and were greeted and treated with respect, kindness, and a positive attitude.We even made use of the rooftop bar since weather did permit during one of our visits.  The rooms are spacious and gorgeous.  Shower is luxurious. And the products provided were great, too.It is a very unique boutique hotel, with it's own theme and charm.  I personally felt well taken care of there, and not at all like I was anywhere near Missouri.An added bonus for me, is the location.  It is in walking distance to a MetroLink light-rail station, as well as one of my favorite pizza places.Our family of five had a fabulous stay at this hotel. Our artistic daughter has gone on and on about the fantastic touches and 'sparkles' that are part of the decor. Our boys thought the dog treats were so cool and made them wish we had brought our dog. (They even tried them- sorry Moonrise staff.....) The Mom and Dad loved the rooftop bar- great music but quiet enough so that we could talk, and the drinks and service were perfection. The part of town this hotel is situated in gave us a feel for true St. Louis culture. We walked up and down Delmar several times and enjoyed all the character (and characters) we encountered. There are wonderful restaurants, bars, and shops, many of which we thoroughly enjoyed. We are definitely coming back. (Maybe next time without the kids!)I've traveled to the top 40 U.S. cities on business over the past 30-plus years, and have stayed in numerous hotels. I'd read some good things about the Moonrise Hotel in my hometown of St. Louis and thought I'd give it a try on a recent pleasure trip (in early July of this year).To me, it's about the little things. Neatly and smartly appointed guest rooms, prompt, pleasant, knowledgeable and welcoming check-in staffers and room service, good, full-service hotel restaurants--not to mention people who demonstrate that they care about what they do. The Moonrise gets five stars in all categories.  The hotel is a class act--especially Crystal, who is an exemplary employee and an absolute credit to the hospitality profession.My only issue during my four-day stay was the white man on the elevator who invited my guest to ride up to ""his floor"" and keep him company, when she'd left our room to greet a friend in the lobby and forgotten her room key. I'm not sure if he was a hotel executive (since he claimed to have an entire floor), or a guest himself, but I found that quite insulting and unsettling as did she, of course.The incident, and the idea that there might be a predator in our midst and/or on the executive staff, certainly tempered the remainder of our stay. Add to that the constant, pulsating noise coming from the rooftop bar until the wee hours of the morning and the bar patrons who loudly spilled into the hallways from it, and that pretty much captures my only turn-offs.  Really, truly nice place otherwise, and a welcome departure from the norm.An interesting boutique hotel with a theme based on moon : with plenty of trinkets and objects of art to admire. However it is overpriced for what it is. Elevators are small, too few and too slow. The guests' comfort is obviously secondary to making money. Not enough light in shower or in room itself. Would benefit from service elevator so that guests don't have to ride with cleaning mops in their faces.I had the pleasure of spending an evening in a Jacuzzi King during a recent concert at The Pageant, and I have to admit I was very surprised with the quality of the hotel. Everything is amazing and every little detail is treated with the highest quality. The bathroom is very spacious and the jacuzzi tub is extremely relaxing, but to top it off I happened to be booked in the only room with a top of the line massage chair. I didn't want to leave the hotel, the chair was amazing.  Overall the decor of the hotel is very tasteful, and decorated with a classy space theme, in fact when you turn off the lights you even see stars on the ceiling. I didn't have a chance to try the rooftop bar but have been before and it offers a great experience.Very nice hotel. Well managed, friendly staff. It's not a fancy, but the rooms are clean, beds comfortable, nice toiletries. Some people don't really notice, but I think it makes a big difference to have a professional, fast thinking, coutreous staff. Extra nice to have the rooftop views from the open air and indoor bar/lounge.  Restaurant downstairs is decent and offers room service. Parking in back is free. There is no pool, no free breakfast, etc., but for the price this is a very nice hotel.Amazing rooftop bar and restaurant! I'm totally a fan.New to St. Louis, I read a column where the Cocktail Ambassador suggested Eclipse for the bartender and rooftop area.  Ok, I'll check it out, and BAM... super score!Summer nights in St. louis are perfect, so get yourself out to enjoy them here in the Loop up and above it all.  With a view of the Arch, I very much enjoyed looking around the city from above and enjoying the fresh summer breeze.  The large spinning moon and funky decor sat well with me.  It was my birthday and I had no idea what I wanted, the bartender mixed up a bourbon cocktail and boy did it hit the spot and set the tone for a fantastic evening.  I highly recommend the rooftop area for a great time.  Somehow the rooftop construction and wind tunneling makes hot weather feel perfect and perfect weather feel even more perfect.The hummus is tasty to snack on while sipping and enjoying outside.I really was looking forward to visiting this hotel after reading all of the awesome reviews, and unfortunately I don't have  a huge desire to return anytime soon.First the good.  Good, vibrant location with some good restaurants, coffee shops and some retail.  The staff was extremely nice and very dog friendly.  The hotel is clean and offered many amenities.The not so goods.  Loud ass hotel.  I don't need shady acres quiet, but I also don't want frat party central.  Both nights of our stay we could hear people in the halls crazy loud thoughout the entire night.  Night two we could hear the DJ's low bass thumping from the roof top deck.  My partner witnessed the elevators door opening to a guy puking as he was trying to take our pooch out for his night time duties.  He let the doors close and took the stairs down.  It's great to have a thriving reception business, but they haven't found the  balance of a good solid hotel experience and banquet business quite yet, at least not the nights we were there.  Any comments about the noise seemed to fall on deaf ears.The room was ok.  It was clean with a comfortable bed, but attention to details were somewhat lacking.  The bathroom was very basic and the plastic shower floor was a little dingy.  Nothing bad but also nothing great.For the room rates and the experience, I have much better hotels in STL that I will happily return to on our next visit.Love this place. Great location, beautifully appointed and Dave chihuly glass work in the lobby ! Staff are nice and I ran into the Isley Brothers in the elevator.This is a nice hotel--would be perfect for anybody either from St. Louis, and especially someone who is not from St. Louis and is looking for a nice upscale but not pretentious place to stay, with all the Delmar Loop attractions within walking distance. The staff was very friendly, and they have private-lot valet parking for $17. The rooftop lounge is a really neat bonus--a place to hang out with a date or with friends. The rooms were also clean, modern, and comfortable. Not what I would call a bargain price-wise (plan on about $200 for a single room) but everything was well worth it. Would recommend.I'm a big fan of the Moonrise. The rooms are comfortable and stylish. It's in a great location. The rooftop bar is fun. And I think one of the best things about the Moonrise Hotel (other than the super cozy beds of course) is the artwork. It's all moon-related and so, so cool.The staff was friendly, the Wi-Fi was strong, the rooms were affordable. Really, you couldn't ask for much more from a hotel!","The Moonrise Hotel is a unique AAA Four Diamond hotel in the Delmar Loop neighborhood of St. Louis. Upon walking in the entrance, you are greeted with friendly, helpful staff, and surrounded with a colorful changing neon staircase and moon-themed decor everywhere.  This tastefully designed boutique hotel has a lot of character with distinct cosmic flair. The rooms are comfortable and well-maintained. Bring your beloved dog or cat to this pet-friendly hotel and he or she will be pampered and warmly received! Don't forget to indulge in food and drinks at the Rooftop Terrace Bar. The Arch is visible in the distance of the STL backdrop. This is a nice, upscale, non-pretentious place to enjoy a a view of St. Louis against the sunset and stars. The Moonrise Hotel is a fun place and I would recommend staying here to explore ""One of the Great 10 Streets in America""!This place is tied with another hotel at the top of my list for Favorite Hotels I've Ever Been To. Our room was gorgeous, the hotel itself is gorgeous. Everything is so well thought out and beautifully decorated/designed.Our room was also exceptionally clean, and honestly I didn't doubt it would be, simply based on how everything else looked too. The lobby isn't the faux luxury that most places try to impress on you, only to give you a run-of-the-mill room. This place is classy &amp; fancy on all fronts.I really enjoyed all of the small touches about our room too:* The noise machine was awesome, since my husband and I always sleep with some sort of background noise and find it hard to fall asleep in dead silence.* The iHome alarm clock.* Love that it had a mini-fridge in the room, that was a big plus.* It was a quiet room too.* The easy plugins on top of the desk/tv table.* Glass doors for the shower (no grimy shower curtain here!)If given the chance, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.This place was the Best! We stayed a couple of weekends ago and I still have a smile on my face. My boyfriend and I were having a staycation to celebrate his birthday. Not only did they set us up in an amazing room facing Delmar Loop, they left an incredibly kind birthday card, signed by all of the staff with comp drink tickets. We had dinner reservations and got to enjoy the sunset and delicious cocktails on their rooftop bar before before dinner. There are so many top notch restaurants right down the street as well as a live music venue. Their customer service, location and beautiful rooms made for a really wonderful stay. We will definitely be back!!Great experience. Staff was very friendly. Restaurants were good. Rooftop Bar was awesome. Room was beautiful.This hotel was very modern and comfortable.  The service was EXCELLENT, the location was great: safe, easy to get to, nearby lots of eateries, shopping, and close to a major university campus.  The city is VERY pet-friendly and so is this hotel.  I intend on taking my furry friend with me the next time I vacation here.  I felt very safe here, even after dark.  The room price was a tad pricey, even with a Triple A discount, quoted at $172/night for the room we had booked.  Overall, it was great!  Room service was quick and easy, too.We didn't stay here but we loved the rooftop bar. It is definitely one of my favorite bars of all time for atmosphere. It was very causal and relaxing. Beautiful and great views!Two reviews--we had our room block here for our wedding and our wedding day after brunch here.  Both merit five star reviews!Room Block:Planning our wedding from Seattle, with guests coming from both coasts, we needed a hotel block that would accommodate a lot of guests at a good price point and would give them a proper welcome to St. Louis (and the Loop in particular).  The Moonrise met and exceeded our expectations on almost every level.  They offered us an extremely affordable rate, allowed us to expand our room block beyond the normal limit, and even allowed additional guests beyond that limit to take advantage of the rate despite the fact that we were booking for an extremely busy holiday weekend.  All of our guests raved about the hotel, the amenities, the price, the location, and the staff.  One particular perk that we had not anticipated is that the Eclipse Restaurant downstairs is never full, open very late, and has amazingly patient bartenders. Our group took over that bar every night of the three day weekend, and loved it.  We already loved the Moonrise for our visits to St. Louis, and now love it even more for the amazing service it provided us our wedding weekend.Brunch:We hosted our wedding day after brunch at the New Moon Room at the Moonrise Hotel.  Leading up to the brunch, the staff was great to work with.  They helped us plan a primarily vegetarian brunch menu, and even allowed us to switch from the rooftop to the New Moon Room (which opens onto the roof) when we saw that we were expecting extremely hot and humid weather that day.  That morning, the staff was great and patient, and the food was delicious.  They even, at our request, set up a bloody mary garnish bar, and our hungover guests were very appreciative.  The coordinator that morning was extremely helpful, even making sure that I (as the hostess) had an opportunity to eat during the event.  The room is so cutely decorated, and upon our request for a 'casual' feel, they set it up bistro style for us so that there were would be a good opportunity for mingling.  At the end of it, they even packed up all the leftover food and let us and our guests mingle around for another few hours on the roof soaking up the sun until we all had to catch our flights.  We chose the venue based on convenience since our wedding block was at the Moonrise, and it was a great choice because they exceeded our expectations and put on a great event.Listen, the hotel itself is great. It's clean and up-to-date. But the room service is by far the worst thing I've ever come across in my life. It took an hour and a half to get to my room, which is fine if they hadn't told me it would be up in 30. We ordered french toast (it showed up burnt and with NO syrup), grilled cheese (hard as a rock and freezing. Actually couldn't eat it because it hurt my mouth), two caesar salads, and a coke (that never came). I'm not a picky eater. My boyfriend actually gets mad at me for having such low food standards. So for me to say food is disgusting basically means rats wouldn't eat it.The End :)Just kidding...There was no mooning. You just got tricked and they were an all around treat to stay at. Happy Halloween!My husband and I were in town for a wedding and we stayed at the Moonrise Hotel.  We loved this place!  Very nice staff, good size rooms, big comfortable bed and charming design plus it's close to all sorts of cool shops, cafes and Forest Park.  I would recommend this spot to anyone visiting and if we ever find ourselves back in St. Louis again we'll definitely stay here.This is a pretty cool place. the place is clean, and sleek, and a feast for the eyes. The staff was attentive and friendly from the moment I parked my car to check in. The rooms are clean and comfortable. We had a great night sleep.Delmar Loop in U-City is a great place at night. If you want to eat great foods and drink great beers/wines, this is the spot for the hip with a little $$. A really nice neighborhood. I am sorry my mom has moved from the area so I now do not have as much access to the U-City area. Alas. The area keeps getting livelier and livelier.I give this place 4 out of 5 because we didn't get the opportunity to check out any amenities the bar offered (namely the two bars, one rooftop). The next time we come through St. Louis we will seek out the Moonrise Hotel and stay here.This place is a real find!  My family had a wonderful time at this hotel!  It was a true treat.  The room was fantastic - comfortable bed, great decor (hip and stylish), a wonderful rain shower, spacious and clean!  The staff was what really made our visit special.  The valet attendant gave us some great restaurant recommendations - he was so nice.  And the front desk staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful.  They treated my son so sweetly too - giving him little treasures from tattoo stickers to key cards.  We will most definitely stay again next time we are visiting!  We're grateful we found the place!Also, I'm allergic to dogs and cats and was concerned about it being a pet friendly hotel, but the cleaning crew must do a great job because I didn't have any problems at all!headed to St. Louis for a little getaway with my mom and 21-month-old son for two nights. found a groupon for this hotel and with my son's love of the moon at the moment, it seemed like a perfect fit.we arrived around 5pm and were warmly welcomed by the entire staff. even though the groupon was for a king room, they upgraded us to two queens for no extra charge. the deal also came with valet parking and a $25 food credit that could be used at any time in the hotel, even for room service.the room was spacious and comfortable. the free wifi was a great perk as was the iPod deck, that allowed my little guy to sleep a little better.the first morning, we decided to call up for room service. the $25 was more than enough to feed us all with coffee and juice and even a few leftovers. it was all delicious - everything came directly from the Eclipse restaurant.the only negative came when we returned that evening to discover our room had not been turned down. normally I wouldn't care, but there were dirty diapers in the bathroom trashcan. when we called to notify them, they were very apologetic and asked what they could do.the following morning, we had breakfast in the Eclipse restaurant. the food was great and they were so kind and accommodating to my little guy.especially bringing him a bowl full of fresh berries (which he devoured) instead of the melon that usually is overflowing in a fruit cup.I absolutely loved the area the hotel was in and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. when we were leaving, I noticed piles of pumpkins by the drive into the hotel. they were for a community event. how fun that would have been for our little guy if only we were there a few more days.as if this review wasn't long enough... I discovered almost a week later that I didn't have a wallet where I kept a few cards/bills/receipts. I called the hotel and they put me in touch with housekeeping. They took my name, number and info and told me they would get back to me as soon as they had a chance to look. They called me back the next day to let me know they had discovered it and got my info to send it back to me. A few days later, it arrived in a FedEx envelope. How often does that actually happen?I am already looking forward to returning to St. Louis with my husband and will definitely be staying at the Moonrise.Had holiday lunch there with about 20.  Food, Drinks and Service was ok, nothing special.  Ambiance kitchsy, but nothing too interesting.  Maybe I'm just not cool enough to appreciate.  The bill left me feeling like I had been roofied and molested.  I will never return.For me, this was a great place to celebrate my 50th birthday.  I am in the Loop more than any other area so it was an appropriate place to be.  The rooftop bar always has a fun cool vibe, the best view of the Loop, especially at sunset.  I am being a bit generous too on this night because service could have been friendlier and the food better so it can be a hit and miss, but on this night, it was a great time.  Get there by 7 and seating should not be a problem (I was there on a Friday).  Come much later, even with the new west roof addition, you may be out of luck, but still go.Moonrise is horrible stay somewhere else. Terrible cusotmer service, rooms are nothing to write home about.  Rude management. We won't be back.I really, really, really wanted to love this hotel, but it failed on so many levels.  I used to live a few blocks away and was very excited to have the opportunity to stay here for my bachelorette party.We had booked a suite and 2 double-queen rooms for everyone to stay in for one evening.  In advance of the stay, I called the hotel to inquire whether there are mini fridges in the rooms.  I was told the suite definitely had one but for the regular rooms, some of them had mini fridges and some did not.  I asked if they could put a request in the computer to make sure all 3 rooms were on the same floor, and (if possible) to have mini-fridge rooms for the doubles.When we pulled up to the overhang by the front door of the hotel, it happened to be pouring rain and we had a lot of luggage and crap in our car.  The valet was really rude to me and wanted me to park about 20 yards away and make about 6 trips (yes that's how much ""stuff"" we had) in the torrential downpour, despite the fact that there were hardly any other cars around / waiting to pull up and check in - we were not obstructing traffic or other guests in any way.First problem:  We all showed up around 5:00 pm to check in.  Check in time is 4 pm. One of the rooms was NOT ready, and my friends that were staying in that room had to hang out in the suite for almost an hour before housekeeping had it ready (2 hrs past check in time) which delayed our evening schedule significantly.  4 pm is already a late check-in time to begin with and they didn't even have the room ready!Second problem:  One of the double rooms was on a different floor than the suite and the second double room.  Normally this would be only a minor inconvenience, but because of their elevator key system, you can only get off the elevator on the floor you are staying at.  So whenever my friends in the room on the diff't floor came to the suite, we all had to ride the elevator down the lobby, then ride it back up together to the floor where my suite was.  I understand they do this for security purposes, but they REALLY need to honor requests to put a single booking on the same freaking floor.  What if it was a set of 2 kids/teenagers that got put on a different floor than their parents room?  (Not to mention, neither of the doubles had mini fridges.)Third problem:  apparently house keeping and management just can't keep it together because our suite only had 1 robe instead of 2.  I noticed as soon as we got in the room and called to ask for a second robe.  They said the laundry was still going. ?!?  By the time the second person got out of the shower, we still had not received the robe.Fourth problem:  The living room area of the suite only has 2 sources of light (at night when there's no window light): track lighting over the table, and then an arc floor lamp in the opposite corner over the couch.  Our lamp didn't work and it was super dark in there when we were trying to hang out.  We made multiple calls to maintenance and they came up and checked it and did nothing.  Finally after the third call they brought us a new (different lamp.)Fifth problem: One of the suites had been booked using a Groupon deal that came with a $25 gift card to the restaurant, which they forgot to give us at check in and then later brought up to the room AFTER we had already gone to the bar &amp; restaurant.  Thanks for nothing.Sixth problem:  One of the hotel staff came and knocked on the room door at 10 pm (mind you this is SATURDAY NIGHT in the CITY) and complained about noise.  We were only a few girls talking and hanging out and playing music from one of those little dinky portable battery-powered speakers.  And it's 10 pm !!! Are you kidding me?  If you are the person with a sleeping child that complained about noise you may want to re-think your choice of accommodations, because a hotel that caters to a bar-filled area next to a music venue and has 2 bars open til 3 am. is not the place for your child or for your weirdo-goes-to-bed-at-9-pm-on-saturday-night self.On the way out the next morning, we had the (dis)pleasure of dealing with the rude valet again.I neither saw nor heard anything about any of the features some of the other guests mention, such as concierge, massage chair, or being treated like royalty.  Aside from the valet, the staff was nice but the entire place is run poorly.They really  need to hire some new management to hopefully get this beautiful hotel on its feet.  It's really disappointing as one of the only nice hotels in the loop area, and with a really cool concept and decor to boot.  I don't think I'll ever be staying here again unless things improve.I used to live in STL and was back in town for business. Loved staying at the Moonrise. Everyone was so nice, the rooms were great - bathrooms are spectacular - and it was really quiet while I slept at night. The art in the hotel cracks me up. Very fun. Plus, there's a rooftop bar! with a view of the arch! Love love love it.The Delmar loop are is interesting. Transitional. Undergoing gentrification. That being said, there are some amazing bars, restaurants, and shops in the area. AND you can drive to all the great attractions in STL easily. If there's a pool onsite, I didn't see it. So that would be the one downside for me, but I'm never in town to swim/layout so I don't mind. Easy walk (~15 minutes) to Wash U or a quick drive. If you're here on a college visit I recommend this hotel. Plus, Wash U is building brand new lofts/housing just down the street so you'll be able to see another side of the university.Very hip hotel, nice accommodations for a low January price. Loved the Delmar Loop location! The Eclipse restaurant was great, especially the cocktails that were part of the restaurant foyer and the New Moon Room on the rooftop (the Michigan Pimm's, White Winter Fizz, and Sunshine &amp; Bubbles cocktails were great). The decor in the hotel lobby was cool, and the same goes for the room (loved the stars on the ceiling when the lights are off - neat little surprise). Some of the fixtures were a little worn or rusty, but it's kind of what I expect in a boutique hotel. Wish the bathroom had a fan. Otherwise, no other complaints. It was a great stay!We gave been staying in Clayton's area hotels for the past few years when visited St Louis. My wife recently learned about Moonrise Hotel in the Loop area, I made reservation over the Thanksgiving holidays and I will not go back to any other hotels for our future visits. The hotel staff is professional, courteous and very helpful. The room is nicely decorated, we don't eat at the restaurant on site, this I cannot rate it. My only complaint is that the lighting in the room and bathroom is a bit too dim,  if the hotel could remediate that, I will give it a 5 - star.","This was my second stay at the Moonrise, and the first time bringing my dog (a Boston Terrier). I got a great deal via Groupon, which included restaurant credit. The food and service was great. Pricing is reasonable, too, and room service when we arrived was fast. My dog had a blast (as did my sister and I). The room was clean, cute, and comfortable. Location is great for shopping. The only ""ding"" I have is that the walls are pretty thin, which means I heard every graphic detail of a guest argument in the next room. Friendliest hotel staff I've ever encountered. I look forward to staying there again when I'm back in St. Louis and highly recommend the Moonrise for a fun, affordable, pet-friendly getaway.We had a wonderful stay while visiting  Washington university. I highly recommend staying here. The Delmar loop has tons of restaurant , shops and galleries to browse. The hotel is about .6 miles to the forest park with the art museum and zoo. If it isn't too hot these are walking distance. The banana bread in the restaurant is exceptionally good so have breakfast there!This was our third visit in the last 4 years.   i was looking forward to the stay but was disappointed to discover the venue is a bit tired.   Both our queen beds were soft saggy mushHands down, my favorite hotel in which I've ever stayed. Comfort, customer service and unique touches are all definitely 5 star. Let's talk.Comfort: Oh. My. God. First of all, my room was HUGE. I have stayed in rooms that are easily half the size of this. Ample space to lay out your stuff and get comfortable. I'm fairly certain the king size bed is stuffed with freshly plucked  baby angel's wings. And you know what? I'm OK with the mutilation of thousands of baby angels if it means I get to sleep this soundly. Finally, the bathroom (which again is huge) has an incredibly relaxing rain shower and the bath stuffs they give you are  pleasant to both the body and nose. I found myself taking very long showers. Good thing I'm not paying the bill.Customer Service: My incoming flight was unfortunately cancelled, and I was given the options of arriving in STL either VERY early, or VERY late. Seeing as I was a business trip, my choice was obvious. Cue to me showing up at the front desk of Moonrise at 8 AM, stinky, hungover and just wanting a shower and a bite to eat. The kind woman at the hotel graciously allowed me into a room VERY early, something she certainly didn't have to do. At breakfast at their restaurant Eclipse (which clearly deserves its own review) I had phenomenal service. I managed restaurants for years, and I would gladly have her on my staff...um, not like that. Wow that sounded bad.....Anyhoo, she anticipated my needs, was very friendly and just a damn great waitress. I can't recall her name, so I'll just say she was the blonde woman working on the morning of 2/24/2012. Might I add that the prices at Eclipse are reasonable, and don't shoot up for room service. Room service at regular restaurant prices? Priceless.Upon checkout I was again greeted by an incredibly friendly and helpful clerk. He offered up his card, suggesting that if I ever needed help finding something in STL that he'd be glad to assist. For a place that doesn't have a concierge, he was certainly acting the part. I also slightly overslept and checked out (I think) 30 minutes late, and he didn't even bat an eye.  Good people work here.The personal touches are where Moonrise Hotel really (moon)shines. First of all, this place is owned by a rich guy with a serious moon fetish. Moon/retro sci fi stuff is EVERYWHERE. I love the vintage pictures on the walls, calling back to a time when the moon was this romantic yet equally mysterious concept. Even taking the steps up to the 2nd level is some sort of sci-fi spaceship moment. The minibar is one of the more interesting that I've come across. I can't say that I've ever stayed in a hotel that offers fancy gummy bears (and a coworker totally made that her breakfast one day). This place has free wi-fi. NOBODY has free wi-fi! And one last thing. This hotel just smells good. Whatever candles you burn, I considered stealing them. OK, so I was drunk and that would have been a bad decision, but stumbling to my room last night...i contemplated grabbing that delicious smelling candle and sneaking it back home with me. All-in-all, this is by far the most impressive hotel experience I've had in years. I want to have to travel to STL all the time, just so that I can keep making my company put me up at the Moonrise.What a neat and nostalgic place to visit. Upon walking through the doors you see the stairs to the left that light up in all the colors of the rainbow. Head to the right and head to the elevator and you can start to see some of the neat ""space"" themed toys and memorabilia encased into the walls, definitely check those out before hopping on the elevator to the top where you can relax &amp; enjoy a cocktail while taking out the views of St. Louis. They have super cool crescent moon chairs and other couches and tables to sit at. A perfect place to be on a cool summer night. You can spot this place from afar as they have a solar powered moon that rotates at the top. Go check it out!!Stayed last night and I have to say it was great hotel and reasonably priced.  The staff was extremely nice and was in walking distance of several stores and places to eat.Surprised my wife for our 21st anniversary here. Beautiful hotel in the heart of The Loop. Right next door to lots of entertainment options. Really swanky kind of place! Very comfortable beds. Didn't get to the restaurant, but everything was very nice!We've stayed three times at this lovely hotel and left impressed every time. I could gush about the decor, the service, the food, the comfort, the cleanliness and even the gym. But I will let the five star rating say it all instead. Kudos Joe Edwards!We were treated like royalty here, as were our two dogs! This hotel was super pet friendly, they provided a dog bed, bowls, and treats for my dogs and only charge us $50 for the both of them.  I room was nice and beds were comfy. The only real down side to our stay was the bathroom echoed, so when you used the restroom everyone ""heard"" what you were doing. Other then that this place is amazing!  I also love the location: close to the metro train (we took it to see the arch), down the street from our concert venue, and across the street from nice restaurants.WE WILL BE BACK!I stayed one night at this hotel and was pleasantly surprised with the hospitality from every employee I spoke with, starting with the lady who walked outside to my car when I pulled up for valet, to tell me the valet would be with me shortly. The front desk employee have me several suggestions on where to go for entertainment and even food specialties on the Del Mar strip. I will stay here again.Great stay. Very glad we chose this hotel. It's in a great location. Close to eateries. The room was well equipped - free WiFi was great. The beds were so comfy and thermostat worked well. We eat several meals at the hotel's Restarant- the Eclipse - great food. The rooftop bar is wonderful. The decor is soooo detailed - very geometric.  Will stay here again for sure.We had a good 2 night stay here and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel.  Being right on the Loop is definitely a plus.  Even though we had a car it was nice to be able to walk to so many shops and restaurants.  The staff is courteous and responsive to requests.  We didn't encounter any problems at all during our stay.Stayed here last night in a superior double queen room. There's free self parking in the back but it apparently fills up on weekends and such so theres $16 overnight valet too. The front desk clerk Rodrigo was super nice and helpful even though we were checking in at 2am. The whole hotel was themed after the moon and space as was the room. Everything was clean and comfortable and the fitness and business center looked more than adequate. Lastly the hotel is in a cool location in the Delmar loop and has easy access to downtown on the metro if you want to see the gateway arch and Busch stadium like we didWinner winner chicken dinner. Possibly my favorite hotel in the entire mid-west. Fantastic rooms, great details, great staff, excellent bar and breakfast. Location is unbeatable.""Fly me to the moon(rise)Let me swing among those stars..""My second stay here and I think this is one of my favorite hotels in the country. That's saying a lot as I'm notoriously picky about hotels (see my hotels list).The front desk staff is beyond helpful, welcoming and friendly. I love that they seem to love St. Louis so much and want to point you in the right direction for sightseeing and restaurants. I love that concierge is the ""Master of your every desire."" Come on!! Genius! That bed is seriously the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in in mah life! I found myself thinking that I could live in such a bed. That rain shower is the stuff dreams are made of. And H2O products rock (I'm so finding that salt shower gel online and buying it).And those vintage moon photos everywhere... the cherry on top!!For this price point, the Moonrise has achieved ""as good as it gets"" status in my opinion. I recommend it to all who travel to St. Louis. Note to self: return when the weather is most conducive to rooftop bar dwelling!!Very nice hotel. Got a great rate through Priceline. Everyone was very nice and accommodating. Would stay here again. Like that you have to use your key card in the elevator to get to your floor.The Moonrise is swank, modern, comfortable, and convenient to the Delmar Loop/West End area of St. Louis.  The staff were VERY courteous and cool.  It definitely has a yuppie-hipster hybrid feel, but it is not obnoxious.It is literally two doors down from The Pageant (GREAT LIVE MUSIC VENUE!) which is why I opted for it.  If you are like me and get bored with downtowns of small metro areas, make sure you check out the other neighborhoods, especially ""The Loop.""Although it's a bit strange to stay in a hotel in a city where you used to live, I'm not going to complain one bit about my recent stay at The Moonrise. Seriously, when I got off the plane and into my rental car (another weird feeling, btw), my gut reaction was to head towards Cherokee Street to my old apartment. However, I don't think the people who live there now would appreciate my ""popping in"" to stay for a few days :)But back to The Moonrise. My co-workers have stayed here a handful of times and raved about the rooms as well as the service. Since it was so close to Third Degree Glass Factory (the scene of the crime for our First Burstday Party), it only made sense to make it home base. And nothing about the stay was disappointing.Rooms are huge - almost the same size of my current apartment in Cali. Only a lot nicer! Since I had a mini slumber party on Thursday night with one of my fave gal pals, I requested two Queen beds. And I love the fact that the hotel makes it a point to stay as green as possible. Oh, and you have the choice to self-park or valet, which is super easy either way.  I only stayed two nights and after sleeping on an air mattress for several weeks, the bed was heavenly! And the curtains are super heavy, so if you wanted to sleep in (and I mean SLEEP IN!) it's definitely a possibility. By far the my fun and chic hotel option in STL. If i can't stay at home, then I'd want to stay here!I was in St. Louis for a conference and stayed at the Moonrise hotel for the week.  I had a wonderful stay at the hotel and ate diner once night at the Eclipse restaurant, where the food was wonderful.  The room was clean, had all of the amenities I needed, including a large bathroom and a mini fridge.  All of the staff were wonderful; anything I needed, from maps to toothpaste (which I forgot) they were able to give me.  Everyone was very nice and helpful, and they even let me store my bags there after checkout because my flight was later in the afternoon.  I'm not in St. Louis often, but if I go back, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.We came to this hotel for the location and ease of access to places nearby - delivered as advertised.  There was an event going on the weekend we were there and were told the rooms on the lower floor were quieter than the upper - we got the opposite experience.  The rooms in general are loud and picked up sound very easily.  We could even hear people coming in and out of the elevator at night.  We were disappointed that the room only had a morning room service menu with no other welcome information or menus in the room.  Unfortunately, the moon lounge on their roof was closed the majority of the time we were there for private events.  Good one time experience.","['attended', 'wedding', 'reception', 'new', 'moon', 'room', 'access', 'rooftop', 'sliding', 'glass', 'doors', 'open', 'glorious', 'setting', 'breeze', 'wafting', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-regency-st-louis-at-the-arch-saint-louis-2,Hyatt Regency St. Louis at the Arch,3.5,$$$,240,"Hands down the best customer service that I've experienced at a hotel. We drove in from New Orleans in the middle of the night and arrived at the hotel well before check in...wasn't a problem because although the hotel was almost at capacity from a conference they accommodated us for early arrival. As I mentioned we were one of few rooms who were staying at the hotel that were not registered for the conference, but we didn't notice. Anything we needed to be brought up to the room was there in record timing. The staff here was wonderful. And the view of the arch from the room was amazing! I wouldn't recommend you staying anywhere in St. Louis but here!My hubby and I stayed here over Valentine's Day weekend. When we arrived at 3p, the garage self-park was already full/closed. Valet is $32, so that wasn't an option for us. Instead, we parked in another garage next door.Our room had a view of the Arch which was fun, even despite the awful construction going on. The layout of the room seemed kinda different...there was an extra large closet-space (I don't know what else to call it...). It had a safe, ironing board and a large comfy chair. Then, the main part of the room was kind of long, the bed at one end, TV and desk at the other end, with a big, comfy chair awkwardly in between.Everything was very clean and comfortable and we had an enjoyable stay. But I'm not quite sure that the price is worth the parking hassle and not overly amazing room.I had a great stay while in the area for a work conference. Check in and check out was very efficient and easy, despite the very late and very early hours that I arrived and departed. I was particularly appreciative of the number of eating options the hotel had in the lobby since my conference lasted the entire day and finding dinner was as easy as walking down to the lobby and taking my pick of the four options of eateries. I'm specifically writing this review however to remark on the concierge services of Darryl. I joked with him that he appeared to work 24 hours a day for the entire week I was there, since I definitely utilized his services at different hours throughout my stay. He was friendly, approachable, professionally, yet very personable. His recommendations for where to dine and places to visit were spot-on and I am so appreciative of his service. Thank you to Darryl, and the Hyatt Regency for making my stay a memorable one. I will definitely be staying here again in the future.Was here not even a week ago for one night. PARKING - I recently went to Nashville where people were complaining about the $24 valet parking for the Embassy Suites downtown (and there was a considerably cheaper option right across the street). The Hyatt has a marginally cheaper option, but valet will run you $30. Which is crazy. Especially since at the Embassy in Nashville you don't have to go to the garage to pick up your car when you want to leave. Just out the hotel door. At the Hyatt, you have to go down to the garage. Which I find odd. ROOMS - I have been here twice and both rooms had a view of the arch. This time I was on the 14th floor and I could see it from the bed. The beds are stiffer. But that's personal preference.  I wasn't paying attention when I booked and somehow wound up with two full size beds. Yep, not a king or two queens but two full size. When my mother found out she said, ""full sized beds went out when Carol and Mike Brady were no longer on tv."" While I am not old enough to verify that i can say I have never seen full size beds in a hotel before.Only thing I can figure is its because the rooms are smallOTHER: Starbucks and good food options in the hotel. Business center to print stuff off. Long list of things they will bring you to borrow (if you forgot something) or have complimentary. Didn't need to make use of the list, but it's a nice touch and had a long list of items.Nothing but good things to say about this place, really.Fantastic location and staff. Everyone was really helpful. Our TV wasn't working and they were in our room within a matter of minutes fixing it. It's a nice hotel and as such, you have to pay for some of the extras - parking, baggage service, etc. They won't let you grab a luggage cart and do it yourself either. Valet was a bit pricey.We got a fantastic deal through a third-party website with a ""secret deal."" Ended up staying here on a Sat/Sun for a very reasonable rate. The arch is literally right outside the hotel. Walking distance to the ballpark, casino, Edward Jones Dome, etc. You really don't even need a car. Obviously if you want to venture out further, you will, but there's plenty to do within a half mile or so. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future and if I'm ever in town, I'll probably seek this place out.The definition of the hotels name holds true. Our entire stay was pleasant from the curbside valet to checking out. Plenty of front desk personnel were available to check in guests. The great customer service made the check in process smooth. There are 2 restaurants on site , it's also attached to an enterprise and Starbucks. The room we got was spacious, had upgraded fixtures (I love the faucet and sink) and had a great view (see pics). Now I'll admit although our experience here was relaxing &amp; pleasant , I had no plans to write a review. This evening my friend's vehicle was burglarized at a local restaurant's parking lot. We originally planned to eat then check out at the hotel and take the 2 hr drive back to our base. After the unfortunate event we decided we needed to recoup &amp; clear out heads and the hotel extended our checkout until 5 pm. This might not seem like a big deal but to us it was a very generous act as late check out is usually till 1pm. I am very grateful for the act of kindness on the hotel's part. If we are ever visiting the downtown area again, we will be staying here.On my last visit I looked longingly at this hotel, as it looks nice on the inside and outside, had better food than at the hotel I was staying at, and seemed like the hotel I should have booked in the first place.So a couple weeks later, I was on a plane back to downtown St. Louis with a reservation for the night.This was the first Hyatt I've stayed in in a good while, and they set the customer service bar pretty high. Not long after booking my reservation online, I received an e-mail from someone at the hotel welcoming me to the property and attaching a fact sheet as to how to get there and such. It was personally addressed and from a real employee. The night before I was to arrive, I got another automated e-mail with some of the same information.From the moment the cab drops you off through check-in, the service is attentive. The staff seems happy to be there. The room was a little small, but in excellent condition - lighting is bright, the bathroom has modern fixtures, everything is clean, there's no marks or nicks in the walls. My room had a great view of the arch.Food-wise, Red has a good breakfast buffet but it doesn't start until 7 AM. You can order off the menu if you need to get going earlier. Dinner here was also very good, but the restaurant isn't open very late. If you arrive after 8, you'll be eating in the Brewhouse. Brewhouse has passable BBQ (most people will think it's great, but I'm a Texas BBQ snob) and an excellent selection of local draft beers.Checkout was fast and friendly. The WiFi worked when I needed it to work. The hotel is modern and clean. There's a lot to like about this Hyatt. Being on the road all the time can be a grind, but the service I received made me not mind being on the road.Located right between the Gateway Arch and the Old Courthouse, very conveniently near to everything downtown. Busch Stadium is just a few blocks away as well.On our first night, we were given a room that was less then adequate, with virtually no view. The plumbing, we learned later, was leaking down to the room below us every time we flushed our toilet. After finally being notified by maintenance, that this was going on at around 11:30 PM, we were soon reassured that they now had everything under control. But by morning, there was frantic knocking at our door and we were asked to relocate to another room, ASAP; rather gruffly. I had to set a couple of the maintenance guys straight that if they hadn't fixed the problem the night before, though reassuring us that it was under control, that I didn't appreciate their attitude now. Needless to say, their demeanors soon changed to a much more polite and pleasant ""yes sir"", ""sorry sir"". Our next room was a much more pleasant upgrade. Don't take my meekness for weakness!But overall, a fairly nice stay...in spite of a few mishaps.Beds could be a bit softer but that is personal preference.Overall, nice hotel, clean, friendly staff.If you forgot something, you can call the staff for numerous things including slippers, woolite, make up/nail polish remover, and hair spray.We got here tonight and were greeted with great service. They immediately checked us into a room and accommodated our special requests. They went above and beyond. We got to our room and it was immaculate. GREAT views of the arch and the Mississippi River. Can't wait to wake up to this tomorrow. If only we could stay longer! Have been on the fence about joining their reward program as the husband and I have been shopping several hotel options and I think we were just won over. Looking forward to many more Regency stays, hopefully more here in STL! Thanks to Nick for his service at the front desk. Again, highly recommended.was friendly and helpful from the time i arrived at Valet till i left.  Walking distance from Arch, near the casino's (likely should take a cab) and you must visit the hill for Italian food while you are in St. Louis, the best anywhere.  Be careful out walking around as downtwon is not the safest place in America.They also have a Ruth Chris steak house on property, i did not eat there, but a nice option if you so wish.We booked this property because of the location, the hopeful view of the river and the Arch and the price. We were in town for less than 36 hours for a funeral and this hotel was a dream come true during our down time there.  We LOVED the staff. I mean, happy, happy people - truly sincere and genuinely happy! As a customer service worker I was dazzled by this team. Every person. Nice. Smiling. Eye contact. Happy. Polite. Gracious. We are breakfast on site and it was as good as hotel breakfast gets. Omelets, waffles, granola, yogurt, cereal, awesome coffee, three kinds of sausage, bacon, fruit, pastries.... $16.95. Snap. Post funeral we knew we had to eat, were exhausted and remembered Ruth's Chris Steak House was onsite. It was great and they didn't make us feel like a burden 10:30. We left at 11:15 on a Saturday night. The hotel rooms that we got were on a high floor, amazing view and very clean. The toiletries were so nice and now in hindsight I am bummed I didn't take mine.The hotel is very beautiful but a bit expensive we prepaid for our room but did not know it would be a $100 hold charge on the card until you check out the hotel has everything at your convenience but it's a bit pricey so be prepared to do a little spending as well as no pool.This was the second time I had ever stayed at a Hyatt, and I was blown away! The lobby was gorgeous! Decked out in marble and chandeliers. There was a couple high end restaurants, a Starbucks and a gift shop located there too! Not only was the staff friendly but they were able to upgrade us to a corner suite on the top floor with epic views of the Arch and city ! The room was extremely spacious and clean as well as the bathroom! The room had everything you needed and if you forgot something at home like slippers or a toothbrush, you could just call the front desk! I wish we stayed here longer but we only had the room for one night. I would 100 percent stay here again and now I want to stay at Hyatts every time I travel !Dated rooms, poor Wifi connection. Room not clean properly, carpet disgusting, dust on TV, dust in A/C vents, years of dust behind TV. Could do better job in bathroom. Rooms in need of renovation. 2-stars because location is nice and staff friendly but this is not enough to stay in this hotel. If I was staying in a motel then the rooms would have been ok but Not for Hyatt! Btw, my room no. 1287 if you want to start fixing the problems.Have stayed here a few times for business and this was the first time for pleasure. Nice, but small, room and very comfortable bed. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Very nice on premises 24 hour gym.  During check-in they try to up sell you a room with an arch view for $50 additional.  Not worth it to me.  We found a parking garage 2 blocks away for $6 a night, much better than the $25 per night the Hyatt charges (or $32 for valet).  Got a great deal via one of the internet travel companies (the one that uses the traveling gnome as their spokesman).  We got the room for $57 ($17 additional in taxes).  It was one of their ""hidden until you pay"" 4 star hotels.  So we ended up paying about 1/3 the regular rate. Great deal!  It was during a weekend when the Cubs were in town to play the Cardinals so I was very surprised we could get that price.This is a four star hotel that I would love to visit again. The staff is friendly and hotel is neat and clean. The gym is large and the restaurants in the lobby are great. I love the Starbucks that is located on the first floor also.After reading some of the reviews, I was a little skeptical of the hotel, but I must say, my fears were unfounded.  I really really like this hotel!The room I received was totally clean top to bottom.  The room had a modern, comfortable decor, with stone countertops and great amenities in the bathroom.  I am very sensitive to smell, and there was no smell, smoke or otherwise, just a nice fresh room with a view of the city outside.  Everyone I came into contact at the hotel was friendly and professional.  If I were to nitpick a little, it would at the parking.  As others have mentioned, it is relatively expensive at just over $30 a night for valet now, and slightly less for self park.  You must understand that this hotel occupies some of the most prime real estate in the entire city, (and probably the state), so parking anywhere near here costs a premium.   I would recommend this hotel, and stay here again.  If you are new to St. Louis and haven't seen the Gateway Arch, it really is across the street.  The hotel also has a rooftop terrace where you can view the Arch in one of the coolest settings.Everything looked more or less tidy when entering into my room. However, there was too much down feathers and dust in the sheets. It's particularly bad especially since I'm allergic to dust. There were also some stains that I saw on the blanket too. The beds though were pretty comfortable otherwise though. For the bathroom, they give bar soap which I personally don't really like so I got room service to bring us some shower gel too. For some reason, our sink didn't really like a warm option. I would slightly turn on the knob for hot water and it got really hot despite the cold water being turned slightly more. Speaking of room service, they did get what I asked within a timely matter despite the huge influx of visitors due to Urbana. They didn't really get to our room that much for cleaning and tidying despite us staying for 4 days though. The hallways are kind of like a labyrinth with so many twists and turns and it's really easy to get lost at first. Overall, it was fine for the duration I stayed and nothing else more.I've stayed here twice now for business and both times it's been excellent. Rooms are clean, staff is polite and friendly. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is for parking. As others have said it's a bit expensive.","Wow. Visiting town for a twins game.  Brought some friends in an adjoining room. What an awesome hotel.Thanks Joe.Upon arrival I'm told valet is 30$ plus tip. And if I want 10$ parking it's the lot down the road that gets broke into daily. Ok. Then, have to give 50$ up front for incidentals. Don't have 50$ cash, they tell me I can't check in until after my show when I'll have 50$ cash. (10p I'm here at 2p) luckily my tour manager called and have her cc to cover it. ( I don't have cc's)They were rude. Just outright rude. I'm a comedian and don't look like typical visitor here and I think they treated me like trash because they assumed my class is less than theirs. Maybe I am below them but I tour the world and use to stay at Hyatts all the time. I won't ever stay here or any Hyatt ever again, I'll also make sure everyone I know avoids them as well.Much better this time around. Once again, Mardi Gras brings me back into town! I actually didn't mean to stay here again (everything was booked except here and Four Seasons) but I'm glad we did. Hyatt beds are like the clouds you imagine Snuggle, the laundry bear, would sleep on. The best sleep happens here. Our room setup was different from our last room and everything seemed in good order. My only gripe would be our room neighbors. Party weekend means party people. Our room reeked of marijuana horridly.We stayed overnight and bought the VIP New Years eve party package. We got a room with an arch view as well. Room was great and the view was amazing especially at night. The party was fantastic. Being in the VIP area was well worth the money. Our wonderful waiter Mario kept the drinks coming without even being asked. He was excellent. The bands were great and everyone had a wonderful time. Check in and valet were very quick despite the long lines.Sure, it has the basic hotel niceties, but the walls are as thin as paper. So if you want to be kept awake all night by your neighbors' TV and random babblings, then this is the place to be.I am a frequent St. Louis traveler, with my dad being a St. Louis native. Unfortunately, this will probably be my last trip since we really have no family left here anymore now that my uncle has moved to Michigan.I usually stay here at the Hyatt Regency at the Arch and it is always a pleasant experience. The rooms are spacious - at least all of mine have been. The King Suite with an arch view is HUGE and the view of the arch is amazing. My rooms are always spotless. On this trip, I received an email from management welcoming me and thanking me for booking directly through Hyatt. I emailed back because I needed to check in early (see my review of another hotel here in town to find out why). She almost immediately responded to let me know that my room was on her list for inspections and would be ready for me whenever I arrived.  I was able to check in before 11am! The service is always exemplary and this stay has been no different. I highly recommend this hotel...and the bottle of Moscato that I had to order here after my stay at that other place the night before!+ for Starbucks in hotel+ for free wifi every time I stay here, don't know what deal the folks who say it isn't free got.+ for Ruth's Chris in hotel+ for the in-room dining apple pancakesMehhh. I wanted to love this place, but I really couldn't. Work took me here for a conference, and I stayed for 3 nights. The hotel itself is large, but the decor is so outdated and weird that walking down the hall of our room made me almost nauseous. 70s carpeting and weird lighting don't belong in 2015. The room was small, but fine, and our view was less than alluring (thanks, construction.) Also, there is no free wifi with your stay. I could write a book on how utterly ridiculous this is, but I'll just say this: if you are the Hyatt, you suck. Get your act together.This hotel can be summarized as good, but dated, and near the arch.To elaborate, the positives were the standard Hyatt cleanliness, the good breakfast options in the Regency Club, the unexpected (and complimentary) suite upgrade I received, and the great view of the Arch and the river. Oh, and both restaurants are good... and there's a good selection of beer on tap in the sports bar.The reason it's not 5-star are:- It's got a pretty dated interior and rooms and is due for a facelift.- It's noisy. I stayed near the top of the hotel and I could hear the traffic noise from the freeway below... and not background noise but loud.- The parking situation. Self-Park is expensive and Valet doesn't bring your car to the door, you still have to go find the kiosk in the garage--despite dropping your car off at the main entrance.Bottom line, I'm content and will stay there again... but maybe request a room without a view (the view has the freeway below).We chose this hotel based on location to the Gateway Arch.  It's right downtown by the Arch park/river.  They only have valet parking but you can come and go as often as you want for one price. Inside is a spacious lobby and plenty of workers looking to help guide you to where you needed.  Check in took awhile but I think the girl was new.  There are several restaurants on site as well as Starbucks and gift shop.  The elevators only go to certain floors so read the signs.Off the elevator is a maze.  We must have turned down 4 different hallways to get to our room.  However, it looked out onto the Arch(maybe half of it we could see?), so worth it.  Room has an angle so felt small until you get to the window area where it's more spacious.  Beds were comfy.  Bathroom was updated and clean.  We opted to do room service for breakfast.  Guy was 15 min early so glad I had woken up early to get dressed.  We hadn't made room for the trays.... But the meal was wonderful.  Worth the price?  Maybe not, but the kids enjoyed the experience and honestly, the food was seriously good.  We had a nice experience at this hotel.  We really enjoyed the sports bar downstairs as well.  We walked to the Arch NP in the evening and felt safe.  Will be nice when construction is over.The corner room with large picture windows is fantastic! We have a view of the arch and a view of the river on the 11th floor. The staff was very helpful checking in and out. We walked to Busch Stadium for a great Cardinals win over the Cubs and ate in the Village last night!Totally enjoyed this hotel!This Hyatt is located right next to the Gateway Arch in downtown St Louis.  Grabbed a room for the night on a long weekend road trip.  The hotel is large and modern and I will say all of the staff I encountered were friendly and courteous.  There is both valet and a self park parking garage available for guests, as there isn't any real parking to speak of nearby (so expect to pay).  The large lobby has a bar/restaurant (the Red Kitchen and Bar), a Starbucks, and a Ruth's Chris steakhouse.  We had a single room with a king bed with a nice view of the Arch and Mississippi River.  Again, the room had a very modern decor Ike the rest of the hotel.  Our room was on the small side (actually a lot smaller than normal), but they do have a variety of room options available.  For the price, this was a nice option in downtown St Louis and I would stay here again.Beautiful hotel.  Nicely furnished rooms and great service.  They have a wonderful gym and several places to eat within the lobby.  It is also a good location for getting to baseball games.  They also directed me where to self-park for only $5 a day!  I would recommend this hotel, the only thing it lacks (in my opinion) is a pool and outdoor patio/tanning area.My best friend got married this weekend and this was the hotel she chose to use as our ""home base"" to get the bridesmaids ready. EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE we encountered was pleasant, friendly, kind, and overly helpful.Keith was essentially our personal assistant and catered to our every whim. He was so incredibly wonderful it really made the day go by as smooth as possible. I'm getting married this April, and you already know where I'll be staying. Boom.We stayed here this last weekend for an event in the Hyatt called ""Whiskey in the Winter."" What an amazing event! We will certainly review it in its own right.Starting out...getting to the Hyatt right now with all of the Riverfront construction was a bit of a nightmare, but we can't fault the hotel. Having to valet was the only viable option as it was not well marked where you could self park.We checked in via Web Check-in (which was super easy) and immediately went to the room to get ready for the night. The room was a little small, but very clean and offered a great view of the Arch.Making coffee in the room upon arriving we realized we only had two pods for the entire stay. This was not a huge issue as we were leaving the next day. We were greeted by several staff members and all were helpful.The room was very clean and the bathroom was incredible, which made getting ready for an event very relaxing. The staff was accommodating and helped us get to the event in a timely, stress-free fashion.Waking up the next day I was in desperate need of caffeine, and to my surprise the hotel provided a free coffee bar on the first floor elevator lobby Hot and fresh cups of coffee with your own fixings were offered, which really started my morning off right. Checking out that morning was incredibly fast and convenient. Overall the entire experience was top notch.If you are looking for a great hotel with amazing service, stay at the Hyatt Regency in Downtown St. Louis.Happy staying,DeniseThis is a beautiful property located right in the heart of downtown with a magnificent view of the Arch. We were so impressed and enjoyed our stay in St. Louis so much so, that we decided to extend our stay another night. There is so much to see, do, explore and enjoy!! The location was perfect for everything we choose to do. We visited Forest Park and went to Saint Louis Art Museum, St. Louis Zoo and the St. Louis Science Museum. We also went to the City Museum and decided to walk to Busch Stadium (which is awesome) to see a Cardinals game.  I don't know if I'll ever have the chance to return but I certainly hope so!!Beautiful city where it's clear to see the people take pride in their City!A lot of these reviews seem silly to me. Lady complaining about no wifi? Wrong. It's totally free and works well. You just have to agree to their terms, standard. Dude complaining about paid parking? Duh. That's beyond typical for any downtown hotel in any large city setting. Downtown Chicago was a sold $10 more per night than this place. Do your research. It's all states very clearly on their website. For me personally, service was great. Very friendly, helpful, prompt. Room was clean. Bed was soooo comfy. And location? Wow! I mean, arch view! And lots of cool stuff near by. Can't go wrong.Stayed here while in town for our anniversary. Parking was very expensive. Valet is $30+ and self-parking is $25. Check-in was very quick. The lady checking us in asked what the occasion was and we told her about our anniversary and she offered us a few amenities like chocolate covered strawberries and champagne, but we were unsure if they were complimentary or not, so we passed. We were placed on the 15th floor with a very poor view of the other side of the hotel and a sliver of a view of the river. The room was very clean and really modern. The lobby is a little confusing because it is so large, but very modern. However...the walls of our room were paper thin. We could hear a couple laughing and talking all night long between the wall. Checkout was as quick as check-in was. We had problems exiting the garage all night long so getting out was, once again, a pain. Overall, great night and very close to everything!Such a beautiful hotel in a ideal location. You are within walking distance of anything that you might want to do. The staff was amazing. I had the pleasure of meeting Keith at the concierge. He ensured that we had everything that we needed. I appreciate the attention to customer service and I would return.Having just had an issue with the Hilton, I was not expecting a good night. Luckily, the Hyatt is well above in professionalism and common decency. We are enjoying our stay in the great room, amazing staff and decent bar. I tried to not compare them in the rating. 5 is right.Very nice hotel and the location is unbeatable! The Arch is directly across the street from the hotel (hence the name). It's walking distance from Ballpark Village and many bars and restaurants. The hotel staff was so friendly and accommodating. We stayed in a corner room which allowed us to get lots of sunlight and a lovely view of the Mississippi. I really enjoyed my stay here!","There's nothing like getting a discounted room and getting to watch 2 ""engineers"" work on a door to get you in. Way to go Hyatt. 2nd stay in 6 years and both have lived up to awful each time.I booked this property to attend a conference held within the hotel from Monday to Friday the week of 2/. Given the location and history of St. Louis I was extremely hopeful that I would have a wonderful stay. Here are the positives:-Exceptionally nice staff. Anytime I needed help there was someone friendly who was willing to assist me or anyone else who attended the conference. The staff really set this Hyatt apart from many of the other hotels that I have stayed (with the exception of a 5 star in Costa Rica). Here's why I gave 1 star: Unfortunately, the staff could not make up for some of the larger issues and serious concerns that I will share. -I had to call the electrician to my room two nights during my four day stay due to the central air/heat not working. This is of particular concern because the weather hoovered 17 degrees and with the air out the room was very cold. -I left money on the counter in my room that went 'missing.' I didn't see it fit to call and raise a complaint because the amount was small and I planned to actually leave the more than the amount as a tip for the cleaning woman. After realizing that it went missing, I saw it would no longer be appropriate to leave a tip as someone had already helped their self. -Cleanliness is of a big concern. When I purchase a hotel stay I expect the sheets to be clean. During my check out I pulled back the top sheet of my bed to find a comforter covered in pee covered stains which was absolutely gross and appalling. The stains were a square foot large, there were multiple, yellow to dark yellow and I believe I threw up in my mouth several times with disgust. I saw the sheets while checking out and cannot believe that a Hyatt property would have me layered in that degree of filth for 4 days. For this reason, I will never return to the Hyatt at the Arch. I urge you to look at the photos that I posted for proof. Also, check your bedding if you do decide to stay.Very spacious gym. One of the largest hotel gyms I've seen.*No Pool*Mirrors in stretch/an area and free weightsGym: 1. Cardio Machines: 5 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, 3 bikes2. Weights: Free weights. Several machines for legs, arms, chest, and back3. Extra Equipment: Bosu balls (half and full), medicine balls, kettle bells, and 2 adjustable chairsRoom: Smelled smokey upon entrance and my room was a non smoking room. They brought a deodorizer to neutralize itOverall I wouldn't recommend. The gym is great however you need to feel comfortable as can be while away from home as traveling can be stressful.Stayed here for a work accounting symposium. The location is directly across from the arch but at the time we were there, construction was being done so in order for us to visit the arch we had to walk a couple blocks down. No biggie. Very close and walking distance to the stadium as well.I like how there was an extensive list of items the concierge would be able to provide if you forgot anything (hello, aquafresh whitening toothpaste) or if you wanted to borrow something (foam pillows). I enjoyed the flavored water provided in the lobby during the afternoons and the BBQ restaurant in the lobby was good too!As usual we stay at this lovely hotel  every year as we head back home to Chicago after visiting Grandma and Grandpa for the holidays.  We've been doing this for more than 10 years.  We have NEVER been disappointed.  EVER.  And this year was no exception. Of particular delight was MOD (manager on duty) - Katie B. who took care of a minor issue for us with professionalism and a smile.  The Hyatt (every level of staff) have been always been incredible.  We will NEVER stay anywhere else while passing through.  CLASS COMPANY TOP TO BOTTOM.The only reason I am giving this place two stars instead of one is because the staff was wonderful. Checking in was simple but the main issue of the stay was noticed the next morning while having coffee in the Room. there was a stain on the bottom of the door, food under the bed and there was some form of gunk along the base board. The card listing the complimentary items you can request was covered in old food. I reported it to the front desk who said they would have the staff do a full cleaning . All they did was throw away the food stained card and didn't a dress anything else I had mentioned. Secondly the roof terrace which is the ONLY VIEW OF THE ARCH if you don't pay extra for a arch view was closed the entire weekend. I went down in Saturday afternoon and was told it would be open Sunday morning which was a lie. The thing about that which angered me is that no where did they state that the terrace should be closed all weekend  It was not open until 4 which is after check out . Also be warned don't park in their lot it is 28$ a day just got to the garage up the street where it is only 5$.I thought the Hyatt was supposed to be pretty nice. At least for the price, it should've been. My bathroom had pubic hair on the floor and in the tub, so I called the front desk and someone came up and cleaned it again, but all they did was push it around so I had to pick it up with a Kleenex and throw it away. My pillowcase had a few small stains on it. For breakfast, I went to the restaurant on the first floor and they gave me oatmeal that was barely warm. All in all, not a great experience. The 2 stars is for the view and the gym was good.I am here for a conference and my entire experience has been outstanding. The rooms are clean with comfortable beds and high quality linens. The bathroom is nicely laid out with a very nice shower head and no shortage of hot water. The room has a nice work table with plenty of easy accessible power outlets.We have been served several banquet meals that are the absolutely best I have ever experienced anywhere! The conference room are also extremely nice with good temperature, lighting, AV capabilities, and noise dampening.I only had breakfast at the in-house restaurant. It is a very nice buffet for a reasonable price. Made-to order omelets and large fresh fruit selection. Amazing cereal/oatmeal add-ins include a variety of dried fruits and nuts, yogurts, and milks (skim to half-n-half). Fresh baked goods ranging from croissants to bagels and everything in between.I highly recommend this hotel for a conference! For a personal vacation spot, it is right next to the arch and a short walk to Cardinal's baseball stadium. Also convent to the train to the airport.What I don't get is that they have so many people working in the lobby area but my stay still didn't end up being as pleasant as if expect from a Hyatt Regency, or any Hyatt for that matter.Here is why:- I had a package delivered here.  They didn't notify me at check in.  Apparently, all packages are sent to the FedEx business center which is only open until 6pm.  After 6, you had to call and ask for the package to be delivered to your room.  And it took them almost an hour to get the package to my room.  And at checkout, I saw a $10 handling fee.  No one informed me about this handling fee or this hours of operation when I called the week prior about sending a package here.- $23 self parking fee.  The garage entrance is very narrow.  The valet guys are very inconsiderate when getting in and out and one guy almost hit me because he was driving so fast.- I got a call at 9.30pm asking what my car was downstairs.  With the time difference, I was almost asleep and didn't get the question at first and the guy asking was being very abrupt.- the elevator going down to the garage was broken on the morning I checked out.  The attendant who checked me out didn't even mention that or offered help even when she knows I am parked downstairs.- The room with the view of the arch does have a nice view but it is also very busy and noisy.  I thought New York is loud but the traffic here kept me up at night.  This was the same issue I had from last time.Please do kindly take these feedback seriously so you can bring the hotel up to the Hyatt standard.  I know it exist and its just a matter of actually caring and executing.Beautiful hotel in the heart of St. Louis.This hotel doesn't look very big when you look on the exterior but when you walk inside, it's pretty grand. There is a Starbucks and Fedex Kinkos for all you business people.Rooms are nice and comfy. Modern and clean. We had a great view of the arch and the riverfront. The front desk staff were very helpful as well as the valets. The only problem I had was the fact that the self parking was pretty far off. It was a few blocks down. It isn't really safe to walk to the hotel in the evening, but there are people still out if you come back early enough. The best part was that we got a fabulous deal on Priceline for a room! Under 50 bucks for a four star hotel. Awesome!Stayed here for three nights in July, and we got upgraded for free to a suite in the back corner, where we got an awesome view of the arch! The hotel was clean, has a Starbucks inside, 24 hour gym, and a couple of fancy restaurants in the lobby. A lot of good restaurants are walking distance, and the arch is literally right across the street. The cardinal stadium is a couple blocks away too. An awesome location for tourists!This is a fairly classy place however they suffer from some service issues. First the guy manning the check-in counter was extremely rude. A group of us was staying here with the reservation under one name and we arrived in separate groups, the guy who had made the reservation was not in the first group. No big deal right? Well apparently it is. Despite having the confirmation code, and even confirming over the phone with the guy who had made the reservation the front desk still refused to help us out. After some hours of that non-sense we finally got checked in when our man made it to the hotel in person. The concierge was also much less then helpful. Asking this dude for advice on places to go is a mistake. Asked for a place close by the hotel to pic up a collard shirt for the evening. The man sends me half way across the city and I followed along because I didn't know any better. Later that night as I was out drinking I come across a store front a block away from the hotel. Thanks for nothing...Let me preface this reviewing by stating that I do quite a bit of traveling for work and pleasure.  I would almost say that the time I spend in hotel rooms is at least equal to or greater than the time I spend in my own bed!  For the benefit of my own sanity I try to stay at hotels that are 3.5 to 5 star rated (4 star being a good mix of luxury to value, in my opinion) so I was excited to stay at the Hyatt Regency at The Arch as it was rated at 4 stars and billed as the premier hotel in the downtown area.  This definitely was not the case..........I booked a room here for the first game of the NLCS with the Cardinals playing at home so I fully understood that many hotels would be sold out and prices would be high.  I typically book many of my hotel stays through Priceline or another app that finds lower prices for you.  Being the significance of the date of my stay I found that not many 'great deals' were to be found so I went ahead and booked a room here for right at $280 a night - a small if not huge savings from it's typical rate of $325-$350.  Needless to say, at either rate, I was expecting a lavish experience and a modern room that was up to date on all renovations.  Again, not the case.Before I begin my extensive criticism I should note that this hotel does have three great things going for it - location, location, location.  It is literally across the street from the Gateway Arch, right off of the point where I-44/I-70/I-64 merge and offer an exit, and 3-4 blocks from Busch Stadium/Ballpark Village as well as other downtown attractions.  Many of the rooms offer a spectacular view of The Arch, mine was not one of them (Priceline folks get the less popular views I guess, I understand and don't have a big issue with that).  Upon exiting the interstate and proceeding to the hotel it isn't quite clear which side you pull to for valet parking ($28 a day not including 'parking tax') so I guessed the front entrance initially, I was wrong.  Okay, so I made a block and proceeded to side entrance where the valet is situated.  The line was 6-7 cars deep (two lanes) but again, I was more than willing to cut some slack since the Cardinals were in town for this event and I knew the hotel would be quite busy.  A self park option is available but most downtown garages are close to $20 a night anyway and you'll spend an hour trying to find one not filled to capacity.  I didn't plan to drive my car while I was here and was going to see it only again after I checked out.  More on this later......The entrance/foyer does show promise as no expense was spared in the decor.  Great woodworking and ample lobby seating are adorned by very nice chandeliers.  On one side of the lobby you have several attendants behind a long desk checking in/out guests and the opposite end of the lobby houses a contemporary yet warm bar area and a separate Ruths Chris Steakhouse.  Ok, things are looking up I thought.  Finding our room on the 14th floor was a bit of a maze but I can understand this since the design/shape of the hotel warrants several and winding long hallways.  Walking into the room left me asking myself ""where is the rest of it?"".  It is a rectangular shaped room (the 2 double room at least) with a small bathroom.  Oddly, the closet is carved into a large indentation between the main room and bathroom; why would you waste so much space making a seprate 'room' for a small closet????  The beds were comfortable but curiously out of the four pillows on each bed only one was plush and comfortable as if the other three came from the local dollar store.  The room was clean (as expected) and came with enough separate lighting and outlets.  Two small things really sum up my feelings about this hotel experience - an old stye iHome dock on the night stand with the connection that only works for 3-4 year old iPhones and a phone in the bathroom that is straight out of your parents kitchen wall from the 1980s (I can imagine an SNL skit of a business man sitting on the commode using this antiquated phone yelling ""Buy!! Sell!! Buy!!"").  To me, those two 'luxuries' show the attitude of this hotel - two steps away from what would be considered modern luxury in a hotel of this price range.  All of this would be acceptable in a hotel HALF of this price range/star level (remember, even on an average day the rate is that of a small new car monthly payment).  I didn't think too much of it then as we only had an hour or two before the game started.  Check out the next morning was a 45 second breeze but retrieving my car from the valet was a nightmare.  It's in the basement (in no way clearly indicated) and we waited at least 40 minutes in a line of about same number of people.  All in all, if you are staying here expecting a magical Hyatt Regency experience and are paying the standard rate, I give it ONE STAR.  If you catch a GREAT deal (at least half off) on the rate and are just staying here for aquiet room/comfy bed - TWO-THREE STARvisited this year end of Februarypros : awesome view of the arch, price, they allow dogs! my 60lb pit bull!, location. pristine lobby, great rooms, Starbucks in lobby. great welcoming staff. cons : location (I just don't like St. Louis)party hotel for college students. parking fees were through the roof.over all it was a good stay we were there for 5 days visiting family in the St. Louis suburbs. it was my second visit to the ""city"" I guess Midwest cities aren't like east or west coast cities. I think the hotel got this good rating because the staff was really amazing. if I had to return I would stay there or any of the ""downtown"" 4 star hotels. for a kingsized bed with good view we paid $75- $125 through Priceline.This place was awesome. It's expensive, but pretty cool views of the arch. The only reason it's not a 5 star review is because you have to wait in line for a while for the elevator, but not a big deal. Would definitely recommend.Here is what I enjoyed about the Hyatt Regency at the Arch: The service - they were great and helpful. They even brought a microwave to my room to warm my one year olds bottles. They also tracked down boxes of Cheerios when he needed something more then was being served. The Starbucks in the lobby - I was there for work with my one year old - 'nuff said. I was there multiple times a day. The staff there were great too by the way. The fancy sinks. I got a kick out of them. They were super modern and made me feel I was somewhere very fancy. The three options for restaurants in-house. I only tried one of them, but for convenience sake alone it is worth a mention. The location - right across the street from the Arch, great views out the windows and walking distance to Arch attractions. One other thing I would like to mention: My room could have used a bit more deep cleaning. It wasn't gross by any means, just needed some ""corner cleaning"". I would recommend a stay here.I must admit, when I first found out I was staying here I was a bit leery...this hotel used to be the Adam's Mark, then bought and renovated by Hyatt. The Adam's Mark walls were so thin I could hear the person in the room next to me taking a shower. BUT...that is no longer an issue here. My room was fantastic. Very clean, large and roomy, with comfortable beds and the always-appreciated outlets by the nightstand. I was treated to a beautiful view of the Arch. It was one of the best views from a hotel I've ever had, and as I travel more than 200,000 miles per year, that is saying something! On a weekend such as this I usually end up with a lovely view of a brick wall or a parking garage! :)Staff were friendly, professional and helpful. The hotel was extremely busy as there was quite a sports festival going on in St. Louis this particular weekend. The World Series AND the Monday Night Football game. Not once were any of the staff harried or brusque. Everything was seamless. Great job, Hyatt!!This is basically a cheap motel feigning as a Hyatt. If you enjoy poor service, expensive parking, a mediocre room and an expensive price, this hotel is perfect. Having spent many nights in Hyatt hotel around the world, this is by far the worst. It's not a single issue, but the whole experience.The Westin or Crowne Plaza would be a much better option in Saint Louis.This hotel is so beautiful. It's within walking distance to the City Garden. From the moment we stepped into the staff was friendly and very welcoming. Charlie checked us in and was so nice and helpful. We'll definitely be returning.Found it on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>, far too late, for far too much, when me &amp; the boys committed to the World Series trip!  Hotel generally is up to date on furnishings:  they've kept up on renovatoins.  Close proximity to Busch, the Arch, and the business district.  Stunning arch views out most of the rooms (angled layout of the building appears to enhance this).Easy access in &amp; out from the expressways.  Easy parking at the Mansion parking ($3 all day on weekends!), but watch out for the difficulty of navigating that garage--confusing!  Also watch out for a scam during world series game (attendant told me Sun morning it should have been $20 to park for ""Event"" and I ""should have been told that at my hotel""!!  (I sat there and argued my way into paying the posted $3)Would return, just wouldn't pay $400, until of course the Redbirds make their next World Series!","Yes, yes the view... but this is not why I rated this hotel so high.  I was here on business.  My flight was long, the meetings were long, and I was tired.  On top of that, it was raining pretty good outside.  As soon as I pulled up, a hotel staffer came out with an umbrella and held it over me so I could step out of the cab.  He grabbed up my luggage while I walked through the front door... so perfectly executed.  :)The lobby was warm and quiet.  My room was beautiful and clean.  I had forgotten my toothbrush so I called down the lobby for a new one.  By the way, it's pretty AMAZING the amount of free things they offer if you've forgotten them or need them.  About 5 mins after I called, I heard a quiet knock on my door.  Opened it, and there was a bag hanging on the handle with a new toothbrush and toothpaste.  Awesome.This is a great place to stay if you're in St. Louis.  The view is great, but the hospitality is better.We were in central IL for a family reunion and decided to spend one night in St. Louis. My husband wanted to see the Arch and I wanted a hotel close by. I am a huge fan of Hyatt and booked a room at this hotel, which is literally right across the street from the Arch. We were really pleased with the valet service, ease of check-in and the size of the room. The room had been updated, but some things like the doorknobs, doors, etc were still old.  I liked that the rooms came with a mini fridge and the bath amenities were very nice. In the lobby there is a Ruth Chris, Starbucks and Brewhouse. Nice selection of places to go right there. We would definitely stay here again. The property was very well maintained and the staff was very friendly.It's a lovely hotel but they're determined to nickel and dime you to death around wifi access. The wifi splash pages doesn't tell you how much access costs, which might lead one to think it's free for hotel guests. Even a limited speed access is typical today. And charging guests to use a computer in the (FedEx branded) business center is rather chintzy. I spent a lot of time averting inadvertent spending disasters with my parents. Otherwise, very cordial and competent staff, spacious rooms, and excellent location.A royal rip-off. Stayed here one night while in town for a wedding. Hesitant to pay so much but it was close to the venue and there was a small discount for wedding guests. Room was small and crowded; functional, but I'd expect more for the price. Came back late from the wedding and found - as another review noted - no sheets on the bed. Just a decorative comforter with not even a mattress pad underneath! ugh. Called the front desk about it. Approximately 40 MINUTES later they arrived with 5 flat sheets (?). Finally got to bed ... and was woken up every 30 minutes by someone screaming out in the hallway, a crowd yelling next door, furniture banging on the floor above, and just when it all started to quiet down around 6am... construction started right outside our window. The main draw of the hotel seems to be its prime location, but when we tried to find breakfast at anywhere besides the Starbucks in the lobby, we had to drive 20 minutes to find someplace open!  Apart from the view out the window, the whole experience felt like we were staying in a budget motel in the ghetto. We later stayed at a Marriot that was 1/3 of the price, clean, spacious, with FREE parking, pool, and wi-fi! Please save your money and go somewhere that has actual sheets on the bed and allows you more than half an hour of uninterrupted sleep.Decent hotel. Room was clean and staff was friendly. But, I brought my 8 year old here for her first hotel stay. Was disappointed that there was no pool. And paying $30 for valet, I would expect it to be brought to the front door where we were dropped off at the beginning of the stay. Instead, the cashier said ""It's very busy on Sundays and unfortunately they don't have time to bring the cars to the front."" Yet, there were no cars being dropped off because it was before check in time. 5 hours before. Very inconvenient. And then, my boyfriend was going to go get the car personally instead of us waiting and they refused to give him the keys. Definitely won't be her againGreat location! This hotel was clean, and the customer service was great. But the location is what will make come back here time and time again! This hotel is walking distance from so many great restaurants, museums, and parks. Also, getting an arch view room is totally worth it. Our view was magnificent!I'd stay here if I wasn't married to the Hilton program, but I come here all the time when I am in St. Louis...Ruth Chris, Starbucks, a store and their restaurant is good too. It is safe, convenient and I like it.Tip: there is a little known restroom under the stairs by the Ruth Chris.At the end of my stay. Four minor -mehh- things: coffee at the restaurant was not great. and the restaurant has plastic flowers (eewww). after reading other reviews, I looked and -yes- things in the room are dusty. and the valet staff (which is a separate company) tell you ""15 minutes"" whether it's 5 min or 30 min...But I still give it 5 stars, because THE STAFF ARE RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING. It was a crazy holiday weekend, but (i) you still let us check out late? and not only that ask if we need more time? (ii) you not only give me my bags, but you tell me you can carry them for me wherever I need to go? (iii) you, ms hostess, want to chit-chat to make the 3min it takes to be seated for the buffett quicker?, (iv) you Mr FrontDoor person want to make sure you give me extra clear directions to the bathroom? I mean, really... it's only at the FourSeasons that there is a staff member at every corner, and who smiles, and who not only helps, but anticipates needs and goes above and beyond.And the (yummy and fun) buffett is open until 11am! sleep! And noon on weekends! wahoo!I want to intern with this management!PS search online, and you will find a lot of good deals on the rooms (incl packages with free breakfast, internet, etc.)I had some points that expired at the end of the month, so we tossed the kids in the car, and went downtown for the night (yes, I live in St Louis and stayed at this hotel, so?). The location is great; close to the arch, lots of restaurants close by, City Garden for the kids, and a Starbucks in the lobby. The hotel is clean, and staff friendly. Valet is $26 for the night with self parking only $3 a block away. We had breakfast in Red the next morning, which was nice. $16.95 per person with kids under 8 free.  If you have little ones, or are coming in for a ballgame, this is a nice hotel. BTW, there's a Ruth's Chris steakhouse in the hotel as well. Bonus!We stayed here again!!! We got a bigger room than last time and it was really nice, lots of space and a fridge :). I wish they had a pool here but other than that you probably wouldn't have to leave the hotel for anything. I love the Red Bar in the lobby area. All the staff are super nice, from the Valet to the housekeeping crew! I like the fact that I saw the same faces in the short amount of time that I was there and they said hello and had small talk, and this is w/ housekeeping and the bellman...not the lady who answer's the phone Mrs. Wills....that's just her job.When I attended company meetings here it was the Adam's Mark. Excellent, till the last time and about a 2 star then. But we used Hotwire and that could have made a difference. Glad it has new ownership. Great location.People - do yourselves a favor: stay at the Westin! Rooms rough, shower doesn't drain,  HVAC system not working properly. I have a nice view of the arch though...I'd trade it to be at the Westin!The staff was incredibly courteous! Extra friendly and very polite! Very quick check in even though it was exceptionally busy that Saturday (Cardinals and Rams both had home games AND there was a wedding party staying at the hotel!). Excellent location! Beautiful decor and the room exceeded our expectations! Very comfortable bed and the quietest ""booked"" hotel night's rest I've ever gotten! The Starbucks downstairs was the icing on the cake the next morning. We will without a doubt be returning, thanks Hyatt!We enjoyed our stay overall, very friendly staff. Walls were way too thin though, we could hear our neighbors perfectly and they woke us up talking and with a hair dryer. All in all, I'd stay here again!What a fantastic stay!Imagine our surprise to find that this is the same place we attended another conference more than a decade ago - when it was the Adams Mark!I was easily amused by the funky key-thing that is just waved in front of the door. Our room was comfortable and cleaned adequately while we attended our conference during the day. There is an uneven spot on the floor in the lobby - watch out for it. My friend stumbled and lost an earring :( And one night at the hotel bar, security got totally in our friend's face and accused him of being loud (which was completely untrue, as witnessed by us and the bartender, thank-you-very-much). Apologies were made at length by the bartender, as well as promises of later follow-up so that never happens to anyone else!Watch out for the elevators - you need to remember which side to ride to get to the right floor ;)  And park at the Mansion House Garage instead of paying the ridiculous valet fee at the hotel.I stayed here during my trip to St. Louis.Actually, I had no choice...We held a conference here and the service was fantastic!The staff were hands on deck and made sure that our stay was pleasant.They took care of us and it was an excellent conference experience.The view from the one of the rooms was fantastic. It felt like you were outside looking at the arch without being outside :)I've been in the Hyatt Regency before because Ruth's Chris happens to be one of my favorite restaurants, but I've never had an opportunity to stay overnight. I needed to extend my December staycation, and the Westin didn't have the appropriate rooms available for all of us. So one of my friends went on Priceline and got this 4-star Downtown hotel for approximately $70 after taxes for several December nights.The good:*Front desk was efficient and effective. I was not the primary roomholder, but I didn't have any trouble checking in. However, we needed to actually extend this staycation extension also without the primary roomholder, so it was a bit tricky to change the name of the room over to another person. They handled it with aplomb. *We got connecting rooms without much trouble.*The rooms are comfortable, clean, and nice. It's a solid hotel room. Some rooms have a straight on view of the Arch (not ours). *The bathrooms are nice in that they have an extra sink outside of the main bathroom. I love that kind of stuff. But they were kind of stingy on the towels. Three bath towels for a two queen bed room? How does that work out?*They have amenities galore if you've forgotten toiletries at home...and believe me, I had. It's also a really nice touch that when you call for them, they call you by the roomholder's name. *Really nice 24 hour fitness center including water, cold wet towels, and earphones. The bad:*It's not that quiet. I was reminded of my college days in Chicago...all night, I heard the traffic even though our room was facing 4th instead of the highways.*Parking is $28 for valet, $8 for self parking. Rumor has it there is a $3 garage north on 4th, but we never found it. We usually did street parking because we were gone all day and back after 7 PM.*Internet is $10/day, but free in the hotel lobby. *Obviously, since it's a nice hotel, the attached restaurants have pretty high prices for average food. They are a couple of choices from Ruth's Chris to Red to a sports bar (which does have a free foosball table) to Starbucks. *They do take a while to clean a room. I'm not sure why. One day, we came back to find them cleaning the room, so we decided to go out for a late lunch. Three hours later, they were just finishing up the room. *The key cards stopped working midway in our stay. Only the roomholder could get them re-activated so that was a pain to recollect all the keys for her to go downstairs to do so. Check in is at 3 PM, check out is at noon.I give 4 stars... The view was nice and the location was ideal. Positives: I stayed in room 1549 right off the elevators which I enjoyed and didn't mind any noise from the elevator lobby. I really liked having a refrigerator in the room and the second day I noticed a microwave by the vending machine next to the concierge desk. Negatives:-I did not like how the Terrace was closed for private events when I tried to catch the sunset. -I felt that it was ridiculous to charge for wifi use daily. I also felt parking was too expensive so I parked at the Mansion Garage a couple blocks down. That worked out well. - I wondered why the closet in the room was so large? It's huge and makes the room feel much smaller than it is. (it's a nice changing area other than the bathroom though)-I had noticed a few nasty things that housekeeping missed. My towel had two buggies stuck to it from the laundry that no one noticed while preparing my room. When I tried to see if I could flick them off they wouldn't budge so I think they made it through the wash. -Also as you can see in the photo there was what looked like a blood stain on the comforter. The sheet that covers this got rustled in the middle of the night so I didn't notice this until the morning of my departure. - My last issue might have been a coincidence, we'll see..... I had my first experience with credit card fraud during my stay and the only transaction I made with the card was checking into the hotel. Still trying to sort that all out. Where to eat? -      Both nights I ate at Charlie Gittos and would recommend walking there if you like Italian. The toasted ravioli was amazing but the garlic alfredo pizza the second day was soggy before I even took the first bite (crust too thin in my opinion) so I should have went with the gnocchi.Ahh, I can remember when the Hyatt used to be the old Adam's Mark....heck, I can remember having my senior prom here....but I digress.The Hyatt is a great choice for those looking to be close to the action downtown.  Located across from the Arch and a hop, skip and a jump from Busch Stadium, the Hyatt is in a prime location.The hotel is always clean and the accommodations are nice.  The also have some significant meeting space for corporate events or Winter Warm-Up!  In addition, having Ruths Chris's in the hotel is not to bad either.  I definitely would recommend the hotel to visitors from out of town as it really seems to be close to most everything.My family and I stayed for the weekend we has a great stay.  Staff was friendly and really help us with different places to go within the city !! We will stay there again","This review is for our wedding block:We have stayed in the Hyatt at several times coming into town for holidays and such, so when it came to our wedding we thought it would be a good spot based on how affordable it had been for us in the past and its prime location next to the Arch.  However, our wedding block experience with the Hyatt left much to be desired.  We realize that it was a holiday weekend with several events taking up much of their space that weekend, but we never felt like our wedding block was made a priority or that we received any special services or attention. First, the prices that they offered our group were highly marked up from what we have paid in the past and higher than other hotels had offered us (but we chose to go with the Hyatt because of the brand loyalty for some of our guests and due to our past positive experiences).  Second, when it came to the wedding weekend, I dropped off guest bags to be delivered.  The bags were not delivered in a timely way.  And, I asked at the drop off how to handle the payment for it, and was told 'not to worry' about it.  Later, I learned that they attempted to put the charge for those guest bags on the room tab of one of my guests.  I knew that guest bag delivery incurred a fee, and would have gladly paid it when dropping off the bags, but was waved away when I tried to deal with it then.  I am still quite upset that they attempted to charge one of my wedding guests for these charges (presumably because I was not staying at the hotel so they did not have my room to charge it to--but they knew this at the time I was dropping off the bags).  Our guests who stayed at the Hyatt did not complain, and seemed to enjoy the experience, and it is a lovely hotel. However, for a wedding block, we were much happier with a smaller hotel where the majority of our guests (and we) stayed for the weekend where we received special attention and felt taken care of at every step.Really enjoyed our stay here. My family and I got a great deal on-line and went for the weekend. I highly enjoyed the friendly staff as well as the food and drink options located right in the hotel. It was close to the arch as well as everything else in downtown. Would love to go back in baseball season and stay there and catch a game at Busch stadium.Worst costumer service I've ever experienced. Manager on duty was rude and unhelpful. Visiting from California. Valet is incompetent and front desk is useless. If you are passing through after hours, go to the next hotel. Obviously the late night staff here does not care about you or your needs.We were a group that made our reservations last year. Of course we had made some changes, and I thought everything was fine the day before our arrival.When we arrived,  We still had an extra room which they promptly cancelled for me.  We were taken to our rooms and were pleased with the size and cleanliness. One room even received a plate of fruit and complimentary water. The room next to mine decided that drunk and really loud was their plan for the evening, so even a visit from hotel security could not quiet them down, so I was offered another room. I didn't like the view and decided to stay, and then they said they would upgrade me to another floor. The only hitch was I would have to wait for them to change it over to a non allergy room . (Horribly allergic to down!) I waited and  Jessica from the front desk came up with the keys and helped me move my stuff. (Why did I bring so much for 4 days?)  She also had offered me free breakfast in the restaurant.  I really appreciate how much she went out of her way!After a night of drinking, I am ready for bed, and I lay down and really dont feel very good, maybe a cold?  I then feel the pillows and think,.....wait a minute. Turns out that  my bed was never changed out and i was getting very congested very quickly. from the five down filled pillows and comforter.I go downstairs and let the desk attendant know that this is a problem. He says he will fix it and calls housekeeping and I sit and wait in the lobby. After about 20 minutes down there he says it is ready and I can go back up and gives me a 50 dollar room credit for my trouble. THANK YOU!!! So up I go, and housekeeping is just starting. Ok. I can deal with this! 20 minutes later and I am in bed!Next day, I notice my debit card has been charged for one nights stay, only problem is I guaranteed the room with it, but paid with another card.   I go downstairs and try to explain this to someone who was not getting it and kept explaining how the cards are held.......so a manager comes over and he is able to fix it and even buys me starbucks, as grumpy Rick has not had his daily caffeine fix yet and may not be the easiest person to deal with!Rest of our stay went smoothly, just a couple minor issues. I was told I got a breakfast again on Monday, so got some stuff to go.   WRONG, I got the bill for 19 dollars yesterday.  Another member of our group got charged and extra 20 for his room, when it was in our email that it was a complimentary upgrade and all our rooms were the same price.  I have not received my refund yet. How long does it take? They sure grabbed that money quickly.My only other gripe is the inconsistency of their housekeepers.  One of our rooms the attendant took the time to wash their counter, lay all their items out on towels and make sure everything was clean. Mine was pretty much having the towels replaced and a new bar of soap for the shower. I have stayed at this property before and it has never been this big a headache, smaller headache once, but generally smooth.  I do want to thank Chris and the entire front desk staff for consistently taking care of us. I will be back.Been waiting for 3 hours for my car, valet service apparently lost some keys. Terrible service, I'll never come back.We were here for five days for a conference with my husband's work. We had an overall good experience. Here are some of our thoughts:Pros:Great headboard on the bed- padded- it made it more comfortable. You can request extra things brought to you room- we were thrilled to get to have a tea kettle to use for the week. We appreciated the fridge in the room.Best blinds/drapes ever in a hotel room- not one speck of light came in if we didn't want it to.It's so fun to have a view of the Arch right from your hotel room and get to see it in all sorts of lighting throughout the day. There was a big closet with a full length mirror and a light in it. The bed (mattress) was very comfortable.We appreciated the big window ledge-lots of places to put things. Everyone working on the hotel side were really pleasant and had great attitudes.The internet had good speed and was easy to access one time and then worked for the whole stay- not always the case at other hotels. I loved the Red restaurant and also the Starbucks!It's a pretty hotel with a great location.Cons:Our room was right by the elevators so all day and night we heard the dinging of the elevator and conversations- no one ever seems to be quiet in the halls of a hotel. When we got to our room our bathtub was filthy (the dirt was only gone the last day of our stay- not sure why.Also when we got to our room there were half-used shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom and one packaged bar of soap- no lotion, no full shampoo or conditioner, no hand soap. We also only had bath towels- no hand towels or washcloths (but they did bring them a few hours after we requested them.) The pillow on the king size bed were tiny and inconsistent.We thought the bedding was really scratchy.The room was inconsistently hot or cold even though the temperature was set by us. It was super cold by the window no matter what temperature the room was (and the bed is a few inches from the window).We kept hanging our towels up to reuse them the next day but they were gone and replaced with fresh ones, even though we thought they wanted to be environmentally friendly.The elevators took a very long time and were often full- I guess they couldn't control that with how many people were at the conference but it was frustrating, and the stairs weren't easy to find and didn't always go to the floor you wanted. The conference gave us breakfast and dinner each day but some of the servers were pretty complain-y about the large group. Many times it was hard to get coffee or water refills.Overall it was a good experience but it seemed like the hotel might have been overwhelmed with a larger conference.We got a wicked deal here on Hotwire which made it well worth the stay.  What I love: - Close to the dome for Rams games- Nice views of the arch- Decent dining options in the hotel- Gym was big and had plenty of equipmentWhat I don't:- Shower leaked- Small-ish room- Ridiculously crowded- Neighborhood isn't great outside of being near the stadium- Gym smelled like baconWas this a great experience?  No. But if I got another $50/night rate here, I'd stay again.Incredibly underwhelmed! Way way overpriced for poor service, lack of amenities, and very uncomfortable small beds. Definitely not up to the standards of a supposed 4 star hotel. Wish I woulda stayed at the Westin, or hell, the La Quinta for that matter...rooms are similar but at least you get free breakfast thereI ate (or more to the point, attempted to eat) in their downstairs bar on New Year's Eve. There was one waitress and one bartender on duty, and only one other table of patrons. I waited 30 minutes for the waitress to approach, even though she walked past my table about 20 times; apparently ""excuse me"" was not in her vocabulary. Finally, I went to the bar and placed my order with the bartender, who promptly blended and delivered my cocktail. I returned to my table, and a few moments later saw my food order appear at the edge of the bar, presumably positioned for the waitress to bring it to me. Ten minutes later it still sat there, even as the waitress stood next to it, chit-chatting with the busboy. I again approached the bartender, brushing past the waitress: ""This is my order, right?"" The bartender confirmed, and I took my meal back to my seat.By then the food was cold; reasonably good, but nothing spectacular--about what I expected, given the overhyped reputation of a former Adam's Mark franchise. Incredibly, just as I finished my meal, the waitress showed up with my check, trying to make small talk and half-heartedly apologizing for being ""slow"" to serve me. Seriously? I ignored her attempt to salvage a tip, paid the bill, and pointedly tipped the bartender 30% in cash. Happy New Year, twit.Alas, it didn't end there; on my way out of the hotel, I decided to pick up some cough drops. I scanned the lobby, but didn't see a gift shop. So I approached two male security guards, and asked where the hotel's sundries store might be located.""'Sundries?'"" the bigger of the two beasts repeated hostilely; ""what's that? We don't have that.""I eyed him neutrally: ""I'd just like to buy some cough drops.""The other guard got on his walkie-talkie: ""Got a lady here lookin' for 'sundries'; d'ya know what that is, or if we have 'em?""( ... unintelligible squawking ... )He stared me down: ""We don't have that.""Sensing a teaching moment, I replied: ""'Sundries' are small items one might find in a hotel gift shop; for example, COUGH DROPS, aspirin, toothpaste ... ""Big Bear puffed up mightily: ""Well, we have a gift shop, but it's closed.""""OK--thanks."" I turned to leave.""You coulda just said 'gift shop,'"" Little Bear hollered after me in a belligerent tone. He got back on his walkie-talkie; seconds later, I noticed a third security guard following me; he stayed on my tail until I left the premises.Yes, the use of big words is apparently suspect behavior in Downtown St. Louis. If you prefer hotels staffed by rude employees with two-digit IQs, this is the place for you! Word up, Gateway Arch: you can dress a pig in a tutu; but you won't get a ballerina--just a pig in a tutu.The good - the staff was very friendly, location was great, the room was nice, and parking was cheap.  The bad - we discovered there were no sheets on the bed at 2am following a concert.  I like to think that it's tough to make me upset, but the lack of sheets did the trick.All in all I'd recommend this hotel, but check for the sheets early if you decide to stay here.I attended a wedding reception on the 18th floor of the hotel. The venue was inviting and clean. The outdoor area was a great atmosphere for a party. The beef tenderloin may be the best I've ever had.I stayed the night at the hotel after the wedding reception. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I was in luck because room service was available until midnight and I assumed the food would be amazing considering the automatic 24% gratuity and a $3.50 delivery charge for my late night meal. The portions were so small and there was nothing remotely fancy about anything I order. For example, the $10 Caesar salad was a small plate of romaine lettuce with dressing on the side. The quesadilla looked like it was ordered off a kids menu. Fifty dollars later and I went to bed still kind of hungry.The most frustrating part of my stay at the hotel was the parking. I was told the parking was free as a member of the wedding party. Perhaps chalk this up as a miscommunication between the bridegroom and myself because when my girlfriend and I checked out the following morning, we were each charged $33 for overnight parking. I was disgruntled, but went on with my day. Later on after talking to a couple of the other groomsman, they informed me their parking was free. I contacted the hotel to see if my parking should have been free and was treated like I was trying to screw them over somehow. They ultimately provided no explanation as to why some overnight parking was free and some wasn't. Overall I just felt like I got hosed on room service and parking, especially after my friends just spent lot money to have their wedding reception at the hotel. One might think that's the opposite of what the hotel wants their guests to feel like upon departure.I stayed here for two nights in August. The hotel is definitely dazzling...the lobby at least. Our room was clean and very spacious, but nothing too fancy (except the two sinks and vanities. That was quite nice.). We were on the 17th floor facing the park, so we had a nice view of the Ball Park Village and Courthouse. I didn't rate the hotel a 5 because they don't have a pool or free parking. YES, it's downtown so space is limited and would be impossible for them to have, but to charge so much a  night and for parking and BREAKFAST---$8 for a bowl of oatmeal!--it just wasn't worth it to me. Luckily I booked through Hotwire and paid half price. I won't stay there again, partly because I live in St. Louis already and partly because it's on the more expensive side, but it was nice to be so centrally located. We had a nice carriage ride--there's a line of horses and carriages right out front--and strolled over to Ball Park Village for a few drinks at Howl at the Moon. If you have the money and want a nice treat, and don't care about a pool, then it's a very nice hotel, and I recommend it. If you want to get more bang for your buck, or you have kids, I'd stay somewhere else.There for our global conference.It's really clean, big, and comfortable.This is an okay Hyatt.  I was hoping to get a better view of the Arch but whatever.  It was still clean and nice with great service.  More of an airport Hyatt though, meaning just not as nice as some of the other Hyatts I have stayed at.  Would I stay here again? Maybe I mean it is definitely not outrageously priced and I like that I pretty much know what to expect with the Hyatt.The five star review is for the excellent service I received from Mr Robert Jordan, a wonderful young man who I am sure will make a wonderful architect one day! Also Ms Essie from housekeeping was very helpful. These two are such gems and made my stay wonderful.I wish I was more impressed.  It was just fine.  I loved the location because it's literally across the street from the Arch but other than that I wasn't impressed.  Staff was very nice during check in and check out but there was just no WOW factor to the place.Rooms were kept clean daily by the staff without any issue.  The rooms are refreshed but my biggest gripe, oddly enough, was the door hardware.  Let me explain.  The door handles on the inside didn't turn.  So when you shut the door it made for a very large SLAM sound.  That being said, I heard that all night long, ugh.Great service. I attended a conference at this hotel. The concierge Darrell was very helpful and hospitable. The server named Darius at the RED Kitchen was not only a professional however also a comedian. Good food, great entertainment. The hotel amenities were phenomenal. Everyone that I encountered was a professional and seemed to enjoy their job.I was here for a conference, and I have to say that they did a fantastic job.  The rooms were nice and well kept.  The conference spaces were adequate.  They always had water available and coffee at the scheduled times.    I managed to squeeze in one workout and the fitness center is really very nice, had no usage fee, and was way larger than I anticipated.Great hotel in the shadow of the arch!  Very attentive staff.  Starbucks in the lobby, great sports bar, the Red bar was great.  Nice rooms.Just left from Hyatt at Arch. Spent Easter weekend there. Everything was great! Room service was on time. Good meal. Check in was prompt. Everyone is accommodating. The gym is very nice. Room was clean. Fridge and in room coffee. But Starbucks is in lobby. No problem. I would park at Mansion House apts garage. It's $3 dollars for overnight vs 28 valet at Hyatt. The walk was five minutes away. Enjoyed another good meal at Brew house in hotel too. I would recommend this hotel to stay at.","['hands', 'best', 'customer', 'service', 'experienced', 'hotel', 'drove', 'new', 'middle', 'night', 'arrived', 'hotel', 'well', 'check', 'problem',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-clayton-plaza-hotel-st-louis-saint-louis-2,Sheraton Clayton Plaza Hotel St. Louis,2.5,$$,70,"Julia at the bar/restaurant called Alexander's is a doll. She is very attentive and provides friendly service. I ordered the lobster bisque and the Caesar salad, and she recommended the salad with a medium cooked steak. It was perfect. Also, she made a Hendricks gin and tonic with a cucumber slice- a new favorite for me! Thanks, lady!Can you give a hotel a negative one thousand? Because that's exactly what I would give, it was really that horrible of an experience!!!! The rooms are dated and dirty, and the only perk to this hotel is the location, and that's it! I feel sorry for the staff that is decent and hardworking that is stuck in this dump! We had a horrific experience with a front desk clerk on our first night. There were multiple other guests standing by, watching her cuss us out and then give us the middle finger before the ghetto desk clerk announced that she quit, all because we asked how to valet our car (there's no signage nor is there an attendant after 11 pm!). After we complained the following day to the hotel staff, the GM showed up at our hotel room door telling us that WE had to leave because we made HIS employee quit! When we asked why we had to leave because we had not done anything wrong (other than to complain to the hotel the next day!), we were told that if we didn't immediately pack our things we would be arrested for trespassing???? He then had police officers that were already called in standing by to basically humiliate and force us to concede. What in the world??? CRAZY! I don't know if the manager was racist (we are an interracial couple) or what his deal was, but he was completely out of line. Never in my life have I ever been so mortified as I was when I was escorted out by two uniformed police officers, despite the fact that I'd done nothing wrong. We later requested copies of the ""police report"", which turned out to not even be an incident report, but instead a stupid memo documenting things. Apparently the GM lied and called the cops, telling them that we threatened his employee and made her flee???? Uh, NOPE! The awful woman that cussed us out simply wasn't cut out for any sort of customer service position. The woman quit because SHE chose to, and obviously doesn't want to work there! This may be a Starwood property, but it's far, far from SPG quality. There are much, much better hotels in St. Louis that are better options, and no one has to risk being evicted if you dare to complain about one of the numerous issues there.We've stayed her 4-5 times over the years.  Seen it through the reno of the rooms (and I think they updated the elevator too) sometime circa 2010.  The good:  street parking available if you're just there for the night;First night bell man (Phil or Bill I believe) was extremely patient and helpful with getting us + our well-past-bedtime kids to the room.""Suite"" with a totally separated living room is the bees knees for sleeping a kiddo in the crib.Concierge floor (#14) spread was really good for manager's reception (see random salad photo).They've remedied the ""weird smells"" that have been a problem before.Good location for business in Clayton.  J Buck's, Morton's and Kaldi's coffee (!) all walkable.Reasonable bar with a few values (craft beer), MacAllan was I think $13 (but a heavy pour!).Cons:  Rooms still show age/ wear. See ew photo of the couch stains.  We bookended our weekend flights: Thurs / Sun night stays this last time.  Room 1007 was in good shape; Room 907 was considerably more worn.Service was up &amp; down.  Bell man on the second night tried to talk me out of parking directly out front of hotel at meter.  I've had that before.  I was 6 steps from the front door and free.  Front desk is a little hit &amp; miss.  Wife always calls ahead to confirm the crib before we arrive.  First stay was a snap.  Crib was waiting.  Second, she got a little attitude from the front desk clerk; crib was missing upon arrival.  Dead area on weekends.I believe you have to be a Starwood/ concierge floor guest to get free WiFi (we did -- but just noting it for the record).The verdict:  I've found the convenience of this location and my Starpoints to fit the bill on several occasions.  I've called the StL Westin ""the best hotel I've ever stayed at in the Midwest.""  I still stand by that.  But it you need a suite for the fam for 8,500 starpoints, and proximity to the airport -- I'd give the Sheraton CP a look.This Sheraton is decent enough, and it provides a comfortable stay, but it feels kind of aged, and not in a vintage hotel, good way either. The staff is always courteous, and the location is great, but for the price I think I'll send my friends and family to newer hotels that feel nicer in the future.I had a breakfast seminar here this morning. There were no signs pointing us to the direction of the conference rooms. We did not have enough utensils for everyone. Third strike, this was a meeting that was going to last all morning, and the coffee was only served in to go cups....Not what I expected from the Sheraton.3.5 that I'm bumping up to 4. I wasn't sure what to expect here, given the very mixed reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. Like others, I appreciated the nice lobby (no weird smells), free shuttle (servicing airport and other locations within five miles, including WUSTL), and helpful staff (speedy check-in).As far as the room goes, I was on the Club floor. Not sure if these rooms have been more recently updated than others, but I had no issues with cleanliness as mentioned in other reviews. The decor didn't seem worn, just a bit boring like most Sheratons. I was pleasantly surprised to find a bathrobe in the closet, and I could hop on the lounge WiFi for free (now complimentary if you book direct, but I booked through a third party site). Internet was fast enough for Netflix. There were two bottles of free water, too.No, the room wasn't huge, but I've seen smaller. And, really, for $110/night on a weekend, how much more can you really expect? I didn't like the bed, but I generally find Sheraton beds too soft, so I was expecting that and it's not an issue with the specific hotel.No elevator issues per other review -- though once we went up a floor and back down to the lobby before really going up. Weird but not a big deal...Two small hiccups:1) I couldn't get into the room initially and had to go down to reception again. My key worked...but turns out I had to push the handle up, rather than down. I was in 1401, though it sounded like that may be an issue for other rooms, too. Not a big inconvenience, but should really be noted at the front desk and shared with guests at check-in so you don't need to go back down.2) When I inquired about airport transportation in the morning for a 6:05am flight, the front desk took my room number and offered to call a cab for 4:30am for me. This didn't happen...but luckily another guest was leaving at the same time and let me split the ride with her. I should probably have called down to check when I woke up like I was considering. Could probably have taken the 5am shuttle but didn't want to risk it.All in all, pretty good value for what you're paying, especially as a leisure traveler who's not spending that much time holed up in the rooms and especially if you're not driving (the shuttle saves $50+ in airport cab fare alone).The place looks amazing sndntge staff was exceptional. I arrived and the room i wanted wasnt available so the staff provided me with a conference room and it was huge. Just wasnt able yo get a window but we lived it.  Due to construction the parking was messed up. I was able to find parking at a spot down the  street for 5.00 for weekends. I would stay there again. The beds were amazing and soft.I stay at this hotel a couple of times a year and I have to say that the bartender Julia is awesome!  Great drinks and great conversation....definitely come have a drink at the bar and get some recommendations for food places around town!The rooms are so small that you feel like you should be in Manhattan but you are just in the middle of nowhere. It looks like they tried to update the rooms but only made it half way, many items were worn and dingy. The cable cut in and out the entire time we were there too. Spend your money elsewhere!!!No free internet in the room. No fridge no microwave in the room. A/C is more like a very loud fan. Parking is pricey too. How is this a 3.5 star hotel?Oh Clayton Sheraton. I have had lovely stays in your other locations, so I had high expectations for this one. It makes me sad that I couldn't give you more stars. The good: the lobby is really pretty, its not too hard to find, the staff are friendly and lovely people. The man at the counter graciously offered me internet and parking for free, before he realized it was already included in my reservation. The lady who served me at breakfast was friendly and kind. My bed was super comfy and there was always enough hot water. The bad: My sheets were not clean. Maybe they were and there were some dark stains they couldn't get out, or something. Either way, I didn't get in til late and the best housekeeping could do was send up new sheets. It felt like so much work to strip the bed to put on the new sheets at midnight, then I was paranoid there were other things not cleaned in my room. The room was a lot smaller than I expected for the SPG level, everything felt a little cramped, but it was fine for just one person. The TV only had 40 channels and most of them were crappy. The elevator took a long time. The parking garage is a little oddly situated- you have to go all the way down before you can get out. I ordered breakfast on my last morning using my green vouchers (I don't need poor housekeeping to come in every day). The man who took the order said they didn't have French toast sticks (off the kid's menu) due to their limited menu but they had regular French toast. I was under the impression that they could've cut up the regular French toast to make a kid's portion, but didn't want to annoy him so I said the regular was fine. When the food arrived, the bill was twice what I expected. Apparently, he had misheard my ""French toast sticks and single egg"" order for ""French toast (which I agreed to), two eggs, and toast"" which doubled the price of my meal. Plus, I didn't need all that food. I just wanted something small and hot. The staff who brought up my food apologized for the mistake and went to fix it; she graciously left the food for me rather than take one egg and the toast away. Sadly, the food was cold. Even wrapped in plastic wrap, it was cold. It made me wonder how long my food had been sitting there before it was delivered. Perhaps all the weddings and other activities going on in the city this weekend made it difficult for the Sheraton to adequately provide consistent good service, but I've had better. This stay was okay, but it wasn't up to par.There was no soap in my room, and when I asked for some the staff told me there was none available. They suggested I could try shampoo instead. Whether or not that made sense, this is not a service level I would expect at a high-priced business hotel. In addition, all carpets in my room were disgusting, it smelled like old pizza or a greasy take out joint in the room, and it felt they generally don't care for their guests. The location is a dead part of town, nominally convenient for its proximity to the metro train, but there is nothing nearby at night. Lobby has very little space, few places to sit. Just a generally depressing place, badly in need of renovation or a lowering of prices. The only thing I did enjoy about my stay here was the bed - sheets were clean, soft pillows, no bedbugs. The only thing that did not cry out for a low rating.Nice hotel in a nice area. Walk to everything I.e Starbucks, restaurants, bars etc. Outdated exterior but the inside us updated. I was nervous at first because some of the reviews but I must have gotten a good room on a good floor or something like that. I would stay here again. 3 1/2Totally A-OK. Just A-OK.Several reviews talk about dumpy rooms. Ours wasn't dumpy, just on the small side and could use some updates (the leather upholstery on the headboard was worn and like another yelper noted the bathroom door and room door get in each other's way). It was Plain Jane, but clean. Fine for a short stay.Lobby is nice. We got takeout elsewhere and ate near the bar. Tables were clean and the bar area has an open feel.What's with charging for WiFi, though? Get with the times, Sheraton. WiFi access is a big deal to most people nowadays and could be a deal breaker for someone here on business. You need SOMETHING to redeem the small rooms.Pool was great, shuttle service was quick and courteous, and the concierge was helpful identifying good food within walking distance.I am a loyal Starwood customer, with a Platinum status and this is by far the biggest dump of a hotel I have EVER stayed at that carries the SPG flag. The staff was nice but the rooms smell like a retirement home, the cable barely worked, elevators were beyond slow ( I changed to a lower room and took the stairs). The stains on the carpet in my room were enough for me to keep my shoes on at all times. Given the rates they charge, you have many other BETTER optionsStaff is super friendly and helpful.  Parking is easy.  In fact, I parked on the street directly in front of the hotel on a Saturday and Sunday.  The parking garage is attached to the hotel and looks easy, but I didn't need it.The bar and restaurant are good!  I had a chicken/avocado sandwich with fries.  It was ginormous and delicious.  I eat a lot for a girl, and I couldn't get much past the chicken breast and a few giant cut fries.  The room was what I expected from the Sheraton.  Great linens,  updated shower and bathroom, lovely toiletries.  We stayed on the 14th floor/club level and had access to a sweet lounge with free snacks and drinks (including alcohol!).  Sadly, some small kiddos were hangin in there with their parents, so it wasn't a place I wanted to frequent for long. The view from my room was fabulous at night.  I could see the lights in the city in the distance, and it was gorgeous!  I like that I can have the fan on constantly with the heating/cooling system, as I need the noise to sleep.  Would definitely stay here again.Run far away. Far. Worn down room. Air conditioning was more like a wind tunnel clicking on and off, than a comforting coolant. 2 hours sleep. I was on 7th floor, and forced to use the stairs several times because the elevator took over 10 minutes. The kitchen had limited menu, because of a fire. Only positive?  The lobby is surprisingly prettyThis hotel has gone far downhill since my last stay here four years ago. What used to be a nicer than average hotel is now one that I will not be returning to. Heavily soiled, sticky carpets in the room made me feel like I couldn't take my shoes off. In addition, there was visible mold and mildew along the grout in the bathroom and stickiness on the counter. What really got me were the brown stains on the sheets that I found as I was getting into bed. No free wifi either. The clientele at the hotel was also very loud and rowdy late into the evening even on a Tuesday, with large groups of guests crowding outside the front door to smoke. I realize that clientele can be variable and am trying not to let that influence my review, but it certainly didn't help make my visit any more enjoyable. I decided to give 2 stars since the staff was very pleasant, but the facilities here are in need of a serious upgrade. Look elsewhere when staying in St. Louis! Especially at this price.A recent fire at this hotel property has caused one of their two working guest elevators to go offline -- creating a huge mess with guests navigating the commute between floors. We stayed here this past weekend, in town for a family weekend, and dealing with the one working elevator amidst an apparently completely booked hotel was a nightmare situation. Each (attempted) elevator trip wait lasted between 12-15 minutes. Each way. Unacceptable. When possible we gave up and walked the stairs but not able to do so every trip while lugging wedding gear, bags, etc. I understand the recent fire contributed to the disruption but at no point were guests witness to any repair teams on site working to resolve the issue. Optics in this case are important, especially when staying at a higher end establishment such as this Sheraton. Only saving grace here from a 1 star was front desk supervisor Shay provided us a complimentary night stay off our reservation when I notified her of our terrible frustration. It was a nice gesture, one I think they were offering to all complaining guests who happen to be a Starwood rewards member.This Sheraton is dated, to say the least. It's in a good location but probably has ghosts and kind of smells like a dirty sock.","The Sheraton Clayton is a decent hotel. What makes it worth a stay is the friendly and helpful staff. For example, Brenda who works in the restaurant (Alexander's) was very friendly and attentive. The hotel itself is weary and in need of a major overhaul. The dents and dings in the walls and doors show its forlorn state. The garage is dirty and seemingly forgotten. I didn't check out the pool or gym, but from past reviews I conclude that I didn't miss much.There is no full length mirror in the room. There is no refrigerator/freezer. The ice machine on our floor was broken.Just had the fire alarm go off at 2:00 am.  Oh wait, just had it go off at 3:00 am again.  The front desk said its faulty and happens all the time.  Thats very comforting.  Besides that, there were not enough towels in our room, so I asked the housekeeper, she told me to try the pool, that's not very hospitable.  Anyways I went to the pool and there were none to be found.  We also ordered a crib to be in our room, well 2 hours later we finally got it.  So we had our baby screaming for 2 hours because she needed her nap.  And finally the temperature of the room would not go below 75 degrees. I heard other guests say their rooms were either freezing or boiling, so I guess we were lucky.  There are plenty of great hotels in St. Louis, stay at one of those.I stayed here on business for 12 nights. I saw the negative reviews before I came, but I am a loyal SPG customer, so I went with it anyway. This Sheraton had its short-comings, but its staff more than makes up for them.First of all, as of today, the elevator problem is cured. Both elevators work and they are as fast as you would expect medium-aged elevators to be.There is still a limited menu in the kitchen. As other reviewers have noted, this is because of a kitchen fire. I was told by the friendly bartenders that the kitchen will be repaired around the middle of September. The limited menu still has enough variety to satisfy the typical diet. If not, there are loads of nice, walkable restaurants around the area.My room was clean with no signs of excessive wear. Perhaps the carpet could be updated. It was surely enough space, but I am traveling by myself; if there were four people in my room, it would be quite cramped (but perhaps the two double bed rooms have more space).The gym has two tread mills, stair masters, a stationary bike, free weights, and a Nautilus-type machine. There is also an indoor pool and an outdoor space. The pool area isn't as bright as the picture makes it out to be, but it is a great pool for swimming laps. It was also clean and well-maintained.---With all this said, it was the professional staff that made my 12-night stay most pleasant. Everyone was incredibly friendly. Not just the front desk, but the bell hops, the bartenders, and those than cleaned my room. The answer to every request was ""yes"".Call me an apologist, but I was offered a great rate and received a great service. I would certainly stay here again.I went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, and finally landed on 3.  I stayed at this hotel Monday to Thursday nearly every week for almost 3 months.  In casual conversations with friends, I would tell them that I stay ""at a dumpy old Sheraton"" in a suburb of St. Louis.  It is a dumpy old Sheraton, honestly.  BUT it has some good points too.  Bad points:- Small, dumpy rooms in need of renovation- Not very clean, generally- HVAC system mediocre at best- Slow, clunky elevators- Poorly ventilated and poorly equipped gym- Lounge food kind of a let down most days- Slow, unstable internetGood points:- Extremely friendly staff, especially at the front desk area- Location is pretty good, walking distance to lots of places (including metro station)- Bathroom floors that seem to be heated (my favorite part of this hotel, actually)- Glass showers in the bathrooms... good water pressure too- Nice lobby with constantly changing display of fresh flowers- Lounge somehow feels more spacious than in many other Sheratons... multiple TVs too, on different channels- Covered parking below the lobby level- Great hotel shuttle service with nice and competent driverI've stayed here on many occasions and it's a fine hotel, maybe on the low end of the Sheraton brand but I've always found it to be clean and service friendly if sometimes a bit slow due to under-staffing.  The location in Clayton is often good for my needs and parking is easy either in their garage or on the street.  The Club Lounge is fine, my rooms have always been clean and up to Sheraton standards, and other than the slow elevators I've never had much to complain about.  The prices are almost always reasonable - or you can use just 7,000 SPG points for a free night since it's only a Category 3 hotel.  If you want a slightly newer/nicer Sheraton (which still has its flaws) stay downtown at the Sheraton on 14th Street or if you want a really nice Starwood hotel stay at the Westin downtown but don't expect the same level of amenities or perfection from an older and cheaper hotel like this as you would get at a Westin or other high end hotel.One of the nicer hotels I've stayed at. The complimentary airport shuttle was nice and convenient, I just picked up the hotel phone located at Lambert airport and let them know I arrived and needed a ride. The hotel is about 20 minutes or less away from the airport. My room was ready before their standard check-in time, I was only an hour early. I was on the top most floor. My room key also doubled as the elevator key. You need to slide your key in the elevator key slot in order to select any floor in the hotel besides the lobby. The only issue is the elevator key slot was VERY touchy and didn't always accept my key...or anyone else's in the elevator with me. It took numerous tries and when one of them worked everyone scrambled to push their floor. I would have taken the stairs.  But that's 16 flights in a hot stairwell, no thank you.  Getting into my room with my key was never an issue. The room was small but very nice no less, it's in line with a $120-$140/night room quality. But some of the room amenities were a little more than average; a bath loofah (never got one if those from a hotel before), nail file, Starbucks coffee w/ to go cups. Just nice little touches you remember.I was in love with the bed the moment my head hit the pillow, so comfy. The white on white sheets wouldn't have been my choice. I woke up feeling like I had just slept in on cloud 9. Overall, good times. The staff were super friendly, accomodating and took care of any issues I had.On the first day of my stay, there was no milk or creme to be had with breakfast, because it was spoiled. On the next day, all the brown bread in the bread box was green with mould. That's just the restaurant.One of the two elevators was broken for a month, and even when both worked, they seemed poorly programmed and it would take 5 minutes to get an elevator in the morning - to the point where people were late for work as a result.And there was a spurious fire alarm in the middle of the night, which no one could account for, not did anyone apologize for it. Worst stay ever in a hotel of this supposed calibre.I have to drop Sheraton at least one star...ah make that 2.  Apparently they recently had a fire, so their kitchen is very limited. The breakfast buffet that was served was horrible - hard, cold bacon, over-done eggs, tasteless sausage...And the toaster wouldn't toast. They also had an elevator not working. On my floor, the ice maker was making a loud running water sound continuously.  And the vending/soda machine was out of order as well (further compounded by the elevator).  Last but not least, they were unable to print me a receipt (printer wasn't working).  That's just way too many issues for me to consider this as a decent hotel.Don't plan a meeting here. They are inflexible.I seriously can't believe that this is a Sheraton. I wouldn't even call this place as good as a Hampton Inn. Seriously, I've been to roadside Hampton Inns with better rooms and customer service. This place is a shit stain.Last night both myself and my brother I shared my room with complained of sheets making us itchy. I would not be surprised if they were not changed. I went to the front desk. It's 330am. They offer to put me in another room. Great. I get in the ""new room."" It smells like shit and has a vacuum cleaner just hanging there. Finally on the third try they got me a room w/ clean sheets.No bell service (when we got there 5/5 of the carts were in use) The workers may as well wear uniforms that say ""We don't give a shit.""Avoid this place if possible. The name ""Sheraton"" ought to be considered deceptive practice.My stay was terrible. Staff is not as friendly as I would expect for a Sheraton hotel. Someone else described service as ""lukewarm"" and that is the perfect word. When I checked in they only had me reserved for one night, I paid for two. On check out day, they slide a receipt under my door with a charge of $228, I already paid when I booked the room. I go to the front desk and got it fixed, supposedly. A few days later I check my bank account and I was still charged the $228. I call them and they tell me that I need to send them proof of my payment before they will reverse the charge. Should they not have this information? HEADACHEThey charge $10 per night for internet, parking is $14 per day. Their bar prices are outrageous even for a hotel and the bartender was an a-hole. Elevators are slow, I always had to wait a few minuets for them to show up. I actually started to take the stairs instead.I've never stayed here, but various friends and relatives do when they come into town to do business in STL. So, I've had a drink or few in the lobby bar.  The decor is nice and the bartender is a sweetie-pie, although she's a bit overworked.I wouldn't recommend the Sheraton as a drink destination, but if you don't want to waste your precious ""visiting"" time roaming around to find a place to talk, this place will do just fine.We had a billing issue with being charged twice. It took three weeks and at least five phone calls to get anywhere with the billing department. The lady in the billing department was not the friendliest and didn't seem to be very patient. After explaining several times that we were charged twice after signing one receipt for the amount, I gave up and decided to just take it up with my bank. I still enjoyed our stay and room.The room was comfortable. I slept great on the bed. The hotel was clean. The lobby was smelly, though.The internet/parking package was $15/day.I called the hotel before the trip and asked if there were refrigerators in the rooms. I was told that many rooms have refrigerators, but if mine did not, ""it would not be a problem"" to get a refrigerator sent to my room. When I spoke to the front desk employee upon arrival, I asked if there was a refrigerator in my room. I was told that there was not, but he would see if there was one available. I explained that I was told before I arranged to stay there that getting a frig would ""not be a problem.""  He told me that ""it was not a problem;"" if he could find a refrigerator, he would have it delivered. Yeah, so I never got the frig. Nor did I get a call with an explanation.The housekeeping staff were really friendly.Despite the bad reviews this place was given we decided to book a room. To our pleasant surprise it was really nice!The pool was full size and looked really clean. The work out facility was fantastic and the room was really nice and clean. Wifi isn't free, but it was $1 with our park-also not free.The only reason it's getting a 4 is because I found a contact hidden underneath the travel soap bottles, but it still looked really clean other than that!Natasha at the Sheraton Clayton is so accommodating. She was so positive and did an excellent job. I would stay here again due to her superior service in the club suite.As I travel to Clayton on business with some frequency and am a SPG member I have favored this hotel but never again. My previous experience, while tolerable, has now declined to levels that is simply not acceptable. First, they pump the lobby with artificial fragrance that exhibits a strong chemical smell prompting one in my party to look elsewhere due to sensitivities. Second, the workout facilitates are sterile, cramped, and antiquated. But the final straw was when my TV failed. I was staying for two nights and notified the front desk at 7:00am on day one only to come back to the room to find that at 9:00 pm that NOTHiNG had been done and when I inquired with the front desk was sent to ""the manager"" and put on hold for 10 minutes before I grew tired and had to hang up. I am left with the impression that this hotel just doesn't care about its guests, it needs desperate investment, and the service is poor.I simply cannot recommend this hotel for business travelers.Went to MO for a wedding - this was the wedding hotel.  Room block was supposed to be Fri - Mon evenings (Sunday wedding, wedding party events Friday evening through Monday morning).  Was told they were completely booked Friday night (turns out this was untrue as others who booked after us were able to get a room if they raised a stink on the phone...my fault for being polite).  So, they told us they could book us a room for Friday in a nearby Sheraton.  Ok, thinking this is St. Louis, another hotel can't be THAT far away.....it was 40 minutes away and further South (as we were traveling from north of the area).  The Friday night hotel was nice and clean, and the room was wonderful.  Relocated ourselves on Saturday....and were disappointed one thing after another.  -Due to a long line at the arch, we were a little rushed to prepare for the rehearsal dinner Saturday evening - and there was a line at the reception desk due to only one person working.  We waited....and waited....and waited-Elevators were just slow.  consistently very slow.  And even on the main floor, there was not a marking indicating where the elevator was so when you were waiting you were unsure what was going on....took the stairs 7 flights up and down more than once.-Our room was the size of a postage stamp - queen size bed (I think), desk, oversized chair that took up the entire side of the bed and a shower so small it was difficult to turn around in.  No floor mat, so the bathroom floor was cold and damp.  Couldn't open the bathroom door and room door at the same time -Bedding didn't quite fit our bed correctly - it was awkward is the only way I can really explain it.  Bedskirt had a stain that looked suspiciously blood like....-Towels were removed from our room but not replenished (same with toiletries - due to the really small amount of bathroom space and zero counter space, we had an unfortunate incident involving a shampoo bottle and the toilet.....but I digress)-Electrical outlets.....were difficult to find.  Only one night table had a lamp, and it also had a plug, but we had a difficult time finding outlets in other areas of the room.- and couldn't find an outlet near a mirror to do my hair in.  Turns out others who booked AFTER us were given larger rooms (we did actually witness these rooms, they really existed), were given the upgraded toiletries same as those we were treated to when staying at the Sheraton somewhere not near where we needed to be.  Minor detail, but did add to the annoyance.-Internet was almost $10/day.  Free if in the business center.  EXCEPT the server was down for the weekend...the whole weekend.-Parking was NOT included.  When we arrived, they asked if we would be parking and we were informed there was a daily fee.  Ok...except the gate to the lot was wide open all day Saturday and all day Sunday.  ANYONE could have parked there or not, and if you were honest, you were charged (Monday morning we did need our room key to exit).Soooooo, we not only will not be going back (although we do need to return to the area for a conference in the not so distant future - thanks Sheraton for assisting us in narrowing down where not to stay), we would never recommend this facility.  There are quite a few other hotels even in that immediate area that are probably worth checking out.  Normally I don't review hotels, but with one little thing after another adding up, I have to recommend not staying here (turns me off to Sheratons all together).-Parking garage is very cramped, with only 6'2"" clearance. My stock height Chevy Avalanche barely fit. And there's no test bar. Your raised pickup will be a convertible before you know what happened. Take a small car if you're parking there. And it's $14/day w/o valet. -Elevators were always slow, to the point where we almost always took the stairs, and we were on the 8th floor (lobby in on the 3rd).-Our room was quite small. I would not recommend it if you are traveling with children and need a little extra room. In fact, even if you are traveling alone and are the type of person who needs to spread some things out for work, you will be disappointed. The size is really only adequate if you are only seeking a place to sleep and shower, and will not use it for anything else. -We traveled with a baby and asked for a crib to be placed in our room (which they agreed to) when we made the reservation, at check-in, and again 3 hrs after check-in. When it had not arrived by 8 pm, I tried calling guest services, but could never get an answer. Fortunately, we had an emergency pack n play in the truck just in case. -The sheets did not fit well and came off in the middle of the night. In addition to the fact that I discovered no mattress pad, there was a large (3' dia) pee stain on the mattress. And this was not one of those drunken pees that is relatively clear and leaves essentially a water stain on the mattress. I lived in a frat house for 4 years, I know what that looks like. No, this appeared to be a mattress taken from an incontinent octogenarian's home. Dark yellow. Almost green. And apparently I laid directly on it for at least part of the night. Eeeewwwh. -Avoid the breakfast buffet, it was funky. And I'll eat about anything, I'm not picky.-A few positives:  TV was decent. HD with a decent channel selection.  Staff was nice, just not very attentive. It appears the toilet flush could swallow a tube of tennis balls. No worries about clogs, but keep loose clothing and small children back when flushing, as they could be sucked into its vortex.  Shower was decent, but a little small. Needless to say, we won't stay at this hotel again, and will think twice about staying at Sheraton at all anywhere.","This is one the the older Sheraton properties. I stay here when the Westin downtown is full, like this past weekend.  It's okay. Just. OK. The rooms are tired. We were upgraded to a suite but there was no bath tub which made it a challenge to give Junior a bath, but we were too tired from our EXTENDED delay on American Airlines (one star) to complain.Next day, we left the room around 9:00 a.m., and swung by around 2:00 p.m. to change clothes, and guess what? Housekeeping hadn't come by! There was a maid across the hall and I'm all ""So our room is next?"" and she's all ""I don't know nuthin' about YO room!"" So then I HAD to complain.Our room included ""free breakfast"" in the ""club"", but by 9:00 there was, literally, nothing left, and what WAS there wsa incredibly gross! Yucky-poo!I waited 30 minutes for the valet to get my car from the garage . . .you know, little stuff, adds up to big negatives . . . just sayin' . . . Good thing I'm already booked for Thanksgiving at the Westin!I have stayed here a couple times over the last year or so. I must say the only thing that blows me away is the doorman. He always remembers people. Engages in polite conversation and is very nice overall. The lobby is nice to look at, the room is decent. But nothing really special.I was disappointed with the tv. They lied about what channels they have on the channel guide. Pool is filthy.Not a bad room but the common areas, lobby an meeting rooms literally smelled like a porta-john. I got my first whiff walking in from the parking structure in the lower level and thought ""Hey, maybe its just the basement."" But, then upon check-in the stench returned. Not sure if it was just bad cleaning supplies or what but it was bad.The room was nice-enough. I had some issues with the TV which I promise were not user error. I hate how much slower hotel remote change the channels. Just annoying. I was on the 10th floor facing east which was cool so I could see the Arch, but that didn't makeup for the $8.95/day Wi-Fi. Whack!A plus was that they did give me (SPG member) a coupon for a free appetizer with the order of any bar item. Too bad I wasn't able to use it. So I hid it in the room for the next unsuspecting guest.The property is also close to the Metro Link station for a quick ride downtown which was nice. No need to an expensive cab ride.I was in town for a wedding and ended up staying here. Check in was quick but was caught off guard by the 17.00 per night parking (A few bucks more for valet). I just would assume parking would be free here. Despite being an SPG Platinum, there was no upgrade. I know this hotel recently went through a remodel, but I wasn't really impressed with the hotel... I don't know... hard to explain... Our room on the SPG club level floor was about as average as they get. In general, there is absolutely nothing special about this hotel. I did notice that the parking booth gate was always up with nobody to check on who paid for parking and who didn't... Essentially we could have parked for free. This hotel has ""average"" written all over it!Can you give less than a star? AWFUL. Totally nickled and dimed. On EVERYTHING. Internet? Not in the room, less you want to pay 10 bucks per device for rotten wifi that's so slow its useless. Parking? You've got to pay for that.  Encourage me to not get room service so that I can get a '5$' credit on my bill, then ignore my compliance by charging me anyway and then walking in on me at 7:45am? When I had the Do Not Disturb sign on?The staff must be miserable, because they are some of the crankiest and most unfriendly people ever. You do NOT feel welcome here. Wish I had stayed somewhere else!hi i'm going to bump you because i have to go to starbucks to get wifi fast enough to be on yelp to give you a review. you charge people 14.99 a night for that?i stay somewhere else.I think it is safe to say this hotel is very hit or miss with guests because I went into our stay *incredibly* apprehensive about the experience and came out 'a-ok' as my star rating suggests. We did book the hotel on priceline - and I can tell you this was the one hotel I did not want to get. But - alas - it is what we got. Some key highlights that were positives or different for us than what we read on the reviews:*Location - This was a good location for us. We were close to everything we wanted to do and with the Art Fair happening that same weekend was just an added bonus.*Parking (not the parking lot, see below for that) - we did not have to pay for parking (this may have been due to the fact that the St Louis Art Fair was down this street the same weekend, somehow we did not know that, but apparently it worked in our favor)*Service - albeit it not the best, it wasn't half bad. I am not sure if it is just because I was polite and inquired about getting a king size bed (vs the queen in the rooms I had read about) but the front desk actually upgraded us to a king size bed, which put us on the 'club floors' or something of that sort. This also gave us free breakfast and evening snacks in a small room. So - hey go ahead and ask, obviously...this worked in our favor as well. Just remember, being polite and not acting entitled is always a good idea when you want something extra!*Smell - I was rather anxious that it was going to smell terrible as so many reviews mentioned....it only smelled a little in the parking lot, but really not enough to bother me.Some downsides to this hotel that were either true to the reviews or not:*Parking Lot - HORRENDOUS. I am not kidding I almost had a panic attack each time we went in and out. This was enough alone to take off one star.*Elevators - Awkward staff only elevator when you walk in from the garage, guest elevators around the corner and incredibly slow.*Hair Salon/Church Room (?) - This was on the lower level when you went to the parking garage, and was just weird. Seriously.*Room/Bathroom - I think the upgrade to king size helped, but the room was still small. If we would have paid full price I can imagine it would have been more of a negative.I have been staying at this hotel every week since July 2009, and have loved every minute!This hotel was renovated last year, which was a definite upgrade to what it used to be. However, I still wouldn't consider this hotel to be the best I've stayed at in terms of newness and quality of rooms.But it is the best hotel in terms of customer service. The staff here is AMAZING and are so friendly, accomodating, and welcoming. Everyone from the front desk to the bellhops goes out of their way to ensure a happy and great experience.As for the rooms itself, they're fairly clean...some scuffs and/or stains in the carpets, but that is to be expected with a hotel that isn't brand new. The one downside is that some of the rooms have bathrooms with pedestal sinks, as opposed to ones with counters. Just a personal preference, but I like spreading my stuff over the counters and a small sink doesn't really allow me to do that. But the smaller bathroom is made up by a larger than usual bedroom, and all the rooms have flat screen LCD tvs, which is nice.Gym and pool facilities aren't very large, but there's never a crowd either. There's also a club lounge on the 14th floor that serves complimentary drinks and food.I stayed here twice in the past year. This hotel is affordable and is conveniently located in Clayton where you can walk to various restaurants. The rooms here are not large, but they are clean and have been remodeled recently. I really like the walk in showers in the bathroom. This hotel is pet-friendly, which is a great plus. I have eaten a few meals here, and they have been very good. You will have to pay for parking here. I accept this without any anger since this hotel is in an urban area.Sheraton?  Are you sure?  I attended a wedding here early October.  The wedding was beautiful and the ballroom comfortably fit around 250 guests with a bar set up.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  They have a shuttle service to/from the airport which is helpful.  They shuttle also gave us a ride to the wedding church which was nice.  The club room is fully stocked with various coffees and snacks.  So why is this hotel only getting 2 stars from me? Pee-Ew!  There was a constant smell of sewage in the main lobby.  To me, that is unacceptable.  Especially in an area where food is served (the bar is located in the lobby area), the smell was a huge turn off.  The shower was extremely tiny.  I'm a pretty small person and I felt like I barely fit in there.  Also, there was not a single long mirror in the entire room.  I had to go to the hallway to use the mirror.  I've had some great experiences at Sheratons and this was not one of them.The lobby smells like feces. Literally. I am not the only person to note this in the reviews. Every floor has its own unique disgusting odor. Our room's window faced an indoor pool room. And we found the previous guest's hair all over the bathroom. What an atrocious Sheraton.This is a very unfriendly hotel.  They may lure you in with a reasonable price, but as soon as you walk in the door, the add-ons ensue.  You want 2 beds instead of one?  $20/night.  Internet is over $15 a day (it's free in the lobby, but you keep getting bumped off).  Parking's extra.  As you sign in, they try to talk you out of  Your privacy sign on the door is ignored.  Even with the sign, housekeeping bangs on your door at 7:30am.  Really?  Really.Great location, clean rooms, good rates, attentive front desk staff, bartender gave a strong pour, dog friendly, what more can you ask for.  Parking for oversized vehicles is easily solved by entering at the alley.  $14 isn't all that much so won't complain about that.First off, the staff is excellent and nice.  REally a 2.5, but read on. the Room: For the pricing tier, the rooms are a tad too small to what I have seen for the same price elsewhere.  Very drafty.. BRRR!  Sadly had to have the heater on much higher than normal which meant it was a bit more white noise than desired. Bathroom is nice with upgraded fixtures but I was really confused that the handles were on outside of shower slide doors but not in?That's confusing at 6am in the morn. Also, something I note at a lot of hotels - the vent in the bathroom - these should be cleaned out. Nothing creeps me out more than showering and looking up to see wads of particulate dust and other gunk clinging to the inside of the grates of these vents. Remember the vents do draw air up and out, so the stuff isn't coming back in to you, but, hey, when you're away from home, you want to feel like you're in a clean environment. For the desk area, I'm a love of outlets, and I think a powerstrip is great, but a powerstrip ziptied to the leg of the desk, while functional and efficient, kinda ruins the hosted room motif, like say at a hotel.  I'm sure the 'professional suites' are a lot more cleaned up, but alas, that was not what I saw. Wireless: In the room it is a pay, slow, complicated. Not easily identifiable.  The wireless network was not labeled ""sheraton"" but something like ""networklan-08"". Now in the lobby, sheraton offers free access and work stations. Parking: complicated- If you've never been here, you're not sure where to go in to park, and the parking lot is a challenge itself and IMHO not marked well. Access to the hotel is a little weird, too. On the lower levels you have to walk back up the transition ramps to a door located half way up the ramp Parking: at the desk they give you a mirror badge, but don't explain you have to keep the ticket with which you entered their garage.Elevators require to badge with room key to access any guest room floor. That was ok but never explained, so it takes you off guard the first time you are in the lifts.Take the airport shuttle if you wish to stay here. Enterprise is on property. I would have done that if I had known. Location: Really the location is great and for the most part all freeways are accessible. I would check with the front desk on the most efficient ways to your destination if you are a first time visitor, though. Redemption: a great indoor pool. Warm, clean, large. But bring your goggles or the chlorine will hurt. Clean workout room with good freeweights. Great lobby. The restaurant is pretty decent. Nothing extravagant but attentive and good for on site. I'm marking it pricy as the room, although renovated, fell short of expectations. I think that this is more indicative of the property, though, and once you get familiar with the quirks and the rooms, you should be fine.I was worried when I saw the two-star reviews after I booked this place...but it appears that the renovations are mostly complete now.  The hotel lobby is very modern with nice touches of the older architecture.  I enjoyed the free airport shuttle, but it would be nice if they had two shuttles...you have to reserve it early to make sure you can get on if you need to be somewhere at a certain time.The hotel staff have been a little spotty with service--some are very helpful, some are not as much.  They gave us one free breakfast coupon for the restaurant, but it was a little awkward when I went an hour before their scheduled closing and they kept trying to hurry me to finish because they needed to set up for a luncheon.  They kept apologizing, so it was okay, but I was a tad annoyed because I had called earlier to find out when breakfast was over, and that would have been a prime time for them to tell me they were closing early for a luncheon but I did not get that information.The room was small, but nice, and the bathroom was completely updated.  The beds are very comfortable.  I did notice a hammering sound for a little while during the day so there might be some renovations still being completed, but everything looked new (except for the carpeting in the hallways where the rooms are).  I got a really good price here on Priceline.  Another plus is the nearby metro stop.  However, they do not have free continental breakfast, or free in-room internet, you can only use it down in the lobby or pay for it.It took awhile to check in. I was very disappointed with the rooms. They are tiny with no room to move about. If you are a larger person you will have problems getting in and out of the bathroom. There is only one mirror ehich is in the bathroom. The doors are very thin so you can hear people talking (which also means they can hear you). We could also hear the kids in the pool 2 floors below us.Their website also states they serve complimentary breakfast and hor d'eurves in the Club Lounge.  What they do not tell you is that the Club Lounge is for Sheraton Club Members (a paid membership) only.  We were supposed to be told this when we checked in but the gentleman failed to tell us this.We DID receive excellent service in the ""regular folks"" lounge.  Jonathon mixed up a great drink, was very friendly, and we did not have to wait for our drinks.  Thanks Jonathon!A family wedding precipitated our recent stay at the disappointing Sheraton Clayton Plaza Hotel. In retrospect, it was an ominous sign when we called the bridal party (who had arrived ahead of us) from the airport and they reported that they were still waiting in the lobby for their room--two hours after the hotel's published check-in time. We arrived to a lengthy wait for the sole clerk at the front desk to assist us with check-in. Our low-floor room featured a scenic view of a neighboring roof, which was enhanced by an air conditioning compressor located immediately outside our window. While the room itself was clean and appeared to be somewhat recently remodeled, the hotel's vintage paper-thin walls and shoddy connecting doors allowed our neighbor's television noise to bother us well into the early morning. The location of our room ended up being a blessing in disguise, as just two archaic passenger elevators slowly underserved the entire 250+ room hotel, resulting in lengthy waits. Our preferred route to the lobby one floor below ended up being the fire stairs. While we didn't see any members of bell staff during our visit, one did appear as we were departing. Not to assist with our luggage or our elderly wheelchair-bound family member, mind you, but rather to inquire after we had finished loading the car if we were done with the luggage trolley that we had hauled around ourselves! Speaking of wheelchairs, the multi-level lobby relies on a hodgepodge of ramps and slow lifts, so the hotel is sadly not a great choice for travelers with mobility issues. With a dated and aging physical plant, obvious staff training issues, and several better options nearby, I cannot envision a scenario in which the Shearton Clayton Plaza Hotel would be any traveler's first choice on a visit to the St. Louis area.3.5Stayed at this hotel for three nights for a weekend wedding.  It started out nice, as we were picked up by the shuttle from the airport, which makes things easy when you are in a new city.  Our driver was very friendly, and assisted with everything.Check-in was a breeze.  We were met with a friendly greeting and were quickly checked in.  Once we got to our room, we saw it was a little smaller than we thought, but it was bright and clean.  I had read the review about the bathroom and lack of space, but there were two glass shelves that allowed the beau and I both to have space to spread our stuff out.  And the pedestal sink was actually kind of a nice touch.  The only real complaints I had with the place are it seems the maid service came really late in the day.  (Between 4pm-5pm.)  So we didn't get things reset for the second night.  When sleeping the gap under the door was rather larger, which let quite a bit of light into the room.  I was closer to the window, but if I'd had a mask, would have used it.  The noise level was also a little loud.  It looked like there was a conference with a lot of 20 somethings there, which added to it.  We lucked out with an end unit, which did cut back on some noise.Oh, and I will end with a positive-the water!  The hotel lobby houses water in the afternoon...water with strawberries, water with cucumbers, water with lemon.  I never do it at home, but I love me some cucumber water.  It definitely refreshes!I was a little apprehensive about staying here due to the other yelp reviews.  However, I felt that the hotel wasn't as bad as the reviews made it out to be.  The lobby is amazing.  They have free wi-fi and computers with printing available in 45 minute increments.  I loved my room.  While I can understand why some would view it on the smaller end, it worked for me.  The main benefit of this hotel is its proximity to a lot of stuff.  Down the street are numerous restaurants.  There's also a pretty good mall nearby.  The hotel offers free shuttle service to/from the airport and to other areas within a 5 mile radius.  Overall, this hotel was nice and clean.  It's in a great location where there's lots to do.","I was really disappointed in this hotel because it's a Sheraton and I've generally had good experiences with Sheraton.  The bedding in the hotel rooms is all white and I was disappointed when I saw the other bed in the room had coffee stains and scuff marks on the white dust ruffle (all over it) which led me to look at everything closer -- finding marks on the bed comforter too.Lights Out. The room was dusty all over and all of the lights were unplugged when I came in. I could barely see and had to move furniture to plug-in lights. Second day not much brighter. Room service left me with cold bacon, lukewarm tea and under cooked eggs. Not the way to kick-start my day. I have to stay here again tomorrow. Hoping for a better outcome.What really ups my rating from 2 to 3 stars is the staff.  The shuttle driver, bellman, and front desk staff are super nice.  Unfortunately I didn't think the cleanliness was 100%... one day they didn't clean my room after I talked to housekeeping staff and explained when I would be leaving, and the next day they did, but I could have made the bed better myself.  The room had not been vacuumed before my arrival.  Kinda gross.My room, on the 8th floor, was kind of noisy.  Some sound that I could never distinguish that kinda sounded like planes taking off but not as loud...It could have been the elevators?  Anyway, not super loud but just a constant background noise.Complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning, but there's also a good little cafe across the street (the Patio Cafe).There are computer stations and printing (free) in the lobby.  In-room wireless is pay by the day and kind of slow.Free shuttle to and from the airport and within 5 mi radius is a major plus.  Did I mention the front desk staff are super nice?  The hotel's front desk phone was broken and the manager gave his cell number as an alternate number.I was in town for business and the hotel was a good location for what I needed.  Lots of good/cute restaurants nearby (Remy's is great and literally like right around the corner).All I'm going to say is plan on paying out the ass for everything.Don't expect free wireless.  Don't expect free parking.  Don't expect much if you're planning on staying here.The 2 stars are for the friendly staff. That's the only good part of this hotel. While the Sheraton Clayton has been updated recently, it feels incomplete. The hallways are dark and old; the vents are old and crepy. The bathroom looks nice, but why bother with a pretty chrome sink if no one EVER bothers to polish or dust it?! The room never felt very clean. When I arrived, there was a dirty tissue next to my bed!!! Ew!! Although my room was tidied each day, the coffee cups were not stocked (they brought more upon my request), the bath mat was not replaced  and they never bothered to leave another breakfast menu (even though I ordered coffee and breakfast the first morning) and I stayed 3 nights!!The room service dining was below average. The first night they called about my sandwich and I told them that it was not very good (a dry chicken breast on a ""panini"" aka toast). The manager kindly credited my bill for the sandwich. However, the next night that I ordered room service, they called my room THREE times to follow up. I was feeling under the weather and it was TERRIBLY annoying to have them call repeatedly and NOT leave a message. That is just Rude. I finally answered the phone so that they would leave me alone!I would not recommend this hotel to a friend. While the staff is friendly, they just cannot make up for the hotel's other shortcomings.I attended a conference here in late October 2011.  I will not stay at the location again.  We paid about $130 a night.  Self parking was $14 per day or valet parking was $19 per day - we opted for valet parking so that we didn't have to bother with hunting our car in the garage or hunting a space when we came back...The good:  Our room and restroom appeared fairly clean - the bathroom could have used a little more work in getting the walls clean.  The entry was lovely.  The bar and lounge area were a nice gathering space.  The personnel were helpful, nice, and quick to help.  The room had a large HD thin panel TV ( channel offering was poor).The Bad: The two things that stand out more than anything are the size of the room (extremely small) and the bed - ATROCIOUS! - like sleeping on the floor it was so hard.  The bathroom was nicely appointed but tiny and there was no bathtub - just a walk in shower - which, for us, was not a problem.  The towels were very soft at arrival but like cardboard the following days at replacement.  The tissue and toilet paper - cheap and rough.  The housekeeper indicated that we needn't use the recycle receptacle because they threw it into one bin anyway - apparently it was just for show.  The bed...I barely slept the three nights we were there.  The bed was rock hard.  There appeared to be no mattress cover - just a sheet with some type of pad underlayment that sounded plastic in the middle of the bed.  ( I don't even want to know.) I got up sore each morning.  That was the only place to sit in the room as well.  There was no fridge or microwave either.  The coffee in the room was way too strong, even if it was a Starbucks brand.  The hotel did not offer a breakfast...shame on them.I wouldn't stay here again.  And only stayed here because it was convenient to go to my conference downstairs.  I never have a bad stay at a Hampton Inn...I'll find it the next time...I should have known better...I thought this hotel was fabulous, for the price you pay. For me, it was only about $115, and that's including all the taxes and fees associated. I know some people who managed to get rates $10 less for the same weekend, too. The rooms are adequately sized, especially since this is definitely a business hotel. There's no room for extended stays - but basically that means that instead of having two side tables, one side table was actually the desk. There was also a rolling office chair and a dresser with a relatively large flat screen tv (considering the room size, I mean. they also had a full length mirror in a niche where you can set up the luggage rack. The bed is super comfy, too. The bathroom had quality fixtures, and you can tell that in their renovations, they took measures to efficiently design the space. Notice the sink, while not in a counter, has a wide rim (for putting stuff on), and a glass shelf has been installed over the toilet. I had a lot of toiletries and I had no problem laying everything out. I was a little annoyed that I found you had to pay for in-room wireless, but free internet is available at a table with computers set up to the side of the bar. The bar itself was cozy with a nice ambiance, and the bartender was a cool guy. I did speak with someone who was a bit catty on the phone, but upon arrival, everyone was charming and accommodating. There's even an hourly shuttle to the airport, as well as local shuttle service. All in all, I'd definitely stay here again.In town for a wedding, this was the hotel to be at, due to trolley connections and other wedding functions.  Thinking it'd be nice, as it appeared that it was recently renovated, I was looking forward to hanging by the pool and relaxing during downtime between wedding events.I had high expectations when I checked in, as the lobby was truly lovely.   However, the lukewarm reception from the front desk clerk took me aback.  I know it was midnight, but come on, be a little bit more welcoming.  Upon parking and entering the hotel via the parking garage, I was definitely more apprehensive.  It appears that the renovations (touted as being completed in early 2008) have yet to be completed.  We were assigned one room and unfortunately lugged all of our bags upstairs to find out the door wouldn't open.  It seemed as if the door was dead-bolted.  When I went down to the front desk, the front desk surmised ""Maybe someone is in there?!""  Hmm, you'd think you'd investigate that before you assigned that room to us.  In any event, in short order, we had another room, without two beds as I'd requested, but at this point, I was tired and cranky, and just wanting a place to put my stuff.The room was ridonkulously small.  For two girls with a lot of stuff, it was just too small.  Too much furniture, you could barely maneuver around in there.  The decor was lovely, clearly this was a room that had been redecorated.  But no fans in the bathroom for a door that wouldn't stay open is sure to lead to some mold problems.Yes, there is an indoor pool, which looked nice, but you couldn't access the sun deck.  And the fitness area looked very nice as well (and new), but I didn't use the facilities.The kicker?  They charged me $14 a night for parking.  For not even downtown St. Louis?  Come on, this just seems excessive.I was not thrilled with the hotel.  If I had a choice, I'd likely not stay here again.I stayed here for business and was overall very well pleased with my experience.  I arrived after midnight on a Monday night, and the front desk representative (Susan) was wonderful.  She was efficient and went beyond the call of duty to help me.  She looked up restaurants in the area that would deliver good food after midnight, and offered to call in the order.  When I asked her about the location of the company with which I was meeting the following day, she asked me to call her with the address once I arrived in my room, and she would print out directions and map and slip it under my door.  Not only did she deliver, but she had a great sense of humor and a nice warmth about her.  VERY refreshing!My room was smaller than most hotel rooms in which I've stayed, but very comfortable, nicely decorated, updated and very clean for one person.  The queen bed had beautiful linens and was the most comfortable bed I've experienced for many years!  I loved the Starbucks coffee and coffee brewer/maker.   The flat screen TV and available programming was perfect.  I easily was able to control the room temperature.The hotel had free Wi-Fi available all over the lobby, lounge, and restaurant, and it was quick and easy to connect and use for hours.I had two breakfasts and one dinner in the restaurant, and happy hour once in the bar/lounge.  Food was great and service was exceptional!  A group of us had dinner in the restaurant, and we were a bit concerned/wary because there was only one other party having dinner during the time we were there.  However, we were so pleasantly surprised!  A few of us had steaks and they were melt-in-your-mouth and seasoned perfectly.  One guy had a beautiful chicken pasta dish that he loved and a few people had salmon that they devoured with gusto!  Nice vegetables, good and reasonably priced wine selection, and tasty desserts.  Again, I was very impressed by the customer service.  Everyone was warm and personable, went beyond the call of duty, and really displayed a great sense of exceptional customer service.  No arrogance or impatience or ambivalence among anyone I encountered.I am a regular guest at Starwood Hotels ever since they introduced the Heavenly Bed &amp; Heavenly Bath. They did something similar with Sheraton &amp; the whole industry upgraded as a result. Thank you Starwood for that. I'm finding however that Starwood is now missing their next ""upgrade"". This hotel is an example. It is a classic old school hotel in an old school city. While rather nice, I just feel like I'm in a hotel my grandmother would have frequented. While that is acceptable in the lobby, I want the rooms to be decorated in a more modern &amp; cheery way. The Sheraton Clayton Plaza is by no means a bad hotel. It just could use a more updated look, especially in the rooms. They also need to figure out the elevator situation (very slow) and it wouldn't hurt to do something a little more appealing to the outside deck on the 5th floor. It's stark, hot and feels like you are sitting on someone's bare roof. How about a deck, a few tables &amp; umbrellas?This hotel is currently undergoing renovations that are scheduled to be completed sometime in early 2008.  I have stayed at this hotel for the past 3 weeks (Jan 6 - 10, Jan 13 - 17 and Jan 20 thru 24).  On several occasions during each, I worked in the room during the day and found that the water was shut off from 9am to 3pm and that there was construction noise (drilling / hammering sounds on floors above or below).  Not pleasant.  I guess if you're away at the office during the day, it won't matter.  From the condition of the rooms, I can see why they are undergoing renovations.  The decor is dated and uninviting.  The bathrooms are a straight copy of some 1960's suburban house - formica countertops, checkered tile on the floors, etc.  My first thought upon arriving here the first week was ""this place is a dump"".  Certainly not what I am used to seeing at other Sheraton properties.  The only reason I have continued to stay here is because this is the only Starwood property close to St. Louis Lambert Airport.  Hopefully, the renovations are completed on schedule.There are some positive things about this property:1) Covered parking - good when it snows2) Club lounge offers breakfast until 9am, snacks / light fare (pasta or pot stickers or fried wontons, etc) in the evenings until 9pm.3) Indoor swimming pool",,"['bar', 'restaurant', 'called', 'doll', 'attentive', 'provides', 'friendly', 'service',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-seasons-hotel-saint-louis-2,Four Seasons Hotel,4.5,$$$,87,"We had our firm Christmas lunch here recently. People were not sure what to think about the idea of haveing it the Four Seasons but all i can say is that it was Phenomenal. Its hard to make 150+ people happy and accommodate all needs during a Christmas party. The Four Seasons was able to do that plus more. The food was from the restaurant and it was fantastic. The steak was cooked perfectly, the chicken was tender. The mashed potatoes actually had flavor and the drinks were very well made The service was top notch and professional. They never frowned or scorned the tipsy party goers and were accommodating in every way shape and from. The location allowed us to go outside and take a breather from everything. All in all the outcome of the party was great. Everyone seemed to have enjoyed themselves and no one had a single negative thing to say which is unheard of when you have company parties. I hope that they continue this route and have it again here next year!My first time staying at a Four Seasons and it wasn't exactly what I expected. I hoped for more and got less.I'm not a hotel snob, but when you hear ""Four Seasons"" you expect luxury all the way. The service and amenities are probably exemplary. I have to say that the service really was. From the valet to the front desk, the workers were all friendly and went above and beyond what other hotels would have. In terms of amenities, they were lacking. This hotel is really small. I mean they had their pool and luxurious touches in the hotel room, but there was really only one communal floor for guests to enjoy the view. It also included the only restaurant as well. The front desk is basically that. It is only a desk with no grand lobby and then you have to go up two elevators to get to the hotel rooms. The rooms were spacious and felt luxurious with its Samsung TV and automated light switches. My favorite part of the room was the bed. One of the best mattresses I've ever slept on. I even inquired about it with the people at the front desk. My next one is going to be one of those. The location is fine if you are totally into gambling. You are right next door to the casino, but when you look out the window at night, the area looks pretty sketchy. In order to get to the casino, you have to go down two elevators and then walk down a few flights of stairs and through several doors. I wouldn't feel safe going back to my room at night if I were to take that route, especially if you have a lot of winnings. No real security. This hotel is the nicest one that is connected to the casino, but I'm pretty sure that there are other Four Season hotels that give you more bang for your buck.My boyfriend and I stayed at the Four Seasons for Valentine's Day and I could not have been happier! I don't give out 5 star ratings lightly but they earned  it. A breathtaking view in our room, amazingly nice service and everything you could ask for in a luxury hotel. Already planning our anniversary trip for the summer so we can enjoy the pool. So worth the money spent!Love this place for the class and the view etc.... Wish after 15 check ins the sommelier would remember us??? Wish the turnover was not so high but I will say every time I'm there the main valet person, always remembers me and welcomed me back.... Love him!!! He gets the 5th star!!! Please get rid of the kale in the Caesar salad... Not a good change....My new goto place to stay in the Lou.Quiet bedrooms, fast internet, clean rooms. Super nice staff that will bend over backwards to help the customer.Free shoe shine every night. 2X a day room cleaning.Really nice workout facility. Very new  and light atmosphere and very upscale. Outdoor pool, indoor hot tub and steam room.On site restaurant and bar. Fresh vegetable juice made to order on the menu.AAA all the way!Unfortuately, I was in this hotel for less than 24 hours. Fortunately, the small amount of time I spent there was quite memorable. On a business trip, I arrived in the early evening. From the minute I arrived at the Four Seasons until I left, the employees were always ready and willing to help me with any questions, my bags and special requests. In a word, they were all very doting. I had the King sized room with the Arch View. Wow, the morning sunrise view overlooking the Mississippi River and the Arch was absolutely gorgeous. The bed was extremely comfortable with super fluffy sheets. The bathroom was huge....almost bigger than the rest of the room. Not only is there a separate shower and bathtub, there's a TV in the bathroom... Pretty neat. Didn't have much time to enjoy it but still cool to see!Lastly, the in hotel restaurant is Cielo. I highly recommend it. Not only is the wait staff attentive and friendly, the good was pretty delicious. We had 14 people at dinner and I didn't hear one complaint. My dish was lamb chops, baby carrots and eggplant parmesan and it was absolutely delectable!Kind of an odd layout for a hotel but still a solid Four Seasons experience. The first floor is really just the entrance. You need to get into the elevators to make the run up to the 8th floor, past the casino level, to get to the actual lobby of the hotel. Once there you can start to feel at home.Getting to the rooms is done through another set of elevators that need your key to punch buttons and that is a welcome firewall between room access and the casino, etc.Service is what you would expect for a Four Seasons and the rooms are nice, roomy, and the bathroom layout works for being away as well. The bonus for me was opening the window shades and seeing a wonderful view of the Gateway Arch which is easily walkable from the hotel -- taking only about 20 minutes to get there which is a little longer than it should be because of all of the construction in the area.This hotel sets the bar when it comes to 'pet friendly' hotels.  When we arrived our room was waiting including a four seasons dog bed for our pup.  The staff is incredibly friendly and is quick to remember your name.  The on-site restaurant is delicious and the pool/spa areas, second to none.  We love this hotel and look forward to each visit.I spent the night at this hotel with my son and niece, and got an arch view premier room. From the moment the valet parked my car, we were treated with the best care. The kids were in awe with the room that was stocked with a snack bar and juice. The beds were comfortable and the view to die for. We were able to walk to restaurants easily, and the staff was pleasant and courteous. My son even got to pick a toy out of a wagon when we arrived. The hotel stay with kids was made a seamless as possible and I will definitely be staying here from now on when visiting St. Louis. The spa was also beyond amazing. It was comparable to 5 star spa encounter I had in Chicago, which I expected, but was blown away by in St. Louis. The individualized care given really puts the Four Seasons above everything else.Very high quality hotel.  It has a beautiful view of the arch and the room, bed, lobby, toiletries and service are impeccable.  We were only able to get a room for one night because of the holiday weekend but it was perfect.  The pool was amazing along with the poolside service.  Highly recommend!The casino is quite.... smoky.... and they should change the ventilation down there but we barely walked thru that area.Another awesome thing about this  hotel is that the whole darn place smells like a high class spa! It's worth it.  Soooo worth it.I love this hotel. I came here for Purina's Leadership training and I'm so glad they chose this hotel. The staff are very friendly and provide me with everything I need! The food is also up to par. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the hotel food. Their pasta dishes, breakfast and dessert were all on point. I wanted to eat more! I think I had 5 servings of their tiny tiramisu. I loved their lunch boxes too, I had a mushroom wrap that was so flavorful and full! They also provide a ton of water bottles and snacks. Their conference room is huge and again, endless food and drink service. When I came back from a jog, they offered me water and basically anytime I came in or out, I got a water bottle. I loved the bathroom. And the piece of chocolate on my pillow every time the room was clean. They also have a great lounge area; the pool is huge with great scenery. You can get to the casino without exiting the hotel.Was a great stay.Room was immaculate; comfortable.  Service was great and the hotel as a whole was great. My stay went without any problems and non of the issues use Im used to like noisy rooms, bad service, dirty or no good options to eat.Excellent full service spa..treatment, poor, sauna, fitness center, even room service after directly to the relaxation room.  Only issue is every small request comes with a price tag...I don't mind paying for a service but damn!  An aspirin was $1 and a mini birthday cupcake was $25.  Wow....Great atmosphere,  food, and customer service . I really enjoyed my caesar salad with salmon, cooked to perfection.  Our server Joel from Puerto Rico was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Great team work. Will come back again.Stayed here on 8/26/15 and loved every minute of my stay. The hotel offers valet for a fee, worth it to me. The hotel was beautiful, clean and smelled fantastic. I felt refreshed before I'd even completed checking in. The room was clean, with a fantastic bathroom (L'Occitane) and an even better view. Ordered room service for both dinner and breakfast the following morning. Both meals were served within the designated time and were set up in my room by professional hotel staff. The hotel staff, including front desk upon check-in/check-out were incredible kind and courteous. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others.OUTSTANDING hotel was some amazing views. This is a great Four Seasons Hotel that overlooks the Arch and Mississippi river. Rooms are newer and the restaurant  (Cielo) is great with lots of outdoor seating and great views of pool, fountains and the Arch. The Lobby Bar is also excellent with amazing Arch and riverfront views. BE SURE to get a room with an Arch view (south) as the north view is quite bland. There is an attached upscale CASINO--which is rare for any Four Seasons. Casino offers a few extra restaurant, shopping and entertainment options. The area is NOT a great place to walk. North of hotel is industrial and South part near Arch is under construction--so plan to take a cab, car or private car service (they have them lined up usually.) SERVICE is superb and prices are very reasonable for a Four Seasons. Be sure to check out the Arch views, casino, Cielo, bar and you will have a great stay in St. Louis. Short cab ride to some amazing attractions like Busch Stadium AND new Ballpark Village, the Crazy Fun 'City Museum', the Arch, Edward Jones Dome, Washington Avenue (bars and restaurants), Soulard (bars and restaurants). For a real treat, look for an authentic Italian restaurant on ""The Hill"" area or go upscale to nearby 5-Star ""Tony's.""I walked into the Lobby of this Four Seasons and was greeted by one of the concierges who noticed that my backpack was frayed along the seam where the shoulder straps connect to the pack. She offered to have it repaired, and said it would be done free of charge. 5 hours later, the pack was dry cleaned, and hanging in the closet in my room. Everything about this hotel is first-class, and the staff's attention to detail and willingness to assist is exemplary.Recently spent one evening at the St. Louis Four Seasons. Reception at this hotel was friendly enough, room was typical for a Four Seasons. Our room had a great view of the arch and river - probably the best part. We had brunch at the hotel restaurant Cielo no complaints there. Food was very good.I just can't rate our stay higher than 3 stars due to the fact that there were minor issues that I would expect more from a Four Seasons top shelf hotel.Room safe did not work. I'm a little crazy about hotel cleanliness and there was goopy leftover soap or shampoo in both the shower and tub (ick!). At some point our tv was not functioning and it was a real bummer as we spent over an hour trying to figure it out - I just wanted to veg out in a comfy robe and watch some mindless tv. Upon checkout we mentioned it and were told the system was going through an reboot, would have been nice if we were notified before. We also asked for Sunday paper delivery and never received it. It could have been a fluke and the four seasons may be your best bet in St. Louis but I was a little underwhelmed. Visit any other Four Seasons and you will see why this one didn't seem to measure up.Can't beat this place in St. Louis for service or location.  Close to the major sports stadium and major sites, its a great hotel.  If you are a gambler, its a bonus that its attached to the Lumiere.  Not my thing, but you can get your gamble on close by.As for a room with the arch view.  the ""city"" view, is a bit less picturesque, you might say.  service and amenities are top drawer.  Only pet peeve is no coffee in the room.  What's up with that?  You can go down to the lobby for fresh coffee, but that is not how my mornings work.Self Parking is adventurous but free.  Valet if you want to feel like a rock star.  One of the other things I love about this hotel is the smell.  it smells clean and  fresh, like citrus, all of the time.  Treat yourself, you won't be disappointed.Amazing hotel. The rooms are huge and comfortable, the hotel staff is very friendly and courteous. The room view was totally unbelievable. This is by far the nicest hotel in St Louis. Will stay again and don't want to stay anywhere else.","Without question the best hotel in saint Louis. If you want to be pampered, this is the only choice. Everything there is high quality. The towels are big and soft, and Turkish cotton. The rooms come with a variety of k cups and Keurig machine. The rain showers are complimented by L'occitane products, and the bedding is ironed and crisp. The views are amazing, and the Four Seasons is absolutely the best hotel for bursting the winter blues as their rooftop heated pool and hot tub are open all year round. They welcome pets with treats, a water bowl, and a little bottle of Evian and a scarf! Although the hotel itself has the highest quality amenities, the staff is really what makes this hotel the best. They go above and beyond any expectation of satisfaction to accommodate any request. I live in saint Louis and come here for vacation. I'm headed there tomorrow, and I can't wait! Oh, parking is free and if you use the app, you can request all the things you like before you even get there like extra products, kids products, coffee, extra robes, anything. I just made my list... I found they even offer eye masks! This hotel is worth every cent. Check out is 12 noon, o you can even enjoy the morning.The Pool Deck and the Pool Parties overlook the Mississipi River and The ARC. The Food Served for banquets n all dat sexy stuff is really good, &amp; if U doing the Uncle G thang they got a kids meal.Extremely rude service at the time of check-in.  I was made to wait in the lobby for an hour awaiting confirmation of a reservation made by my spouse even though I showed them the email confirmation of the reservation.  We have stayed in Four Seasons Hotels and other luxury hotels around the world, but this one is the absolute worse in terms of customer courtesy.  This issue was discussed with the front desk manager who was very courteous and apologetic for his staff's behavior.  I am satisfied with the resolution to this problem.My stays at Four Seasons hotels are typically only for really special splurge type of get-aways such as my honeymoon and a post-kid weekend away with my husband.  So when I scored a sweet deal at the Four Seasons STL during a recent work trip, I was oh so excited!It was only one night, but it was such a treat... This Four Seasons in the 'Lou delivered on everything you'd expect from such a high end brand name and more.  From the friendly service all around, the spacious, immaculate room, the fabulous amenities and products, comfortable bed, quality restaurant (with views of the Arch included), and awesome fitness room to the spa and casino that I hope to experience next visit, this hotel really does offer it all.I only hope to score a similar deal in the future... I could definitely get used to Four Seasons for all of my travels!Originally was the stay at luminere.  Issue with the room they had so they put me up at the four seasons.  Great staff and amazing overall accommodations.  Thank you.This is a Four Seasons by name only. The experience unfortunately, is not up to par with the luxury hotel brand that we are accustomed to from multiple other locations around the world. We stayed here for the first time at the beginning of June for four nights. My parents hosted an engagement dinner for my fiance and I in one of the private dining rooms on the Saturday night of our stay. From the moment of our check-in to the party itself to check-out, everything was a little off. The front desk took over 10 minutes to check us in, and didn't seem to be familiar with the Fine Hotels &amp; Resorts amenities. He also came to inform us half an hour later (while eating a late lunch at the hotel restaurant) that our spa reservations for the following day were booked for 5 PM instead of 4 PM, which I had to personally clarify by walking down to the spa during lunch to clear up the mass confusion. The rooms are average - the building still looks new-ish, despite being built over eight years ago. The floor to ceiling windows (overlooking the Arch and the freeway) provide plenty of natural light. The color palette is off putting - an odd mix of reds/burgundies, moss green, and beige. It feels like staying at an upscale Sheraton airport hotel. The hallways smell like faded cigarette smoke, which I suppose isn't that surprising given its proximity to a large casino next door. The first night of our stay, they forgot to do turn down service. The next night, the housekeeping staff (or someone) opened our bottle of complimentary champagne in the room while we were gone, so that by the time we returned to our room, the ice in the bucket had completely melted and we were left with a flat bottle of opened champagne floating in a water bath. Very strange. The massages at the spa were quite lovely and probably the highlight of our stay - a full 50 minutes of blissful relaxation. The spa area in general is spacious and calming, but unfortunately overlooks the muddy brown Missouri River. I suppose the hotel can't be blamed for its unpleasant surroundings. Our engagement party was organized by the catering manager and we were lucky that no other events/private dinners were occurring the same evening so we had complete privacy. The food options consisted of many choices (pre selected by us a few weeks prior) for an appetizer, entree, and dessert - I was genuinely looking forward to an enjoyable meal. I'm sad to report that the beef sirloin entree was truly terrible - I can't emphasize how awful it was. The meat was rubbery, tough, tasteless, and unappealing on the plate lumped next to a pile of potatoes. The White Castle we ate a few hours later after going to a bar tasted better than this, which is saying something. The best part is that the director of private events/catering stopped by during our dinner to shake hands with myself, my fiance, and my parents (I think actually while we were trying to stomach said beef) to congratulate us on our upcoming nuptials, and I'm sure to try and rally up some more business from us for the wedding itself (no way in hell). He also stopped by the next morning at our breakfast as well. (As you can see, the hotel employees here apparently like to interrupt your meals at any given opportunity). The location of the hotel sucks. Unless you're into gambling in which case you'll enjoy the smoke filled casino. The Landing is the only nearby attraction - once upon a time, this was an appealing option for me as an undergrad student looking for a cheap place to drink with friends. Ten years later, it does not shine quite as brightly - revisiting some old haunts during the day (while sober, engaged, and with family) made it abundantly clear that not only have things not changed since I've been gone, but it has perhaps gotten worse. Dilapidated brick roads with bars that have since shut down and turned into empty spaces with no signs of promising new developments make for a depressing walk down memory lane. Until downtown St Louis finally revitalizes itself, staying at this hotel will require a car to get out of the area during the day and a really good reason to be in St. Louis period. I would not recommend hosting any kind of private event here as the food really is detestable and there are far better options (i.e. buy out a restaurant) around the city. In terms of the hotel itself, it's probably your best option in St. Louis unfortunately, since the Ritz is quite outdated and probably in need of a major makeover. I dunno, is that an endorsement? Methinks not.Four Seasons Hotel is a great place to stay if you are in downtown St. Louis, MO. I had a beautiful room, with a view of the Gateway Arch, and Mississippi River. The bathroom is gorgeous. Overall impression is new and modern -- television screen in bathroom mirror; towels are soft, and the perfect thickness. Everything impeccably arranged, and superbly clean. The shower has modern fixtures with a waterfall shower. L'Occitane products generously displayed. Four Seasons Hotel, St. Louis has an exceptional housekeeping team. Everything was spotless and impeccable when I arrived, and throughout my stay.The first morning, I awoke later than usual, due to room being blissfully quiet, bed being so cozy comfortable, and room karma being so perfect.  The next morning, I went to Cielo, Four Seasons St. Louis restaurant, and ordered coffee, and a waffle. The waffle was especially delicious -- crisp on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.The hotel decor is modern, sophisticated, with modern art displayed throughout, water features, and a fireplace in the lobby. The staff are impeccable at the St. Louis Four Seasons. Everyone was friendly, helpful, and professional.Everything was simply magnificent! They thought of every detail - every single one! We had an arch view suite, fabulous for our family. They took such great care of us all, no detail left unattended too. We'll never stay anywhere else! The Four Seasons St. Louis is not to be missed, worth every single penny!I think I was meant to live here! This is the way you should stay. Four seasons all the way!Very friendly and nice hotel. They have decent amenities and great view from the room. They have an eco friendly card that you can put on the bed but it does not stand out so I did not use it the first night. I wish it was more visible. Otherwise, I love this hotel!Finally got to check out the Four Seasons in downtown St. Louis! Wow! I was attending a leadership conference for the weekend and the Four Season definitely lived up to their reputation. Our room had an amazing view. Customer service was 5-star. The showers/bathroom was superb! What can you say about a place that has a reputation of being a 5-star hotel. That they are a 5-star hotel. Bottom line: If you either live in St. Louis or traveling through St. Louis you won't be disappointed by how pampered you are at this place! Well done Four Seasons!If the world ended tomorrow I would be happy just living here! Very attentive staff, extremely clean rooms and excellent pool area and lobby! Pets are welcomed and they even left a nice doggy bed with treats, water bowl and even a bottle of Evian! We got a view of the arch absolutely gorgeous!!!Great hotel.   Loved the look of the place and how pet welcoming they were.The place is gorgeous.  It's a warm modern feel.  It has a masculine vibe in a *not having to like sports* kind of ways!  The bathrooms are huge.  Bigger than many rooms in my own house.  Separate soaker tub and rain head shower area.  TV in the mirror and enough room to ballroom dance if you wish.  They brought up a dog bed and treat for our pooch.  Our little guy didn't understand what the dog bed was as he looked down upon it from the softest king size bed he had ever laid upon, but he thought it was a cute gesture.  You enter the hotel on ground level, take the elevator to the middle of the building to check in and then proceed to another elevator to get to the rooms.  That seemed like a lot of waiting and people interaction for our 15 year old pooch to make it through in hopes to make it outside to do his business, so the staff happily showed us the service elevator at the end of our hall that was one continuous ride down to an outside destination and told us to use it whenever we wanted.  What a life saver.  Every staff person we encountered was top notch.The location is somewhat perfect yet oddly located.  Once you get to the front of the building it's fine, but winding yourself down to make that happen seems a little challenging at first.  It's just tucked down next to a casino and all in a bit of a cluster, but once inside it's a little slice of heaven.  We hope to stay here many more times.Like all Four Seasons, they are all beautiful. This Four Seasons is a little different with a casino - but I found this property extremely confusing. This hotel has two towers and they do not connect indoors - making it quite a trek going from one tower to the other in the cold winter months. Other than that, not much to complain about! You can see that the employees truly love their jobs.I wasn't staying at the hotel, but on Wednesday afternoon I had an appointment at the salon. I had left my husband down the street about 3 blocks at a restaurant. When finished with my appointment it had started to storm. I had no way to get back to my husband because I had walked. There were to very nice gentleman who worked there at the door when I exited. They offered me an umbrella to use, but when they saw how scared I was of the storm, they offered to shuttle me to the restaurant even though I wasn't staying there. I just wanted to say thank you for being so kind. You made my day by being so kind and thoughtful.I enjoyed the spa in the hotel, even if I didn't receive what I asked for. The service I receive was mediocre. I wouldn't recommend the spa to friends. I had a great salad and delicious champagne for lunch. I'll give them another try before writing them off. Maybe it was a off day for both my masseur, and masseuse.Stayed here 2 weeks ago for my 50th Bday! Booked off cheap hotels for $235.  Absolutely everything was superb!! The room, the view, but mostly the staff.  They set the experience apart.  TEN STARS!   Only suggestions ~do a little of your own homework and book things  yourself and save yourself more than a few dollars over using the concierge, but then....,,convenience costs:-).From my experience, the hotel and rooms are immaculate. The rooms are very modern and have excellent bathrooms. Definitely try to get a room with a view of the Arch. If you're not facing the Arch, you'll be looking out at some old, run down factories. The value here is fantastic: in larger cities, you'd pay $400-500/night to stay in a place like this. Cielo is the on-site restaurant, and it has a terrace that is a fantastic place to have a few drinks while taking in the view of the Arch. One negative: it's a bit disconnected from the rest of the city because the interstate runs between the hotel and the city. If you want to walk somewhere, though, you can walk through the Lumiere Place casino next door. The casino has a pedestrian tunnel with people movers that connects the complex to the rest of the city. Laclede's Landing is down the street, but, truthfully, there's not a whole lot that goes on there anymore. If you're looking for a nice night out, head up to the Washington Ave. area.This hotel lives up to the Four Seasons brand. The staff is uber polite and helpful, from the check in to the restaurant to room service. The rooms and beds are crazy comfortable, the pool area is nice -- you won't want to get out of bed or leave the hotel.Wonderful spa. The ""coed"" whirlpool overlooking the city is a great idea. The hubby and I loved our daily ritual of gym-steamroom-whirlpool, followed by an afternoon of reading magazines, watching the slow progression of barges on the Mississippi.The rooms are spacious, with clean lines and tasteful furnishings. Plus, l'Occitane products and comfy bathrobes make any restful stay even better,Only downsides: The steady flow of Casino patrons through the lobby.Smack-dab in the middle of our four-day stay - A loud, rowdy pool party that consisted of multiple bar-stations and people dancing as if they are at a nightclub.","Asked for turn down, and they only collected our dirty towels and didn't bring clean ones.  Not sure if they were having an ""off"" night or what.  Pretty room, but not  ""Four Seasons"" service. We had dinner at the restaurant Cielo, and the service was outstanding.  The food was very good, as well.  My hubby wrote a letter after our trip about our hotel service, but we have yet to hear a response.  It's now been over a year, and mgr never responded.What a train wreck.I travel professionally and have stayed at Four Seasons properties throughout the world.  This was by far the worst.  I paid premium dollars weeks in advance for an upgraded room facing the arch with floor to ceiling windows.  The windows were filthy with some kind of crap smeared on them just above arms reach.  It looked great with the sun streaming in on the beautiful sunny winter afternoon.There was no directory of amenities or hotel services, like site restaurants, etc.  We wanted to see what options we had for a quick, light breakfast in the morning prior to our departure for the airport.  My wife asked at the front desk about it since we find some sort of directory of services at virtually every other lodging throughout even the 3rd world and she was told that they were 'working on it' and 'would have it someday' !!??  I guess nobody has mastered a crayon and xerox machine in that far flung outpost of civilization we call St. Louis. (For shits sake they had a beautiful directory at that bastion of lodging, the St Robert, Mo. Fairfield Inn.  That's pretty rural, kids.  Maybe the Four Seasons should hire the very effective managers from that better run Fairfield Inn property to consult on hospitality management 101, see more reasons below).The on-site restaurant at the Four Seasons for breakfast is a Must-avoid.  We were going to go to use the Peets Coffee outlet we saw signage for in that dingy ashtray of a prison next door  that they call a 'casino', but I thought, hell its the last day of our vacation, we're at a Four Seasons, the restaurant doesn't look very busy and it would be such a treat for my wife.  I counted 4 servers plus maitre 'd and supporting runners, bussers, etc. restaurant was half full (if that), with most guests finishing their meal.After being seated by said maitre 'd, we waited 15 minutes to get anyone to come by and even offer us coffee, but the maitre 'd did have time to cruise by twice to tell us that something would happen soon.  Get a pot, take an order, fool!  If the staff is that inept, pitch in!  There was only one other table seated in the hour we were there, so he wasn't busy with guests.  He just stood at his little podium, looking great.After burning almost an hour for the simplest of mis-executed breakfasts (I'll not go into the botched order, etc.), I went to the room, got luggage and went down to check out.  Guess what?  The morons at the restaurant (now empty) couldn't be bothered to post the check to the room.  The front desk didn't know the phone number to the restaurant and had to walk across the hotel to then get someone to post the check.  After about 15 minutes waiting, he comes back and says he couldn't find anyone to do it.  I'm now running late for the airport.  The front desk said they'd settle up and email me my statement and asked for my email address. You know, that same thing they badger you for at check in?  The desk clerk scratched it down on some little pad full of doodles.  I still have not received that statement.The valets in parking were the best feature at the property.  They were organized, fast and efficient.  Maybe they should run the hotel instead of the garage?I think a zoo full of chimps could run things better.  At least we could all be amused by the chimps as they hurl feces.  Oh, I guess they did.  It was all over the windows of my room.  Epic Fail.  Never Again, not even if Eric Ripert himself left the NYC property and took over that crappy restaurant.In summary, the best part of my experience at the luxurious St. Louis Four Seasons Hotel was seeing it in the rear view mirror of my rental car as we got the hell out of there.This is my favorite hotel in St Louis. I've stayed at several Four Seasons in different cities and I feel this is on par with those. It's not as nice as...say, the one in Hawaii... but I mean..that's Hawaii ;) Here are some random thoughts:The beds are big and super comfy. I love white on white beds. White beds would never work in my home (I'm way too messy) but they are so crisp and fresh. Mmmhmm.Thick curtains allowed us to sleep as late as possible.. Not a single ray of sunshine got in that room unless we wanted it in there!Nice modern furnishings, neutral colors. I told my hubby that we're decorating our next bedroom like the Four Seasons rooms. They are relaxing and luxurious. The TV is huge. There is a TV built into the mirror in the bathroom. The bathtub is huge and so magical. I think I took maybe 10 baths in 4 days ;) I got Room Service several times (including a milkshake at midnight when I just had to have something chocolate). Tips: Maybe Avoid breakfast. My toast was burnt to a crisp which is pretty unacceptable and wasn't fond of the Eggs Benedict. For the two of us it was 60.00++ I should've went to Rooster.  That being said, we got a club sandwich the day we got in, through room service, and THAT was delicious. I'm sure if I had complained about breakfast they would've rectified the situation but I didn't, so that's also my fault. Price: Pretty standard. On par with the quality. I think we paid 200.00/night after a special was applied to the price (We stayed during the week in winter). Oh, and the view of the Arch is awesome. Also:Walking to Washington Ave at night from the hotel can be a little questionable, especially in the darkened area under Interstate 70. Um...I mean, it's not the safest area. Thankfully, we discovered the underground tunnel that pops you out right infront of Edward Jones Dome. This cuts out quite a bit of that sketchy walk. From there, it's a quick walk on a well lit and traveled street (past Drury Inn) and you're to Washingnton Ave (where all the restaurants are). Alternatively, you can walk through Laclede's Landing and hit up the Metrolink and go anywhere you need to. Maybe a 5 minute walk? OR, there is always a cab outside the hotel waiting to take you whereever you wish to go. We ended up parking in the (free) parking lot below the hotel to avoid valet as we didn't need our car for the 4 days we were there. If I was coming and going I may have paid for valet but the parking lot is maybe an extra 2 minute walk so it served it's purpose fine for just checking in and then checking out days later. We literally walked or cabbed it everywhere during our stay so we could both safely drink. Would like to mention that the valet is VERY friendly. They were a standout; always had a smile. Didn't use the spa much to my dismay. Also I was disappointed that the hottub and pool were closed, out on the rooftop. I was staying at the FS last February and I thought for sure that they both were open so this was disappointing that they weren't open this time, around the same time. Looked like a remodel was in the works though. Snagged a sweet deal; 3rd night free. As far as I can tell they often do deals like that so look around. This brought the price down to ~200.00 a night.TIP:You take the elevator up to floor 8 to check in. You do not need a key to do this as there is a restaurant on this floor so it's not just hotel guests. From there, check in and then you take up a different bank of elevators (with your key) to whichever floor you're on. This was a little annoying as if you were just coming and going you had to change elevators on the 8th floor just to get to the bottom level but it was nice that only those using the hotel were using that bank of elevators. I read another review from someone who said the Four Seasons is two towers and this VERY MUCH confused me because I'm nearly positive it's not two towers. Wait, what? The other adjacent hotel is the Lumiere.Four Seasons is great value for money.  As any traveling salesman would agree, there are only three things that really matter in a hotel--the room, the room service and the bathroom.  And this Four Seasons property excels at all three. Four Seasons has ultra-modern rooms, most with direct  views of the arch.  The room service is fast and the food is far superior to the average restaurant fare in St Louis.  And the rain shower and the mirror TV make the bathrooms a great place to be in.Some bonuses--complimentary shoe shine, a great rooftop restaurant, friendly service, rooms at about $100 a night, a free shuttle to select locations, and a casino within very close proximity,Why is it so easy to get a room at this hotel?  Search me!Good food, nice space, and excellent service! We went to a charity event in their main ballroom.I had a recent work trip to St. Louis that I was dreading. I mean who loves 16 hour days where you're non stop catering to other people's needs!?! Well, to my surprise, I didn't mind it at all this time and I owe it ALL to the Four Seasons. First off, this hotel is gorgeous from the lobby to my incredible and spacious room. Second, it's located right on the Mississippi River AND the Arch is a stone's throw away which is pretty perfect if you're touring the city. Next, the staff was amazingly helpful and friendly All that coupled with great food and great fitness facilities made this trip a breeze for me. Absolutely stay at the Four Seasons for any trip to St. Louis. It's worth every penny!We stayed here for this past Memorial day and it was very nice. I mean, what do you expect? You are at the 4 seasons!?! So, pinch yourself and settle back for luxury at its finest. We were set up with a nice suite that had two huge windows overlooking the Mississippi. Very modern room with a lounge area, office area and huge plasma TV. There was tons of storage space throughout our suite. The bathroom was all marble and granite with a separate overhead shower and a sunken tub. The bathroom even had a TV that was built in to the mirror, never seen that before. The lobby is where you'll grab your coffee in the morning and maybe drinks. The patio has a huge space that has a very nice pool and cabana set up that overlooks the Arch. Location however, was right next to a casino. Not to sound like a snob, but I stay at the 4 seasons to avoid that kind of riff raff. A sixty year old guy chomping on the end of his cigar wearing an Ed Hardy tshirt and jeans certainly ruins a romantic meal. I also smelled smoking on our floor, which certainly should not happen for what you pay a night. It also got loud outside as people cruised around the casino throughout the wee hours. Don't get me wrong. I love the 4 Seasons, but they lose a star for location.My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons 11/2-4 for a conference.  It was wonderful to have the conference only a few floors below.  With their fast elevators, I could run to my room during the short breaks.  The conference facilities were nice, with plenty of drinks and good meals provided.  Our room was spacious, with a separate couch, coffee table, desk and two chairs.  The bathroom was large with a walk-in shower and TV in the mirror.  The closets were large as well.  We had room service, which arrived on time with the food still hot and crisp.  Every person we interacted with was very friendly, helpful and respectful.  The modern yet calming decor of the hotel was also enjoyable.  We look forward to our next stay there.Host:  n/a (bar)Barternder: 1.0Drinks/concoctions: 2.5Property-style, decor ambiance: 3.5I have never been to a Four Seasons Hotel where the staff conversed amongst themselves about their personal matters and at a voice level patrons could hear.  Consequently, you may have to wait for your beverage until their conversations have concluded.Score one for a midweek deal at the Four Seaons 'Lou edition! This was my first ever stay at a Four Seaons (ever!) and I feel like I'm channeling my mentor on maternity leave. She'd be proud! While my budget doesn't typically allow for such indulgences, some quick finagling of a few seasonal deals landed me here for one night of luxe accommodation. Yes, I was in St. Louis for a busy 20 or so hours, but 8 of them were spent sleeping in that utterly fantastic bed...sigh. Truly heaven. The staff is on point over and over again, the place is immaculate. The rooms large. The L'occtaine products bliss-filled. The soaking tub + rain shower, impeccable. Large, well-appointed, serene, great desk. All around excellence from porterage to check-out. Coupled with a stunning view of the Arch, and well...what's to complain about? Oh, I can find a few things...scroogey Mcscroogerson Hotelier reporting for duty. *located directly next to a Casino. Hmmm. Touristy. *view of Arch is entirely overshadowed by one of the most garish LED billboards advertising none other than...The Four Seasons. It lights up my entire room. *Room service from Cielo: one of the worst Cobb Salads ever made, most definitely. $45 for a salad and one glass of wine. Fine if they rule. Not fine if they drool. So yes, this is a 5-star property...but as of now, 4 stars for the Four Seasons due to a few outlier issues. Fair enough. High expectations call for high standards and relative ratings.I've been to the Four Seasons a few times and each time I discover something new about the hotel which makes me want to return in the future.Be careful, however, because it is attached to Lumiere Casino and if you're not careful, you're bound to park in the casino garage over the hotel garage.  But all roads lead to one another.Having family work for the hotel, my first experience here was with the Unveiled Bridal Show last year.  It was amazing and the hotel did a great job with presentation, food, drinks, etc.  I returned recently to lunch at their restaurant with my cousin and I was interested in seeing that the lobby isn't the check in lobby, its simply the concierge directing you to the 8th floor where the registration is and their restaurant.  Upon walking off the elevators, you find out why - a gorgeous view of the Arch and downtown await you.  Such a small detail that makes you eager to explore the rest of the establishment.As good as it gets. This review is based on the rooftop restaurant.I came last night with my <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMeetup.com&amp;s=26b64e7bab324d27aa4b63dff07ddb356faa66945c651d3084df91876495534f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Meetup.com</a> group. Weather was horrible. Monsoon raining in downtown St. Louis @ 6pm in the evening? Think about it. Regardless of the dreariness of the outside, I refused to let this stop me from going and enjoying myself on the top of this venue. A friend had recommended and I had to find out for myself what the hoopla was all about.I got to the restaurant after braving the elements, and waited for my guests to arrive. As I sat there waiting at my reserved table, the server came over to check on me more than once in the 30 minute time lapse as i waited. She wanted to ensure I was happy and comfortable.The bar manager even peaked by to see how I was. Prompt and very friendly without missing a beat.Once friends started arriving, the server was quick to make sure we were knowledge of the drinks they had, and provided us with dinner venues as well.Though everyone settled on the pizzas, everything tuned out to be very savory and well done to the liking of the guests.You are looking to pay from 25-35 dollars for yourself if you drink and eat over the course of time. Pricing isn't cheap, but you pay for the view. The view is amazing!!! Once the rain let up, we moved outside to the pool deck/patio where they had a fire pit, canopied with televisions, the pool of course, and a spectacular view of downtown and the Arch.This venue is perfect for a wedding proposal date, a first date, anniversary date, a date to get away from your kids...... THIS is a DATE place!! As well as friends' night out, an after dinner drink or what ever occasion you can think of. I will come here again, and hopefully soon. Definitely a winner in my book for a rooftop with a view. I'm all about rooftops. :)Wow is all I can say. This is an outstanding property with all you would expect from the Four Seasons brand. Impeccable service where they almost seem to be reading your mind and spacious, well appointed rooms. The fitness center is big enough to take a good sized crowd of fitness nuts and has a nice array of equipment. No hotel in downtown St Louis even comes close. I get really ornery and perhaps even a little depressed if I have to stay anywhere else on a business trip.This was truly one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The staff was super helpful and friendly. The room we had was right in front of the arch and really nice! We also ate at the attached restaurant. The dining was an extremely unique beautiful experience! We also went to the casino right next to hotel and had a fun time there as well!A must if you are in St. Louis!  This hotel is the picture if luxury.  A stunning lobby with friendly staff.  Gorgeous rooms that are impeccably clean!  And views that are just incredible.  I cannot recommend this place more!These are the second-nicest rooms I've ever stayed in! (only behind a super-luxury resort in Mexico), but the BEST bathrooms! They have high ceilings, floor to ceiling windows and spacious, amazingly nice bathrooms.  The best part of these rooms is how large they feel.  The bathrooms have a deep soaking tub with shower hose, tile and glass shower with shower hose and rain shower, large counters, separate toilet room, and a TV in the mirror.  The only drawback is no exhaust fan. I didn't use it much, but my room had a large 42"" flat-panel TV. The complementary shoe shine was nice and and room service was always on-time or ahead of schedule. They of course have a late-night menu, but the kids menu is also available 24h. The staff is very courteous and professional. Access is very fast on/off I-70, only a couple stoplights. It's super close to Laclede's landing, and an easy walk to Washington Ave and downtown or to the Gateway Arch.  I had an amazing corporate rate of $105/nt but double that would be very appropriate.My review of the Four Seasons is only for the 8th floor bier garden and inside bar. And it's gorgeous! Although it's pretty dang hot right now, I don't mind standing out on this patio because it has one of the best views of downtown/the Arch that I've seen. Drinks here are pricey, but what do you expect at the Four Seasons? How else are they supposed to pay the mortgage? :) The staff is very helpful, friendly and we were never without a cocktail inside the lounge. Even with a huge crowd they kept their cool and it seemed like everyone was being accommodated. I am interested to come back and use the spa sometime - and that amazing rooftop pool! Everyone with whom I've spoken who's used their services raves about 'em. Hear that boys? The ladies like the Four Seasons Spa!My hubby and I stayed here a little over 2 years ago and.... can you give a hotel 6 stars?!?!  This place is the best hotel I have ever been to.  They went above and beyond.  My favorite lounge/running pants had ripped and I sent them along with my other clothing items to be laundered and when they sent everything back they had sewn the hole in the inseam of my pants.  Talk about amazing service!  We ordered room service and the food was very, very good!  The view was spectacular and I wanted to take the bed home.  The bathroom was the best... nice over sized walk-in shower with plenty of room.  This place is worth the price and I would definitely stay here again.  From a travel agent's heart to yours... this place rocks my socks!! :)I had the pleasure of staying here for 3 nights when I was in Saint Louis for work a few weeks ago, and I could never imagine staying anywhere else on future trips to the area. I imagine most of this review goes without saying as the hotel more than upholds the standards one would expect from this hotel chain. I was surprised, as were several other Yelpers, to at first see that this hotel was connected to a casino right on the river and it momentarily had me worried that that was the reason we had gotten such a great deal on the rooms. But it was a very quiet, professional business-class hotel. The view of the arch and the river both from the lobby and from my room were to die for. I have uploaded a picture here for you to to see. The room itself was very large and nicely laid out with a modern workspace, a lounge chair, and wet bar. The bed was so comfortable that before I left I actually pulled the sheets off to see what kind of mattress it was. And the bathroom was big and lovely. I only wish I'd had time to relax long enough to enjoy a bath in the enormous tub. We ate dinner here two nights and the food is good, though obviously pricy. The menu had a lot of great offerings and my only complaint would be that both waiters we had each night did not seem well-educated enough about the wine or the food to be offering suggestions. They were helpful, but not knowledgeable about the product. With regard to other services, the valet was extremely efficient and polite which was great because we were often coming and going in a hurry. They learned our names and our vehicle quickly. My only regret is that my visit was in February as I didn't get to try the outdoor pool and hot tub (which were both open) as it would never have crossed my mind to bring my bathing suit to Saint Louis in February. But there were definitely people out there and it looked fantastic!It's the Four Seasons. As expected, everything was perfect. If you need a review to figure out if the Four Seasons is a good place, you're either a hillbilly or not from this country. Pay a lot, expect excellence.","This hotel is my favorite in St. Louis with its view, unbelievable service, and good food whether you are at the pool, in your room, or at the restaurant. I highly recommend any out of town guests to stay here.Staying here on business and this has to be the nicest hotel in the Saint Louis area.  The staff were extremely attentive and even gave me an upgrade when they accidentally checked me into a room that had not be cleaned prior to my arrival.   Since I will be coming back frequently over the next few weeks they offered to store my bags and have them waiting for me when I arrived again the following week.  The rooms are so plush and the bathrooms are to die for.  If you are in the area and can afford it you should stay here.Probably the top hotel in St Louis.  Great accommodations.  The suites are spacious and the services are top notch.  Four Seasons is the ""to go"" hotel for the weekend trip with the family.  Chef's dinner is fantastic and Fabrizio the chef does a great job in keeping everyone entertained and satiated with great food.  The kids (4 and 7 yo) love this hotel as well.  My 7 y.o. wrote a thank you letter voluntarily last summer to the hotel staff as she had such a great time during our stay.  The summer is a great time to visit with the wonderful pool and pool service.  If you are up for some gambling, you can walk over to Lumire and push your luck as well.This review is for their spa.I received a $300 gift card for my birthday so I decided to use it on the Taste of Spa Package. The cost of this package is $225 and lasts 90 minutes. You choose three services from 4 different services available. I chose the massage, body scrub, and the facial. The body scrub and facial were amazing and I thought the massage was ok. Not the best I've ever had, but still relaxing. The staff are very friendly and between each service, I was given tea and snacks which was a nice touch. They have a sauna but I had a limited amount of time, so I was not able to go in there. I had $75 left on my giftcard so I used it on a $65 haircut. I dont ever spend that much because I usually found that no matter how much I spend, my hair ends up pretty much looking the same. I was proved wrong. Jackie (I believe that was her name) was amazing. I had gotten an awful haircut earlier that month. I wanted side-swept bangs that girl I went to previously had f'ed up so Jackie came to the rescue. She made my bangs and hair look amazing. She is totally worth spending $65 on. Overall, if I were rich, I'd come here every weekend. I had a fabulously relaxing day and would recommend this spa without any hesitation.Best $18- Martini everWe are currently staying here at the Four Seasons! By far, one of the nicest hotels ever! The staff, room, etc., a 5 star place! Thank you!What can I say, this place is the BEST.The rest. where I had Brunch today for Easter was GREAT. Service went out of there way to make my day great. See I was alone and they made me feel like I was family. Now we talk about the food. 10 star's , 2 thumbs up. I am a chef and for as many people they were cooking for everything was great. I will come back again and again.This place rocks!  I travel like 50 weeks out of the year all over the place and this hotel is in my top 3 favorites across the U.S.Awesome service you'd come to expect from any Four SeasonsKick ass back patio area with a pool, outdoor fire place and fantastic view of downtown and the archCool little TVs inside the bathroom mirrorsConnected to the Lumiere casino - which provides about as much excitement as you can expect from STLThis place was the worst. I couldn't believe it. First of all it's in the strangest area, kind of tucked away, but not in a charming way. And it's situated RIGHT next to an enormous casino. Though if you like casinos and the people that frequent them, this might not be an issue.Really what ruined my stay was the proximity to the stadium. Yes, it is not only next to a GIANT stadium but if you're lucky enough to stay on one side of the hotel, your view will consist of a huge billboard with flashing lights. Lights that flash all. the. time.So was the room and amenities nice? Sure. Was it worth it to be kept up by the flashing light (blackout curtains did no good) and then woken up at the crack of dawn by the bass of music coming from the stadium/fans? No. Worst of all the staff pretended it was a non issue, which was pretty frustrating considering how much money we were spending and since the noise was deafening and it's practically an all-glass building. And that other guests shared my sentiments. A total disappointment. Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere.Staying at my home away from home again and just want to give them props for always anticipating what is needed before I need it. :) Thank you so much to my hero James for being such an amazing person along with ""GREATS"" Heather, Danielle, Aline, Ashley, Mr. O, Cory, Stephen, Fabrizio, Peter Bakery God and culinary team and Peter v2 :), John, Jamie, Carmel, Leslie, Yvette, Colin, Kimberly, Emily, Lysette, Jeffrey, PJ, Aaron, Kyle &amp; team, the Spa, Housekeeping, Valet, Concierge, et al!! Everyone is first class, stellar and I love them!! Can't say enough about the service! Just the best. I won't stay anywhere else. Book early because its the best hotel in St. Louis and they fill up fast. LOVE YOU GUYS!!My mom treated me to a massage at the Spa at the Four Seasons, and afterwards, I requested this as my birthday present every year from now on. IT IS AMAZING. I had a 60 minute massage, and I felt like I was in heaven. My masseuse was very accommodating, and the pressure was excellent. I was a little stuffy from a bad cold the day I got my massage, and he used eucalyptus to clear my airways. It was excellent. The whole experience was mindblowing.Ok, I'm sure you expect this place to get 4 stars and good review but there is a reason I am taking the time to review them.  When we arrived in our room we encountered a 'situation' It was not a huge deal to me but they about died apologizing for it and moved us into a new room with an upgraded arch view and treated us like kings.  My wife loved the bathtub.  When I say loved I'm talking this stay will probably cost me a $20,000 bathroom upgrade.  We stayed there Monday night for business but then moved down the street to the Hyatt for a conference (and that was the conference hotel on the shuttle route).  Turns out the Hyatt didn't have a pool so we called four seasons and found out their rate was VERY competitive and moved back.  She did go to the pool but loved the tub so much I think she spent all of Friday morning there while I was in meetings.  They also had their limo take us to our black tie event so the shuttle was not that big a deal and the hotel was so much nicer!!  I do wish the internet was free.PS-the beds are wonderful tooThis is for the Spa at the Four Seasons. This is where I go for all of my facials and I LOVE IT. Lauren (the estetision and the ONLY person I will ever let touch my face) is amazing! I always feel so refreshed and rejuvenated when I leave...although I never want to! You can also spend time at the pool and get some lunch while you are there.Best. Splurge. Ever. I was lucky enough that my boyfriend booked one night here for my birthday because I would have probably never been able to justify the splurge, but even that one night I was able to see just how incredible this place is. First of all the service was fantastic, the people at the front desk were helpful but not overly annoyingly so, later when we were wanting to swim during this unusually warm November day the staff helped me track down a bathing suit to use and while swimming another staff member appeared out of nowhere (it seemed lol) with fluffy robes and hot chocolate. How awesome is that? After swimming we headed back up to the room and we had been left a makeup bag with some fantastic Lancome samples AND a treat that can only be described as a chocolate piece of art. The rooms were beautiful, the bathrooms were just out of this world with the decorating and spacious tubs and the beds themselves were beyond comfortable. This is most certainly a splurge that I think is 100% worth it.EASILY the best hotel in the St. Louis area.Very modern.Very clean.Exceptional service.St. Louis needs more hotels like this.This review is for the Spa at the Four Seasons St Louis.  With any $95 treatment (example: 60 min. Swedish Massage) you also get access to their pool, fitness center, whirpool, and steam room.  Just the access is worth the $95, so to get a massage as well is an added bonus.The space is serene and peaceful, the staff is helpful, the therapists are really talented.  My therapist was Mirranda this past weekend, and I fully intend to request her next time I return.I didn't stay here, but I went to a wedding, so its worth reviewing, if someone is looking for venues. Actually its worth reviewing because the food tasted almost as if it was prepared just for me when actually it was prepared for 300+ people. I wasn't the only one that felt that way. Nice work in the kitchen.The staff was friendly but the valet lost our car, so minus one star. Of course they found it after like, half an hour. That's a long time after several hours in 3 inch heels.Definitely a great hotel, but...I wouldn't categorize this as anything more than a nice Hilton.  The rooms are the best part of this location...huge, great city view, awesome shower, tv in the bathroom mirror, etc.  The one restaurant on site was very good, as I had a breakfast voucher for three days.  The outside pool and hot tub looked nice, although I did not partake.  The location stinks.  It is close to nothing, except the gnarly casino it is attached to.  The free self-park garage is accessible through the smoggy, granny-smoking-with-oxygen-tank, and-local-riff-raff-coming-to-make-their-fortune casino...not too classy.  I would say that it got peaceful inside the hotel, but on Saturday night, a wedding was held on the balcony on the reception level.  It was so loud, that it overpowered the football game on my tv, 8 floors up!  I didn't pay this money to be annoyed in my own hotel room.  I would stay here again, but only for a much more discounted price.  It definitely was not worth $300/night.This is a great place to stay when visiting St. Louis.  The rooms are large and beautiful, everyone is friendly and helpful, and late-night room service is good (try the buffalo wings).  During the humid summer, the best plan of action is to enjoy the 8th-floor pool and bar with a view of the Arch in the warm night.  Especially with a cold, tasty pitcher of sangria.Wonderful hotel! Great bed and a spacious room. Very comfortable. I didn't eat here or go to their bar, but the room was modern, comfortable, and quiet.","Only place I'll stay since it opened. They know me by name at this point I've been so many times. I'd recommend it to anyone coming to STL, especially someone considering Hotel Lumiere (that place is a dump).Luxury, luxury, luxury!  We stayed a night last week and this hotel is top of the line!I was here for a business meeting this past week and it was the nicest set up I've experienced at any hotel.  The ""continental breakfast"" was delicious, especially when I was just expecting coffee and bagels.  As soon as I was seated, the server offered me juice or coffee.  I really enjoyed the various options, especially the egg-white vegetable frittata  - it was a tasty and healthier option to regular scrambled eggs.  The meeting room offered coffee, tea, sodas and (my favorite) sparkling water.  The box lunch we had to go was offered in small soft-sided coolers.  What a good idea!  I'll use mine again and it will be free marketing for Four Seasons :).  The coolers contained a sandwich, chips, an artichoke pasta salad (yum), a cookie and an apple.  The sandwiches were good and I noticed that even in March, they found nice red, ripe tomatoes. I'd recommend the Four Seasons St. Louis when considering options to host a business meeting or training.Wow, amazing hotel.  Best in St. Louis hands down.  I worked an event here for my internship and it wasn't anything less than stunning.  In addition to a gorgeous wedding reception, the staff was friendly and very helpful.  If you can afford it, hold your next event here!We just stayed there for our anniversary and had a great time.  They surprised us and upgraded our room because they saw we what we were celebrating and that really got things off to a good start.  The spa is wonderful and we both had some of the best massages (deep tissue) we have had anywhere.  Dinner at Cielo was quite good and the whole place was jumping which gave it a great vibe.  Almost seemed like we were in a big city.  Definitely recommend and we will be back again when we can. Only had a couple of concerns; they (like many upscale hotels) still charge for wifi, which is getting to be a real irritant and the service at the restaurant was a bit choppy.Hubby and I just had a 4 night stay at the Four Seasons in St. Louis and I am now spoiled for any other St. Louis hotel.  We come into town at least a couple of times a year for family and passing through on the way to Mizzou games, and so often stay in St. Louis hotels.  The Four Seasons is hands-down the best of the pack.  The rooms are large, beautifully decorated and comfortable (in particular the beds!)  The bathrooms are also huge with a huge tub and separate shower.  Everything is immaculately clean.  I have seen some complaints about the location, but St. Louis is a strange city and no location is really great.  This one is within very easy walking distance of Laclede's Landing, which has some good bars and nightlife.  It is true that it is right next to a casino, but we did not feel that affected the vibe much once inside.  Of note, we did have a city view room, which means we could not see the arch, but also did not have the bright sign flashing in our window.  What really differentiates the Four Seasons from other St. Louis hotels, though, is the service.  It is really first class.  We felt very welcome and at home immediately upon alighting from our car,  and every staff member was willing to help us with the smallest request with a smile.  The concierge set up a great dinner and helped us with getting a car in no time.  The doormen will even offer water or an umbrella if needed on the way out, both of which came in handy on this trip!  I think we have found our new home away from home in St. Louis!I was very interested in seeing what the Spa was like at the Four Seasons Hotel ever since I moved back to St. Louis with my husband.  Mind you, we just moved back from a 4 year stint in Las Vegas so we've been very pampered with our choices of Spas and got accustomed to world class massages and service from world class masseuse.  It just so happened that our favorite Spa in Las Vegas was the Four Seasons in the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, so I HAD to try the Four Seasons here ASAP!  Donna was my masseuse of choice after reading some reviews and word of mouth and WOW am I glad I took their advice!  I received three different treatments over three different sessions including a scrub, wrap, and massage.  I mentioned world class service in Las Vegas,  I have found it in St. Louis!  Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended!!!","['firm', 'lunch', 'recently', 'people', 'sure', 'think', 'idea', 'four', 'seasons', 'say', 'phenomenal', 'hard', 'make', '150', 'people', 'happy',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-st-louis-city-center-hotel-and-suites-saint-louis-2,Sheraton St. Louis City Center Hotel & Suites,3.0,$$,80,"I'm disappointed to see so many negative reviews because my whole family had a great stay. We got 4 rooms and they were all clean and had comfy beds. Those are the 2 main things I look for in hotels.  I had the deluxe king room with a jetted tub and it was incredibly relaxing. The room also comfortably fit 8 people in there when we were hanging out. The building itself is also very creative, with the paintings on the outside walls. I grew up in St Louis, but this is the first time I stayed downtown and I wasn't disappointed.I was put up here for a work trip. It is a fine enough hotel in that it has a bed, large room, fridge, etc. BUT there are a lot of things that would make me stay elsewhere. Another perk is that it seems to have thick walls or be mostly empty so I didn't hear a peep from any of my neighbors, but the complements pretty much stop here. - Location- Yes, it is close to the stadium and the ice rink, but it is also immediately across the street from a metro terminal and right off the highway. It is not the best location. Yes, you can walk to a lot of things, but walking alone at night in this area might not be your best decision. One night, I was at a bar near the stadium and I asked the bartender ""what's the best way to walk back to this hotel?"" He said, ""take a cab."" Ha! He then went on to say he has daughters and would not want them walking alone through that area so yea, maybe pick another location hotel. Ah yes, and one night there was a puddle of blood in the parking garage. Who knows if that was a guest or non-guest, but it's worth noting. - Aging hotel--You can tell they've tried to update some things, but it is an aging establishment and didn't give me the cleanest feel. - Pool--Pre hotel stay: ""Oh cool, they have a pool. I'll bring my suit and relax in the pool and jacuzzi."" Well one look at the tiny, indoor, and dingy pool and I said ""methinks not."" The jacuzzi is closed and has a large wood board over it to indicate this. - Every room has a window...a window looking into the fake atrium. Oh boy, but I guess that's better than looking out real windows to see bus stops and highways. - Hotel bar and restaurant--I tried to eat at both, but the prices were so ridiculous I couldn't bring myself to purchase anything other than a salad. I know hotel restaurants have high mark ups, but seriously the prices were a joke. - Staff-- The staff were kind of helpful, but then again they weren't at all helpful. Let me explain. We were traveling for govt jobs so we have tax exempt options. Each person at the workshop asked about this, and each person got vastly different answers. Most of the staff said no, we can't do tax exempt, which btw is absolutely not true. If it weren't for a persistent few at the workshop, we would've all paid for something we weren't supposed to AND it would've been out of our own pockets because the govt expects hotels to be knowledgable enough to figure out tax exemptions for govt employee rates. I have to say that they did eventually fix the problem and a few weeks later I got a refund, but it's pretty ridiculous to me that a govt contracted hotel didn't know how to handle the tax exemption forms and tried to take our money rather than problem solve.READY TO PITCH A NO HITTERCame into St. Louis for family reunion / baseball game. Arrive very late (1am) but staff was wide awake and ready to serve!! Found a huge room, clean, comfortable, and quiet. Needed a few extras (pillows for kids) and they brought them right up. Slept great!! Had interaction with housekeeping and other staff. Very friendly. Large fitness are with both machines and a dumbbell set. Pool is actually long enough for lap swimming (a rare find in hotels). Walked everywhere downtown. Easy access.Location, location, location. Loved this hotel for concert (or hockey games). Park in the hotel garage, party in your room or in the hotel lounge and head across the street a few minutes before the show. A lifesaver in cold weather or rain. The hotel had great decor and friendly staff in the lobby. But agree the rooms can use a refresh.I travel for work and am in-and-out of hotels on a weekly basis. This was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had. Room: to start out the room was old, dirty, and smelled like smoke. Plus, a business colleague and I were given a room with just one bed. When we got to the room we called the front desk and asked them for the double queen bed room we registered for online. Their staff said this was not possible with no explanation and did not even check with a manager. They wouldn't have been able to even check a computer in the time they responded. Then they closed the call with, ""the couch pulls out into a bed."" As if this was equal to the king size bed in our room. The staff refused to help and hung up.Fees: you pay $17 per day to park in a pretty old parking garage with very little real security for yourself or your car. (Hotel is on the edge of a pretty bad area). Then in our dungeon of a room we go to log into the wifi and it is $12 per day to use. If this was a 4 or 5 star hotel it would be different, but this place is old, dingy and not somewhere I would ever bring my family. The cheapest hotels offer free wifi! For $12 a day they could put a laptop in every room with high speed internet.Result: We left! We were booked for a 3 day stay and left the first night. We found a hotel that was clean, where the staff was very kind, and the room was excellent. We got free parking, free breakfast, free wifi and 2 beds just like we ordered. When I called to let them know we were checking out 3 days early they meet asked why or if there was anything they could. There lack of care or interest was a good summary of our experience.Okay, the room had a few stains on the wallpaper and carpet and the interior is a bit outdated but overall it was great. We had a king room, the bed was okay comfortable and the staff were very nice. The view from the roof is nice but there are a few buildings in the way of the Arch.The location is great and within walking distance from the arch, central library, was memorial, and anything downtown. Distance from the Arch is a 20 minute walk but perfectly manageable. One star off is for not having free wifi in the rooms (what is this, 1995?!) and sneakily having 2 free small bottles of drinking water but 1 larger bottle that's 4 dollars but only informs you in very very small print.My brother was being sworn into the military may 14. He and other gentlemen being sworn in were staying at this hotel. We tried to find a hotel near but there was nothing that had openings. We had to stay here. When I called the hotel itself they said only suites had continental breakfast. We booked a room through hotels because it was almost just as much as a sweet for a normal room. Show up and we were booked in a suite but they wouldn't give us continental breakfast. WiFi costs AND parking cost! Anything for a buck!! My brother went to get into his room and his key didn't work, why? Because the handle was broken and the battery was dead.. this place is a joke! Will never stay here again.I stayed here for a work conference. Solid hotel- decor is a bit outdated but the rooms are extremely large with nice wet bars, mini fridges, and fold out couches. The staff were very helpful, friendly and prompt. The shower handle in my shower came off as I was turning the shower on- the staff got right on with fixing it and it was replaced in no time. It is right across the street from the Civic Center MetroLink stop, making it easy and cheap to get to and from Lambert Airport. It was only 3-4 blocks from nice restaurants and bars. Bottom line- if you're looking for a basic hotel with friendly staff in a convenient location, check this place out.Stay away form this hotel they will charge you when you're not looking. Our hotel room was booked under my name and card so when it was paid with my friend's card they charged us both. The bad part is I wasn't even there, ended up rushed to the hospital the day we were supposed to check in so she was the only one to check in! Trying to explain this to them is useless.We recently stayed here on SPG points for a recent weekend in STL. We have usually stayed away from the downtown area and opted for the Central West End or the Chase Park Plaza but thought we'd give this hotel a shot.Overall we were very happy to stay here and ended up exploring a lot of downtown STL which we previously had not done the 4 other times we've visited the city.Yes - this Sheraton is old and outdated (think green carpeting, wooden dressers and couches you might find in your parents' basement, etc.) but the good definitely outweighs the bad. The Good- Great location across the street from the Metro Link (and Amtrak, Greyhound) so you can get around STL without needing a cab. Yes, there are shady characters loitering around the transit hub but it is well-lit, there's plenty of security, and you just have to cross the street to get from your hotel to the train.  - Short walk to the downtown area, the Arch, and across the street from the Scottrade Center Sports Arena- Huge rooms (ours was a standard and in addition to our king size bed, there was a pull out sofa bed, recliner, desk, etc.). Our room even had a wet bar and a refrigerator. - Free WiFi in the lobby (not free in the room), along with complementary newspaper- Complimentary coffee and bottles of water in your room- Quiet, clean, good water pressure- Convenient check-out available on your room TV The Bad- Outdated rooms (although seriously, you should get out and explore STL instead of staying cooped up in your hotel room)- Dark rooms if you get a room facing the inner courtyard that looks like a mall atrium- No outdoor pool, although there is apparently an indoor poolWouldn't mind staying here again if the rates are cheap and we plan on hanging out downtown since we spend so little time in our room anyway - overall a pleasant stay!Great location, but bad hotel.Staff was rude and unhelpful during our stay.As noted from other customers the rooms were outdated and gross. Also wifi was an extra chargeDecent indoor lap pool on the 13th floor with a workout facility.  Rooms are large if on the dated side in terms of decor.  Restaurants are serviceable as at any Sheraton level hotel.  Walking distance to Busch Stadium if you're into baseball.   Nice view of the iconic Arch from the sun deck on the 13th floor adjacent to the pool.A-ok rating because of location, location, location .... Kinda seedy neighborhood. Doesn't feel particularly safe outside the confines of the hotel after dark.  No decent restaurants within walking distance.  No matter how good hotel dining may be (and it ain't that great here), you need some options.Absolutely serviceable for a 1-night stay if you have business in the area. Boring and confining after that.I loved my stay at this hotel. HUGE and really clean king room that had a very comfortable bed . SUPER FRIENDLY STAFF (even when I was ball busting about me being a Cubs and Giants fan [I was there for game 5 of the NLCS...yeah ya know, the game that turned it ALL around]). Did you forget something at home? They'll likely have it there in the room for you when you walk in. Loofah, mouthwash, and all of the other normal things that hotels leave out for you to use. If they don't have what you want, there is a tiny story down by the front desk. I love that Sheraton St. Louis is directly across the street from Union Station, it's prefect for when you're taking the Amtrak from Chicago. I did like that Busch Stadium is about a 10 minute walk.  I didn't like that there isn't much else around the hotel. I had to walk like 15 minutes to get find a coffee place when I needed a caffeine fix in the morning. Finding a bar or a place to grab a bite to eat isn't very easy either (they do however, have a restaurant and bar inside the hotel, I just wanted to go out and wander when I was hungry during my stay). I honestly don't see what the problem is with some of the other guests...Stayed at this hotel for a family reunion and it was a reasonably priced hotel , downtown St. Louis with huge rooms..the decor is a little dated but for the price I am not going to complain about whether a chair needs to be replaced.  My biggest complaint, and I hope hotel management reads yelp, the hotel need to be cleaner...hallways, corners, mirrors, needed cleaning...other them that I would recommend this hotel.The rooms were clean and the staff was professional. We had just come from a hotel with super friendly staff so it felt like a bit of a shift as the staff wasn't quite as warm. The cost was more reasonable, however, and you are right by a metro link and bus station which makes it easy to ditch your car, though I did spy a drug deal going on in the nearby park. (That stuff is just city stuff though, and frankly doesn't bother me) The parking was more reasonable too at  $17 a night compared to $24 at our other hotel. The hotel definitely seemed a little more worn down and dated. Our room also faced the hotel center which made it dark in our room most of the time as not a lot of sunlight came through. Also, you could see across the hotel into other people's rooms unless you drew the drapes. Room service costs were predictably expensive. The location isn't particularly charming.The pool is indoors and doesn't have a lot of places to relax. Mostly surrounded by plastic white chairs. It's most definitely not a lounging pool. There's also a jacuzzi near the pool, but again, the pool area is very lack luster and drab and isn't really a relaxing space. Pretty much feels like a YMCA gym.. which is great if you are just looking to work out but not if you are in vacation mode.  My biggest complaint is the sun deck. They encourage you to hang out on their sun deck which looks gorgeous on their website but in reality is a large cleared out concrete deck on the top floor with some lounge chairs and lots of ash trays. It looks nothing like the picture which sports charming red umbrellas (which weren't there) and wrought iron lounge chairs (which are now replaced with less lounge chairs and they are plastic). In fact, it's pretty much the smoking lounge. We laid out for a few minutes and then felt pretty grossed out by all the smoking.  They also charge an outrageous $10.99 a day for Wifi in your room. You can access it for free in the lobby if you like though.  There is a mini fridge in your room which is a nice. It's not filled with overpriced crap either. It's empty and free to use.The property seems to be renovated, very clean and offers very food service..indoor pool with nice balcony with a view.  Breakfast is very, very, delicious, not your typical hotel offerings.  yes, you must pay for parking, however there is no fee for your pet and they even offer a pet bed. great stayThis place is awful! We stayed here for one night requested a jacuzzi tub and it was dirty so of course we didn't use it. We were exhausted from running around sight seeing so we ordered room service. We ordered a salad, children's grilled cheese and two sodas and what did it cost us??? $54!!! Not including tip!!!! Wifi costs a ton and cell service sucks. Our room is large but dirty. The television has few and awful channels. Also, our phone was broken so they sent two guys to our room three times. We are here to have a mini romantic vacation and these men traipsing through our room. When my fiance accidentally forgot his key they would not give him a key, instead sent up a rather rude service gentleman who didn't bother to verify that this was our room. If they would make such a huge deal at the front desk that out last names were different than why just let him and scoff when he says thank you. Please don't stay here. It's terrible!People keep harping on the ""shady area"" that this hotel is in. Yeah, I guess that's legit. But if you are from a city you probably already deal with this stuff on a daily basis. Yeah, you'll get asked for money. Yeah, you may see some loitering across the street. But overall, if you are from a city you probably know how to deal with this sort of thing. But if you are not used to it, you might be better off elsewhere.To me, the hotel itself is in a great location. It is right near the light rail line and the Amtrak station. There are also a bunch of buses that stop right out front. These things are part of the reason for the ""characters"" that are hanging around the area. You are within walking distance to the Arch and Busch stadium. The hockey arena is within one block. Although there are no great restaurants within 4 blocks or so, if you are a person that is willing to walk, you can probably walk all the way across downtown in 30 minutes or so. Or, if you want to drive, St. Louis has pretty easy and cheap parking all throughout downtown.  But if you are the type of person that has never been on a train or bus before, and you hate walking, you might be better off elsewhere.The hotel rooms are very large but very outdated. The wallpaper looked old. The couch and chair were probably 20 years old. But some positives: good water pressure, 2 sinks, a wet bar w/refrigerator, free bottled water, free Starbucks coffee, and a very quiet room (at least for us). If you are expecting a five-star modern hotel, you might be better off elsewhere.For us, it worked out well. If you are from Chicago you can take the Amtrak down in about 5.5 hours, and you will be dropped off right across the street from the hotel. Then you can use the light rail to get anywhere in the city. Can you believe it? Somebody visiting STL without renting a car? Yeah, it happened. And it was totally fine. Overall, you get what you pay for. The Sheraton is functional. If you want something really nice, look elsewhere.EDITED TO ADD: Wi-fi is like $12, or something similar. CROCK. We used our iPhones instead. Paying for Wi-fi is ridiculous.Good location if you want to go to Union Station area.  Convenient to Metrolink and bus stop.  Staff was friendly, room was clean.  Dislikes. Pay for internet, not sure if would be charged for water, TV remote control didn't work. Building seems to block 3g/4g cell phone coverage.  Light switch was in odd location at edge of bathtub.Room was clean. Staff very friendly. Had to pay 17 a night for parking. Kinda a bummer. Overall nice place.","Very dirty hotel.  The carpet and the skuffs in hallway are extremely gross. Cumon a little touch up paint goes along way. Then I get to the 1st room they gave me and it was unacceptable. Gross partied on a million times couch and the weird layout of room was very odd and very used. To say this hotel needs a face lift is an understatement! They charge u a crazy amount to park even more to valet. Then they charge for wifi. 12 dollars for 24hrs. So the first room was extremely dirty. Carpet, walls, curtains, vent, bathroom, all dirty. Clean the room, its your job!. I've stayed at many Sheratons and never seen a property so in disarray. So they give me another room. A little better but by no means what I'd expect from Sheraton. The long walk to the second room was more of the same. Trash, puke stains, spills everywhere.  So gross!So I'm 60+ dollars into parking and WiFi, unsatisfactory room dirty windows on the inside. I mean forehead prints on the windows. It just seems like nobody cares. The first night it was pretty cold outside and so was the room. The heater barley works. It didn't turn off all night and it never reaches the temp I set it at. Which was only set to 76 degrees.  I really feel like I got bent over and it keeps getting worse. So the second nite. There was a fight or some extreme violence in the room close to mine. I tried to stay out of it. But after 45 mins I couldn't ignore it anymore. So I walk down to convey my concern and the front desk attendant says ""oh this happens all the time"" I will send security over there. Obviously I didn't want to get involved,  police did come and it quieted down around 2am  I got 1 more night here and I would do anything to get out of it. But I fear that this is probably a little better than the other old hotels nearby.  So since I'm already paid I have to stay. But I will never stay here again. And it makes me a little leary of Sheraton altogether.  Up until now I've never seen a hotel this nasty. Dust, filth, stains everywhere. Believe it or not I could say more but I think I've said enough. The ratty couch and dusty cushions seem so uninviting.  The trash up and down the hallway, numerous stains, drug bags or what looks like paraphernalia everywhere. The violence and the front desk non caring attitude was a real bummer. I plan on saying something to someone @ hotel. But I really needed to vent. And I hope this might inspire some changes. So thanks for checking out my review. I don't dwell on negative so this is probably my first negative review. But I had to get it off my chest.Stayed here for a few days for a conference and Sheraton provided an extraordinary experience. Free shuttles everyday but must check the times they're available. If you opt out for no housekeeping for a day, they leave you a $5 off food voucher towards a meal (awesome). The one individual that made my stay here worthwhile was the general manager (Dogus, pronounced as Dohsch) mainly because he was extremely approachable and hospitable. He went above and beyond to assist in any way we needed such as driving us to our destination, giving us a quick tour of the city and getting to know us on a personal level. He's great and I would recommend this Sheraton to all my friends!If you're looking for a hotel to stay right in the heart of the city within walking distance of about everything sporting event, this hotel is perfect. Don't forget to ask for a room with a city view or else you'll have a view of an empty courtyard and other folks rooms. The beds are Not comfortable and the there's a daily parking charge. Yes, they charge daily for wifi in your room but it's free in the lobby area. For the price of this hotel, you should get breakfast, at least coffee but you don't. We had it brought to our room for an extra $54 a day. We're here for a wedding. It's always nice to have a room right in the hotel of a wedding you're attending so for that reason I'll go w three stars instead of two.I travel every week for work and stayed at this hotel for the first time (and hopefully last time) earlier this week.While the people and service were friendly enough, overall the hotel is dated and dingy.  On the plus side, they have an olympic size swimming pool, the shower is good and the rooms are quite large (and include a queen sofa bed if you have multiple people staying).  The negative list:  1)  No wifi available in the rooms (only ethernet cable) and my wireless card didn't work in the room either due to bad reception (see negative #2)2) Many of the rooms look out onto an interior courtyard (doubletree-esque but not as cheery)3)  There were stains on the furniture4)  The health club had ""StarTrac"" treadmills, if you haven't tried one before imagine a treadmill built around the time of StarTrek5) Hallways are dimly lit which gives an overall dingy feel I did not try the food because I was too afraid based on the condition of the hotel.Feel ripped off b/c:1. We were never told of the $17 parking2. I requested 2 double bed for myself and brother, called in advance.  Got there and b/c I used priceline, they gave me king size plus a 10 year old pulled out bed.  3. The inside looked like they've been repairing it since the 80'sWhy 2 star:1. The staff was nicePositives: If going to a hockey game it's a short walk. If you are traveling with dogs, it's pet friendly. Huge pool and hot tub on the 13th floor. Great water pressure and hotter water than most hotels. The toilet and shower was seperate from the double sink. Most of the staff was not UNfriendly...but not friendly and hospitable like most hotels I've stayed at. Starbuck coffee. Negatives: Lobby isn't bad but once past that- it is dark, dingy and oh so outdated. We went through hotwire so we got what we got, it must of been a suite. One king sized bed that practically took up the whole bedroom and a living room (dirty, very uncomfortable pull-out sofa), a wet bar, desk and tv. There was 3 of us and after seeing that we had only one bed, we asked to be moved to a room with 2 beds, but they said no since we booked with Hotwire.No wifi. Really? In this day and age? Hotels with a lesser rating offer free wifi. The internet connection was zippo as there wasn't good reception in our room. This was a HUGE negative!The wall paper was coming off in some areas of the room and I have never stayed in a hotel where it was so dark, even with all the lights on. With the curtains opened the bed area was better but rest of the rooms were dark. Our room had a stanky smell to it as if it was a smoker's room even though the hotel is smoke free. Pool was huge but needed algae remover or something. There was plenty of chlorine as it was very strong smelling but the pool bottom was slick. The hot tub didn't look very sanitary either.No restaurants or much of anything around the hotel. Close to the hockey stadium and 4 1/2 blocks from the Union Station (which is very dissapointing in the last 15 - 20 yrs), but the immediate area of the hotel is isolated and a bit itimadating. Lots of homeless people hanging out in the park we walked by to the Union Station. Bus station across the hotel.Other costs involved: $17 for parking per night (which, I suppose is normal for downtown). $14.50 for a burger or sandwhich with fries. $6.50 domestic draft beer. $9.00 for a kids' meal. $9 cab ride for 4 1/2 blks (the ride back from Union Station).I will continue to use Hotwie but will hope that I don't get this Sheraton again.If you want to feel like royalty, take a stay at this Sheraton.      A group of us went down for a hockey game and stayed here since it is located literally across the street from Scottrade Center.    The rooms are spacious and include a mini bar area with coffee maker, mini fridge, full counter top, and sink.    Besides a king size bed that is might comfy ensuring a good night's sleep, the rooms also have desk for business work and a couch that doubles as a pullout bed.  The bathroom area has a full sink and comes with a whole array of toiletries to suit your every need.   Where most hotels provide only shampoo, soap and conditioner, Sheraton provided shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, facial soap, lotion, and shaving cream.    This hotel is located in the middle of downtown, literally, so there are not many restaurants or bars to patronize unless you walk about fifteen minutes east to Union Station or fifteen minutes west to the riverfront area.    If you don't feel like walking, the hotel does have a bar/lounge area called Columns which is excellent,  granted the drinks are pricey (6.50/bottle domestic), but if Calvin is working, you are sure to have a great time.     They also have restaurant called Bistro which is pretty decent as well.There are just a few items that knocked this hotel down one star, one is it's location and when we checked in only a few of our rooms were ready.    As such, we had to wait 45 minutes to an hour until the other rooms became available.    The hotel did make it up to us though and allowed us a late check out on the following day.    The other issue I have and this is any hotel I stay at is paying for the internet service.      I cannot understand how a hotel that charges $50-70/night (ie: Comfort Inn, Super 8, etc) can offer free WiFi, but yet hotels that are high end and charge upwards of $100/night don't.      As a word of caution, be aware if you leave an item behind,  I am not sure if it just got lost in the hotel's communication process or what, but when I arrived home I realized I had left my phone charger at the hotel, when I called to inquire if it was there, the front desk said they would call me back.  I have yet to hear from them, despite making follow up calls.    I just said forget it and ordered a new one online.""When the 'Beat Me in St. Louis' convention comes to this hotel, it's usually a full month before any of us residents will get near the pool"", a condo owner told us.Another stay in the downtown Sheraton. The people are always very friendly and there are no complaints there. There are many little things that can add up over time though. This visit wasn't my favorite stay in the hotel but still this is a place I would stay at anytime.This hotel was exactly what we needed. Having a 9 month old who goes to bed earlier than us, we prefer to have a seperate sitting area and a closing bedroom so we can still stay up once she's asleep. This room provided exactly that, and I don't remember if we even requested it, so it was fantastic. I am not writing a rave review because the floor, walls, and furniture were pretty dated and thus pretty dirty - they either need a good shampoo or a replacement, but we were more than happy with the space and functionality of this room. The pool was fun and the deck surrounding it to see the city was really cool. My daughter signed into the wifi without asking me first and it is not free - you do have to pay per day, so when I called 30 minutes later and let the front desk know they removed the charge. That was really nice of them. It is $17 for self parking which is not indicated anywhere on the website - I really think it should be less or free for guests of the hotel, expecially when there are no events going on. Overall we were satisfied with this hotel.Hotel is very nice and clean.  Priceline rated 3.5 Stars and I agree I like it.Con: $17 overnight parking required if you have a car since there is no where else to park.  Not a lot of channels, but who's in a room to just watch TV.  Lots of selection to buy movies if that is your fortay.Gift shop is not cheap so try not to forget anything.  They did provide toothbrush and toothpaste w/o a charge.Pro: Refrigerator in room, sofa bed in regular room.For summer only, this hotel is about 1mile or a little more to the Riverfront Arch and Lacie's Landing where a lot of restaurants are.For Winter, drive Lacie's Landing parking is about $5 and Riverfront about $6Rundown hotel, but within a mile walk to all St. Louis attractions (except the Arch, which is about 1.5 miles).  Needs updated though, and looks like it is from the 80's with lots of stains on the carpets and walls.The front desk staffs are not professional and not good at doing their jobs.I booked my room 3 days before I arrived. when I arrived the hotels at 10pm on last Wednesday, I've been told the room is gone. and they have to give me a 2 beds room instead, which is fine for me. It takes about 15 miniatures to get the key, which I didn't understand why it took so long. In addition, their parking system has some problem that sometime it won't let you in without double activate your door access key.We really enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton.  The room was huge--almost bigger than our 1br apartment!  There was a little kitchenette, a double sink, and very sink-y pillows.  It was spotless.  We also liked the parking situation--you could leave your car in the garage, come and go as you please for one daily rate, and take the parking garage elevator directly up to your room.  If you are going to spend any time in Soulard, this hotel is a happy medium between that district and the downtown area.We got a fantastic deal on Hotwire for this hotel (one of two 3.5 star hotels in the downtown area).We got a great deal on the room through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a> so I suppose it's okay that, after the lobby, the place is a bit of a dump.  During most of our stay, the floor of our hallway was filled with  piles of towels, half-eaten room-service food, a few glasses, and a microwave (yes, a microwave).  The weirdest thing was that we saw the maid's cart, but that too was just sitting in the same place for the majority of the weekend.TIP: Park in the lot behind the hotel.  It's $10 for an entire weekend of parking, while the hotel charges $17/night. The last night we were there, we came back and our room hadn't been cleaned.  I'm not going to cry about not having a few clean towels and made bed to sleep in, but when we called the front desk they didn't take responsibility.  They said that without knowing it, we probably had hung the sign on the door saying we want to forgo room cleaning in order to help the environment.  Yea, it didn't really make a lot of sense to me either.  I asked for a free movie for the night and they said no way.  The next day a manager slipped a note under our door that gave us a free breakfast at the hotel.  So that was bizarre.Also, the pool is on the top floor with a view of St. Louis (as views go, it's a view of St. Louis) and is indoor.  So on a hot hot hot day like when we were there, it's not really ideal for swimming in.  Luckily, St. Louis is pretty tiny so you can't really be located in a distant place.  But the people at the front desk also didn't really have any good info for us about seeing the city, except they kept repeating that it was dangerous and we should drive everywhere.  Did I get stabbed? No.  Would I stay here again? Big maybe. So I guess that's a 3 star hotel in an nutshell.This hotel is pretty nice. The interior was a wee bit dated. I could tell my room used to be a smoking room. It still had that stink to it. Otherwise, the hotel was nicely decorated. The rooms are pretty large. I'd stay there again.Pleasant staff, but uncreative room decor. Everything besides the arena is over a mile away from this location.Pretty nice hotel all in all...suite was huge...i mean big..decor was a little dated but not terribly so...we ended up having to bring our dog on this trip and it was the first time i had taken a dog to a hotel(i read in advance that they did) and they were so nice about it, they made me feel like they wanted my dog there...was a little hard to find a place for it to take care of its business but you are downtown...the only real downside is that its not in a super safe feeling part of town..walked across the street to take train down to the landing and I was glad there were 4 cops there to prevent me from being murdered....all kinds of thugs just hanging  out at the station...i think i wisely chose to take a cab back instead..fare was only 10 bucks so you might do that in the first place if you are lacking a sense of adventure.Had dinner reservations @ bistro 14 before a concert. We have done this before out of convenience and it worked well. This time we were confronted by 3 people at our cardoor informing us it was 30 to valet tonight (normal price $5). That was bad enough bit they were also just really rude about it.  They need to be careful because the convenience to Scottrade arena is the only good attribute of his place. It is old, dirty and rundown. My prediction is it will not be around much longer.  So onto dinnner at their restaurant Bistro 14. You would think they would be prepared on concert nights, nope!  Took 25 min for a waiter and a dumb one at that. Took 1 hour to get apps and a salad. Food was actually OK if you can take the rest of it!This hotel was so disgusting and dirty.  There were stains all over the carpet and dirt in the bathroom.  We had to ask for fresh towels.  When you walk in the lobby it is absolutely beautiful but don't let that fool you.   Run as fast as you can to another hotel!  It's a shame, I used to love Sheraton Hotels but wonder now if all are this bad.","The room was spacious and clean.  The bed was extremely comfy!  The decor is slightly dated as it is an older hotel.  Staff was friendly.   Our dog Twinkie enjoyed her stay.  Pets are welcome, but there is no grass to do business if you have 4 legs.This place was great! My friend just turned 22 and we planned on celebrating like we were 21.  We pitched in to get two suites right next to each other.  It was a little pricey but not outrageous. It was very easy to get to from downtown as you go straight down 14th street.  Their parking garage was set up strangely, but there was plenty of space and we were provided with two spots.The greatest part of this hotel was location location location!  Our plan was to have our group bar hop around Washington Avenue.  from the hotel it is easy walking distance.  We got there in no time and had to make one turn so it was very hard to get lost even with some alcohol in your system.   The rooms were very clean with lots of space and huge comfortable beds.  Being the young crowd that we were, we were a little loud for most hotel standards and their security did come to remind us to quiet down, but they were very polite and just doing their job.  I had an amazing time and will go again.Definitely enjoyed our stay!! The staff was friendly, rooms were clean. I also felt like the hotel was secure and safe. We got a great deal on the room by booking through the Blues group rate and I definitely intend on staying there again next time.A solid three-star experience. I booked the Sheraton for a last minute road trip via <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a>. For $85/night, I had a swanky room on the 6th floor with a courtyard view. Aesthetically, the room was great and bed was comfy. The downside? The walls are paper thin. I could hear doors slamming all around me, the television next door, and the toilet flushing upstairs. Other Cons: - During check-in, the queue was six deep with only one clerk. The manager appeared, asked who was checking in. Everyone responded, then he walked away and never returned. - There are only three elevators for the hotel, which led to slow transport and massive queues building up in the lobby. - One of the elevators broke and was out of order for the duration of my stay. - Parking in the hotel garage was $17.00 a day. - A serious lack of restaurants within walking distance. The Hard Rock was closest, and it was several blocks away. - The pool was swarming with children the entire weekend. In addition, there were no clean towels available as of 5:00pm.  - The jacuzzi was broken. The jet streams weren't working, and it felt like sitting in a tub of lukewarm dirty bathwater. - Children were playing in the jacuzzi unsupervised, including a diapered toddler. - The floor around the pool was drenched and super slippery.Pros:  - The Sheraton is located directly across from the Civic Center MetroLink light rail. And by directly across, I mean it's in the front yard of the hotel. Very convenient. - There is also a Downtown Trolley stop and bus stop located right in front of the hotel. - It's only a five minute ride to the Arch and other attractions via MetroLink.The cheap rate and public transport were the real winners for me in this hotel. Had I paid full-price, I would have been upset, but for $85.00, I can't complain too much. If you're looking for a place to lay your head while you spent most of your days exploring St. Louis, stay at Sheraton.For the price of the room you will get a large space. After that there is nothing special about the room. The couch and chair in our room was so old that my wife sat down and I had to help her stand up because she fell so far down. The positive is the that if you are going to a Cards game you are within walking distance to the stadium. Go to the Westin down the street. You will spend a little more but you will enjoy your stay and room.Swing and a miss. We stayed as preferred guests (even got upgraded to a deluxe suite) and were treated pretty poorly. We had 6 in our group and we all arrived at different times throughout the day. When some arrived, the front desk clerk refused to distribute keys to those whose name were clearly on the list for our room (even after verifying ID). Our guest of honor (bride) had to go to the desk in order to obtain a key. Mind you, all 6 keys were already MADE with the names of people who they belonged to behind the member desk and those guests STILL couldn't gain access to keys. After we could get to our room, it was spacious and clean. The rooms could use some SERIOUS updating, though. As long as you don't have to interact with front desk staff, the hotel is slightly above average. Definitely over priced.Wonderful hotel. Very pricey restaurant $13 for sandwich, $20+ for dinner. Basically across street from Savvis Center and stones throw from Union Station. Very friendly &amp; accommodating staff at front desk. Took forever for my request of a bottle opener but the hotel was absolutely packed due to a college hockey tournament in town, so I understood. Decor is typical Sheraton style. Room was very clean and spacious (king bed). Had fridge w/ bar sink. Really strong water pressure (almost painful) in a rain-style shower/tub. Beds are comfortable as are pillows (which is unusual for hotel fare).Parking was in 3-level garage with elevator access directly into the hotel.  They give you a convenience card to open the gate, but it's still $13 a day to park.  It filled up very quickly on Saturday night and getting back to the hotel was not a pleasant experience due to the Blues hockey game traffic.  Several roads were closed, but that's not the hotel's fault.  Just something to keep in mind.Overall, I liked the hotel.  It was a convenient location, the zoo &amp; several restaurants were within 10-15 minutes.  I will stay here again.I don't understand the negative reviews.  This place is gorgeous, the staff is very helpful and friendly.  The price was great, and so is the location.  I'm so glad I chose this hotel.We stayed here 8/24-25/12.  Its a decent hotel.  Clean (abit dated and dark) and the staff was helpful. The room was huge. There is NO free WIFI.  There is a huge bus stop hub across the street which looked dicey at night.  It is located in an odd spot. Not really within walking distance of anything except the Scottstrade place and maybe the Peabody.  There was some construction going on so maybe it will be better later.  There was alot of cabs so getting anywhere was quick and easy.  I cant say anything bad but Id probably stay somewhere else next time.Good place.  We got a BIG room for $180 nightly, which included ""continental"" breakfast (included choices of cereal, croissants/muffins, eggs, bacon, oatmeal, fruit, etc. - tons of stuff).  The room had two queen beds, a nice sitting area, and two televisions.  I think there was a smaller room for even less.  We tapped into the wifi for free.  Beds are comfortable and the building is nice and secure.  The room smelled a little stale, like it may have been a smoking room in bygone days.Pool and hot tub area, and fitness center are decent.  There's a nice observation room surrounding the pool, so lots of bright light.  The immediate area is highways and commuter train track, so the views aren't all great.Walking distance to Union Station, the Arch, the stadiums for the Blues and the Cardinals.  Also a MetroLink stop across the street.The staff are super friendly!A real dump. There are stains all over the carpets, dirty laundry is always I the hall.  Rooms while huge are dark and dingy. Furniture is old, frayed and covered in stains. The worst was when I got into bed and pulled the covers up there were brown marks all over the sheets. Truly disgusting. I've stayed at holiday inns that are worlds better than this dung hole. Avoid!Hotel is conveniently located near Scotttrade center as well as metrolink and bus stops. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful, but rooms and facilities are in dire need of refresh/upgrade.This is the hotel I stay at every time I visit St Louis. The staff is always friendly and the hotel is very clean. The rooms are inviting and relaxing, and the beds are always very comfortable. This hotel has an indoor pool and hot-tub on the top floor with an outdoor observation area. It is beautiful especially in the evenings. The location is perfect if you're visiting downtown St Louis. The hotel says that parking is $17 per day, yet if you park behind the hotel in that lot, I believe it is closer to $12 per day.The location is great right off of 40E downtown area. The lobby was clean elegant, there was a pool on the roof top with windows. However the rooms were a mixture of plaid old couches mixed with extremely old date wood funiture. The arrangment of the funiture was awkward. The t.v. stand was on the side of the bed rather than infront of the bed. Nothing was upgraded like in the lobby. Carpet was flat, cheap &amp; dull along with the curtains old thick vintage nothing seemed to say ahh. I wouldn't stay here even if I received a free night. It was not cozy.finally someplace giving a bonus for declining housekeeping. one of the best staffs of any hotel.very mixed crowd of people staying, some business, tourists, in for sporting events, teenagers for school sports, etc etc.condos in one half make for an interesting setup. always lots of dogs in the hotel, coming and going!the king bed is wonderful.Good deal through hotwire. We had a bachelorette party at the hotel and were pretty happy with it. The rooms seemed oddly isolated from each other - it seemed to take forever to get through all the hallways - but that was probably good for our purposes as well as the other guests there. We got upgraded to a suite for one of the rooms and it was quite large, with plenty of couch space for everyone in addition to the separate room with 2 queen sized beds. The only awkward thing was that the bathrooms themselves were quite small. The beds were INSANELY comfortable, from the mattress to the sheets to the pillows - that was great. There's a nice pool up on the 13th floor that seems to be open all the time. It's pretty well located although the area nearby can be a little sketchy at night. The only really bad thing was the rip off parking.Do not stay here! Horrible service. Spent $200 on a room and the room was not ready two an a half hours after check in time. Poor staffing by management in the bar/restaurant.I would give it 0 stars if I could.  I can't believe this place has more stars than the Hyatt down the street.  I stay at the Hyatt every week.  They have excellent service, comfortable rooms, and great food options.  The Hyatt was sold out this week so I was looking for a similarly priced alternative.  At the Sheraton, you get a beautiful view of a highway ramp, and all the noise that goes with it.  The shower pressure is poor, the towels are tiny, the outlets at the desk are so loose they don't work, the breakfast food is so manufactured I found it inedible, the wait-staff is indifferent, the parking lot is strange... I could go on.  I will never stay at this hotel again.This is a really nice hotel! I booked through hotwire, per usual, and this was my result. I was very pleased! The Sheraton is a great location in terms of hockey games or other events at the Scottrade Center, and only a long walk/short cab ride away from Busch Stadium, Laclede's Landing, and other touristy attractions. The room was awesome! Huge! The bed was comfy and I liked the toiletries. The staff was also super helpful as both my friend and I forgot our toothpaste! Overall, great hotel stay at the Sheraton!This hotel is outdated. The rooms are large, so that's nice. I hadn't seen a CRT T.V. in a hotel in like FOREVER!! Staff not helpful and boarderline rude. In fact, the between the front desk and the valet (who brought the wrong car down EVERY TIME!) we never attempted the restaurant! AVOID! The only reason we stayed here is because the Westin up the street was full for some Jesus convntion or something. AVOID!","Wow, where do I begin? Lets start with the location which hits the trifecta across the street from the interstate, some sort of bus station, and an abandoned government building.  My view however didn't allow me to see the beautiful location as it looked over an interior courtyard/neighboring rooms.  The 27 inch big box TV was very nostalgic, thanks Starwood!THE GOOD-The best bed I have ever slept in in a hotel.  AwesomeTHE BAD/UGLY:  I encountered the rudest and most ridiculous desk clerk on the over night shift.  I have never been treated so poorly.  The room I stayed in was pretty torn up.  Scuff marks all over the walls.  But, damn...that was was comfy.Once again a good hotel!  Once again a hotwire hookup!  Around 70 a night.  A few blocks from Busch Stadium.  Easy to get to.  Comfortable ass beds!  Only bad thing was 17 a day to park which is a tad bit weak sauce.  Its downtown though so its understandable.  Friendly staff and a cool bar that has happy hour specials to get your drink on before you head down to the game.From being in Saint Louis before and not having a great experience at the Holiday Inn I opted for a more well known hotel that usually has a good reputation, here comes the Sheraton.Most of the hotel room sizes are 550 sq ft which makes for a really considerable amount of space for a hotel room. The room I requested had a King sized bed, Queen sized sofa bed. As I mentioned there was plenty of space which was nice. The bed is really comfy and seems to be an ultra plush bed. When we got there the covers weren't clean, they had noticeable brown spots here and there. This was changed immediately at our request.Maid Service, as everybody whose been to a hotel knows they tighty up the room everyday during the morning/afternoon. Sadly this wasn't done at all, she completely skipped our room and we didn't have a Do Not Disturb sign up. We had to call the lobby to get the room cleaned up (with fresh clean towels brought in and such).The internet is where it gets interesting, they have free wifi for the lobby but it costs $10.95 a day in the guest room. Please keep in mind that the internet is NOT wifi in the rooms, it's a direct wired connection, only one! This was pretty much a let down for me, so if you have more than one laptop with you, sadly only one of you will not get internet access. For those who are tech-savy as I am, the service locks in your MAC Address for 24 hours.The location of the hotel has an exit right off the highway which makes it really convenient and easy to find. Parking is $17 a day with valet at $23 a day. The parking is a bit tight depending on what type of vehicle you're driving.This hotel has a nice sized pool &amp; hot tub which I think is pretty awesome. The nights we stayed there, it was practically empty there which was nice and relaxing.I've been to other Sheraton Hotels and I honestly expected a lot more, such as free internet, maid service not missing a room, the bed being clean and such.Regardless it was a pretty good place to sleep at especially since the beds are super comfortable and they have REAL PILLOWS unlike the Holiday Inn.I will say that the hotel staff was pretty nice and helpful and fixed up our issues right away.Clean but just mediocre service.  Rooms were large and comfortable, fridge was available.  Really not happy with customer service aspects -- meeting our needs, conceirge, etc.PERFECT LOCATION downtown.  Near the Metrolink, walking distance from Busch and Scott Trade Center.  Rooms are decent..good size, comfy bed, somewhat dingy though.  Not really good lighting.Service...eh.  The front desk/concierge were about as helpful as a tourist.  When asked about breweries and bars to check out all she could say is ""go to the landing"".  ""Where's the landing,"" I asked....""just take the train there"".  What?WIFI will cost ya $11/day.  Parking $17/day, but if you valet its $23/dayWe made the mistake of also getting breakfast at the restaurant here.  Service was INCREDIBLY SLOW.  My server disappeared for a solid 20 minutes!  All I wanted was a refill on my coffee...and for 13 dollars I was expecting an outstanding Frittata...it was just mediocre.  $4 for a cup of coffee or milk?  WOW!  Thankfully, I used points to stay here...if you get a good deal, its worth it for location...but don't expect much service!Actually, I want to give this place 3 1/2 stars.  My bf booked this place on priceline or hotwire and we surprisingly got it for a good price and got a suite!  It was a little on the older side, and not the cleanest (the couch and chairs had stains and the carpet was a little dirty looking), but the beds were very comfortable and the place is in a great location. It is walking distance to all the sports venues (though a good walk to the Edward Jones Dome--football), Union Station (shops/restaurants), the Arch, other hotels, restaurants, etc. I agree that the parking is a little steep--$17/day and the garage was almost full when we got there on a Saturday afternoon.  The bar in the lobby area was okay--a couple of tvs.  They have a delicious brownie desert on their restaurant/room service menu that was worth every penny. We walked around upstairs and they have a nice banquet/meeting room floor as well.  There's a pool and a big balcony that looks out over the city where you can lay out--too bad it was a bit chilly for that!Great hotel near Busch staduimStayed here for a conference and hotel was extremely nice. Food served to us was wonderful and staff very friendly! Great location to MetroLink!The main thing going for this place is its great location. Literally right in front of the Civic Center MetroLink station, so it is convenient when using the MetroLink from the airport. There is a short walk to Busch Stadium and the Gateway Arch as well. It was nice to get the attention that I got upon entering the hotel lobby. I was greeted almost immediately and checked in quickly. A little snafu came when there were still someone staying in the room that we were reserved for, but that was quickly resolved by the staff. I don't know how that mistake could've happened, but oh well. Fortunately there was nothing inappropriate going on when we walked into the already-occupied room. :-)The rooms are on the average quality. Surprisingly, the king bed room also included a sofa and chair, so it was almost like a suite. The window looked out into the central courtyard with a view of the inside of the hotel. A little lame and disappointing. I would've liked a window looking out into the city. Unfortunately the sheets had some kind of stain in it, so that's a big no no. Since I only stayed for one night, I didn't bother to bitch, but otherwise I would've asked for new sheets. The bathtub faucet also didn't work correctly when you pulled on the metal tab to switch to the shower head, and it made for a very messy (and water-wasteful) time in the shower.Minus one star for the mistake of providing a room with people still in it, stained sheets, and malfunctioning fixtures. Again, since this was only a one-night stay, there wasn't a need to bitch and moan about it to the staff.Location, location, location! Can't go wrong with the central location of the Sheraton in St Louis. Its close to Metrolink, Busch Stadium,Gateway Arch, and Amtrak which is a huge plus for travelers. The service was top notch and staff was nice and helpful. We were greated immediately and the room looked like a suite. It was spacious with a fridge and couch and very comfortable. No wifi however, booo! So that wasn't good, but we were on vacation so no Internet wasn't such a bad thing as we had our phones. The king bed was nice, cozy, and comfortable...something your looking for when your traveling. I was very pleased with my experience with Sheraton St Louis City Center, I recommend staying here.Good place to stay in downtown St. Louis. On the plus side:Relatively convenient for sightseeing in St. LouisRelatively good price, comfy suite rooms, restaurant and Starbucks onsite, as well as pool and exercise room.  On the minus side: Wired internet in rooms for a $10.99 per day. I am never a fan of being charged extra for internet access.  There is free wireless in lobby and common areas but you are blocked from accessing any free wireless in the rooms.  Parking is $17 per day.  Room service food  is so-so.  Location is a five minute walk from Union Station and from metro access, and about a half hour walk from the Arch.When I am staying at a hotel, the only thing that I ask for is a clean, comfortable room and to be left alone. This hotel fit the bill. The bed was so comfortable and the room was very spacious. The staff was friendly. I am a person who does not need a lot of hand holding so I don't know how knowledgeable the staff is about the city because I do my own research before I travel so I know where I'm going. I am on a restricted diet so the refrigerator and the microwave upon request was a huge plus. This hotel is located directly across the street from the Metro Link. This is a HUGE, HUGE bonus because that train takes you directly from the airport  which saves on transportation costs since you don't have to use the Super Shuttle. The buses and train took me to everywhere I needed to go. The hotel is within walking distance of Union Station and the Scottrade Center. I have no complaints. I will definitely stay here again.For a little over a hundred a night on a Saturday with a AAA card, we were in the perfect location for a Blues game. The front desk person was very nice and friendly. The parking was convenient, less than other hotels in other downtowns, and you could park and come and go as you pleased for about the same cost as special event parking for the game itself.  The room was also spacious and clean.I have stayed here a couple of times while in town for fun.  The hotel rooms are very large but somewhat dated.  They are not super clean but are servicable.  The location is great.  Close enough to walk to all the big places in nice weather and just across the street to the local transit/train when it is sweltering hot.I wasn't repulsed, but I wasn't impressed either.  Lobby was nice.   But the room was unkempt.  The carpet was soiled, and the place seemed in need of a major overhaul.   We opted out of our King Suite and headed up Spruce to the Westin.   The Westin was incredible!A great hotel choice in St. Louis. The Sheraton City Center is in a very convenient location (next to Amtrak station, Metro station, blocks from Arch and Stadiums) so it was a prime choice. there are other more centrally located hotels, but for the price and the size of the rooms, this was an excellent choice. Huge hotel rooms for the regular size (would have been interested to see the club and suite rooms). great and accommodating staff and hotel personnel. only thing is it could have used more taxis around for guests. but another trip to the STL would probably get another stay here.Good:*Location:  Quick walk from the Amtrak station, where I arrived, and practically next door to the Scottrade Center, which is where I was heading.*The room was up to the usual standards of hotel cleanliness, though it did smell smoky (despite being a non-smoking room). Bad:*I thought $159 ($187 after tax) was high for one night in the middle of the week (Wednesday)*Not only did Internet access cost money, but it was possible to buy it over and over in their confusing purchasing interface without any sort of confirmation screen.  I got double billed, once for unlimited and once for 2 hours.  Why did their purchasing interface even allow me to bill myself this way?*No one told me the Internet was free in the common area. Golly... wonder why they wouldn't tell us, when it's $10 in the room?*The front desk was unhelpful with the Internet charge and removed the cheaper charge, even though I'd used just 15-20 minutes of access and thought paying for the $5 session was more fair.  Only when I told them I would be escalating my complaint did they erase both charges.  I escalated my complaint nonetheless through Sheraton's website and have yet to hear a helpful reply on the matter.*I couldn't find the continental breakfast, but the ""Bistro"" restaurant attached to the hotel was offering standard breakfast items like oatmeal for $8 a bowl - what a steal!  Needless to say, I went out walking looking for somewhere else to eat. *There are no eateries exceptionally close to the hotel.  Not even a McDonald's!*Someone, presumably housekeeping, pounded my door loudly at 8:50 am and tried to enter.  The safety latch prevented them from entering, but it didn't prevent them from slamming the door against it multiple times until I was hiding in the bed like a pansy. They then apparently lost interest and continued down the hall.  I've never had this happen at a hotel, so I wonder why Sheraton was different.I don't think I'll stay at any Sheraton again, and DEFINITELY not this Sheraton, unless there's simply no other option available.Loved it! The room was very nice, lot's to do.  I've stayed 3 times!Wonderful staff, large rooms - awful food.",,"['disappointed', 'see', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'whole', 'family', 'great', 'rooms', 'clean', 'comfy', 'beds', 'main',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/renaissance-st-louis-airport-hotel-st-louis,Renaissance St. Louis Airport Hotel,3.5,$$,72,"Great hotel, very comfortable beds and rooms at an outstanding price, very competent and quick check-in, the breakfast buffet was several notches above most hotel breakfast buffets. We took the bell hop's recommendation and had the pork chop for dinner, it was top-notch. Our daughter is at WashU but we will stay here on all visits, even though the drive is farther, because the value is very good, the food is good, and the hotel very is very comfortable.This review is about my experience as a commuter at a two-day conference, rather than an overnight stay. There's a lot of space for events, and much flexibility in room arrangements, as I attended large group lectures of several hundred, and breakout sessions of 25 to 50, all with comfortable seating and good acoustics. The food was tasty, from informal sandwich lunch to formal plated banquet. Restrooms were adequate, and the bar area elegant. The parking lot gates weren't working correctly, prompting two visits to the front desk to get out. The staff was friendly and responsive to my requests for assistance.After my stay and complaining to corporate, the assistant general manager contacted me and apologized for my terrible experience.  He seemed very sincere and I wish the multiple people I complained to while I was there had advised him.  I'm pretty sure he would have moved me to a different room or come up with a solution.So, if you are having a bad experience ask to speak to Ryan Johnson.  He seemed to really care about customer service and making the hotel a better place (and he is a recent hire, so the conditions I experienced cannot all fall at his feet.)He also reimbursed me for my ruined sweaters.So, given Mr. Johnson's sincere efforts, I am increasing my rating.Had a full day and a half stay here and there is much to say! First, the staff is wonderful and very accommodating. I was allowed to check in very early without any hassle. Food, yum. I started my day with the gouda tomato frittata and frites. I loved it! I also loved dinner! I had the arugula pear salad with the request of an addition of salmon and spinach and boy was it delicious! The next morning I was able to request off menu items such as scrambled egg whites and wheat toast with pb. I mention this because again the staff was just so accommodating. I also enjoyed the turkey sandwich and my colleague absolutely loved his pretzel app that he ordered! I recommend dining in the hotel as the food is pretty tasty. Also the lounge area stretches throughout the main lobby and is inviting and comfortable. The gym was simple. I like. It had the basics and was open at the crack of dawn so that was great. Not overly crowded either around 5pm!  A few things I noticed that the gym also had a nice filtered water cooler, antibacterial wipes, and apples for guest. Overall I gave the establishment 4 stars as I thought the hotel rooms could be a little more updated. Seeing how 'sassy' the lounge and lobby area was, I suppose I expected the rooms to have the same or close to the same feel. Two areas I unfortunately wasn't able to explore were the pool and libations. However overall a wonderful experience!I've stayed at this hotel before and I think my experience before was way better than this past Sunday. The lobby and outside of this hotel is beautiful. Shows more of a modern decor than before. The staff was friendly besides the shuttle service. The driver wasn't rude but def expressed that he didn't want to be at work that day. Some people are not morning people either so I can undersatnd but we all still have a job to do. Now the rooms... The room I got this time was on the second floor. I didn't care what view i received so the parking lot was fine. Now the pillows were way too soft, as if I wasn't sleeping on a pillow. They had no feathers in there what so ever. Also, the bathroom was not updated. I'm sorry but changing the sink to a granite countertop does not suffice as an updated bathroom, more like an updated countertop. The water pressure sucked. The whole bathroom can use a little update. It was somewhat dirty. I saw some old staines on towels and a lot of dust underneath the sink. Maybe just a good scrub is what that bano needs.Mickeya was a wonderful waitress!  She was very attentive and fun.  We requested her the second time we ate at Norah's.  She definately takes pride in her work and it comes through in her lovely smile!Thank you Mickeya!This was not my first choice hotel, but we stayed here since our other Marriott options were totally booked. My expectations were not 100% met for a Renaissance brand hotel. I was disappointed with the lack of attention to detail with housekeeping. Yes, the rooms-particularly the bathrooms, are dated, but if they were spotless, they would present in a nicer light. Also, there are plumbing issues in the hotel, one of our rooms did not get cold water in the sink, only hot water. The tub faucet was also falling off the wall. It was clear the maintenance staff hung out in the room after their visit (which didn't fix the water problem), because the TV was set to a different channel and the pillows a bit dented up when we got back. I do have positives: the lobby looks very fresh, the bellhop, valet and security staff were very friendly and helpful. I just don't think I would stay at this property again. It's just not on par with the Renaissance brand expectations.Pretty looking place, but service (either at the front desk or at the restaurant) leaves plenty of room for improvement. They're not timely, lacking manners, lacking attention... Is it a neighborhood Waffle House or a proper hotel?Great place to stay... Service is spot on. Immaculate. Friendly staff at every level! Will definitely be back!Nice hotel with great decor throughout except for maybe in the guest rooms. When I entered the hotel, it was very modern, beautifully decorated, and unique. I didn't have one complaint about how it was designed. It looked like it could be a boutique hotel. When we finally got our key, we found the hotel room to be pretty average. Sure it was clean and had all the basics, but when you enter a lobby like they had, you expect to be wowed by the rooms as well. The service was not the best I could have gotten. We arrived a little before check in time. It was like maybe 30 minutes. Our room was still not available so we decided to relax and rest in their lounge area by the bar. They said they would give us a call when it was ready. When the time came and still no phone call, we got up and checked. It was ready, only no one decided to call us, and we had told them we would be waiting in the lobby as well. Thanks for wasting out time. The hotel is located really close to the airport. There wasn't very much else around. The area gets kind of sketchy at night. There is a Hustler store like across the street so you can get a feel of what kind of neighborhood it is located in. You have to pay for parking and it gets crowded pretty quickly at night and on weekends.Regular visitor to Airport Renaissance and Norah's restaurant. Great food and excellent service from Mika, Maurice, Curtis and Brendon in the lounge...and if course Bethany. Great team always makes us feel welcome.I had a conference at the Renaissance. They are in the middle of a remodeling project so I am trying not to judge or be too harsh. The parking lot was a mess, HUGE and I mean HUGE pot holes. I was afraid my car was going to be lost in one. Once I got inside, no signs to mark where our conference was being held. I finally found a person that worked at the hotel and she directed me where to go. We were on the 12th floor, very nice. Room temp was perfect for the morning session. Coffee, fruit, tea and danishes were available all morning. Restrooms were neat and tidy. The afternoon session was on the other side. Lunch was stuffed chicken and mashed potatoes. Chocolate cake was amazing. We had five ladies at our table and four of us asked for coffee.. Here is the fun part. We were told that they would have to bring the coffee up from downstairs. Okay no problem. They brought the coffee up in cups, not a carafe cups...... We were speechless........The afternoon session was a little cold. So I think that I am being fair on my review. It was good and bad.We used the parking services for this hotel.Great rates only 3.99 per day plus taxes and fees.  The shuttle picked us up immediately in our way to airport.  It took a good 20-25 min to catch the shuttle back from the airport.  The only reason for the four stars was because of this and that on our way back the driver hoarded around everyone waiting for a tip.Would use again.I have never been impressed with this property! It looks great from the outside and even strolling through the inside might get your attention, but if you dig any deeper you might not be so impressed. My room was clean looking, but had a smell that never went away - thank goodness I had some cologne to spray! The amenities in the room are pretty basic and I really hate that mint shampoo and conditioner - don't get that crap in your eyes because it will burn all morning! The bed is typical, but the pillows at this one have never been as comfortable as many of the other Marriott properties. Service - well - this is where the 2 stars come from. They have never treated me like a guest at this hotel - more like a nuisance. I have never gotten the feeling like they care you are there OR what your status is. There is also a fee for parking and the internet - if you are gold or above the internet is free. However, I couldn't get on line the first night even after spending an hour with the hotel help desk. The second night I tried again - different person and after about 30 minutes I was able to connect. The fitness center is better then most though - so the 2 star rating is a solid 2 stars and could have gone up to three if I actually would have had time to use the fitness center. I will be looking for a different Marriott property the next time!I stayed there recently for work; my first business trip with Boeing and first time in St Louis.  The breakfast buffet in the morning was really good with lots of yummy items; or they will make an omelet for you too.  I did not eat lunch or dinner there so I cannot comment on those meals.  The room was big with two good size beds even though only needed one.  I swam in the pool one night after work; it was warm enough but once I got out I froze my butt off.  I felt bad as I had to go thru a gathering to get back up to my room from the pool.  If I did not feel under dressed before I sure did with my swim suit; etc.  Wifi worked well for work items; parking also was good with the rental; and everyone seemed helpful.  The only reason I did not give a 5 was the valet guys.  I was told I could not park in the circle in front of the hotel even if I was just checking in to get my key; figure out where to park for the best route to my room.  They took my rental car keys; not sure why that was and they never explained.  They asked if I needed help once I brought my bags from the car parked in one of their lots.  When I declined politely I heard the valet man tell the other one that ""I have enough money and can afford it"".  They have no idea who I am or how much I make; not good customer service there at all.  They were very loud and obnoxious when I was going into the hotel each time.  Like I said if the first person that sees you says you cannot park there and nothing else; not a good start.  Luckily the rest of the hotel was very good to make it 4 out of 5.Held our wedding reception at the hotel in the upstairs ballroom on 5/16/2015.Our Catering Manager, Rachel Simon was great, very accommodating, very professional, walked us through all the myriad details, from the tasting to the banquet set up.  Was easy to contact via email and responded to all our questions in a timely manner.The hotel booking agent Elizabeth Wurm worked with us when it came to blocking out rooms for our party and allowed us to add rooms using our group discount when it became apparent we had additional guests staying over. She also gave us a running list of which guests made reservations.Judy Trask, the Banquet Captain was a delight to work with the night of the event and kept everything running smoothly.The ballroom looked great.The food was outstanding and we received many compliments on it. And the staff was wonderful.  They took the time to take one of our guests, who has various food allergies, through the line and explained all the ingredients of the various dishes to her so she could choose what she wanted without worrying.  My brother is a special needs individual and at one point I saw a staffer helping him navigate the crowd in his wheelchair when he needed to get to the men's room.  Everyone we worked with, from the waiters, to the bartenders, went out of their way to make sure all our guests enjoyed themselves.I cannot emphasize enough how happy we were we chose this venue.Now, since everything can't be 100% positive - on the down side, the Renaissance does charge a 24% service charge, which does not include tips, which, in my opinion is fairly steep.  Several of our guests had to wait over an hour to check in because their rooms were not ready.  And the Sunday buffett was on the mediocre side, but that's all I can come up with.In summary - if I had to do it all over again I couldn't think of a better place to have our wedding reception.Chuck S.Hotel was nice and staff was nice at the front desk and helpful but every other staff member was an issue. The people that load the bags tried to hustle us into taking car service to a convenient store because they claimed there was none around-there's like four within walking distance, when food was undercooked they just walked away without a care, any questions you had they would just walk away- it got to a point where it was kinda funny how much they didn't care, they were always trying to rush you out of your table to clean your plate---basically they didn't give a shit about anything and it really shows.This is a hotel that I really want to like...should be able to like...but it just falls short. It is a very classic art deco Renaissance that was remodeled a little while ago. It still feels fresh and newer...but they just don't get the little things right. The rooms are huge and so are the bathrooms. Now for the little things...they have a great exercise room...but the TV's on the treadmills didn't work. The concierge lounge ran out of food and the attendant's response was ""we were really crowded earlier."" The water pressure on the shower was so low that I had a hard time getting it to switch from tub to shower. Two of four elevators were out of order...and two of the TV channels would come and go. I spend over 100 nights a year at Marriott properties and was a little surprised by how little this property was on top of things. Great potential...but falls short of what it should be.I am a professional traveler and I have to warn others about this hotel. Bring your wallet because Renaissance wants it. The horrible breakfast buffet is 15 bucks and no where can you get a free cup of coffee...or water. Parking is 10 bucks a day!!! Also it is costing me 10 dollars to leave this review...internet in your room is 10 bucks a day.They refer to me as a ""GUEST"" but I sure don't feel like one.I like this hotel; it is convenient to the airport and is a classy place.  Note that it is also a very busy hotel, hosting literally dozens of events every week and over the weekend.  It's also a very beautiful hotel inside and outside.Rooms were large, and we got an Elite upgrade to the Club Level.  Beds seemed a little old but were ok.  Restaurant is top notch but at a hotel price.  Bar same story.  WiFi worked great, and the bell stand help is very friendly and helpful.To get here take I-170 to Natural Bridge and go west, or if coming from the West you can take the Natural Bridge exit off of I-70.","***This Renaissance is a decent, Marriott-esque hotel; the room rate is not that bad though you do get hit with extra costs like Internet and parking***The exterior design of this hotel feels like a building out of the 70s, but the inside of the hotel is mostly nice and relatively contemporary.  It feels very much like a Marriott though you get a little more modern design in the lobby, hallways and even the rooms.The rooms were nice.  The bed was comfortable and the shower was good (comfortable room temperature too).  The bathroom was a little small.  Unlike Courtyard Marriotts, you don't get complimentary Internet here, but the fitness center was a nice size and it was 24 hours.For Marriott Gold Elite members, they do have a Concierge Lounge and it was pretty decent and comfortable.  There was a big screen TV and some couches and such.  At night, they offered complimentary items including salty (maybe too salty) snacks like chips, mixed nuts and Chex Mix, cheese, fruit, crudites, chicken wings, and a few sweets (cookies and brownies).  For drinks, complimentary soft drinks and bottled water were available.  There was also an honor bar.The Concierge Lounge also offers a complimentary breakfast, but you do have to get there early before it all gets picked over.  For hot stuff, they had scrambled eggs and oatmeal (I think).  There were other items like cereal, granola, yogurt, bagels, and a wide range of pastries including cinnamon rolls, danishes, and several flavors of muffins (the muffins were pretty decent for a continental breakfast buffet).  Complimentary juices, milk and bottled water were available.Like most Marriott hotels, service was friendly and good here.Room rates are reasonable (even during the week).  You do get hit with some extra costs like Internet and parking fees, which I believe is $10-$12 per day (for self parking).The location is okay.  It is not that far from Downtown St. Louis though I'm not sure what the traffic is like during rush hour.This Renaissance is a decent hotel and provides an experience similar to a Marriott.  Like several Marriotts, you do get hit with some extra costs like Internet and parking that you can avoid if you were staying at a Courtyard Marriott.  Still, the rates are reasonable enough where this is an okay (and not too expensive) Marriott brand hotel for the area.As mentioned, self parking is available and is right next to the hotel.  Parking is $10-$12/day and it is very easy finding an open space.  Valet parking (which has a fee as well) is also available.Worst marriott ever, impossible to find. Sleeping in the parking lot of a mcdonalds now, thanks Marriott.This hotel looks great on brochures but when you arrive on campus, you quickly realize that it is a tired old building that has gone through some cosmetic surgery.  Up close, save for the lobby, It looks and feels like a 1980's Las Vegas casino.Before you even set foot in the lobby you have to navigate a very irksome parking lot consisting of entry and exit ways blocked by metal bollards which are apparently a part of a defunct paid parking system.  Guests constantly have to navigate around ridiculously placed grass islands and other barriers just to get in and out of the place.  Immediately outside the front doors is a huge circular landscaping structure with a rusted sculpture in the center.  It is absolutely pointless.   I guess I shouldn't complain too much about these things, given that parking is free.As previously mentioned, the lobby looks great.  The decor is all swanky modern.  And in true Marriot brand style, you are hit with aromatherapy immediately upon entering.   Adjacent to the check-in desk is a half-moon bar and lounge area, which always seems to be buzzing.  There is a restaurant next to the lounge but I have not eaten there.The rest of the building is not quite as impressive.  You won't be hit with extremely obvious neglect.  Rather it's a series of smaller things, like quirky elevators and old furniture.  You just get a sense that the building is well past its lifespan.  Old football stadiums get torn down and a new one gets built in its place.  But apparently the hotel industry doesn't work like that.  The good news is that the staffs are all as professional as you would expect with the Marriott brand.  Prices are very reasonable and, as previously mentioned, parking is free.  But one thing really stood out for me: this hotel is directly across the street from the St. Louis international airport and almost directly under one of the runways.  Interstate 70 is also directly adjacent to the building.  I've stayed here numerous times and if you hadn't seen it driving to the hotel, you would never know you are right next to an international airport and a major highway.  They must be using extra paned windows because it is absolutely silent in this place.This is not a memorable hotel to stay in.  But all in all, for what St. Louis has to offer (especially in the North-West suburbs) you won't find much better for the money.  You just have to be able to tolerate a sense of oldness.I did not go to the gym! The hotel was not a good idea to walk to! Oops! It had a wierd faux modern vibe. Everything that I needed was there. They didn't have my room ready for me when I arrived but it worked out in the end.Classic Renaissance. Nice remodel, rooms are great, and it has become our go to spot for business travel. Our rate always includes wireless and breakfast, I don't like the $10 a day parking/$12 valet.Love the restaurant, because they have reasonably priced, great dinners, but they do have leisurely service.Do not stay here!!! This place is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  I'm a frequent traveller and come to st Louis regularly I've tried to give this place a chance but time after time something goes wrong.  First the hot water didn't work.  Then their elevators broke down.  They have been in a 6 month renovation on elevators and they say it'll be another  9 or 10 months.  So just say a little prayer before your go get on it that it doesn't breakdown on you. The latest gem is that there is a piercing noise coming from the air unit that they can't seem to fix.  I got NO sleep and had to call twice in middle of night to make noise go away and the guy still couldn't fix that.  On top of that I had to ask for some compensation for my inconvienance and they didn't even offer it on their own had to discuss with manager! Really? I'm mean common sense tells you if your guest in a hotel is up all night because your hotel is a dump you should credit them!To add to insult this place is very expensive and act as they they are some 4 star place when they are no better than a motel 6.  They charge for Everything and it's not cheap.. Internet parking etc... Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else in St. Louis not this dump!I stayed at the Renaissance St. Louis Airport Hotel for a work conference. The staff was very friendly and accommodating especially the banquet staff. they made sure that all my meals were in fact gluten free. If I was rating the staff I would give them four stars.  The Lobby had been recently renovated and was great for enjoying drinks with colleagues  The rooms and especially the bathrooms seemed really outdated and not well kept. My room in particular had huge black streaks on the  walls and wall paper that was peeling off the wall. If I go back to St. Louis I think I will try a hilton or Hyatt instead.Nice place.Here are the criteria I judge a hotel on:Cleanliness - Its spotless. Food Option - If you get stuck in STL due to the weather, the food is tasty bar food with healthy options. Room - more than adequate for someone traveling on businessLocation - Its not in the downtown, but with the crime rate in STL, why would you want to be downtown? The lobby has just been fully redesigned and its very poshe.Stayed here the last weekend in May, 2014 to attend a Koren Specific Technique Chiropractic Seminar (KST).       I flew in on American Airlines from DFW and within 15 minutes of landing I caught the shuttle to the hotel.  It was a brief ride; the driver was very nice.      Checked right in that Friday early afternoon at the counter with the help of a very friendly young lady.  All the employees were friendly and it seemed like they truly enjoyed being there.       Got to my room up on the third floor which was very clean in every aspect and spacious.       Went down for a late lunch. Had their gourmet burger which was excellent!       That evening the seminar began in one of their conference rooms that was to hold 60 of us for the weekend.      Everything about the large conference center is designed for the attendees to have a great experience of which I did.       The room's bed was perfect for me.  The hallway's were quiet as was the room as I could not hear anything going on from inside the room.  The thermostat made some annoying clicking noises, but I was able to take care of it.  I watched a bit of a movie on the rather large monitor which was fun.      Saturday mornings breakfast was a buffet which was excellent! I am totally impressed with their kitchen and with their waitresses and waiters.      The Saturday seminar went from 8am until 7pm.       At 8pm I got to attend the seminar's VIP supper.  There were 16 of us and we ordered off the menu in the restaurant.  I had a steak that was absolutely wonderful!  I didn't need a knife as I used the fork to cut through the exquisite piece of very well prepared meat on a bed of mashed potatoes and asparagus.  For dessert I indulged in their Mississippi Mud Pie which was very rich and very tasty!       Sunday's breakfast was the same as before...very, very good!     The seminar ended just before noon Sunday morning.  I quickly caught the shuttle and minutes later I'm at the airport waiting for my flight back home.     I totally enjoyed my stay at the Renaissance and in their conference room.  I highly recommend it.  I look forward to staying there next year at the KST seminar!This is a classy hotel with clean rooms and a competent staff. My wife and I always show up with high expectations and have them exceeded at every turn. From the front desk to the concierge, everyone seems eager to make your stay memorable and special. The bar/restaurant area has been recently renovated and gets an A+ for both libations and nosh.Great management must be the key, we'll be back!Update- The front desk gave me the vouchers to the restaurant because the concierge lounge was closed for the holidays.  However, they did say that the lounge would still be open, just not serving food.  I was disappointed that it was not open and the front desk was absolutely clueless.  Plus, my bed had blood stains on the mattress pad under the sheets and the only cup in the room was on the luggage rack.  This hotel also never values its platinum elite members as I have never been upgraded or even on the concierge level (except maybe once) out of the 11 nights that I have stayed there within the past 5 months.  Plus, this hotel is extremely inconsistent with amenities and I usually have to call to have them open the self parking gate.  It doesn't make sense that the parking pass given to me always somehow still asks for payment when the fee is already included on the room charge.  Furthermore, I had my company hold a meeting there as well.  We are all loyal to the Marriott rewards program but are disappointed in the options available.  The airport Marriott is just so rundown and outdated that I'd pick this hotel over that one (after about 4 nights there the past year).  I personally had the worst experience at the downtown renaissance (1 night) and will not be staying there again either.  The Marriott west was more to standard based off of 1 night but they aren't in a central location for me.  So, after 16 nights at Marriott properties in St. Louis, I will be taking my business elsewhere due to the horrible customer service, inconsistency of standards, and a nonexistent appreciation for loyalty.  This is 4 nights next week alone.  And by the way, the restaurant is really really slow! The best part of this hotel was that the restaurant staff is super friendly and this one gentleman, Bill or Josh was super pleasant.Good option if you want to stay close to STL airport. The shuttle service is relatively convenient and they will take you to the nearby rental car outlets instead if you want. The rooms are nice and pretty soundproof, so you can't hear the planes taking off. Not a leisure destination, but when on business, why not.......Check out the Lobby bar/ lounge/ restaurant!Well decorated and comfy- lots of different types of chairs and areas to sit and entertain in. Didn't feel like a hotel lobby. I live in st louis and love visiting this place to a surprise friends for dinner in their restaurant out for a drink at the bar.Friendly staff, too!Excellent service from curb to room!! Airport shuttle every 15 min!! Nice bar and concierge lounge.The staff at this hotel are very rude, unprofessional and do not appreciate their guests at all. They also charge for parking, never had to pay for parking at a non-downtown hotel in my life. Avoid this hotel if possible.Despite my previous comments my faith in Marriott as being a top rated hotel has been restored. My comments were read and a personal message from the general manager of the hotel said he would do everything he could to correct the problems. He actually appreciated the feedback. So I am happy to report the staff and the general manager stepped up and did everything he could to make me want to come back.  So I will come back.I was here for a Sci-Fi convention so I really didn't get to interact with the hotel too much so I can't really give a solid review but from the few times I did interact with the staff, I was treated very nicely and they were very helpful with answering my questions and getting a solution to the questions I had.The hotel was very nice and clean, and the outside of it was very well up kept and was very pleasant on the eyes.  you are very close to the airport but apparently the sound isn't heard inside, at least I didn't hear the few planes I saw on their take offs from the lobby windows.Stranded due to storm, booked on smart phone at <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbookings.com&amp;s=870c59e355bb2e7df4f23b1812d677515b1045fe2f9204148c24387ae889143b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bookings.com</a> while in airport and in the room within 20 minutes. Only complaint is that room never really warmed up to over 70 degrees but temperature outside was -4 and front office agent that checked me in did not explain any amenities and did not direct me to the elevator which is a minimum expectation in a full service hotel. Bar food service and quality adequate, prices reasonable for this quality of hotel. In room dining same. Airport shuttle runs every 15 to 20 minutes and lucky me it was at the door when I came down at 430 in the morning!It was my first visit to St. Louis, and I had never stayed at a Renaissance hotel before but have stayed at numerous hotels throughout my lifetime. My expectations coming in were not high, but my experience here exceeded any benchmark I could have made. My room was beyond crisp and fresh everyday, the staff went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and happy, and the decor of the lounge is modern (almost too stiff, however). The gym was a bit small, but it never got crowded at any time of day so I think they did a good job at gauging the expected capacities during peak workout hours (early morning, after-dinner time). I'm currently staying at a Renaissance hotel in a different location and the experience isn't as pleasant as it was in St. Louis. I would reccommend staying here for corporate events with co-workers, but you may need to venture out 25-30 minutes to find restaurants and lounges.","Three recent stays and I am happy with the service here. This is a full service place... so service is the deal! I had a noisy room and they swap me out presto to a quiet corner of what I like to call this place.... the Death Star segment. Think about it after you see it.Inside, the hotel is tastefully appointed and very pleasant.Good showers, easy web, and comfy beds round out the essentials to go witht he friendly and top-notch service.I stay here one night every week before flying out the next morning. The staff is exceptional from check-in with Ali to Brendan in the Concierge Lounge. The lobby and lounge are first rate. The restaurant is 4-star and worth the price. The rooms are the one shortfall. The are old, small, and in need of updating. The 60s style wallpaper is worn and peeling in most rooms. The rooms are dingy and require the use of 4 lamps to adequately light the place and all contain 2 incandescent bulbs and not CFLs.Amazing Transformation. Kudos to the decorator. Love the new look, feel and style. This hotel has went from a ""what is expected large corporate 3 1/2 star hotel"" to a ""Wow-should be a solid 4 star hotel""  We stay here every year and I felt I was in a completely different hotel. Beds, Rooms, Restaurant, Staff, all amazing. Super big flat screen TV with too many channels - (a good problem)  Thanks. I look forward to next years visit. Caution: Do not park on the Waffle House, Jack in the Box side of the hotel. There are VERY frequent break ins of cars here. Be smart and hide your valuables and especially your GPS so you don't temp them. Best to park on the pool side of the hotel near where the valets park.I'm a Marriott Gold level Rewards member and stay at many Marriott properties in the US.  This hotel is one of their better up to date airport properties in the Marriott portfolio.  The rooms are of average size and more modern than many other locations.  The lobby and lounge areas are nicely decorated with a more upscale look.  We ate at the restaurant for breakfast.  This is the only negative aspect of the hotel.  Like every other Marriott full service restaurant, the food was overpriced and nothing special.There is also a charge if you self or valet park your vehicle.  I assume their proximity to the airport dictates this policy to keep the freeloaders out of their parking lots.Overall if you are looking for a comfortable, updated hotel in the St Louis airport area - stay here.One thing that was great about this place is the free shuttle service. I wasn't expecting shuttle service but I noticed the signs at the airport and was able to take it to the hotel.As for the room itself, I guess I just had a bad room because the cold water faucet swung all the way around, past the off position. It got pretty annoying and I could imagine being more annoying if I stayed for more than one night. I also didn't have an iron in my room and had to call room service for it. They delivered it relatively quickly, but that iron was horrible. It kept leaking water. As I was ironing my shirt, it would just streak it with water and soak it. That iron was in no way usable. The hotel itself was nice, and the staff was very accommodating. Aside from those two issues, it would've been a nice stay.Nice staff.  HORRENDOUS motif.  The 1970's look really looks terrible.  The hotel is starting it's slide downhill.  When the guests look like they belong at a Motel 6, it's time to change hotels.I stayed at this property 07/06/12-07/08/12 I was in St Louis for medical reasons. Several things went wrong during my stay:1).According to the call center the hotel was 9 miles from the St. Louis Arch and there was also a shuttle available.  Upon leaving the hospital I called the hotel to take advantage of the shuttle. It was then that I learned that the shuttle was only available via the airport. I advised the woman on the call of my location and asked how to get to the hotel, she was not able to tell me advising that I should take a taxi or utilize the Metro and once I was at the airport I could call back for a shuttle pick up. I was tired and not interested in the hassle so I took a taxi a $34.00 ride which proves the hotel certainly is not 9 miles from the Arch. 2) the elevators were out of service or being serviced so there was a long wait 3) there was a stale odor in the room 4)the hotel was very noisy 5)I ordered food and was told I had to come down to the front desk to get it. When I finally dragged myself downstairs the clerk said I should have explained I was sick and he would have made an exception. 6)the ice machine was leaking all over the floor. I mentioned it to the front desk several times but no one ever came to resolve the issue. 7)the breakfast at the hotel was not good 8)the maid never bothered to clean my room. But the biggest issue I have with this property is that I sent an email to Bill Fontes the GM expressing my displeasure with my stay he called me twice and then sent an email stating he could not reach me I replied to his email and he never bothered calling me back or even shooting me an email. My advice is DON'T BOTHER STAYING HERE. Its not worth the headache. Its certainly not an example of the level of service I've come to expect from Marriott.Inattentive staff.  Arrived about 1:30 am, nobody manning the front desk.  5 minutes later a clerk shows up.  No apology for the wait, she had the attitude that I was interupting her evening!  She couldn't find my reservation, so I had to go to my car to get reservation info.  I said to the clerk, ""DON'T GO ANYWHERE!"".  Guess what!  She left again!Beware of the secret charge for parking!  They charge $10 per night, but they don't tell you about it until checkout.  And, you're going to pay; they have your credit card!No frig in the room.  For a 3 1/2 star hotel, they should have a frig.  Also, no free WiFi; even low end hotels have free WiFi.In the parking lot, the gate arm quit working.  A guest kept pushing a the call button on the box for help, but nobody would respond.  Result, 20 car traffic jamb in the parking lot.Renovation of the lobby area was needed and turned out very nice.  Now they need to renovate their rooms to the Renaissance standard.  The staff is hit and miss.  Most times they are competent.  The restaurant leaves a great deal to be desired.  Way over priced with service that is less than ideal.  Eat somewhere else.  As a platinum-elite, I see many Marriott/Ritz Carlton properties and this one is middle of the road.Very nice hotel  in a not so nice spot. Perfect if your just staying for a conference or  layover. Not really any attractions in the area though. None in walking distance anyway. Multiple pools and very well appointed workout room did keep me occupied though.We haven't even started our stay yet and we are already having issues. I realize that check in time is not until 3pm, but we arrived early (for a huge wedding) in hopes that at least ONE room would be ready. We were told that they needed about two hours to get one room done. So, no problem. We call back after the two hours and they were short with us. Said that check in was not till 3. I wish they would have been truthful with us at the beginning.We stayed here for a night while we were in St. Louis.When you first arrive, you need to park in the guest parking lot (anywhere outside), and then pick up a packing pass from the front desk when you check in. You need to insert the pass everytime you leave the parking lot, and supposedly you're charged off that.Checking in was reasonably quick. They were out of double queens, so we had to settle for a king and a rollout bed. We ended up leaving for downtown shortly afterwards, which meant that I had to pick up our complimentary champagne when we got back.We ended up getting back after midnight, so I tried getting our champagne the next morning. However, we were told that we could not bring the champagne outside the hotel, and they refused to give it to us.Room-wise, it was just okay. It was a bit on the smaller end, and they didn't upgrade us despite her platinum status.Breakfast came with the room rate ($129/night), and it was actually pretty good.This property is alright. I'm a Marriott points-lady, so it's an easy place to stay near Lambert. The renovations to the lobby are beautiful. The staff is pretty nice, but most of the time when I'm here, I have to wait about 20 minutes to check in on Monday nights, which kind of sucks because I just really want to go up to my room and lie down. Also, the room service menu leaves something to be desired, there isn't a great selection. Overall an ok property, but I prefer the Renaissance Grand downtown.I was very pleased with our one night stay here. The bellmen were all very friendly and very quick! We called down to the front desk to get some help with our luggage so we could check out-honestly within 4 minutes, he was knocking on our door. We ate dinner here too- service was GREAT and our waiter was very attentive. Ask for the bar menu if the regular menu doesn't look appetizing to you (it didn't to me). The bar menu is ALOT cheaper. We ordered chips and dip as an appetizer (ONLY $0.99!), the bf got a turkey avocado sandwich, and I got a burger. We were so stuffed. If you're hungry and feeling lazy, you should eat here-yummy!I had stayed at the Airport Renaissance about 6 years ago for a work trip and came back for a conference this year and was highly impressed.  They did a great renovation and the place looks stellar.  Outside of that, the hotel itself is doing a superb job.  The lobby is very fancy, they did a great job with check-in as there was a very large group checking in for the conference all at the same time, they made it very efficient and easy.  The restaurant onsite was very good, I ate all my meals there during my stay and was very impressed, everything was tasty, the breakfasts, the steak dinner, nice work guys!  There was even a free vodka tasting on the day of our arrival and live music in the lounge, which I thought was very fun.  Downside, they do charge for internet, which I always find annoying, but you can get free wifi in the lobby.  The conference room was large and accommodating, and the food provided for our work event was great, I was impressed with the service staff and everything involved in the conference that was done by the hotel.  The rooms are very large, spacious and comfortable.  The beds were cozy, and the rooms very quiet.  Everything was clean, and well kept.  The hotel gym was ok, fairly standard.  I believe they do have an indoor and outdoor pool which is nice to have options for both.  There is a free airport shuttle, and this allows access to the lightrail to get to the downtown area.  I was super impressed with this hotel, and would not hesitate to stay here again.  I would also highly recommend it for people looking to book an event, conference or otherwise.  Good work stepping up your game Renaissance St. Louis!We stayed here because we had an early morning flight out of Lambert and wanted a place close to the airport. It was fine given what we were looking for. The price as the best part of this hotel as my rate also included parking for up to eight days. The shuttle service to the airport early in the morning was very convenient. The other service, however, could only be considered mediocre. The front desk did their job but didn't provide a terribly warm welcome. The wait staff in the lounge was very slow and not very attentive. While the price for the room was fair the lobby bar's prices were more what I expect in Chicago and not St. Louis. If you looking for a place to stay and proximity to the airport is your most important consideration this hotel is fine. If you are spending some time in St. Louis and the proximity isn't important then I would stay somewhere else.Nice BUT...wifi s/b free in entire hotel..comfy bed, nice airport view.  Room need a small fridge!  Still having issues with my bill BUT overall good night stayPretty good hotel overall. It seems that the rooms have recently been renovated, the beds are nice, good HDTV and clean. The bathrooms are kinda small and tend to steam up really quickly, even with the door open (scandalous). I also wish they did away with the tub. The rooms overall are somewhat small. The location is good if you need access to the airport and the room service is tasty but spendy. This place gets the job done. Oh and the concierge lounge is good if you have access to it.Had our wedding reception here June 6, 2009. We were at the top floor looking over the highway and can see planes taking off. We we're impressed with the food there and the hotel staff was very nice.. Our room was very nice too. We always stay at the renaissance whenever we go to Chicago too.. we just like this kinda hotel. I recommend this hotel for wedding reception.. or a place to stay.Let me start with that i have stayed here on many occasions, and i am a Marriott Platinum elite so expectations are high since i spend alot of time at Marriotts.  The good news is that the lobby has been remodeled and that weekend rates are low and include parking - but that is about it.  Rooms usually have issues, you can not get the staff to respond to requests, the staff generally has an attitude that you are doing them a favor staying there and you should be happy that they are even talking to you.  You should not have to ask mutliple times to get a request satisifed - so if you do not mind being dis-appointed with the service then you usually can not beat the price - if you care about service - do not stay here","Stayed here for the weekend.  Close to the airport, you can see the planes take off, but very quite, you wont hear them at all.  It will not bother you when you are asleep.  Room are pretty nice. We got two room with connecting door, great for the kids.  It has pool, but we did not use it. Parking is $10 with in/out privileges. Overall very satisfied with they stay.  Highly recommended.This hotel has a very nice facade...beautiful fountain in front, decent looking pool &amp; workout areas. The rooms look very nice.Check in was a snap because we'd already paid on Priceline. The parking situation couldn't have been simpler, though the parking lot is pretty dark at night and far away from any sort of security.The room was nice. The bar was small, not busy, but it took awhile to get service. Lots of empty plates and glasses on the bar waiting to be cleared, so we couldn't get a seat. They had two bartenders working that night, but they must've been the ""B"" team, because they weren't on their game. This is not to say they weren't friendly. Liquor and beer selection was decent, but fairly minimal. They serve a limited food menu at the bar until midnight, which is nice for late night arrivals. It was also VERY cold in the lobby and bar area. We stayed on the 4th floor. I dunno about the rest of the rooms, but the walls between our room and the adjoining room were quite thin. Whenever our neighbor and his friends rolled into their room around 2:45 am and decided to act like idiots, we heard every word. We had an early flight and needed some peace and quiet, so I called the front desk to complain. I dunno exactly what they did, but it took 15 minutes for our neighbors to shut up.After minimal, noise interrupted sleep, we rose early to get ready for our flight. The coffee maker in the room was pathetic. It was a one cup, one serving, ""brew it right in the cup"" style that came with one regular and one decaf cartridge. There is a Starbuck's in the lobby, but it doesn't open until 6 am, so for any early fliers, this isn't an option. Checkout was easy, but the woman at the desk in the morning knew nothing about the ramp construction on the way to the airport (.5 miles down the street) and the detour we had to end up taking. She just told us to go straight and follow the signs, but ""straight"" was under construction and we weren't able to do so. After turning around a few times, we found a back way to the airport. Being essentially an airport hotel, you'd think the front desk would be more on their game about how to get there. Overall, the experience was average. Thin walls, bad in-room coffee service, sub-par bar service, and lack of knowledge about the route to the airport was evened out by ease of check in and out, parking availability, a nice door person, and a beautiful setting. The price (through Priceline) was more than worth it for what we got. An average experience all the way.Great hotel for business travelers and the shuttle service is very prompt. The Lobby has been renovated and is ultra modern, great decor.I have stayed there a couple of times now for business trips. It's not anything fancy but not bad either. They offer free shuttle to pick you up from the airport. They have a nice bar, a pretty decent jacuzzi, and average hotel food. The room is pretty spacious and comfortable. I like their large HDTV. Too bad that they don't have 24 hours room service...it closes at 11pm.On a recent trip to the Louis the Saint, our large group booked a several rooms here, (6 in total) the initial impressions were grand. As you enter the parking lot you notice the size of the building in all its glory. Not a bad view. Although that quickly changes when you drive a bit forward and notice the non working fountain and are instructed by the valet that you must park your own car. Nonetheless I must give credit where it due. The valet attendants were really friendly and helpful Sean in particular told us about all the local hotspots and was courteous with his instructions and suggestions. The rooms were clean and the beds were super comfs! The bar/club in the lobby was inviting but $6.25 for a Blue Moon and $8.14 for a breakfast croissant is a bit ridiculous. Overall, I enjoyed the stay and would def recommend this place, to anyone who is looking for a respectable hotel at a decent price.I'm only going to review the T-Bone Trattoria, the restaurant inside the Renaissance Hotel. A friend was staying at the hotel and invited us to dinner. I must say, for a hotel restaurant, this was a really pleasant surprise! Obviously, the place specializes in steaks and chops. However, I opted for the Kobe beef meatloaf (yum!) and blue cheese mashed potatoes (even better.) Good service and pretty decent prices. I would come back here for dinner without needing to stay the night.We stayed 3 nights.  We negotiated the price online, so it was a great value.  They have a small but nice, classy bar and separate restaurant. The swimming pool is clear and has an appealing set up.  The customer service was good.  The housekeeping did a great job too.  My only wish was for better noise insulation from the hall &amp; adjacent rooms.Stayed two night this past week and besides the fact that I needed to use my room key to get to my floor the hotel was great. The bed was super comfortable, nice flat screen tv's, and free internet in the lobby. No free parking was kind of a pain but it was very close to the airport but surprisingly quiet since I could not hear the planes come in even though my room on the 10th floor faced the end of the runway. It was also kind of cool to watch the planes come in one after another. I would definitely stay there again but I will definitely get my starbucks somewhere else. Yikes not good.My fiance and I were in town for a wedding and we decided to get the romance package.  It is hardly romantic when you have to ask 3 times for them to bring you the bottle of champagne.  Whenever we asked for something we never got it.  We wanted more towels but had to wait 2 hours until I decided to go and find one of the maids and ask myself.  The hotel was clean and the wait staff for the restaurant was great!  Actually I give them 5 stars but the front desk and the others get a very very poor rating.  the workout room is also amazing!!!  The valet guys were awesome as well.......but not worth all the money we paid in total.Follow up on this:  I did write a letter to the manager explaning what had happened and within 24 hours I got a response and a credit to my account, so some redeeming qualities about the situation.This hotel is part of the Marriott family, so you know what you're getting to some degree. And I generally like Marriotts, so no surprise that I liked this hotel.The staff was friendly, and the facility was very clean -- nicely appointed, too. I had a double-queen room, and it was HUGE. One of the larger hotel rooms I've ever stayed in. Bed was comfortable, bathroom and shower was fine -- standard Marriott. Only negatives were two minor points: the iron in my room was old and beat up a bit (but it did work just fine). And there was no wireless in the room; you had to request an ethernet cable from the front desk. (Huh?!) Actually, I didn't have to request a cable because I travel with one, but if you don't have one, you have to ask. The hotel is right off the airport grounds, and you can hear the jets taking off -- but not so loudly that it bothered me or kept me from sleeping. Oh, there's an adult ""boutique"" across the street from the hotel, too, if that matters to you. But it's still a nice property overall.Stayed here for 3-days while on a business trip.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Really appreciated the inclusive breakfast (a perk given to those who work for my company) and all of the healthy-options offered at the breakfast buffet (I was soo happy that I could eat all the pineapple, grapefruit and strawberries to my heart's content).  Room was very clean, bathroom had top-of-the-line Aveda products and the bed and linens were quite comfortable.  Having in-room wi-fi was sooo helpful as I needed to get a great deal of work done while I was at the hotel.  The front desk was extremely helpful - after I had checked out of the hotel, I had realized I had left a couple personal items behind.  I called the hotel and they immediately went to my room and gathered the items, placed in an envelope and kept them at the front desk for me.  Customer service is A+ here and I know I'll stay here again on my next business trip.I'm lovin' this place.  Very convenient, yet not the cheesy Day's Inn around the airport.",,"['great', 'hotel', 'comfortable', 'beds', 'rooms', 'outstanding', 'price', 'competent', 'quick', 'check', 'breakfast', 'buffet',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/marriott-st-louis-airport-st-louis,Marriott St. Louis Airport,3.5,$$,65,"Truly superior service at the restaurant/bar. Ate here several times during my stay in STL; each menu item I tried exceeded my expectation. Top notch performance from the staff, especially Brandie.Typical sandwich/burger: $14Typical dinner entree: $29Typical drinks: $10Highly recommend.PROS - Hotel check-in smooth and friendly, beautiful interior, clean roomsCONS - We were there for the Contagious New Years Eve party on 12/31/15. We had an adjoining room with my parents. We were room 2058, and they were room 2060. In our room, we had our small dog and my parents small dog to keep each other company during the NYE celebration downstairs. At about 12:15 a.m., we arrived back at our room, to which our dogs were overly excited to see us and barking. We quieted them down promptly, and all of a sudden there was a knock at our door. I opened it and there was a gentleman informing us that ""he had received multiple complaints throughout the night and we needed to quiet our dogs"". I apologized and told him that they were just really excited to see us, and he said that ""room 2060 had called so if they don't quiet down, we will be asked to leave promptly"". As mentioned above, room 2060 was my parents room (who were also down at the party with us) and their dog was with ours. Why would they be the ones to call and complain? I informed the gentlemen of this and that there was no way they called, and he assured me it was room 2060 and then walked away. I then proceeded to knock on our adjoining door. No answer. My parents weren't in there nor had they been all evening because again, they were downstairs with us. When they got back 15-20 minutes later, I informed them of what happened, and they were very disturbed that he used them as a scapegoat.Needless to say, the dogs did not bark anymore that night, and we never saw or heard from the gentleman again. I was very put off by the way he treated me and lied to my face about my parents calling. If this is truly a pet friendly hotel where I have to pay $50 extra for my pet to stay, I don't want to be threatened to be kicked out after getting back and my dog barking for 30 seconds because he is excited to see me. We travel with our dog a lot and have never had any complaints or been treated this way by a hotel. I travel a lot for work and typically stay at Hilton brand hotels. I have colleagues that rave about Marriott hotels so I have thought about giving them a try, but this experience has made me feel differently. I think I'll stick with Hilton.Great overnite here tonight. Every required amenity that I have. Lot elec plugs bedside on the lamp. Good tv and internet, though I did pay $15 for the max internet access. Seems good. Nice bedding and bath situation. Was placed here via the fbo Signature Flight Support at STL, where I parked and hangared our Merlin N307PA overnite. Cold here, 19deg, overnite forecast.Will def stay here again. Thanks folks. Great front desk folks too.Jan 12..another night here via short notice sched change. In a first floor king bed room. Double the rate of several nights ago, but front desk may be able to fix. Still a good value with the amenities offered here.It's home away from home.  I love it there.  It's always the same people when you go.  It's like you are among friends.  All of the rooms are clean and nice.  I always get a great nights sleep when I stay.  The restaurant and bar are great.  It is a great place for conventions.  The convenience of staying there is amazing.  If you travel internationally you will find the long term parking right next door.  Nothing like coming back form Asia and having your parking and hotel at the same place.   The Marriot will overwhelm you with kindness..I've been platinum and gold with Marriott for many years, so have stayed at many properties. This hotel rises above in terms of the staff's attention to customer experience. Everyone is super friendly and they generally manage to avoid being annoying. Obviously well-trained. They get my highest compliments.Visiting family and staying here for it's central location on main highway. Really like it here. Front desk staff well trained to meet your needs and friendly.  Enormous first floor with so many open and semi private seating venues to chill at. Contemporary furniture and comfy. Nice, large bar area filled with TV's all over, small and large, to catch your favorite team. The staff gladly changed stations a couple of times for us. There's a Starbucks full retail off lobby with a very friendly and helpful woman working there. They have an expanded product assortment of snacks, foods and a personal product area for toothpaste, hair products, meds, etc.  The rooms in the west tower are newly renovated and the rooms in the east are fine too but show wear so we called the front desk and without hesitation they moved us to west tower. Typical wonderful Marriott linens and very clean room. Requested a corner room for the extra space and it's nicely furnished and two walls are floor to ceiling windows with great views. Room 6000. And really cannot hear the airplanes so no disruption to sleep.Had the chicken noodle soup and it's actually homemade like my grandma's. Huge carrot pieces, celery, lots of chicken and great seasoning. Major delish! Hubby had a very tasty burger. This review is only from our first 12 hours here and hubby and I are very happy with this choice. I travel extensively for business so I know what I like and don't in a hotel. Definitely would come back here every time I'm in the area.Brandie is one of the best wait person as she is attentive and really nice.  She'll remember your name; nice.  Frank V.Let me just take a moment to acknowledge how thug my maid is. She comes by my room, decides she doesn't want to clean it, so she pulls out a gangsta privacy hanger and hangs it on my doorknob. You know. So it looks like I wanted her to stay out. Guess what happened the next day? I put MY privacy hanger and my maids EXTRA privacy hanger on the shelf, crawled over my exploding trash cans and piles of towels, and left. When I got back, I found the maid had hung ANOTHER SECRET THUG PRIVACY HANGER, and hadn't touched the room. That was really great, cause I totally hate clean towels, and soap, I effing hate soap. And I love my garbage - like, I like to have it at arms reach at all times.Now my one regret is that I didn't get my maid's autograph, because I'm pretty sure my room was being serviced by Ferris Bueller, and found a way to take ANOTHER day off.Staff at the lounge (Mary Jane and Nalia) are really nice and ensure you have everything you need. Night times are stocked with hors d'oeuvre and fruits. Rooms are a bit dated although there is a newly renovated wing.We stayed here on a Monday night for a super early Tuesday flight and Brandi down in the bar took extremely good care of us. The whole staff went above and beyond to make our stay amazing.  I wrote down the name of the woman concierge on staff who coordinated our dinner but I can't find where i wrote it down? I believe it began with a B anyways, she is awesome too.  We wanted some really good Italian food on our last night and they made it happen.  The driver of the shuttle I think his name was Bona? HE WAS SO NICE AND WONDERFUL and also made our last night in the STL a really nice time.  Super awesome staff that went above and beyond. And the bar prices are super reasonable for a Marriott bar.!!!!There is no doubt that the property is dated, but I also think that is part of its charm. The lobby area is inviting with lots of action going on between the bar and restaurant - the open concept is very inviting. The rooms are your typical Marriott rooms and unfortunately so are the bathrooms.By typical Marriott bathrooms I mean small, the door barely clears the toilet by 8 inches.  The lounge is a very good size and serves, breakfast and hors d'oeuvres - but unlike most other Marriott hotels their lounge food is actually very good. The restaurant also did not disappoint both dinners I had there were extremely good, the first evening I had the fish tacos which were really good and the second time I ate the Shrimp and Grits which were excellent. One would not expect to find Shrimp and Grits so well executed in St. Louis and much less at a hotel but this dish could compete with the best in Savannah.Despite its minuscule bathrooms, the food and above all the staff makes this one of the most enjoyable hotels that I have stayed at. I don't think that I have been to a hotel where the staff was more friendly than at this location - and that includes the Al Bustan Palace one of Marriott's flagship properties.Beautiful lobby. Nice bar with decent menu.Unfortunately, we were disappointed from then on.Upon check in, we had to ask about parking. We were never asked if we had a car. We were told to swipe our room key to get admitted to the parking area. We were NEVER told there is a $10 parking fee per day, (we found this out at check out on our final bill!). The fee is understandable. However, I feel it should have been disclosed.Upon check in, nothing was told to us about internet services.  We got to our room. I called down asking for the code for internet. I was told there was no code as there is a $9.95 fee per day. I CAN NOT TELL YOU THE LAST TIME I STAYED IN A HOTEL WHERE I WAS CHARGED FOR INTERNET!!! I feel this also could have been explained to us upon check in. When we got to our room it looked as if maybe it hadn't been rented out in a very long time. Dust on all the counter tops. You could easily write in it, it was so thick. Even our TV remote was dusty, (not in a clean cloth slip cover like most hotels.)On the morning we checked out, at 10:15 AM the maid knocked on our door. We told her we weren't ready to leave yet. She asked us how much longer we planned on staying. Well, she never needed to ask us that. Check out is 11:00 AM. When we left, we nearly tripped over her cleaning car as it was halfway blocking our door way.Very unsatisfied stay. Probably won't be back.A few bad experiences, mostly average and one good point.When I checked in the lady at the front desk wrote the wrong room number on my key card.  I had to come back downstairs and deal with her attitude as she made up a new card and wrote the correct room number on it.  She didn't mention her mistake, I figured that out when I came back upstairs and found myself at a different door.  Later that night someone knocked and then entered my room.  When I woke and asked who it was he said, ""sorry, wrong room.""  Seems unusual for after midnight.  I remembered to use the deadbolt after that.Room was average, tub is getting a bit grimy due to age.Very convenient to the airport.We decided to take an impromptu trip to St. Louis from Louisville since it was only 4 hours away and we've never been. We got a good deal through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and AAA to stay at the Marriott St. Louis Airport. First, the hotel is literally across the street from the airport but we never heard a plane. There is no valet parking or luggage assistance at the front door. Self-parking is $10/day. The outside of the hotel is extremely dated but the interior looks like it's been renovated. The front desk staff were courteous and did a pretty good job. We had checked in advance through the Marriott App since we are reward members and it made check in a little faster. The room was nice even though we got 2 double beds instead of the 1 king we requested. The pools were ok. Nothing special but we had a good time.  Overall the hotel would get 3-3.5 stars if not for the lack of cleaning in our rooms bathroom. The tub had so much soap build up and grime that as I stepped in I totally ate it. I was so pissed off I almost left. My wife also slipped in the tub but luckily didn't fall. I know there are a lot of rooms to clean but how hard is it to spray some scrubbing bubbles and rinse it off. It would have saved me a nasty bruise on my elbow.ehh.. I have a hard time with rating this one.  The lobby was beautiful, the staff was friendly.   The bar had a nice selection of beer, the restaurant had a good (but expensive) breakfast.  The room itself looked nice enough.  Typical teeeeny tiny marriott bathroom layout - have to straddle the toilet to close the door!  Definitely had been remodeled recently but I was stuck in the back tower and on the ground floor.  Lovely view of the parking lot and all of the associated parking lot noises.  Slamming car doors, stereos, dumpsters being emptied at 5 a.m.  Not exactly a peaceful night's sleep.  I wish they'd paid more attention to sound proofing the room when they remodeled.  Overall there are just nicer places to stay in the area for the same price.Had to stay over because our flight to Houston was cancelled late on Saturday night.  We got the airline discount for the room and got a nicely appointed, newly decorated room.Went to the bar for a snack and drink and Jenny waited on us.  She sympathized with our stay and said they try to make it up when a traveler is stranded.  Food was good (but toasted ravioli were dry) and drinks were outstanding.  Jenny made a great gin and tonic, herself, and even comped an extra drink.  It made a bad situation a great experience.I have stayed in more than 20 Marriott hotels this year and this was one if my favorites. Convenient location and gorgeous interiors. Breakfast was yummy and the staff was the friendliest I have ever met. They should train all Marriott employees to this location's standards.The hotel looks ancient from the outside.  We were a little bit worried driving in, but there has been a lot of upgrading on the inside.  The lobby and first floor had most of the upgrades.   The rooms still seem a bit dated and could use some cleaning.  It's not horrible but not 4 star.  It is super close to the car rental place.  There's a massive bar and meeting area in the lobby that was super popular.  I did get tickets for free drinks, too.  There is also a super convenient place to print out your travel items.Convenience and price means I could end up here again in the future.When I make quick trips back to St. Louis this is my go to hotel. I often take early and late flights and this hotel makes it so easy! The staff is quick and friendly. It's newly remodeled and very trendy. There is a place to print boarding passes and is directly across from Lambert. It's also next door to Budget rent a car. The bar is nice and there is a Starbucks in the lobby.This is a classic case of don't judge a book by its cover. We needed a place just to rest our heads but since there was a home Cardinals game, hotel prices were high around the downtown area. Thanks to Priceline, we scored this hotel (about 20 minutes from downtown) for $70. Driving up we weren't really impressed with the outdated and somewhat dirty exterior however when we walked in all was different. It was spotless, trendy and modern. In the lobby there is an array of cool lighting, a bar and ample seating. Check-in was easy and our rooms were comfortable with lots of space.Why 3 stars? Well, we had to pay $10 to park. For a hotel this nice a parking pass should be included in the fee.","Modern, decadent lobby, restaurant, coffee shop and meeting areas!  Then there's the throwback hotel rooms with the big box TV, AC when setting heat to 76, remains at a cool 65.  Started this review in April 2014.  Now it's May 2014 and...  hey now... check out the renovation!  Great new room interiors, flatscreen TV, big fluffy beds and multiple electrical outlets!  Reading light on the headboards, fridge...  Outdoor pool with cabanas is coming eventually, while the workout room is warm and stuffy.  Great staff, lobby bar and TVs!  Top it off with a glass of La Crema Pinot Noir.  Improvements are looking good.  Weather is better in the rooms, too.The stars are for the staff, who were HANDS DOWN the most courteous and professional I've ever encountered at a hotel. Their attitude and demeanor, their smiles and posture, told me they were proud to work there, and I was a wearisome traveler whose flight was canceled. Not only have I decided that if I need to stay in St. Louis for any reason, this will be my hotel, but I may even MAKE ST. LOUIS my destination for pleasure BECAUSE of this hotel. Raising the roof for Erica, Jackeya and Simone.A quick overnight stay...but it felt so luxurious!  Very friendly front desk staff, updated lobby,  and the room was fantastic! The interior of the hotel has been renovated and feels modern and clean. My room was cvery clean. The Starbucks/bistro was staffed with friendly personnel as well. Unfortunately I did not have time this trip to visit the concierge room but I have confidence it is as good as the rest of the hotel. A great example of what Marriott does right!Beautiful hotel! Comfortable,  modern rooms, friendly check in, great bar! The menu here is very tasteful.  Bartender, Jason,  polite and professional. Close to metro rail for downtown access. Airport shuttle. I'm always satisfied with my stay!Fine lower-tiered hotel, conveniently located right near the airport.  Nice free shuttle to the airport.Friendly and knowledgable bar staff. Several local beers on tap and a few more in bottles. Service was fast -- but surprisingly chatty. Recommendations were given when we said we were from out of town, and the bartender even bought us a round of beers! Modern, lounge-like ambience also. I'd say if you're staying in St. Louis, this is a good place to spend the night (despite its somewhat dated exterior).Had an unexpected layover at stl and did a <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a> search.  Landed this hotel and I can't say enough nice things.  The exterior may be dated but the interior is fabulous.   Upon arriving I was greeted multiple times and was quickly service by wonderful front desk personnel who were so curtious and friendly.  My room was clean and comfortable with modern amenities.  They had live entertainment inside and outside by pool.   I first remained inside, listening to the dualing pianos and had a wonderful roasted corn chowder at the bar.  The management was very hands on and assisted the bartenders due to the crowd.  They asked me my name once and I was addressed by it all evening, just a nice personal touch.  I then went outside where Jason Chase was playing cover music.  He was amazing. The poolside decor and furniture is wonderful...cabanas, a bar, two pools with sparkly floating lights.   Great ambiance!  Again, the servers were exceptional.   Slept great and probably overstayed my welcome with the late checkout.  Had a lot of time to kill before my flight so decided to lunch it.   Again with the service!  Wonderful!  First name basis again and super attentive.   Had a wonderful Bistro Burger cooked to perfection with yummy sweet fries.  Getting ready to depart via the free shuttle service.   I can honestly say that out of all my recent travels this was one of the most pleasurable experiences.  It's so nice to be able to write a lengthy positive review!  Keep up the good work!I highly recommend this beautiful hotel. The staff and management is top notch, treat you like you TRULY feel like a guest. I appreciate the attention to details and going the extra mile for their guests. Sexy lobby and bar area...oh and Marissa  at the bar is a mixologist! Sweet dreams STL perfect ending to a great trip! Love this place!If this hotel was not going through a huge remodel - I would huge renovation I would have given it two stars. Either way - I will not return to this hotel. The check in line at 9:30 pm was 15 people deep - the place was a freaking zoo and the lobby is located a mile from my room - I thought I was walking back to the airport! The price was extremely high for this location and the overall hotel service was lacking.My room was small, but extremely clean with crisp bedding that smelled fresh. However, the only bathroom smaller then this hotel room's bathroom was on the airplane I flew in on - this was incredible small. The view stunk and the parking - though plentiful was normally a long walk to where you wanted to go and it cost to park there. Again - nothing impressive or good enough to make me want to return.The guest computers for check in worked - once you found them and the restaurant staff was very good - nothing great, but very good. The food was very good, but the price made it less attractive.The pool area was incredible though - even though I never found the time to use it. this is as good as this review will get, because I never plan on going back. It will either be downtown or the Renaissance by the airport for me!Had to kill a couple of hours before our flight and decided to stop at Marriott.  Greeted by Nick at the restaurant...Introduced himself and gave us a great table.  Then Debbie, our server immediately arrived with the same cordial greeting &amp; intro.  Her recommendations were excellent and service was outstanding.  Very personable and accommodating, she made our time very enjoyable.   Food was very good also.  Hopefully, the majority of Marriotts are this pleasant.Very nice, great customer service, quite at night and the temperature of the room was very nice and comfortable. I would recommend this place to anyone.This is my first time staying at this hotel once I got here I was greeted at the front door with a very enthused staff. Which didn't stop there at check-in the service was top-notch again staff again was very gracious and made  check in a breeze. Once I made it up to my room the room had a nice standard size king bed room which looks well-maintained and clean. after relaxing,  my crew made it down to the hotel restaurant/bar I was the last of the three of us to sit at the table I was immediately greeted by Robbie who was not our waiter but was over the food and beverage department I hope I got that right he brought an extra menu and drink list to the table. upon walking up he was very friendly and engaged everyone in conversation made sure everyone was having a good time and if we needed anything to just let him know he was also very knowledgeable about what drinks they had available and if they didn't have something particular he knew what was similar to taste. Shortly after Jenny our waitress came over she asked us our name which I have never been asked before she was so upbeat and happy and knowledgeable of the menu and surprisingly she remembered all of our names throughout service. One of the people I was with had the chowder and said it was wonderful and feelingly. I had a hard time choosing what I wanted so I went with the burger I thought you couldn't go wrong and I was right. The other ladies I was with had wine and I was looking for something like an angry orchard cider  or REDDS beer which they did not have but they did have a Stella Cidre which was very identical. I was overall very pleased with my stay I hope to be coming back to this location when I am in St. Louis again on business. The outside of the hotel you could definitely tell it wasn't new once getting inside you could tell it was more modern updatedThis is a no frills hotel. This place charges for basic amenities most places offer complimentary. You have to pay to park, to use Wi-Fi... The room is comfortable, spacious. The location lacks anything remotely resembling civilization, it's only convenience is the Airport location and the freeway.The hotel looks old and dated from the outside, but it was surprisingly clean and modern inside. The proximity to the airport is great. The rooms are nice, clean, with in-room coffee maker which I love. The walls are thin, you can hear any noise in the hall. The restaurant was terrible. Avoid the restaurant, especially in the morning. Buffet food containers constantly empty, terrible service. They seemed annoyed that you even wanted their help.Typical airport, about what you would expect.  There was nothing great about it, but it wasn't bad either.I think this place has come a long way.   First time I visited I wasn't too impressed.   Now the remodeling is done and it's really nice inside.   I think the parking needs a better set up. But I understand why they have the key swipe.  If you need a place near the airport, check it out. Prices are right and the rooms are very nice. The restaurant has very good food.  A few local beers on draft too.Epic fail...It was one bad thing after another here.  It all started with my room not being available...My first room had two small beds and smelled like an old shoe..I should have known based on the dehumidifier in the room...After switching to a ""better"" room, I noticed the ancient furniture and wallpaper peeling of the wall...yuck...To top it off, my alarm clock light did not work, and I did not get a wake up call...If you want to make your flight, this is not the place for you.Polite and respectful service.  Larger rooms that were quiet.  AC could have worked a little better. Couldn't get cooler than 70 degrees in the room and it was May.  My biggest complaint is that of the theft that occurred from my room while I was out of the room for a funeral.  The cleaning staff sifted through all my clothes and mixed my dirty clothes and clean clothes together and then stuffed them into one of my bags.  Thus far, I have only noticed that they stole a blue Nike running shirt that I wore for a morning run, prior to showering and heading out for a funeral. Don't leave your laptops or credit cards in your room unattended.  They will likely go missing.  But what else would you expect from St. Louis?$10/night parking.We departed from the hotel at 6:45am our first day and arrived back around 4:45pm that evening. Our room had not been cleaned. Called the front desk and the said they would ""send someone right up"".  45 min later...no room service. Got back to the hotel that night at 10:30ish and while the room had been somewhat cleaned, they had not replaced the coffee. Also, breakfast buffet was going to be $17.30 per person! Front desk staff and Bona, the concierge, were outstanding. Will not stay there again, and would not recommend it.There is a lot of renovation going on here","This is another place I want to give a 3.5. If you're attending FSI it is close to the school so the drive is short, but anything else you want to do will require a bit of a drive. If you're staying here for less than a week it is a good pick, anything longer you might want to change. If you do pick here you have a choice between 2 towers. The Marquis tower has rooms that were renovated 5 years ago. It has HDTV, but you have to walk to the other tower to access the gym or executive lounge. The Main tower is being renovated as I type this. The rooms are a bit nicer than the Marquis. What gets me is why there isn't HDTV on this side. What is stopping them from putting it in this tower, but the gym and executive lounge are just an elevator away...So, pick your poison on what is more important. In hindsight I'd go to the Marquis tower and just enjoy the walk.It's about 10 minutes from the airport. From the outside you see 2 towers and a motel-type building. They are going through a full lobby remodel and it looks like it's going to be very nice. I was in the tower where check in is located and the lounge is in the opposite tower. Even though I am Marriott Gold, I got a fairly small room, but it's clean and airy with a flat screen TV. I love the Marriott shampoo, conditioner, and hand lotion, but their coffee leaves a lot to be desired. Too bad Starwood has in-room Startbucks coffee locked up.Staff was very friendly &amp; helpful. Wi-Fi in the rooms was fast for about 30 minutes (while I was writing this review) but has since slowed to a c-r-a-w-l.Frankly, most Sheratons are nicer, but you can't beat the location.I needed assistance with an issue related to flight times, and Nikai Travis at the front desk was super. Not only did she help me accommodate my change in schedule, but she was cheerful and pleasant the whole time.It is a pleasure to go to a property and have a friendly staff leader help like this. The property and location are always secondary to service, and she deserves five stars herself.Unused to stay here a lot until I couldn't stand the dinginess and lousy service.  However, today, they had the only room in town.  I forgot why I hate this place.  Damp carpets, desultory service -- cheerful but incompetent -- and now, no Internet in the top floor, last room.  Maybe they could spring for a few extra boxes?  The lobby is being renovated, but the guest rooms and floors are the worst.  I'm ashamed to be a Marriott Platinum Elite -- how can I be loyal to a chain with a hotel that is so consistently lousy?I travel roughly 330 days a year for my job, I always stay with Marriott and was very disappointed in this property. The outside looks horrible, very out of date. Parking is a nightmare and costs $10 a day as a guest. The east tower where the concierge lounge is, it's pathetic, the rooms in the east tower are highly outdated, paint is peeling off the walls. Only thing is this room that was modern was the TV. Internet drops connections all the time, the Wifi literally disappears, laundry is in the west tower on the 3rd floor, if your staying in the east tower be prepared to lug your dirty cloths through the lobby and restaurant area. One your in the west tower you'll be in for a big surprise and pissed. The west tower was recently renovated and looks much nicer. I am a platinum elite member with Marriott, so they automatically put you in the east tower, which is old and run down. Your better off staying at a different Marriott.I stayed here for a convention this weekend. Fortunately, some friends let me stay in the room for free, so all I paid for there was food and convention admission.The lobby and pool areas are beautiful. Also, the staff in the lobby were also very polite and friendly. But that won't make up for the lack of actual service we got.The room looked nothing like the picture, and the cheaply made coffee maker sprayed more water onto the desk and chair than into the cup. Lots of channels on the TV didn't even work, either, they just had a blue screen. The walls were quite thin as well. Another annoyance was that the lock only recognized the keycards about half of the time. Getting into the room was a pain. Despite the fact that I almost bumped into at least one housekeeper every time I left my room, nobody bothered to clean anything. Our tiny trashcans overflowed quickly, and when housekeeping did not change them, one of the girls in my room went down to the lobby to ask for another one. We never got it. So we gathered everything into a trash bag and left it out in the hall, hoping an employee would pick it up.They did not. I also noticed wine glasses that had been outside rooms for at least a day, too. We were also charged an extra $20 for parking, even though none of us had a car with us. Fortunately we were able to sort that out.If I could give ZERO stars I would! After kindly asking Justin, the front desk ""manager"" to please give us a quiet room in preparation of our long journey of course our room was right next to the ice machine! Oh, plus the smell of pot was strong and potent throughout the hall and seeped through our room. After letting them know via phone and person nothing was done! I should have known from the initial sight with bulbs from the lighted sign burned out. UNACCEPTABLE!Im personally a fan of Hilton. My friend got good rates here for our weekend in STL. The room was clean it just seemed... idk outdated? Maybe it was the location and the hotel. I would stay here again but not by choice. Also, the coffee stand by the front desk serves Starbucks, but it doesnt taste the same. Also their baked goods are definitely NOT Starbucks!A great experience. I travel a lot. All US. I stay at a lot of different hotels. Many  Marriott hotels. Very close to the airport. They run free shuttles every 20 minutes 24/7. Friendly drivers that insist on loading your luggage. Recently renovated; friendly fast check in; great food. Over the top friendly service. A welcome stay for weary travelers. Nice job St. Louis Marriott!It's a hotel by the airport. Basically it's not as nice as staying in the city and people rarely stay more than 1 night. From the outside it looks old and run down. Inside is a little better. Staff was very friendly &amp; helpful. It was clean, but I thought the rooms were a little small. No wifi was a major negative. Bed was comfy but bathroom was very small. Not my first choice to stay, but its better than some of the other options nearby.Great hotel!The staff is so helpful and will go out of their day to make you feel warm and fuzzy. Literally, everyone I encountered was kind and pleasant. The place just has a good energy.I arrived after the convenience shop was closed on my first night and the manager happily offered to open up shop for me anyway. The gym is AWESOME. It's 24hrs and is very modern and a good size. All the new techie treadmills and bikes are a serrious +1. They even offered complimentary cool towels and earbuds that stayed in my ears while I ran. Yes, consider this my confession for taking more free earbuds than I actually needed. The room was comfortable and clean. The internet was fast and reliable. The restaurant even allowed me to order off their menu to satisfy my dietary wants/needs. These folks complaining about $9 for parking (in a secure area) clearly don't travel much. I often pay $20+ when traveling and have to park in far less secure areas for it.Clean and environmentally conscious hotel. Convenient to airport. 24 hour fitness and business center. Affordable rates and amazing customer service. Visited Missouri to resolve complication and the hospitality made this visit quite impressionable. Much thanks to Heather behind the reception.This is a great hotel.  The staff are always helpful and friendly.  The facility and rooms are clean and neat.  Depending on which tower you get assigned to you may have an older tube television vice an upgraded HD set.I was here with my brother for his company's Annual Christmas Party. Food bites worse than mosquitoes in a days old muddles puddle. The staff was friendly, but that did not make up for the less than tasty morsels we were served. The carpet in our section, the East side of the building looked rather dark and dingy. It had recently been vacuumed as evidenced by there being nothing on the rug, except worn down and dingy fibers.A really solid Marriott to stay at if you need to be close to the airport, or if miss the last flight home and need to spend a night at a nearby hotel. The staff is very nice and the ladies who work at the concierge lounge are really nice. If you can stay in the Marquis Tower here I would highly recommend it as it has been somewhat recently updated and has new decor and HDTV in the room. The air conditioner in my room wasn't noisy, the bathrooms are a tad on the small side but nothing can be perfect I suppose. The rates are very very reasonable for a full service Marriott.Impressive convenience shop - they carry every toiletry and minor pharmaceutical, incl diapers, in minipacks. They also have dress socks, dress shirts, swimsuits, and belts; you could nearly outfit yourself for a business meeting from the skin out! Free Internet terminals in there too, just ask for activation. Good soundproofing in the rest of the hotel; we couldn't hear any planes, just the kid screaming in the hallway. Staff were friendly and the decor was nice.I think most have left very forgiving reviews here. What was supposed to be a king bed turned out to be two lumpy double beds and a shower bathtub that doesn't drain. I could hear the rooms as well above and below mine into the early morning. Plumbing volume was sleep prohibitive. This place is a dump.The room was just fine, typical Marriott. Comfortable beds etc. Our room had two doors, one opening from the hall and one to the outdoor pool. It was really nice to pop outside in the morning for a swim. The pool was supposed to be open at 9am. We tried to go at 11am, but all of the little gates were locked. I called the front desk. They accidentally hung up on me. I called again and again, no answer. So, I just jumped over the fence --hey, checkout it at 12, I'm not going to wait!!! Then I was scolded because someone else didn't do their job and open the pool and clean all of the bugs out of it. Our room was really humid. It smelled like mold. There was a dehumidifier in there, but it was full by morning. They charge $8 a night to park. Shouldn't that be included with the room? They also over-sold their parking lot, so there were no spots. We drove around for 15 minutes. The restaurant had really bad service, we waited forever, they forgot stuff blah blah. There were tiles missing over the bathtub so you could see tubes and electrical stuff.Rooms were comfortable and the internet was very solid. Didn't get a chance to use the dining or exercise amenities but everything looked clean and fresh.Typical Marriott hotel.  The customer service was great, I use this hotel every week and they don't even ask for my name when I check in, they already know me by my first name.  The rooms are a bit on the small side, but that isnt very important to me as I only use the hotel to sleep.  They were clean and well maintained, so no complaints there.  The regular rooms have old square TVs, but the one time I was given an upgraded room, they had a nice flat screen LCD monitor.  Ate a few times at the restaurant, decent food but not much of a variety.  Prices are high (10 dollars for a plate of mac and cheese with lobster) but thats too be expected for a hotel.  Overall, a nice stay.","Older Marriott that has been kept up well. Staff is excellent. Location is convenient.Stayed here on an impromptu trip to see the in-laws. Everything was okay, but nothing very impressive. I would have given 4 stars but the $9 extra per night for parking was kind of ridiculous.Our flight was canceled and rescheduled for first thing the next morning, so we needed a cheap airport hotel to shuttle us to and from and get a good night's sleep. We got a great rate, and they have happy hour (3 drinks free!) every night with light snacks. The BBQ place next door is great too, and everyone is SO nice. It was such a relief to not have to worry about shuttles or anything once we found the Pear Tree.It is very rare for me to give five stars. When trying to come up with a reason for one less star, I could  not come up eith anything substantive. I stayed here on business. I hardly ever come across hotel staff that is so nice, cheery and helpful. Hot tub, swimming pool, and a 24-hour gym?! Das good stuff!great atmosphere, friendly staff, shuttle service to the Airport and MetroLink, the only downside is that there are no walking-distance restaurants nearby...so we walked for 2 miles to eat and then got stuck there...we called them and they came and got us - at 3 AM! they held our bags all day for free (some places charge for that) and the entire feel of it left a very good

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-st-louis-airport-hotel-saint-louis-3,Hilton St Louis Airport Hotel,3.0,$$,95,"It's out there, but this Hilton is less expensive than many other St. Louis hotel options in this category. The location is right by the highway which is convenient if you just need a place to stay in St. Louis. The drive to downtown is about 20 minutes, so it's not ideal if you need to shuttle back and forth multiple times each day. The room we had was very clean and large with a huge window. It felt luxurious and secure. A view of the airport runways gives a little bit of entertainment if you're into that sort of thing...The downfall: $10/night parking -even for those staying in the hotel? I would understand this price for those hoping to snag a parking spot before catching a flight but it seems odd for hotel guests given that we're in the boonies and not downtown STL.The hotel is quite large and spread out but easy to navigate. Seems like they frequently have conferences. Our room was clean and I enjoyed the bed and shower pressure. For $100-ish/night 25 minutes outside of town +$10 parking per night, it's hard to say if we'll return next year.Decent place but would never stay here again. I was just getting up to get ready for my flight followed by several business meetings. Some how the fire alarm tripped ( it wasn't a fire) so I had to quickly grab everything and leave. No ironed clothes for the day, I couldn't take a shower so I smelled all day, I went catch the shuttle which couldn't be found and all the cabs were getting snapped up.Since this is yelp and not trip advisor, I am focusing on the food portion of the hotel for this review. I stayed a week and ate breakfast and lunch here most days. The diamond breakfast coupon covered the entire buffet, and it was one of the best I have seen from a Hilton (since I was last at Hilton Anaheim). This is a top notch breakfast buffet. The breakfast service is always questionable, so ask for the check before you're ready to go. The bar/lunch spot has a solid and creative menu. Everything I ordered was above expectations, even though it's not cheap. I was also given 3 drink coupons at check-in which saved me a solid $20, and encourages a nice sized evening crowd in the lobby lounge. Lastly, there was an executive lounge on my floor. It was stocked with some NA drinks all day long, and it was a nice quiet spot to get some work done. They also had a free breakfast. Non-Food tip - get a room far from the elevators...they're pretty loud and the walls are thin.We did a park and fly here. Our car was safe while we were away. The breakfast in the restaurant was beautiful. It was free with the rewards program. The airport shuttle was prompt in both directions. Our room was comfortable with an interesting view.Food is really bad.  The pork belly was cold, not warn but cold.  Their idea of pizza is tomato sauce over a tortilla.  It's a wrap by morning and pizza by lunch and dinner.  I'm starving so I ate it.  I finished and pulled out my credit card and placed it on the corner of the table.  Nothing in the past 15 minutes.  It's a Friday night.  It's not busy here.  Two waiters, a bus boy that walks around with good asking tables if it's for them and a manager.I stayed the weekend with my 8 month old. I will never stay here again.I was meeting up with friends and one of the first to arrive had arranged it so our rooms could be by one another. The lady behind the desks tells me my room is still dirty. I can either wait and she will put an expedite on it or I can be moved to another floor/room. Having just finished a 6 hour drive, alone, with an 8 month old I wasn't exactly quick draw McGraw with my answer while I weighed my options. Before I could answer or ask questions a guy standing there steps in and says there is no ""do not hold"" my reservation so I can be moved. I say my friend arranged for us to be blocked together and he says no you don't have a block (in retrospect when another friend had called weeks in advance she was told she needed to provide a credit card to reserve our BLOCK of rooms- their terminology not ours.) The girl again tries to offer me the expedite option, I begin to say let me call one of my friends to see if we can wait in their room and the guy says no move me and puts me in another room on another floor. Fine. I don't have the energy to argue and my kid is exhausted. Never asked if I need help with my bags. I pull my car up to the parking gate where I need to use my room card to open it. I slide it. Nothing. I keep sliding it. Nothing. Try both cards as many different ways as possible. I'm only mildly annoyed as I figure this is a glitch as I had just checked in. I finally hit the help button. A voice comes on and I explain I just checked in and my card isn't working. The girl says I need to check in first. I tell her I already did and neither key is working. She begins to talk over me that I need to check in first before I yell ""I ALREADY CHECKED IN!!! The keys you gave me ARE NOT working!"" Magically the gate goes up. I say thank you and she tells me have a nice day. Ugh. Ok a bump no big. I find a spot thankfully close to the entrance of the hotel. I had noticed there's no luggage carts. I have a rolling suitcase, a rolling cooler, a large duffel bag and a laundry basket with stuff in it. Plus my diaper bag and my son.I strap my son into his carrier and grab my first bag mentally bracing myself for a long trek from parking lot to 6th floor multiple times. As I come into the lobby I see it, like an oasis in the desert- a luggage cart. I snatch it, kinda laughing like Smegal, throw my suitcase on it and head back to my car. Load the cart up and head inside gripping tightly to my precious. At this point a very nice employee steps in and offers to help me up to my room. I almost greedily say no and hiss but contain myself and say yes thank you. He helps me up to my room- very pleasant very nice. Unloads the cart for me and leaves. Crisis averted.It's a hotel room. I can't make up my mind if the decor is just old or chosen to look old so they could save money on renovations and just call it kitschy. The room has no fridge. I push the front desk button on the phone- the number is disconnected. What?!? I notice the menu of charges on the phone for calls and opt to dig for an alternate number and find another spot that says push 0. I do. The lady is pleasant and tells me it'll be $15 for the fridge. WTF. But I need it for my son so I say ok and she says 20 minutes. I decide to hold off on starting his bed and bath routine as we will be at an odd stopping point once the fridge arrives.Fifty minutes later I call down and explain I've been waiting and I'm cut off! ""20-30 minutes ma'am."" Yes I know but it's been longer and I've delayed putting my kid to bed and she begins to talk over me! Repeating 20-30 minutes. I finally say ""either way it's been 50 minutes! My kid is crabby. When is it coming?"" No joke her answer-  ""you were told 20-30 minutes and it is on its way."" I end the call with ""it doesn't change that it's been 50.""The next evening we return from our day out and there's a car having issues at the gate too. Eventually he somehow gets in. Now it's my turn. Neither card works. Unbelievable. Over 24 hours since I've checked in and it's still not working. After a few minutes of fussing I push the help button. Nothing. I swipe some more more. Nothing. I push the button again. Nothing. I go into this cycle of swipe/push. This whole gate experience takes approx 18 mins (between the guy in front of me and me). By this point my normally good natured kid is bawling. He's got a dirty diaper and he's been sitting in it. So I begin jamming on the button. Finally it opens. I'm fuming.For check out? I called down and asked for help with my bags in about 20 minutes. They send 1 guy (on time) and no cart. How the hell does an AIRPORT HOTEL only have 2 carts?!?Just spoke to a friend- they charged her for 2 rooms when she only reserved one. They tried saying she booked 2 and was a no show for the other. What?? They're telling her it'll be a month to get refunded.This place is a joke.After one night at the Crowne Plaza Downtown, we left really disappointed and wound up at the Hilton by St. Louis Airport.  We used Priceline and got two nights at $60 per night and this Hilton did everything they could to make this a stay we would remember.  The hotel is a lot bigger then it looks from the outside and the rooms were very comfortable.  The food at their restaurant was excellent and the waiter even gave us breakfast vouchers which when we got our bill was worth $35 in free food.  Could not really go wrong with that.  Seems like most hotels have a $10 per day parking charge, but the rental car was totally safe.  I will stay here again in the future.I was going to give four stars but due to my 11 year old son falling through the sofa bed. He wasn't hurt though and the manager was there in 3 seconds flat. They upgraded our room without us asking. Which was kinda nice. The food is expensive there so eat elsewhere. Reviews said hot tub there was none. Room key messed up a few times. Our TV was weird as well...and no free breakfast!! It's close to a lot of things though. Other than that the room was clean and staff was very nice and helpful. Would definitely stay here again.Great front desk staff! Tamara was really helpful and sweet.  She handled my check-in and took care of my parking for the night since they couldn't accommodate me the night before.  The room was very clean, nice and the bed was wayyyy too comfortable! lol  I ended up sleeping in for the first time in years due to that nice bed.  Also, I ate at the bar the night before and had great service from the bartender (john maybe?) anyway, fast service, friendly as well.  Food hit the spot and reasonable.  Paid $20 for a small pizza &amp; bread pudding dessert, with tip.  Not bad!! I used my AMEX points for the stay and it was WELL WORTH IT.This is a great location for a hotel, as it is extremely close to the airport. The staff is friendly and helpful, but this is not my favorite hotel.The bathrooms are some of the smallest I have ever seen. There isn't even really a small shelf to put a towel or clothes on when you are showering. The room seems quite roomy for how small the bathrooms are, which appeared odd.When we got to our room, the temperature was 64 degrees. It was so cold. We tried to turn the thermostat up. We even turned it up as high as it goes, but there was still no change in temperature. We went down to the front desk, and we were told the entire tower was controlled by one central control. She said she would get someone to turn it up within a half an hour. It did warm up -- to 66 degrees. Still not warm enough for us. We dealt with it because it was just one night but more time here would have been miserable. The pool is great. It's incredibly warm, so we spent some time with our feet in that. The hotel does seem dated, but you can tell there have been updates.I only stayed here one night to be close to the airport.I wasn't expecting much and that's what I got. The hotel staff was courteous. My room was somewhat clean if I overlooked dust and crumbs on the floor. The wi-fi was weak and the place could use a facelift to update things such as dingy carpet, wobbly toilet, dirty caulk around shower. On the bright side, the hotel has an airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes. Here's a tip- Avis car rental is right next door, so keep that in mind if you need a rental. Another tip- Planes fly overhead so lower floors may be quieter.Stayed here as we are loyal to hilton and former diamond members - great thing about this property is that it is very close to the airport and rental cars - in fact we should have stayed the night and then rented out car the next morning as not only did we pay for a rental  that sat in the parking lot- they charge for parking- $10!! Property is dated - signage is poor and area is noisy- hilton executives you need to come and inspect this property as  it does not meet your standards across the nationThis was my first time in the Lou. Of course I trusted Yelp to ensure that I got a good nights sleep. I have to say that not only did the city lack a decent amount of reviews; it appeared that no one really liked any of the destinations. I chose the Hilton based on location and the fact that I could rack up a few more miles. The lobby was really nice. Several fruit infused waters. Although tasty, not enough to make up for the humidity in the common areas. Once assigned my room, I was as far from the front door as you could get and this is no exaggeration when I tell you that I was dripping in sweat when I got there. After cleaning up and changing shirts, the AC in the room finally stabilized the heat flashes. The room itself was very nice and comfortable and unlike many hotels I have experienced, the high def TV actually had high def channels. My particular package had two free drinks, free Wi-Fi and free, complete breakfast buffet. The staff was super friendly and buffet was delicious and once the business resort picked me up and I saw all the hotels that I didn't choose, I could tell at least from street appeal, the Hilton was the best choice, if you prefer to stay near the airport. Hilton, if you read this, amp up the AC in hallways. I should always be comfortable inside and not feel like I'm staying in a locker room!They actively block personal WiFi hotspots!Didn't believe it at first but tested it several times over my week long stay. Of course the for-a-fee wifi worked great throughout the facility! Disappointing! My room was clean and looked to be updated recently (new tile in bathroom, etc). The doorframe was not square so there was a huge gap under one side of the door.Breakfast, lots of variety on the buffet and none of it was remarkable, very bland and unexciting for $15.Staff was courteous and helpful and the proximity to the airport is awesome and it doesn't make up for the other shortcomings. In spite of many upcoming trips to St Louis, I wont stay here again.Won't be staying here again, at 1 am our neighbors down the hall started arguing in the hallway. An hour later after many calls to the front desk they were still at it, The hotel has a security guard whom could have taken care of it, but they called the police instead. The staff was friendly but never once apologized for the 1am wake up call. Also if you're charging your guest $12 for breakfast, I shouldn't have to cook my own waffle.3.5 stars.. OK hotel. Our first room was damp and dusty but they were able to get us into the room we reserved the next night. Even comped some meals for our troubles. Which brings me to why I added on the done pts for the stars because the Worlds Away Restaurant more than met my expectations. My visit was in April and I'm still thinking about the pork belly short ribs and cheese grits...a surprisingly good combination. The  breakfast buffet wasn't too shabby either. Now while I will never step foot in St Louis again the staff was also friendly and helpful. The new room was also cleaner than the Westin I stayed in recently in Atlanta.The Hilton is back! I am so pleased with the updated rooms, exceptional service and the food. I decided to come back after a many year boycott and they have won me back. Excellent hotel. I am back!My review is honestly between three and four stars but I'm going with four stars because of the fact that just an ""a-okay"" rating seems to be a little low especially when you take into consideration the hotel nightmares I've had the past few weeks with traveling in connection with a move.  (Feel free to scroll through my past reviews to laugh at my expense for that).The pros:.1:  The hotel is conveniently located near the airport and offers free shuttle service.  The shuttle runs every 15 minutes and when I used it this morning, it arrived on time and was quite helpful.2. The front desk staff is AMAZINGLY helpful.  I am staying at this airport (in an out) for a few days in conjunction with a move overseas and had several questions upon my initial arrival.  The staff went ABOVE and BEYOND to help me get my answers and made multiple stressful situations for me go smoothly.3. There is a restaurant on site that has a variety of price point meals.  Its good if you don't feel like venturing out.  The food is pretty good quality.4. The gym and pool were also top notch.5. My room was CLEAN (thank you travel gods) and spacious and well stocked.  The bed was also very comfortable.The Cons:1. There is some nickel and diming with the having to pay for wifi...come on now its 2013?2. Walls are pretty thin and at some times it seemed like I could hear anything and everything yet I never heard a plane.3. Paying for parking...meh.....just another annoyance but not the end of the world.In the end, I'd definitely go back to this hotel should I find myself back in the area without hesitation.Had some minor issues with Wifi and plumbing, however, I cannot stress how good their customer service is.  Right in-top of issues.","We recently had a 6am flight home from Saint Louis, so decided to stay at the Hilton St. Louis Airport.   Pros - super close to the airport (5 minutes - only because I hit a red light), comfortable beds, and good service.Cons - run down, broken, and even gross rooms.   I'm a loyal Hilton member, and choose them due to the generally consistent standards that I've come to appreciate and enjoy over the years. The staff was a pleasure to work with, and when I truthfully responded to my how my stay was, they generally seemed sorry for the disappointment, and offered to remove my parking charges and provide me a large amount of HHonors points.   Of course, this was after they mistakenly added almost $40 in internet charges. I doubt we'll be back, but if you just need a place to crash briefly overnight that's quick to the airport.... I guess it's okay.Eating at their ""Worlds Away"" restaurant in the lobby. Eat the bone in ribeye (39$)! Med'rare....they got it perfect. Almost the best steak I've ever eaten. Would have given five stars and would have said the best had they not put a tiny bit of gravy on it. Other than that amazing!Great prices. 55.00 bucks when the travel lodge down the road is run down and running same with additional cost per person.  The room was serviced every day and the staff was very polite. Really comfy beds. This is. pretty solid hotel.  Decor is St. Louis airport pictures very coolI travel a lot, I'm a gold member with Hilton and they have had my loyalty since 2005.  I'm currently in the hotel as I write this review.  Long story short, I moved rooms on the first night because I was at the end of the hall and I couldn't grab the wifi signal.  Room change was prompt, no complaints.  Now comes the next issue, I was constantly cold in the room.  Its march 18th, its 45 degree in St. Louis, heat should be provided during this time of year.  On the 16th, after days of freezing my tail off at night, I call about the heat, which had been running at the highest setting since the 12th.  Room never got about 67 degrees.  Was I dying, no, but at 67 degree in my pajamas I was cold.  I even brought my shakeweight to keep warm.  Anyhoo, the front desk told me they would send engineering.  6 hours later...nobody came.  I walk to the front desk and the clerk says ""yeah the heater was just repaired, they said maybe a few hours and it would be back up"".  Comfortable with that answer, I go back to my room.  On the 17th, it was even colder, I call the front desk and the girl has no clue what Im talking about, says the heat never went out.  She says she can send engineering.  I ask to talk to the manager, who confers that the heat was never out, BUT mentions that the first floor rooms don't have working heaters, that the air stays the same ambient temp as the entire first floor,  WHAT THE HECK???  why the lies and story.  I'm pretty upset at this point, but don't really have a temper so I calmly ask the manager for my options.  He offers to move me rooms (which 29 hours b4 checkout.... doenst make the wrong right.  He then send a very very small space heater.  It does nothing except warm your feet.  In the morning, I receive a handwritten note from the manager, gifting me 5000 Hilton points.  Thanks, but 5k points isn't even enough to buy breakfast, let alone book a free night.  Speaking of breakfast, the dining room is right by the front entrance, this hotel might as well serve as a glacier bar, because the entire facility, and room are COLD.  The dining area is so cold!!!  The server, bless her heart (I wont list her name) kept taking things away from me.  She takes away the pot of coffee after I pour a cup, she takes away the ketchup after I leave to get another plate.  You have to ask for water, have to ask for condiments (they aren't anywhere to be found)  Leave for the restroom and she clears the whole table).... strange...strange...service.  Also, perhaps THE WORST WIFI I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.  Hilton STILL charges for WIFI, and it will ask you to log back in or purchase a plan every 2-5 hours.  Insane annoying.  Good luck trying to download anything large. All in all, not just the worst Hilton experience, but the worst hotel I have ever stayed in... and I stay in hotels 180-220 days out of each calendar year.  If you must stay at this hotel:1. request a room in a tower floor so you have heat during the winter.2. Wear a jacket when you dine in the restaurant in the winter.3.  think about the clever ways to spend 5000 Hilton points :)4.  Don't plan on using WIFI for more than a few hours.This Hilton is located across the street from the airport. Sometimes convenient to stay at if you have an early flight out in the morning.Few things:This place is REALLY BIG.The parking is not free.The front desk staff that I met were the most pretentious and snooty people I have ever met.I still prefer staying DT St Louis.I liked staying at this full service Hilton near the St. Louis Airport. Staff was very courteous and the the establishment was clean with some good amenities. The distance to the Airport will bring me back to this hotel during my next visit to St. Louis area. Hotel has a complimentary shuttle to the Airport which takes less than 3 minutes.Pros: Near airportThermostats seemed to workThe gym had adequate equipmentCons:DirtyOldCharged 10 dollars for basic wifi,16 (plus tax and tip) for continental breakfast buffetDinner restaurant was blandStaff was ok.  Not great. The shuttle driver was very nice.Would not return.I was super nervous to stay somewhere I had never been and alone but I picked the right hotel ! The front desk was amazing after taking a shuttle 2 hours from ft leonard wood they checked me in early . My room was clean and the perfect temperature. I ordered room service for lunch and it was fast and delicious .then later ordered dinner which was amazing . And the employees are so friendly ! I would definitley stay here again !This location is close and convenient to the airport and Hertz.The room felt clean so that is a plus.However, they could use some refreshing.stayed three days at this property and the room was very good except for one problem. The bathroom sink stopper was disconnected so I could not drain the sink. I reported it every day I was there and it was never fixed. Other than that, the room was very comfortable and nicely appointed.There were numerous outlets for charging my various outlets in the room. I had no problem hooking up my phone, iPad, computer and Nook at the same time.The staff is exceptionally friendly and courteous. Everyone I encountered greeted me and exchanged pleasantries.Even with the sink problem, I would return to this hotel for my next trip.No fridge and there was no wifi. definitely think they should make this clear to us. We ended up paying $30 for weak wifi and $20 for parking. This is XXXXPaper thin walls.  Not a good hotel if you plan on using the room as an on the road office.  I could hear my neighbor's entire 2 hour conversation on the phone with his wife while I was trying to work.  Then I could hear him coughing and sneezing all night.  I won't be staying here again because of this.  Otherwise, the staff are very friendly and the hotel is clean.  Free shuttle from airport and back makes for convenient low cost transport.I came back from visiting the Missouri Botanical Garden over Labor day weekend.  My timing was perfect since I was able to catch the Japanese Festival.  However, I was really tired and just wanted to check-in without dealing with airport parking, etc.  After reading some reviews, I opted to park temporarily in the 15 minute space to see whether my Gold membership got me some perks.CHECK-IN AND PARKING ****$10 for 24hr parking but Gold membership got me $5 for parking.  Someone on Yelp mentioned getting free parking but I don't mind the $5 discount.  The front parking gate card reader was denying access after front desk programmed my room keys.  I tried the back parking gate reader as well with same problem.  At least the back parking lot had a speaker button which dialed to front desk so that they could open the gate for me.  Front desk searched a bit for room upgrade.  Eventually, she found corner king suite with 2 rooms- separate bedroom and living room.  YESSS!!! I overheard the guest checkin a few minutes later looking for similar room.  Beat him to the room within minutes.  The front desk also got me free fountain drink voucher, appetizer voucher, and breakfast buffet voucher.  ALL THREE- THE TRIFECTA!!!KING SUITE ****Missing Peter Thomas Roth body wash so called room service.  Got 2 bottles within minutes from housekeeping.  Great view of the airport from both bedroom and living room.  Dropped off my luggage and went downstairs for quick bite to eat.RESTAURANT ****I had a ginger ale with Ahi tuna seared with black sesame seed crusted.  Quick and wonderful service.  Would have liked to try local brew but voucher only good for non-alcoholic drinks.SWIMMING POOL ****Yes, there were many families but loved the 9ft deep end to go for dives.  Housekeeping was there to stock up on towels for us.  I did a couple of laps and then headed to room for the night.FITNESS CENTER ****Woke up early to get a workout in.  Found the stairmaster similar to the one in the Double Tree Chesterfield.  Got my 30 minutes in before a morning shower followed by breakfast buffet.BREAKFAST BUFFET ****Got an omelet made to order at the grill.  The rest of the buffet was wonderful with plenty of fruit.  I also found small boxes of almond milk and chose the chocolate flavor.  I also found a nice spread of smoked salmon but didn't want to risk it.  The coffee was quite bitter.  Overall, I loved this hotel which reminded me alot of George Clooney's ""Air Up There"".  I would recommend this to anyone who needs a relaxing vacation.We reserved a room with two beds, so I was a bit stunned that this Hilton did not hold my reservation as one would assume is customary. The room we received was nice, but no surprises at check-in is preferable. There is a charge for parking at Hilton St. Louis Airport. Also, a hot breafast is served at 6 a.m. and the lobby bar remains open until 1 a.m. + room service is available until 11:00 p.m.This is a classic, old-school airport hotel. I dig it. The front desk staff members were really friendly and helpful, and even let me borrow an umbrella when the skies looked threatening. The rooms are smaller, but that's what older hotels are known for... remember, this thing was built before every weenie felt entitled to a McMansion.  With that, the bathrooms are microscopic. I'm a scrawny, short little thing, and even I had a tough time navigating the bathroom door versus the toilet. A few mystery-hairs in the sink, but nothing to get wooged out about. Shower was blessedly pube-free, and the bathroom fan is nice and enthusiastic.If I could make this a 4.5-star review, I would. My only gripe is that I'm having a hard time getting comfy, temperature-wise. It's 90 degrees and humid out, and my room is 70 degrees and sticky. I feel like I'm sticking to everything. I don't know if this is even something the hotel can control or what. Bring baby powder to St. Louis in the summer is what I'm saying. Not a fan of having to pay for parking and wifi, but my corporate rate covers it so luckily it didn't impact me. YMMV.Great hotel, nice room, easy parking.  However, stay away from the restaurant!   Medium = rare, water optional, and waitstaff preps the table for the next customer while you're still sitting there.  Very odd...Great front desk staff, courteous concierge and security staff.A favorite hotel. Excellent service and friendly staff. Good is good but pricey. Close to airport but quiet. Free fast shuttle .I love this hotel.  It's a older full service Hilton across the street from the airport.  This was the Hilton filmed in the movie ""Up in the Air"".They got rid of their hot tub a couple years ago, so no hot tub.  They have an ok pool and a great fitness center.The bar area has a nice ambiance but service is usually difficult.  The bar is best place for service.  You could sit in the restaurant area but its always dead, not sure why.The rooms are nice and clean and very new looking.  I stay here all the time.  There is plenty of space for many types of meeting from very large to very small.I can only comment on the meeting rooms and the bar as I was there for an event and did not stay.  The meeting rooms are very nice and they do have plenty of them and the food they served at the event wasn't bad at all.  Just upset they ran out of the cheesecake before I could get to it - darn!The bar area can get crowded quickly on the weekends but service was plenty quick enough.  What I do not like about this hotel is that they charge you $10 to park!  Geeze!!!  And unless you get lucky and park in the front or very close in the back, you may have a bit of a hike to get into the hotel.This hotel is pretty nice for the price I paid. I think it was only 50 bucks a night. I loved the beautiful rose decor behind the front desk. The beds were nice and clean and so was the bathroom. What I didn't like was the service I got. I came during a night when they had canceled a flight and had to accommodate those passengers. The lines was insanely long with people all over the place. There were only two people in the front to help out three shuttles worth of people. Also, they only had two luggage carts available and it's not like those guests are going to return the carts right away. I was annoyed. I had a lot of luggage that I didn't want to carry to my room. There were no bellhops to be found either. One thing I also don't like is when hotels have rooms on the first floor. I don't know why that bugs me, but it does. The layout of the hotel was a little confusing and we went down the wrong path to our room. At least we didn't have to carry our luggage a far distance I suppose.","Nice staff. $10 a day to park in their lot. Insane. Go elsewhere  until they become sane.  I would never charge my store customers to park.   $10 per device per day wifi. Insane.  Elevators...  Still free.The location and room decor are the two positive things I can mention; however, what you really must know are the negatives. It is obviously an older hotel that has had some renovation, but not enough. To start, it has a strange, almost musty odor in the halls and elevator. The room doors are old, probably original, which means they are lightweight. They don't close automatically, so you must remember to pull them shut. They are also thin, so you hear the hall noise. The area of the bath with toilet and shower was very tiny, and the door would not close because the lights hung too low. So no privacy. Speaking of privacy, our neighbors on the other side of the wall were probably unaware of their lack of privacy. Otherwise, they might have kept the sounds of their fornicating to a minimum.Just not as nice as the decor suggests.  Staff, especially Andy at the front desk, go out of their way to make me feel welcome.  However the pool was closed, no hot tub, and the decor is kind of fake-high end.  The Hampton Inn I stayed in in Columbia for far less per night had 1.  Hot tub2. Nicer rooms3. Free breakfast4. Free fresh baked cookies on arrival5. Pool that was open and workingLiterally the ONLY thing they have going for them is proximity to the airport, and there are like four hotels in that immediate vicinity.Note:  the things that made the visit special are the personal touch of the employees, such as Andy.  I wish the infrestructure of the hotel were 3/4 as impressive as the commitment of the employees to making my stay pleasant.  Sorry I can't give a better review--but don't hold that against the staff.I was upgraded to the executive level.Breakfast is served on the executive level, for the executive level, in the executive lounge. I got free WiFi with my room, and free parking. Minus a star for jenky iron and ironing board. The rooms are a very nice size, the bed is very comfortable, the gym is well stocked with elipticals and treadmills, the lobby has a bar and a restaurant, and the staff is very nice and helpful.All in all I recommend this place to travelers who find themselves in need of a little R&amp;R.Located directly across from the airport. The area around the airport isn't the best and I stayed here for entire week and the highlight of my day was giving people directions to turn left at the Hustler store. Really a 3  1/2 star review because the Staff is friendly and lobby restaurant/bar is awesome. Carpet looks light my grandfather laid it down. The pool should be reclassified as  a wading pool and they need a hot tub.  For business this place is perfect. For pleasure I would stay downtown.Not a great experience, but the service pulled it together enough that I won't give it two stars.Checked in last Sunday night (Easter night) around Midnight.  They took me to my room which was large and exactly what one would expect from the Hilton...one problem: the room was REALLY warm and humid and adjusting the AC did not quickly remedy the situation.  UGH.  It's not 12:30 and I call down.  They say they'll move me up to an executive suite.Security comes quickly enough to take me to my new room.  It is a bit bigger (like I care I just gotta get some shut eye before checking out early in the morning), but same problem.  I set the temp to 65 (lowest it'll go) nothing seems to happen and minutes later the thermostat auto-adjusts up to 67 and stays there.  It was about 74-76 in my room and humid (not 67), so I slept on the covers.  The television would get stuck on a single channel and not move at worst, and in the morning when I was awake enough to notice, every channel kept skipping as if I was streaming.Went to breakfast.  Not amazing buffet for $17 but they did have LOTS of options despite the mediocre quality.I checked out and mentioned the TV and air and she comped my breakfast to her credit and honestly admitted that they were having some problems with temperature control (I hate it when they ""comp"" you but treat you incredulously as if you were the first person EVER to complain about ________, so some credit is due there).The people were really friendly overall.I was looking forward to flaking out with some beers and bar food after a rough series of meetings. The hotel front clerk asked me three times about aspects of my check in after I had already told her, obvisouly paying NO attention. The bar was fully loaded due to construction in the dining room, no seating. Went to the Waffle House down the road, and it was pretty good! The place is seedy and beat. No iron int eh closet despite there being an ironing board. No foldy thing that holds your suitcase. And this is a full service hotel? It will be a LONG time before I pay a premium to stay in a ""full service"" hotel. Lousy performance, Hilton. Had to pay for parking and Wi Fi to add to the insult. Next time, Hampton or anywhere else.I am very impressed by this hotel. The hotel doesn't look all that great from the outside, but the inside is actually very attractive. Decor is right on point. Everyone... And I mean everyone was so friendly. We also got a discount for being military. Our parking and breakfast were free.Ugh, I want to rate this 5 stars, but our linens had some dirty stains, my glass cup at breakfast was cracked. The silver wear didn't look like it was cleaned very well.  But overall, I would recommend this place.Hotel was great. The restaurant has to be one of the worst hotel restaurants ever. Food was always cold and tasteless.Amazing staff (Ashley) took care of my colleague and myself after understanding our situation missing our United Airline flight to San Francisco Airport. They honestly took better care of us than the airline. Thank you.While the title Hilton usually inspires a certain level of class and quality, this one does NOT live up to those standards. The lobby is beautiful but once you go past that area, the ceiling tiles are covered in water stains, the furniture is showing it's wear, and the wall paper is even bubbling and falling off in sections. The staff is very friendly but can't erase the stains in the bath tub or the missing knob on the closet...The hotel would have easily had 4 stars had there not been ants in my room, crawling all over my lamp.  The front desk gave me a Starbucks gift card on my way out when I pointed it out in the morning (I had to deal with the ants myself the night before - too tired/too late to call housekeeping to do something I could have done myself).  I have a feeling, from how well-run the rest of the hotel was, that this was a fluke...but a fluke nevertheless.The lobby is absolutely lovely and beautiful, and was part of the George Clooney ""Up in the Air"" movie.This was one of the places I stayed when I first visited St. Louis.  It's got a convenient shuttle to the airport that departs whenever you want it to and at a regular time during rush times.The hotel staff are fantastic and friendly. The restaurant ""World's Away"" is great for breakfast but VERY hit and miss on other meals. Overpriced for slow, under-seasoned and off-temp foods.For a hotel next to the airport, it's fine. A bit dates but comfortable. Ask for a tower room. They are more comfortable. Staff is very helpful. Business center, 24 hour fitness center. Good enough for one night.The overall hotel is nice.  However, don't waste your time eating in the bar area.  The service was great.  Mandie our waitress too very good care of everyone.  Now the food... Hmm the best thing was the raviolis &amp; shrimp cocktail in the starters menu.  The  white turkey chili was more like soup than chili and the ahi tuna had zero flavor but lots of sesame seeds.  I needed up going to bed hungry.  At least the wine was good.Very nice room...  no fridge, but still, very comfortable room.  King size bed, couch, granite tabletops.  Nice gym with cardio machines, dumbells universal cables, benches and room to stretch.  Beautiful place to remain indoors while humid heat reigns outside.  Monkey hopes to return early enough to enjoy the bar.The front desk staff-- and in fact, all staff-- are very, very nice and helpful and hospitable. The rooms are okay- a little dated but also a little unclean. The bathroom had a lot of hairs that weren't mine and dust all over the floor. The bathtub and bathroom door were dingy. However, the Phillip Thomas Roth bath products were great. The main problem I had with this hotel is that I just could not get a good night's sleep- there is so much weird noise. The first room I had exposed me to some kind of blower that sounded like a lawn mower starting up every eight minutes or so. I also could hear the person next door snoring! There is no sound proofing at all. In the room I switched to, there seemed to be people taking showers pretty much all night long and slamming doors. There just is no insulation from noise, which sucks when you have to go to meetings after no sleep. I appreciate the shuttle to the airport and other nearby areas and it is very close to the airport. But that's about it. It's not near downtown at all and the restaurant menu is really not very vegetarian-friendly. I will say that the pool is nice and open till 11. I don't know what they can do about the noise at night but that is definitely my biggest problem with this hotel.Great location in terms of airport proximity. Friendly staff. Not exactly comparable to other Hiltons, but it works for those nights when you arrive on a late flight and simply need a bed. It seems as though they also offer a program to rent out parking spots to people as an alternative to airport parking.Good location but ridiculously thin walls in the room. you can here what your next door guests talk on the phone. And parking is not free. Not recommend this hotel. Go somewhere else.I only stayed for a few hours, but I thought it was very nice and upscale compared to most hotels in the area. I felt more comfortable here and the rooms were nice and clean. I did get free parking because I stayed barely 24 hours.","You know, I love Hilton most of the time.  This particular Hilton just doesn't do it for me.The parking, being so close to the airport = not cool.  It's free if you're a Diamond, but you have to check in before you can actually park, as it's keyed.  I can understand why, but that is annoying.Also, as a Diamond, I'm usually used to getting decent room placement/etc.  The last 2 times, near the elevator.  Although you would think that 3 rooms away from the elevator would prevent the elevator noise.  Right?  Negatory.  The first hour I really thought I was hearing something, or that there was a strange construction event happening.  Nope, it was the elevator.The food here was decent for a big Hilton, but not terrific.  It feels like they just mailed it in a little bit at this Hilton, knowing they'd get tons of traffic no matter what, as they are RIGHT next to Lambert and they'll capture the business and airline travelers.  Disappointing.  At least I still racked up points to eventually use at a kick-ass Hilton, like the one we used in France.  Or Rome.  Fo reals. :)Very nice renovation from my last visit. I look forward to my next stay. Good Job!I am a Hilton Honors member, and wanted to use some accumulated points to stay the night in St Louis, since I was out there for business.  I tried to book my 'rewards' stay at the Hampton Inn, but was forced to settle on the Hilton St Louis Airport.Upon arrival, I noticed that this hotel was pretty 'state of the art'... for 1978 (or whatever year it was built).Side Note: I've stayed at Hilton's before, using my rewards points.  Other locations have a specific Hilton Honors desk, to allow members quick check-in, check-out, or issue resolution.This hotel didn't have the Honors desk, but they did have an Honors kiosk.  Good enough, right?  So I proceeded to use the automated screen to facilitate my check-in.  I made it all the way through, and was waiting for it to encode my room keys, but it must not have been my lucky day.  Instead, I received a printed scrap of paper instructing me to complete my check-in at the registration desk.I think there might have been a seminar and a large family reunion going on that day, given the amount of people waiting in line at the registration desk.  I gathered up my bags, and tottered to the end of the line with my slip of parchment.While waiting in line, I struck up a conversation with another Hilton Honors member, relishing our newfound experience with the latest in guest hospitality technology.I eventually received my room key (#302), and headed to the elevator.  As I made my way down the 3rd floor hallway to my room, (which was all the way at the end, but I really needed the walk) I came across a sizable mess (on the carpet) with disclaimers posted all around (see hotel pictures).Once I walked into my non-smoking room #302, I ascertained the distinctive aroma of cigarette smoke.  The bouquet became more pungent as I made my way into the bathroom.  I called the front desk and explained my situation, and a very nice associated told me to come back to the front desk for a room change.With my second set of room keys in hand (#308), I charted a course for the elevator.  Walking down the 3rd floor hallway once more, I spied some Tootsie Roll wrappers strewn about the mess on the carpet.Note to Self: If you don't want to clean something up, just post several 8 1/2 "" x 11"" notices in the general vicinity.This room was much better smelling.  I dropped my bags on the bed and was about to head out to catch a Cardinals game, when I felt an impending force on my nether regions.  I felt it prudent to resolve the situation prior to the 40 minute Metro Link ride.  That's about the time I was introduced to the Hilton brand 'Tight Squeeze' toilet.  That, my friend, can only be described as one leg constrained by the tub, and the other by the wall.When I returned to the hotel, after the game, I headed straight to the lounge for a few Hefeweizens.  I ended up ordering the Beef Tenderloin Tapas appetizer, which was delicious, yet not too expensive (around $11).I headed up to the room and hit the shower which maintained a good amount of water pressure.  The towels were fairly soft.  After adjusting the thermostat, I fell into bed, which I must say was very comfy.I awoke a little before 9am to housekeeping knocking on my door.  I yelled out something to the effect that checkout time wasn't for another three hours, which seemed to satisfy their aspirations to further whack the door.I rolled out of bed, flipped on the news, and filled the sink with water so I could shave.  Unbeknown to me, the sink was slowly draining, causing me to momentarily rush the razor blades across my jugular area.  Fortunate for me, I was using the Gillette Fusion 5-blade battery operated razor, which always gives a comfortable close shave.I headed down to check my bags, so I wouldn't have to lug them around the Anheuser Busch tour.  A very friendly associate tagged and stored my belongings in a secured area.  When I arrived back, I picked up my articles without incident.Swoop Says: If you don't expect much, and can get the room for $55 or less through Hotwire, I'd consider it a deal.  However, I wouldn't blow 20,000 Hilton Honors points, unless you absolutely can't get into anything else.~SwoopExcellent hotel. Although it is an ""airport"" hotel, it is located off of a freeway with easy access to the attractions in St. Louis. The employees are very friendly. One of the employees from reception even remembered my name as she wished me good night. I stayed in a very spacious room with 2 queen beds. The hotel was recently renovated so expect to see new furnishings and a clean, sleek look. The hotel bar in the lobby gets crowded on the weekend. I'm not sure if these folks were locals or guests attending a convention at the hotel. Regardless, eat dinner and have a drink at the bar. The wait staff and bartender were very attentive. Get the Caesar Salad! It's super yummy.Overnight parking for hotel guests is $10 each day. The airport is a short 2 minute car ride away or take the airport shuttle offered by the hotel.Today I will be checking out of Hilton St. Louis Airport. My stay was okay considering I am leaving for a deployment today. The front desk staff and concierge was top notch. Especially the airport shuttle attendants. Oscar and Tommy went out of their to assist many times. I did have a few issues. Housekeeping almost always came by at early in the morning. I usually was awakened by their loud talking in the hallway before they even got to my door. One day specifically I heard one talk on the phone as she told the person on the line to hold on while she knocked on a door. Granted it is holiday season and a lot of people are usually communicating with families to make arrangements but i don't think the hallway is the appropriate setting for doing that. Also if I called for housekeeping, the housekeeper would not come until maybe 3 hours later. I understand the hotel has had renovations but the housekeeping section maybe a little under par. Other than that my hotel stay was okay. Not the quite the Hilton experience I was going for but it will have to do. The location was alright considering that the Airport was connected to the public transportation train. That was great. $7 for a day pass and it is well worth it! St. Louis did not have as much sightseeing as I thought it would but it is a great city. Might not comeback but it was nice to say I came.I love, love, love this hotel!!  Seriously, if I ever come back to STL, I am definitely staying here!!The staff is SO nice, friendly, and helpful.  Anytime I saw someone they would greet me with a smile and ask what they could do for me--even when there was nothing to do!  They were all so awesome.For example, my friend and I went down to the ""gift shop"" to get some milk one evening for the kids to have with dinner.  There were three staff members stocking the area, but I didn't see milk.  I was in the middle of telling my friend that I would just go to the gas station for milk, and my hero, Adriana, asks me what I am looking for.  When I explained what I needed, she went to the back and got us SIX cartons of milk!  FOR FREE.  We were ready to pay gas station prices for them.  I was SO grateful, and I know my son was, too.The only problem we had was Saturday when we came back from the zoo for our kids to nap.  Housekeeping had just started cleaning the room, and she said she would be back in two hours to finish and that it was no problem because she was there til 6.  Well, she never came back.  So we had to call and ask for towels, and a garbage bag, etc.  But if that's my only issue, I will take it!I LOVED our stay here, and I know my friend feels the same!Q: What happens when a lot of people are trying very hard, but not quite succeeding?A: A 3 star Yelp review gets written.I really feel like that sums it up. Pretty much everybody here was trying hard to make this a good experience. Everybody was courteous and polite. But they kept messing up.Good: Great selection of fresh fruit at breakfast buffetBad: Really expensive breakfast buffet ($16 I think?)Good: Clean, large room. Cleaning staff that go out of their way to make sure your room stays clean.Bad: Front desk people give different answers at different times, some were smart, some were clueless. They called the worst cab driver of my life.Good: Punctual, free shuttle every 15 minutes to the airport. Shuttle driver, when asked about what he thinks about the womenfolk of STL, says ""Well... They're all lesbians. This here's the lesbian capital of the midwest, probably the country, maybe the world.""Bad: $10/day wifi. Seriously guys? Seriously?!? You mean to tell me that something that Starbucks offers for free after you've bought a couple dollar coffee you'll charge me $10 for after I've rented a hundred dollar room? Thank god for cell phone tethering.Good: Comfortable bed.Bad: They charged a dollar for a minute long local phone call.Good: Location is very close to the airportBad: Airport is close to nothing whatsoever.So yeah - plenty of good and bad. I dunno - I'd stay here again if the price was right. But the nickle and diming needs to stop. And they just need to get their act together in general.40 Minute shuttle wait at the (cold and rainy) airport  Called the hotel but was served unresponsive, disconnected, if lazy phone assistance, all the time saying dismissively ""he'll be right there"". 10 others who were also waiting and calling, were similarly frustrated. Clearly the octogenarian driver had other things to do than attend to customers.  Arriving at the hotel, come to find our that there is no power near the desk (it's behind it, which you can get to if you get on the floor and reach up). Next the internet didn't work. I expect Hilton to be at the top of the hospitality game. Unfortunately I got (and others) a Motel 6 effort and even worse display of professionalism and hospitality. There are plenty of other spots around the airport. I suggest that you try those first. Stay away from Hilton - St. Louis Airport. David BantlyHilton Diamond; Marriott Plat; Holiday Plat; Hyatt Plat...it's not my first rodeo but this is my first blog complaint. Don't like ""hating"" but this is an unacceptable performance.Friendliest, most welcoming staff in recent travel experiences! Clean, smart decor. Will DEFINITELY stay here again - family or business travel.This hotel is horrible. They nickle and dime you for everything. Parking? $10. Internet? $10. Per device. That's right. Want to use your work laptop? $10. iPad? That's another $10. Personal laptop? Another $10. In the year of our lord two thousand and twelve. Other issues: The rooms don't have mini-refrigerators, which I find very frustrating. There is no handsoap in the bathrooms. There is no channel listings in the rooms. The TV in the room is slow, and does not have an onscreen guide. Just changing the channels is a chore. Also the thermostat did not work in my room. I was sweating. In February.Rarely do you find an airport hotel worthy of 5 stars-but this one just hits all the right notes!  The staff is friendly, even cleaning staff is socially spot on!  The rooms are consistently nice, clean, fully stocked with amenities.  In 5 years of staying here a few times a year I've never encountered a room that wasn't picture perfect.  Now that's consistency!  The bar/restaurant area is modern with a classy yet comfortable feel.  Our server last night, Eric, was outstanding and saved one of our folks from getting a lap full of wine.  The gym has just about everything you need; free weights, standard assortment of cardio equipment, strength training station and medicine balls.  Plus, it's just spacious enough to have your own space without feeling claustrophobic.  5 years and going strong, a great hotel pick here in STL!This hotel could very easily be a 4.5 star property, if not for a couple of minor issues. First, the rooms are very nicely updated, with excellent beds, LCD TVs and couches. Unfortunately, I had a slow sink leak, which I reported at checkout. The thing that really bothered me, however, was the lack of maid service. I had the DND sign on my door until about Noon on my second day, and upon returning to the room at 5:30 PM, there had been no maid service. No refreshed towels, coffee, etc. A phone call would've been nice if they intended not to provide the service because of the sign on the door, but nothing.The lounge was nice (Stacy and Lena were excellent waitresses), the meeting rooms were great, and the fitness center was superb, with disinfectant wipes and plenty of water and towels. The front desk staff was just okay; when my room key failed to get me in the fitness center, I was greeted with scrutiny but no apology. Unfortunately, at least for my experience, any one employee can negatively impact a guest's stay.Rooms were typical but always stocked with water daily. Eric in the bar is amazing!! Great service with a smile!! Ask the front desk for appetizer and drink coupons upon check-in!!Apparently, they sold out last night, so no early check in for me. I think I'm officially done with this Hilton.I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member. With this status, Hilton hotels will usually go out of their way to accommodate you. Not this one. While most things are pretty standard, I didn't get that next level of service I have grown accustom to.And my biggest pet peeve is their separate wing. I travel with lots of luggage. It is not easy getting all the way to the rooms on the other wing of the hotel.3 stars. My experience with this hotel has never been better than just ok.This is a beautifully decorated Hilton, large plush chairs and vintage photos of the St. Louis airport and plane travel. Gilded floor-length mirrors took my breath away and my room was more than comfortable. So what happened to all the stars?? Bar: I ate at the bar. Well, kind of. I ordered at the bar and nibbled my food before I got grossed out and left. I ordered a drink, which was way too strong, but I guess a strong drink is better than a weak one. Next, I ordered some meat skewers and just before they arrived, I hear someone hock a loogie in the kitchen. SERIOUSLY?!?!??! Needless to say, I thoroughly inspected my food, nibbled the tip and left the whole dish sitting there. I paid and left the waiter staring at my full cocktail glass and untouched plate of food. I took away the third star for the expensive parking (~$20) each night!I am sure there are better hotels in the STL area, I love this city......but I don't want to stay at this hotel ever again.This is a pretty nice hotel by St. Louis standards! It's really classy and the lobby, bar, restaurant are all pretty fancy! Especially for the area around the airportEasy Location and friendly staff but that's about itOkay, so we arrived via the rental car agency (see review Alamo St Louis Airport). Pulling in to the parking lot you have to park in the front of the building and go check in before you can park for good which is weird as it takes a room key and $10 overnight to park. In addition getting out of the poled off parking section was difficult. Every day I left I had to make a 3 point turn in order to pick up my elderly family members at the door because the exit is positioned to leave the premise. Check in was smooth and the clerk was nice. For this trip which was a funeral, I booked an executive king which at this hotel is situated on the top floor (9th). The decor of the small lobby seemed pleasant but plain. Located across from the checkout counter is the restaurant which was decorated in a 1970's color and lighting theme and not on purpose I'm afraid, a few seats and the bar area is also dated decor. The bar area does contain a couple of flat screen HDTVs and the area seemed okay but because it is open and not really isolated from the main corridor to the rooms, not very inviting. I was told that the concierge service for the executive rooms is not available for the weekend and I was given 4 soft drink or tea coupons and 4 appetizer coupons which I used in the Constellations restaurant (see review) with my relatives on the last day. This gesture, dollar wise was a great deal but the food, well more on that later. The bar is not staffed or served during the day which seemed odd. Overall, the food served at this hotel seemed just so so. Some of my relatives ate at the all you can eat breakfast buffet for $14.95 and said it was good. I ordered muffins from room service one day which were kind of dry and expensive at $8 so for the money and the overall foodie breakfast thing , I'd say you'd be better off walking or driving a block down to the Golden Pancake  (see review).  As for the room (934), it was nicely decorated and laid out well with the position of the couch, tables and king sized bed. It took me a minute to find the TV remote which was on the bedside table closest to the wall. The picture on the 32"" HDTV set was decent but was satellite and kept going in and out for no reason. The bathroom is the same layout as most of the Hiltons I have been in recently with the door opening inward to the tub which makes for close quarters, marble tops and a drop white sink. In my room the faucet was loose on the cold side and took a bit to come on. The shower is a basic one knob turn kind with fine jets or thicker jets as the only settings. Every shower had good hot water and like other Hilton properties they used the new name brand natural soap that I have grown to love. The room does not have a microwave, or a mini fridge and only a small no name coffee maker that seemed to do the trick for my wife but was nothing to brag about. The only Internet service offered was for HHonors members like me, and the service was slow and only wireless.  The real problems arose in the room with sleeping. First you will discover that the curtain is backward with the shears inside so to open the curtain and let some light in you must open the shears and let everyone gaze upon your Adonis. Next up for the darkness factor, the light that pours from the door is just crazy insane. On my 1 to 10 scale with 10 being pitch dark this is like a 5. It's not totally un-sleepable, but really it's a lot of hallway light and a towel in front of it only blocks 3 out of the 4 laser beams! The bed itself is a true king with pillows and duvet matching all Hiltons at this time (white fluffy and feather pillows) however this bed was lumpy and had a divot and my wife and I were forced apart on the edges of the bed in order to not keep rolling into one another. I would expect this in a lower class hotel but not here.  The room was cool, but not cold and I later found out that the weird noise that kept me up all night was a frozen over air conditioner which explains why it said it was 65f all the time when it really didn't feel like it. So overall if you are looking to do a quick an easy stay close to the airport, say you were an airline employee, then sure this is your place but short of that I was not impressed at all.The hotel seemed OK, nice lobby and clean appearance. The parking fee of $!0 on your room every night was OK - but really an open lot without security? The room was nice - but a ridiculous fee for wireless internet access even if you are a Hilton Honors member - I have been to many Hiltons that were nice - you are taking down a good name.  Oh, and get a restaurant in that huge lobby - what a waste of space!Once again I had a great stay at this location. I stayed for the weekend, for a wedding I was attending/planning. Check in was a breeze. I was greeted with a ""welcome back"". That was a great touch to acknowledge that I am a returning customer! When I got to my room, I had a personalized note from the staff, welcoming me back and provided a phone number to call in case I had any issues....again perfect!!! Along with a couple of meal/drink tickets!!! Once again I love this location. The attention to detail and care taken to acknowledge the customer is great!So while at this point I won't  change the rating review - I will certainly give them a second chance. The way the management responded was A+.","I stayed at this hotel for two weeks for sales training... The staff was very friendly and professional... They were also very helpful in getting us to the local galleria mall on the weekend... The food was not great, but it was decent.  Overall, a good experience.My review will be based on the rooms, food, and service Hotel includes restaurant, buffet, bar, lounge and pool Room - pleasant and comfortable. I did not have many issues. The only one being my bathroom flush didn't work well. Besides that everything ran smoothly. Food - good selection but WAY overpriced. $18 for a breakfast buffet is not reasonable. I only had breakfast and lunch at the buffet and they were both pretty good. Lunch did not have much selection however it was good quality. The menu in the bar and restaurant is the same. I had dinner at the bar and the menu did not have many non-meat selections. Gym - small gym with most of the essential machines. The pool was indoor and medium size with no jacuzzi. Service was GREAT. They were very helpful. Whether it was the front desk, room service or the restaurant, they were always willing to assist you! Overall, I would stay here if I was not planning on being in the hotel for long periods of time and I would not recommend staying here if you are vacationing. The hotel is located in an area where there is not much to do in terms of entertainment. If you want to be in a central location stay at the Hilton at ballpark in downtown. However, this hotel is a good place for meetings and executive events. It has good rooms for meetings with food and beverages that are restocked often.I slept better in this hotel than in any other hotel in years.  I have been meaning to try this hotel for a long time, but the opportunity never presented itself until just this weekend when I needed a place to stay after arriving from a long flight.  You know how it can be arriving late at a hotel.  I was sleepy, tired and just ready to go to bed.  I picked up my car at Hertz next door to the hotel and drove to the hotel and parked in the designated check in spaces.  The front desk personnel kindly explained the parking and how to get to the room.  The parking lot is huge, but I managed fine.  The things I, as a business traveler - but this time as a personal traveler - value are a good bed, quiet and a great breakfast.  Theyreally hit the target for me on all counts.I found the room, which was on the executive floor, very well appointed.  I liked that I could change the temperature in the room to what it needed to be for me to make it comfortable.  I had to take a shower since I had a late flight and felt sweaty - the bathroom was nicely appointed with towels, soap (for both the sink and the bath), shampoo, and a very welcome handle on the shower to hold on to.  This is one of those hotels which is solidly built not to have plumbing noise come into the room and the bathroom felt well built.  The sink was one of those new ones and very nice to use.  The bed was wonderful.  The bedding was genuinely comfortable and the pillows made it easy for me to not only sleep, but all through the night without disturbance.   This hardly happens to me on the first night in any hotel, but it happened here and that is, after all, what a hotel is primarily for.The breakfast in the morning was delicious and fresh.  It was a buffet, but this was one of the best ones I have seen where the food is really nicely done.  I loved the variety and the service by the waiters in the dining area was exceptional.  This really was one of the best breakfasts I have enjoyed at a hotel buffet.The personnel I encountered at the front desk were very attentive and helpful.  All around, I had a great overnight here and when the occasion comes again as surely it will when I have to arrive late again and need a place to stay before embarking on a long drive in the morning - I will use the St. Louis Airport Hilton again.Great hotel for a pretty good price. Great workout facility, very nice lobby and lobby bar. Was surprised how good the food was in the restaurant there. Free wifi in the lobby always helps too. Rooms were a little dated feeling, but nice. Staff were all very nice.Love the renovation.  Was here on a coaching/speaking event.  Love the staff!!  Was here for 5 days and they just make you feel like family!!  From the front desk to the kitchen staff!!!  BRAVO to you all!!!Very nice airport hotel. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again for future ""park and fly"" trips. They have a gated secure parking area in the back for long term parking. They give you a pass if you stay at the hotel for parking in long term. Shuttle was very quick. The room was very nice. The bed was top notch, very comfy! nice lcd tv screen, carpet, and pillows! Only thing that I didn't like was the toilet was super loud when you flushed. I like not having a clogged toilet don't get me wrong, but this thing sounded like a jet take off when you flush! kinda made it hard when you don't wanna wake other people in the room or even next door.Food was terrible, but the service was outstanding. The staff went above and beyond, and they were completely pleasant. The hotel was lovely, and bed was comfortable. I would consider staying here again...just not eating here.Very nice hotel with very helpful and courteous staff.   WiFi free to Diamond members.Nice hotel set up.  Very clean and well organized.  Rooms, as always were great.  Friendly staff but very inefficient bell hops.  Restaurant was pretty good but a limited selection.Loved my room. Comfy bed with heavenly pillows. Place is fairly clean and well decorated. Lobby restaurant could use some type of door entry and not just open to the lobby. There was a constant draft coming in. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Minus a star for expensive and not so great internet.This hotel was recently renovated and is amazing. The rooms are very comfortable and very very comfortable. The food is great as well. It is one of the nicest Hilton properties I have ever stayed in. The rooms are all decorated with TWA memories and is very charming!Terrible. We were placed in a room that was on the ground floor and seemed to have an overall dampness. Not sure if the AC just couldn't handle the heat or if something else was going on. Upon requesting another room, we were moved across the hall. Same thing (not that I expected much different). As nice as the hotel was (beautiful interior, that is - the exterior leaves much to be desired), I was surprised by the service we received from the front desk staff. We left the hotel and stayed elsewhere. If we go back to St. Louis, we'll probably stay closer to downtown. If we MUST stay near the airport, maybe I'll try the Renaissance.Price was OK as we have a corporate discount. Hotel needs a good manager. Dishes at breakfast buffet were washed but not clean. Coffee machine in room still had previous guests coffee in it. Room had a vent in the closet that was allowing cold air in.Staff was nice. Decorations were nice. When I come to St. Louis again, I will stay somewhere else.Stay here for the week for business and got special deal at executive floor. The whole place has been renovated, how ever my bathroom toilet didn't flush properly, the room is kinda small with no fridge. However you do get LCD TV, and lobby has Mac with free internet access. There's $10 for internet access daily and parking as well. The room service food is bad, I suggest you go out of hotel if you got an car. Bandanna BBQ is an great place to go just 2 minutes away.  It's next to Hertz car rental which is really convenient .Our team stayed here during our MRL weekend in St. Louis and we were very pleased. Location, partking and amenities were first-rate, as was the customer service. Staff always said ""yes"" to everything we asked and never made an issue of it. Our rooms were very comfortable, the breakfast buffet was very good and the prices were reasonable for a hotel of this type.","['less', 'expensive', 'many', 'hotel', 'options', 'category', 'location',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-st-louis-downtown-st-louis-2,Crowne Plaza St. Louis - Downtown,2.0,$$,121,"The Crown Plaza - Downtown Hotel has it's positives and negatives. But its an decent place to stay.Lets talk about the positives. The hotel location is great!  You are within walking distance to all the good stuff like the stadiums, museums and restaurants. You have to pay for parking, but its only 10 bucks per night and that's not bad for downtown. The hotel also has a roof top pool and observation deck with a killer view of the Gateway Arch. The staff of the hotel is really friendly too. They set me up with a room looking right at the arch when I asked for it. So don't hesitate to ask for what you want to look at :-) Most of my pictures below are of the stuff I liked.The main negative for this hotel is that its old... It looks like they are doing some renovations, but the overall feel is still meh. The room itself and bathroom was nice and modern. But the hallway getting to the room was super dated, with a loud ice machine. Try not staying in rooms ending with 06, 07, or 20 since they are right next to the loud ice machine. The flooring throughout the hotel is old and there is a lot of cracked tile everywhere. I don't believe that the negatives will keep me from coming back. It's an OK hotel, that's right in the center where you want to be, and at a good rate.I have to say I was disappointed overall in my experience at the Crowne Plaza.  I'd like to give you a recount of my weekend at the hotel, so you can get a whole picture.  When I checked in to room 2111, the room I was in felt warm, but I figured the air conditioning just hadn't been on and it would cool down.  It was a pretty warm day in STL, so I wanted to give the room time to cool off, as it was hot in there.  I also noticed dust on the dresser where the TV was and dirt on the makeup mirror in the bathroom, which is not my previous experiences with IHG hotels.  I didn't say anything that first day, thinking I was only there for two nights and if the room cooled down I could overlook the other issues.  I brought my own wipes and cleaned things off myself.  My general impression that first day was that this hotel really needs to be renovated and updated.  I stay in hotels a lot all around the U.S. and I have never seen a hotel that needed updating as much as this one.Unfortunately, that first night was pretty unbearable.  Both myself and my friend with me were really hot all night long.  Neither one of us got much sleep that night at all.  The next morning, I called the front desk and was told the air conditioning is off for the winter.  Whoever I talked to apologized and said she would send the engineer to my room to have them turn on the air conditioner in my room.  I left for a few hours and was hoping the air would be on when I got back.  Unfortunately, when I returned the engineer had been in my room, but the air was not on.  The only thing that had been done was a box fan was left in the room and the curtains closed to keep the heat out.  I then called the front desk and spoke with someone else, who told me the air conditioning is off for the whole hotel for the winter and it wasn't coming back on.  It would have been nice if the first person had told me this.  I asked if I could at least get another fan in the room, since there were two of us staying in two beds.  I was told another fan would be brought up.  I was again leaving for a few hours and was hoping at least for a second fan when I returned.When I got back the second time, the second fan was still not there.  This is when I called IHG and let them know this hotel is not in line with the standards of IHG.  Emili then promptly called me and offered me an upgraded suite, which she said is usually cooler.  The problem is there were two of us staying in the hotel.  The suite only had one bed and neither one of us wanted to sleep on a sofa bed.  I declined the suite and asked Emili again if I could just please get another fan for the room.  She agreed and said someone would bring one up.  She also told me the air conditioning would be coming on that night.  I again left for a while and when I returned, I still didn't have a second fan in the room.  I called the front desk when I returned and told them I needed a second fan in the room; and also expressed that I was told twice earlier in the day I would be getting one and still didn't have one.  The person I talked to said someone would bring one up immediately.  That second fan never came.  The good thing that happened that second night is the air conditioning did come on, so it was a little more bearable to sleep that second night.  After a long day, my friend and I went to watch some TV and the TV didn't work either.  When I called for help with the TV, a very friendly gentleman came up and switched out the remote controls to make it work.  He was very nice and I appreciated at least one thing getting fixed during my stay. I have to tell you if I had been staying more than two nights, I would have checked out and went to get a room next door at the Hyatt, even if I had to pay.  That is where I spent all of my time outside of my room at a hotel that weekend.  I know it's not entirely your fault, but I would convey to whoever needs told that this hotel is dingy, dirty, and quite honestly the attitude of the staff is mixed.  Emili was very nice when she called, but a few others at the front desk seemed to just generally have an attitude.  I will say the gentleman who checked me in was very friendly.  As you can imagine, this gives me a generally poor impression of IHG.  I find this whole experience surprising because the Crowne Plaza is supposed to be IHG' s luxury hotel.When I called IHG, I was hoping they would at least refund half of my points for the first night.  They have not and I can understand this, since I did stay there.  When I return to St Louis, I will definitely not stay at the Crowne Plaza againDidn't have much interaction with employees. Was in town for a concert weekend. This place needs a serious renovation. Faded paint , dirty carpet, broken bathroom fixtures. We had no heat during our stay, in winter? Should be priced more like Motel6 At least our floor was relatively quiet and hotel is a decent location.Not a bad hotel for a good price. The lobby and bar area looked nice, but the corridors and elevators were as some of the other reviewers have stated, ""old-school"". Their were definitely some cleaning issues as well. The place looked a bit shabby in quite a few places around the hotel. The room layout was a bit odd, but my room had a great balcony with a not so bad view of the Gateway Arch (a leg of it anyway LOL). The shower was a mixed bag. It had really good water pressure and was capable of good and hot temperatures. Unfortunately it had a bad temperature control valve. There were only two temperatures; SCALDING HOT &amp; FREEZING COLD...  I made the mistake of having breakfast in the Union Grill hotel restaurant. It had the same cleaning issues as the rest of the hotel with a hotel priced sub-par buffet. I think that I would probably stay here again if the price was right. Although I would like to try another hotel on my next visit to STL. I used Orbitz and came in about thirty bucks cheaper than CP's advertised price.Average. That's the word I keep coming back to. There are parts of this hotel that look incredibly dated, and the first impression I got walking in is that it's an old hotel. Once you get into the room it looks like the furniture is recent but the wallpaper and air conditioner are not. The bathroom is small and old but clean. The room itself is good sized. Service is a mixed bag. Some people are good at customer service, some aren't. It's the luck of the draw. The hallways aren't as clean as they should be. But the bed is comfortable and the sheets clean. Breakfast is fairly good. As is typical for a hotel it's overpriced for what you get. The restaurant staff is attentive and there's a nice view of the arch in the dining room. I ate in the lounge one night; the food wasn't bad but wasn't outstanding. The service at the bar was lacking. The bartender doted on regulars and talked to her friends but left me waiting a lot. Pro tip: self park your car. Besides the self parking being $10/day instead of $20 for valet, the valet situation is horrid. You're recommended to call down for your car 20 minutes ahead of time. So the drive fills up with cars waiting to be claimed. Meanwhile the attendant will leave you waiting. And waiting. And waiting longer than 20 minutes. Don't bother. The rates here are cheaper than the others nearby, but the other hotels are nicer. It's not a dump, but just know that there are some trade offs for a low rate.Seven stars for an incredible staff. Nice lobby. Reasonable parking for its location ($10). Minus five for the room.There's no nice way to say this: the building is a dilapidated relic. The newest thing in the room is the tv, at least it is a flat screen. Fridge and microwave are a nice touch, still old. Room was clean and large, crazy with wasted space, old furniture, crappy old fixtures. My room was right next to the elevator. You could hear it all night long, like there wasn't even a wall there. Slamming, people whistling, talking loudly, it went on all night. That stunk.The bathroom. Ugh. Seriously dated, thinking 1970's remodel? The shower had two temperatures: glacier-fed and scalding. I ended up having to devise a kind of sponge bath because I'm just not into torture. The soaps were nice.The furnace, God bless it, tried. Too bad it isn't adjustable. Brrr.The view from the balcony is spectacular. There is a lot of potential here. I hope a major overhaul is in the works. Until then, it is way overpriced for a glorified Motel 6.This place is going to make me withdraw from the IHG Rewards program,  We had a family meet up here to have a good weekend and a Father's Day celebration. It was awful, the place was dirty, the staff was surly and I will never return.When we arrived in our room (2BR  suite with a sitting room) we had 1 towela busted lamp shadea fist hole in the bathroom door2 Pair of dirty underwear1 wash cloth tossed behind the couch that was all stuck together (you figure it out)In the morning we had two leaks in the ceiling.The staff made no attempt to correct this and then they locked us out of our room and resold it, giving us a room with two beds and a couch. DO NOT STAY HERE!This is probably one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at, they had a deal to stay here for for about $60 a night, boy was that a bad idea.  The lobby and downstairs are nice but the rooms are gross and disgusting. It definitely needs to be renovated. While it is convenient next to the arch, Pay a little more and stay at the Hyatt or the Hilton just next door. The furniture is all scratched and dented, the bed is on a metal box spring so it is super noisy. The closet door was even broken so you couldn't close it after opening it. STAY AWAY!Not staying here again.Our group came to St. Louis to attend Mardi Gras festivities. We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in 2014 (during this stay our room type had been overbooked so we were upgraded complimentary, at which we were surprised about but still content). During this stay, though, we had requested a roll-away to be placed in the room. The roll-away was not in the room at check-in so we reminded the front desk as we left for dinner. Upon returning much later at night (~11pm), our roll-away was still not in the room. I went down to the front desk to remind the agent one more time. Now, I work as a front desk manager as well and I believe there is a certain manner in which you handle disgruntled guests. The MOD at the time notified me that I could not get a roll-away because we had 5 beds in the room! 5! We were in your suite which came with a king bed, a queen bed and a pull-out. The woman did not even bother checking before she stated this. When I proceeded to tell her we only had 3 beds in the room, I was given the reply ""Alright, well he's got a LONG list of stuff to do so it's going to be a while."" Again, at least tell me that you are working as fast as you can - don't give me the impression that chances are slim of me even getting the roll-away I had REQUESTED WHEN I MADE THE RESERVATION! At this point I clearly saw that the woman did not want to deal with me and told me that I would be ""taken care of."" I reminded her that this was not my first time requesting the item at which point she started to walk away. I have video/audio proof of this entire conversation and am highly disappointed with the training here - especially for your MOD (who should be setting an example for the rest of her GSA's). I understand that it is Mardi Gras and that you do not want to deal with inebriated guests - this was not my case. What baffles me the most is that upon having a side-conversation with my colleague regarding your agent's attitude, she overheard me mention that I took a video of the proceedings. She then called me aside and stated that ""I do not appreciate being video taped, I'm going to call the police."" She proceeded to pick up the phone and imitate calling the police - at which point I told her I would wait in the lobby for them to show. I'm assuming she never called them because no one ever came. We will not be staying at your hotel anymore - not because of the rooms or any issues with the facility - but because your staff needs to be trained better in interacting with customers even in late hours or on busy days.Just not a great experience at all. Yes we got a great deal of $42 on Priceline buttt..... it definitely wasn't worth the 2 fire alarms at 230am and 3 am or the loud guest screaming off the balcony around 1130pm. Pros: Big RoomsGood size TVRefrigerator/ Microwave in roomCons:Small BathroomNo control of temperature (Heater was blasting so we had to open windows when is was 20 degrees out)Rowdy guest + hallways smelling like weed= 2 fire alarms!Breakfast was good but only had one guy hustling the whole room. He did a great job but had way to many things going on. Wifi was ok.I was here for a convention. Yes, it's convenient if you are Ok with a $40 cab ride from the airport. No shuttle service. This is the only hotel that my car was broken into. The hotel security didn't even see it, the hotel across the street did when one of their security guards went out for a smoke break. No video surveillance. No offer to discount the room or pay for the window. This place can eat a bag of ......What a joke this place is. Do yourself a favor and don't stay here.I made my reservation through Expedia for a king bed/non smoking room about a month before my stay. On my arrival, I was told that there wasn't any non-smoking rooms left. I had just driven over 6 hours and was exhausted; figured ""how bad could it be?!""Well, it was terrible. Not only was the smoking floor stinky and causing me to have itchy red eyes right away, it was old, things were broken, including my TV, and it just felt dirty.I had called Expedia to see if they could get me a non smoking room in the hotel. To my disbelief, Henry, the incompetent manager, had informed Expedia that since I already checked in, I would be charged $50. $50 to stay in a room for 15 minutes that I didn't want, didn't reserve and was literally making my skin crawl. Ridiculous.I paid the $50 to just get the heck out of this disaster of a hotel. Should have read the reviews on the place, in the first place.Stay at the St Louis City Center instead, people. They were very nice which was a warm welcome to the crap service at the Crowne.The only good thing about this hotel was the view of the arch. Bid on this room on Priceline and got it for $60. Parking was another $10 and the parking garage was a confusing maze. The room was pretty gross, found a fake diamond earring on the bathroom floor in plain view. The deadbolt on our door had been ripped off. The wifi did not work at all, and when I called downstairs about it I got hung up on, they did not care. There was central heating because the building was so old, and the room was very hot and we could not make it cooler. There was a used condom outside the parking garage. Just a bad/gross experience overall. Thank god we only got that hotel for one night!!Couldn't handle it. This place is so bad I had to leave. The first room we went to was huge... On the 4th floor with a watermelon sized stain in the middle of the room. It smelled awful. The light was broken in the bathroom so we asked to switch. Then we went to a room that looked fine but on the sheets there was hair and yellow body fluids. Disgusting. The elevators felt like they would break, the halls had chipped paint left and right, the doors hard to open. I left this hotel. I've stayed in 3rd world countries with better hotel cleanliness.A super 8 is better then this dump. No air conditioning. Has a nasty smell through out.  Curtains falling off the rods. Wall paper coming off the walls. Rude lady at the front desk. RUDE as in doesn't deserve to be in the public. Beware before you book a room here.... they definitely need to do some repairs to this whole.Just gonna hit the quick details of my experience:-smells old and dirty -climate control is not adjustable-internet doesn't work 99% of the time-20% chance of getting a decent view-any complaints will get ""looked in to"" and you'll never hear back-location is great for tourism only-not recommended for business trips-room rate and quality are not equal. Overpriced for sure-I've stayed in super 8's nicer than this placeThe staff is at best incompetent and inattentive, at worst downright hostile. The guest rooms haven't been updated since the 90s. Peeling wallpaper, loose bathroom fixtures, window AC units that struggle to adequately cool rooms. When we arrived our room was 84F (90F outside) and there was no toilet paper or bath towels. Several of the elevators are broken. The crowd here this weekend (drunk and obnoxious Cardinals and Pirates fans) but the paper thin walls that allow their idiocy at 3am disrupt everyone. To the staff and management of this hotel: If the lines for your elevators extend through the entire lobby and into the bar, maybe some active management of that system is required to have any sort of pleasant experience for your guests. If guest rooms aren't available for fully three hours after the stated check-in time, perhaps you should extend some hospitality to the affected guest by a comp at the bar or restaurant. Maybe you should have a checklist for housekeeping to make sure little details like toilet paper aren't missed. Maybe management shouldn't be renting rooms without functional HVAC systems.PS: The wi-fi also doesn't work correctly. Their certificate systems are broken so auth doesn't complete. I notified the front desk, but it was like asking a house cat to do calculus.There is a less than zero chance I will ever return to this property.We booked a room as did another couple for the night (we were in a wedding downtown). Our room had a beautiful view, nonsmoking (per our request) and a king bed. Our friends, got a smoking room (despite their request) and at midnight when we arrived post reception there was nothing else available. Not happy. Futhermore, only 1 of the 6 elevators was working so there was quite a long wait to get up to our room. When we did get to our room, the AC was broken (which really wasn't a big deal bc it was lovely outside) but it made cranking noises all night.  The rest of the wedding party stayed at the Hyatt next door. It was a little pricier but WOAH way nicer. In the future I won't be so cheap bc it definitely wasn't worth saving the 20 bucks.Great location. Clean room. Parking on site for $10. Rooftop pool nice view but pool is small.Small refrigerator is ice cold. Small microwave in room also. Room service available. Bar in lobby.Poor St.Louis. This hotel probably shouldn't be open. Certainly not a Crown Plaza hotel experience. Tired, worn, and indite need of a total do over!Pass on this place.","I am a priority club member and normally like the Crown Plaza brand. This hotel is in need of a remodel. Our room, even though it was a suite, was tired. The Wi-Fi was spotty, the room temperature controls did not work, they ran out of pillows and blankets. Also ran out of hot water during peak period around 8:30am. There is a sign posted for valet service and none available. There was substantial freeway noise and also construction sounds audible from the nearby arch. Upon check out there was apparently a problem with my credit card but after calling my company twice and waiting 30 minutes, it was finally processed. Overall, a disappointing experience. Check out the Hyatt and Hilton nearby.Wifi had no resemblance of working...at all. Also, if you get the free Priority Club breakfast, pass. It is the most limited, fly-infested joke. I have seen better at a Super 8. Are you rewarding valued customers or punishing them?   ...but nice view of the Arch.The lobby and bar area are great. Valet parking is a decent price. But the hallways and rooms are pretty old school. Our heat and air seem stuck on air (unless they have a central thermostat). Our TV looses satellite signal a bunch.Please read all the reviews about this hotel after my review.  The only positive thing about this experience was the view of the arch.  Outside of that, the entire experience will be like staying at a haunted hotel that had been a long time abandoned.  The wifi required you sign into a hotel homepage that was never created.  This goes back to 2013, so it's not as if they didn't have ample time to correct the problem.  The entire hotel looks as if kids came in at night with Walmart carts and played crash-up derby in every corridor in the hotel.  The heater/air conditioner was preset and broken and the table had little stick-on stars which my 1st grade teacher gave on tests.  Soda machine ate my two dollars which was given in change because it would not accept my bills.  The room layout was strange even though the beds were clean, the housekeeping did a half assed job on the rest of the room.  And the parking garage was not only a maze of ridiculousness but after going down two levels to go up three levels, the actual exit was two blocks away from the hotel by the time you made and exit.  If misery = Missouri, here is your guarantee.This was probably the worst hotel stay of my entire life (for some perspective I am a consultant who is traveling about 25% of the time so that's really saying something...) The reason for one star is because some the staff were great in trying to resolve our issues and it had a convenient location with a great view but still it was an overall bad experience. From the moment of check in we regretted our choice of hotel. The lobby was filled with high school age groups and extremely drunk sports fans. We were in St Louis to celebrate and meet with my future in laws. We arrived Friday and checked in the early afternoon. My in laws room had two other parties attempt to get in because they overbooked the room to two other guests. The first time it happened the people actually went in the room and were able to shower and change clothes before the hotel figured out what was going on. The security guard explained he had to go through their luggage because they didn't know who was in the room. They had to get new room keys 4 times that day. The second time someone tried to get in their room was at midnight. They had a horrible night dealing with security and other guests trying to get in their room. So not once but twice the front desk rented out an already occupied room. I spent the next morning speaking with the manager who moved them to an upgraded suite which was great but the issues didn't stop there. (On a side note the balcony door was broken and they sent someone to replace it quickly.) they did offer us free drink tickets as well but we found out later they were for drinks, just beer. We witnessed a drinker guest fall on the pavement in front of the hotel that night and break her nose. I ran to the hotel to get some help and it took them over ten minutes to send someone. A medical emergency deserves more than a tired look and complacency from the security staff. That same day we watched an underage drunk kid get arrested in the lobby. The next day our stay did not improve. Our floor was filled with unsupervised high school age children who found it fun to go between rooms all night. This would not be so bad if the rooms weren't 50 years old and the doors weren't hollow and need to be slammed to close (literally have signs on the doors saying close with force because they do not close on their own). So after asking them to keep it down and after I was done being yelled at by their ""supervising"" adult (who was staying on a different floor from their three unsupervised teenage rooms) they decided it would be funny to knock on our door every 15-30 minutes. So for the next three hours we kept being woken constantly by knocking at the door. After 1am I finally got security to come up and try and get it to stop (after several calls). I would not recommend this place to anyone!! Although they have a wonderful view of the arch, the hotel is very old and in extreme disrepair. The elevator system was so whacked that people were waiting upwards of 30 minutes just to get on one to their room. It didn't help that there were unsupervised kids playing games and pressing the buttons to every single floor causing havoc on the elevators. We seriously rode an elevator from floor 15 to the lobby that stopped at EVERY SINGLE floor because someone decided to press every single button. The location was convenient but that's pretty much where the one star comes into effect. If you like drunk and rowdy people, a broken down transport system and an old decrepit room (stocked with your own pet cockroach) this is your place. We literally had the same room service remnants in the hall of our room the entire stay - that's three days with rotting food sitting right by the elevator with no attention paid by staff at all!!! We had to carry all of bags down 12 flights of stairs to check out after waiting for 20 minute and seeing 8 full elevators pass our floor. We checked out early and got flights home early because it was so terrible we couldn't stand another night. Seriously I never thought I could have such a bad stay somewhere but if you want the stay from hell, the crowne plaza is your ideal destination.After looking at some of the negative reviews I didn't know what to expect but after staying here I can't say I had the same experience. I thought the staff was very polite and accommodating. The rooms were basically what you would expect from a hotel and we had a fantastic view of The Arch.The only issue was I prepaid for the room and they asked for my card upon arrival to cover any incidentals if there were any after the stay. When I left the next morning I checked my credit statement and there was a charge for $50 from the hotel and I tried throughout the day to reach someone but they were consistently unavailable and was transferred to a voicemail. I checked the following day and the charge had been removed so not sure what the deal was but was a minor inconvenience that could have been solved with transparency up frontWe made a 2-night reservation for a family weekend in St. Louis on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and requested a crib when making our reservation. We did not have one in our room upon arrival but we're tired and did not want to bother with requesting one that night. The next day we asked for a crib at the front desk and the woman there said she'd send one up right away. It never came. When we took our 3 kids up to the outdoor rooftop poi on the 29th floor we had to wait about 15 minutes for an elevator--they were slow in coming and when they did arrive they were too full for us. Finally we got on one that was going down, rode to the lobby with other guests and then took it up to the 29th floor. When we got to the top floor there was a piece of cardboard with the words POOL and an arrow spray painted pointing us through a stairway to the outdoor pool. When we walked outside I immediately noticed that the entire surrounding area was covered in outdoor carpet that was originally blue (the far outskirts of the area were still blue) but most of it--especially in heavy traffic areas--were black from slimy mildew or algae or whatever grows on chronically wet surfaces. Both of our boys fell just walking between the pool and my chair. Plus little black specks of slime got all over everyone's feet and were, of course, tracked into the pool. The pool water was gross and extremely cold. I did not go in at all and my husband could barely stand being in there with our kids. When we got back to our room we put all the kids in the shower with their suits still on and had them was off with soap. All over the hotel were signs of neglect. It seemed like the hotel had been rather nice at one time, but has not been well maintained in a while. Our toilet was running when we came in the room for the first time and continued running for our entire stay. Our TV remote did not work so we could not watch the TV at all. One of the lamps in our room did not work. The closure door's paint was chipped off noticeably, tiles in the lobby were chipped and missing. Even the woodwork on the front desk was full of scratches and nicks. The only plus is that our room itself was not visibly dirty.Worse hotel I've ever stayed in. Poorly maintained and worn. Peeling ceiling in bathroom. Staff is lackadaisical and has a ""do not care"" attitude.I was sharing the room with two friends. We came back to the room late on our first night to find a note under the door instructing us we had to leave the room due to a sewage backup within the hotel. Need I say more? In addition the note told us the hotel was full and we would have to relocate to a different hotel somewhere in the city! We refused and were then instructed NOT to flush the toilet. We had to use the bathroom located on the 3rd floor. We were on 20.There are no positives. NEVER stay here!Great location... Run down rooms... incompetent staff.. This hotel sucks!First off, I called for a cot before we arrived-- It wasn't in the room. I asked the concierge to please bring one to our room by the time we were ready for bed. We get back from a night on the town, it wasn't there. I call again and here's the response I get-- ""Sir we don't have cots"". Another issue is that you don't have central air in your room's. It was probably 80-85 degrees in our room due to a very mild November here in the Midwest. I was irritated at this point and called down to the front desk again-- ""Sir, it's Fall.. we don't have air conditioning"" So we had to settle for a fan. So the 1 of us had to sleep on the floor in an 80 degree room. I highly recommend you don't stay at this hotel, It absolutely sucks. I was stuck with this place after using Priceline's name your own price. Do not book here!!!!The only reason this hotel gets 2 stars and not 1 is because the concierge suite on the top floor has awesome views of the arch, free happy hour, and free breakfast. It made me feel like a luxe business traveller.Otherwise this place needs some serious help and some serious updating. The rooms are way old, they look like they could belong in the 50s. The AC is seriously old too. The sheets were way too thin and I tended to be too cold at night. They have a smoking floor - what is this Europe? I asked for a wake up call one morning and never got it. And when they gave me my final receipt under my door on my departure day they didn't zero out my balance so I had to go down and get another printed. Seriously, how difficult is this? The Cards were playing three nights in a row when I was there and everyday at the front desk it was pure chaos without enough staff to help everyone check in.Go elsewhere.The hotel was very clean. The staff is very friendly. I reserved our room on Priceline and was a bit nervous to what I would get. My room was spacious. With 2 queen beds. The bathroom was huge. Didn't hear any traffic noise and other guest noise was barely audible. There is valet parking for $20 and plenty of self parking for $10. Room service ends at 11pm. The hotel is within walking distance to the Edward Jones Dome. The bartender Sam was great and chit chatted with all that came to order drinks. The only con to the room was the shower. It's a walk in shower and had 2 shower heads. But the main one didn't work. The hand held shower head can only be pointed to the wall so water doesn't stream out to the bathroom floor.I am an IHG expert.  In the last 18 months I have about 170 IHG hotel nights, many of them in Crowne Plazas.  I am a Platinum Priority Club member so I know what I'm talking about.  I usually give Crowne Plazas four stars but I'm sad to say these folks get three from me.I have many good things to say-* The location is awesome.  It's easy to walk to dozens of restaurants and bars.* This property is almost 30 stories tall. Ask for a room with and Arch view.  You will be OMG completely blown away.* Even better, ask for a room with a balcony.  Can you imagine a balcony view from the 25th floor?  It's incredible!* The staff is wonderfully trained and friendly and competent.  Kudos to the management for their efforts.* There is a pool on the roof and as you might expect the Arch view is stunning.  In season, it doesn't get much better than enjoying the pool and the view with a cooler of adult libations.I know you can hear the ""but"" coming and here it is-* This property is tired.  It's old.  It's clear that it  is has had a remodel but it is not up to Crowne Plaza standards.* The rooms are spotless and huge but were designed decades ago.  That has consequences.  See the next bullet.* The bathrooms are tiny.  No, that's inaccurate, they're minuscule!  I could stretch my arms out one way and touch both walls.  Stretch the other way and I could touch the wall and the shower.  If you were sharing this room with your significant other it would be almost impossible.So would I stay here again?  Yes but it's a seasonal recommendation.  In warm weather the balconies and roof top pool are killer.  I'd stay here in a heartbeat.  In the colder months I'd look elsewhere.After reading the reviews for this place i was a little skeptical about our stay, but found myself to be pleasantly surprised.  The view of the Arch and the old courthouse from our window and balcony was amazing.  The location is within walking distance to a bunch to the Arch, even with the construction going on, the Cardinals stadium and many other attractions.  Also not too far from some great food. The hotel is in need of some updates, I mean the burnt orange carpet is just hideous and the public style toilets was a little wierd, but overall we found the hotel to be clean. One BIG upside was the friendly and accommodating staff. I can't say that we were very needy on this trip, but every interaction in the lobby and even riding the elevators was a pleasant one.One reason I am giving the hotel 4 stars is because the wifi would not work on my laptop or cell phone, but somehow worked on my tablet? The website never popped up to allow me to sign in. We were here on pleasure, so this did not bother me too much.Another reason is there was no furniture on the balconies, I mean a couple lawn chairs and an end table would suffice.My husband and I were very pleased with our stay and would stay here again in the future.Looking at the reviews for Crowne Plaza, I was really expecting the worst. But maybe that's how all good experiences start, by having low expectations. So I was downtown looking for a place to stay, calling around for the best price for the night. (You would think that hotels would lower the price just to sell a room for the night, right??) Well, when we called Crowne Plaza, they were polite and courteous, answering all of the questions.When we finally got there, Sharhonda is amazing and helped us out. She made the experience easy and fun. We got a room for the night overlooking the arc in all it's glory and beauty. It definitely made my last night in Downtown Saint Louis the best it could have been! The room was large (2 beds) &amp; clean, and although the sheets felt a bit starchy it was comfortable enough.Reserved and pre-paid for a non-smoking king suite. Upon arriving at the room found used and broken cigarette butt in the middle of the bedroom doorway. Waited over 15 minutes at the front to speak with the manager on-duty. The room smelled like smoke. Room decor was extremely outdated and sad. Elevators extremely slow. Really really really disappointed. Won't stay there again.Staff was courteous but man this hotel was filthy. Not only were there spiderwebs above the beds but the rug was filled with critter nests in every corner. Sheets were stained with God know what. We told the front desk after our first night and they tries their best but they can only do so much when the hotel is falling apart slowly but surely.Long story short: Long wait, ugly rooms and at least one bed bug. Full review belowSo, I wanted to like this hotel. It's in a great location, and I was there for a wedding. I should have known the stay would be rocky the minute I pulled in the parking garage. They have about four spots in front to park and check in. This is for a huge hotel. So, I decided to just pull into the garage. It is the worst parking garage I have ever been in. The directions make no sense. It was dirty. It was mysteriously wet. There was insulation falling from pipes. It was so bad that we decided to just valet the other two times we had to park. That was strike one. Strike two was the 45 minute wait to check in. Now, it was a busy weekend. The hotel was fully booked. But 45 minutes?! There was no order, no line, no ropes to help guide the crowds. So there was just a mob mad rushing to get to the counter when a place opened. Luckily, I got there early enough that I wasn't late for the rehearsal. I've stayed in hotels in LA, Chicago, New York, and every place in between. I've never had a wait like that to check in. So after the 45 minute wait to check in came the 8 minute wait for an elevator (At this point I was staring at my clock, so I knew how long it took). The place is 28 stories. They have six elevators. All of them are slow. All of them go to all the floors. I don't mind a brief wait. I work in a skyscraper in Chicago. But good lord. Ever time we left our room we had to budget time to wait for the elevators. Then the room itself was.... OK. It was dated. The bed was fine, the chairs were awful. It was a weird layout, but whatever. They're claiming to be updating, but I didn't see much work being done.The final nail in their coffin was the picture my friend, who stayed on a different floor, sent me today. It was the stack of paperwork she was doing in her room Saturday morning, complete with a bed bug. Gross. I checked my room when we got there, and I'm confident I didn't. I will say the staff was very, very friendly.I was very disappointed with my stay at Crowne Plaza downtown. From the moment we arrived it was an unpleasant experience. The valet was extremely rude, then when I went to the front desk the only room they had ready was handicap assessable. Which isn't a big deal however my check in time was at 3pm and I arrived at 4. When we finally got to the room. Half the light switches did nothing. And a few towels had stains on them.When we got back to the room that night to sleep it was freezing. I have the ""heater control"" if you can call it that, at the warmest it will go and I don't think it did anything. So I called the front desk, took me 3 try's to get someone to answer. I told them that our room was freezing and I wanted some more blankets. All they said was ""sure they will be right up"". Not once was there any question of ""is the heater not working"" or any apologetic ""I'm sorry to hear that, is there anything else we can do"" I was very upset with my stay at Crowne Plaza and I would not recommend to anyone.Stay away from this place!I unfortunately booked this place with too much confidence in the Crown Plaza name. I spent a terrible 3 nights here and found myself toying with the idea of checking in at the Hyatt next door every night as my my window faced their hotel and I could see how much nicer they had it. I started my tormented stay here by being introduced to the hideously confusing and dangerous establishment they called their parking garage. After figuring out the poorly signed ups and downs of this garage, I parked my car and entered the hotel lobby. I finally checked into the hotel after my tiring journey and waited 10 minutes to get to my room on the 17th floor. The hallways were filled with trash and room service remains from the morning.  After attempting to open the hotel room door I realized that my room keys weren't activated. I called the lobby and they asked be to come back down for reactivation.  I waited another 7 minutes for the elevator and once I was in the lobby I had to wait on line for 30 minutes until they got to me.  The keys worked on the second round.  At this point I had already been at the hotel for over an hour and had just gotten the chance to enter my room....I was at least expecting a decent room. Instead my room looked like it had been rotting from the inside.  I was greeted by old, disgusting carpet,  poor thread count bed sheets with stains and holes in them, a dirty grimy tub, a super tiny closet with NO ironing board or suitcase stand, and the most ancient AC system I have ever seen. The only saving grace was my view of the arch. I took a little nap on the corner of the bed where there was no staining on the sheets.  I woke up freezing several times bc the AC unit would not adjust. I then decided to run an errand and found myself in their maze of a parking garage once more.  Upon trying to exit the garage , the garage teller told me that the front desk has to give me a stamp on my ticket in order for me to be able to exit without having to pay for the garage. I was super annoyed that the front desk didn't tell me this during my one hour check in drama. I distinctly remember mentioning that I parked my car. The teller informed me that this situation happens a lot with the guests of the Crown Plaza.  At this point I didn't care. I payed the extra fee and made sure to get my ticket stamped thereafter.This hotel was a glorified motel. The halls were always dirty, the carpets old, and the service terrible.  I will never stay at another crown plaza again. It is obvious to me that they do not abide by standards. Even a Holiday Inn is more of a predictable choice.I was expecting something decent. I can barely shut my eyes I am so against sleeping here. The walls, floors, and everything in between are filth. There was only one hand towel left in our room, no shower towels or wash cloths! I would like to add we have been on a road trip for a week, stayed in 1-Star up to 5-Star hotels and motels and I wish we were sleeping in the car tonight. This building is THAT filthy.First, I sincerely hate when room service trays are left in the hallway for hours on end. That's why there are bugs! Even the doorway in our room looks like it has never had a vacuum run over it. Dust and dirt piled, PILED in the corner. Ew. I can also smell the must from the carpet. Same review about the bathroom as other yelpers. Tinier than a closet, the fan is caked with dust and mold, the tub is dirty. I sincerely wish I had brought a bottle of bleach. Actually, just wish I had stayed somewhere else. Don't stay here!","Unless you are booking a reward night (and even then consider saving your points for another time), don't bother. Quite dated. Also double charged me. Positives:  location walking distance to ArchNegatives: everything elseWill never go back. Horrible experience.  They tell you one thing &amp; then say another.  Room was blah &amp; everything was old style not updated. The lobby area was only area I thought was nice. Carpet in room  seemed gross. A/C didn't work. Engineering had to come &amp; fix &amp; it still sucked. They told us when we checked in free breakfast included but when we went to go eat they then saif not free. Just a horrible experience &amp; won't go back.This was, by far and away, start-to-finish, the worst hotel experience I have ever had to endure.First of all, I was the best man at my friend's wedding this weekend; the couple set aside 20 rooms for the wedding 4 months in advance at a discounted price. The hotel lost the groomsmen's room reservation and we weren't made aware until 2 days before the wedding. On top of that; they had no open rooms for us and we were asked to pay almost double the group price for a room that was worse than the one we'd originally reserved. I had a long conversation with the person making my reservation about downtown St. Louis and whether or not we'd have an Arch-view room. I get finished overpaying and the reservation is for the Crowne Plaza in Costa Mesa, CA, approximately 1,800 miles west of the correct hotel. I call up to the Crowne in downtown St. Louis and the woman hangs up on me! At this point I was livid. I had to call the hotel repeatedly and finally got a hold of the woman with the reservation department who helped me cancel the bad reservation and set up the appropriate reservation in St. Louis for over $100 more than the discounted price we were supposed to receive for being part of the wedding party.They lost the Newlywed's reservation! Seriously! They lost the reservation for the couple that helped them book about 20 rooms for a weekend. They ended up upgrading them for the trouble but the rooms were an even more ridiculous issue. (See paragraphs below)The flower girl almost missed the wedding entirely because her mother's car was locked in the garage and the hotel would not validate her parking until her ""room was finalized."" The groom's aunt had to take a $50 round-trip cab ride from the wedding hall to the Crowne to pick up the flower girl and go back. Her mother missed her daughter being in the wedding entirely. The hotel offered nothing to make this right.The towels were left over from the the previous people because they were still dirty with make-up and what I can only hope was snot. The shower had a leak that never stopped and just dripped all night long! There was some red, blood-like substance on the wall that was not cleaned up. There was a spider that had been smashed into the wall but not scraped off. It was probably the same spider who had built the elaborate webs in every corner of the ceiling. There were beetles in the bathtub that ran into the bedroom and disappeared under the beds within 5 minutes of checking in.We took pictures of this nonsense. I have never been so appalled at the condition of a hotel. I could have gotten over the awful wallpaper that hasn't been changed since WW2. I could have gotten past the fact that the bathroom looked like one from the basement in my high school. But you lost the room reservations for the bride, the groom, and the groomsmen. You made me pay $210 for a room that was negotiated for a price of $110. You put me in a filthy hotel room with the groom the night before the wedding and never found my ""missing"" hotel room for the night of the wedding. I had to book a different hotel and move all my stuff amid the craziness of the wedding day. There are literally no excuses that a hotel could possibly make. I was downgraded from a suite to a double queen room and paid $100 more than the agreed-upon price and the hotel didn't even try to acknowledge what had happened. They offered no recompense for all of the costly errors and disgusting conditions of the rooms.I will literally never ever ever stay here again. I will never recommend it to anyone. I will never stay at another Crowne Plaza location. And whenever anyone asks about hotels in St. Louis, I will make sure they know what happened at the downtown Crowne location so they never stay there either.My name is Luke and I stayed in Room 1817 on Friday night, 8/14.Like many others, I had a sub-optimal experience here for 3 nights. Upon check-in, they confirmed my 3 night stay in a non-smoking room &amp; then proceeded to tell me there were no non-smoking rooms left. Staying in a smoking room is torture for a non-smoker. I kept my clothes in my luggage with the hope they wouldn't all be contaminated (fat chance). You'd think they'd give me a nice room to make up for the inconvenience, right? Well you'd be wrong - I could barely squeeze between the bed and the dresser, and I'm not a large person. I did switch to a non-smoking (larger) room the next day. They weren't apologetic about the hassle.This place is in serious need of an overhaul. You can't control the temp. in your room - it's controlled centrally for the entire hotel. Too hot? Too bad. Too cold? Put on every piece of clothing you brought with you. And then we have the rest of the ""WTF"" items: single paned windows mean lots of street noise, water damage on the ceiling where the acoustic material is discolored and falling off, a closet with 2 hangers, a missing hairdryer, a missing iron, a shower that doesn't work. Now those weren't all in my room, but compiled from the comments of others I was with. But it gives you an overall picture of the care &amp; maintenance, or lack thereof, of the place.I won't even go on to describe the food other than to call it virtually inedible. Don't eat here.The upside (yes, there are a few): close to the arch, views of the arch from some rooms, convenient to Busch stadium for Cardinals games, and within easy walking distance of lots of restaurant choices.To sum it all up: stay somewhere else.IHG properties are usually well kept. My room had an amazing view of the arch, but inside the room i was missing my desk chair, had wall paper falling down and paint chips. Definitely time to renovate. (Frequent travel with IHG, 100 nights a year)Girl comes back to the bar after getting punched In her face by her boyfriend. She is vocal about what happens, Security does nothing. Although I always stay here someone should say out loud that the almighty dollar should take a back seat to domestic violence.Overview: Spent almost $500 on two nights to stay in a downtown location with a pool (roof top). -Rained during our entire stay so we couldn't use the pool (understandably) but could also not use the t.v. since they rely on a satellite for service. Also, to order a kid's movie cost $17. Remote control for t.v. did not work. -Our room had large stains on the floor, stains on the bathroom wall, and had a broken door for the balcony, so we couldn't go out. We did have a nice view of the Arch.-The bathroom was tiny, just enough room for one person to turn around, and the hair dryer was broken. There was an extra one in the room, but it took up what little counter space was available. -The wifi doesn't work so don't count on using it while you're there. -If you call the front desk, expect to be put on hold for half an hour and shuttled around from person to person during your call. -Some of the buttons on the elevators don't work so you have to switch elevators to get to the correct floor. -The heating element in the room doesn't actually heat the room. We were there during a cold, rainy weekend and the room was damp and cold. The staff is nice but it certainly didn't make up for the overpriced dump of a room we were given. I've stayed in motels nicer than this. Do yourself a favor and choose one of the other downtown hotels. I wish we had.One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at.  Dirty. Smells bad. Bizarre room layout.  Old and broken furniture.  Awful food.  Scary parking garage. Stay away.  This place should be closed and completely redone.I've stayed at many Crowne Plaza Hotels in my line of work. When it came time to plan a weekend get away to St. Louis I decided to book this hotel via Priceline.   Upon arrival into St Louis we called requesting to be picked up from the Amtrak station and were told that the hotel does not offer any shuttle service (despite having a picture of one on its website). We decide to hop in a cab. We were given a warm welcome and to our surprise upgraded to a superior room.  The excitement quickly came to an end upon walking off of the elevator on to the 11th floor.  The hallways were dark, dirty and dated. Upon entering our room, the age of the hotel was truly revealed. The suite was in need of serious updating.  From the carpet, painting, furniture and decor. Everything was dated including the forced heating/air conditioning. The closet doors appeared to be the original doors.   While I did not take photos as many others have, I can attest that my suite resembled those of others.I did have a great view of The Arc however!This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. My group and I get there at 3:30 to check in (check-in is at 3) and they tell me the rooms aren't ready, I decided to just wait in the lobby until everything was in order. 5:30 finally rolls around and we got one room. The second room wasn't ready until almost 7:00. Check out is at noon.. The second room had a beautiful view of the arch. It also had a mini fridge which the 1st room did not have (same price for both rooms mind you). Unfortunately the air conditioner did not work and the lock for the door malfunctioned forcing us to have to get new cards for our room everytime we needed back in. This next part isn't exactly the hotel's fault but it added to the ""wonderful"" stay we had. Lucky for my group and I we got  what seemed like a whole fraternity in the room next to one of ours. They enjoyed playing soccer inside and slamming against the wall. And lastly we left early one morning during our 3 night stay to go to six flags. When we got back much later that evening room service did us a favor by leaving the  door open to our room. Saving us a trip down stairs to get new cards I suppose.I would not recommend this hotel.. just saying. Put a irritating damper on my brother's 21st birthday celebration.Friendly staff at check in.  Good location. Our room was huge!!! 1709. Had a nice view of the Arch. No thermostat controls and our room was very hot    Got the room on Priceline for $57 so can't complain much. Would definitely stay here againI give this hotel three stars...location is fantastic can't beat the views of the arch and the river.  The price is good for a downtown hotel and the rooms are spacious and that's a big plus, considering I'm from Chicago and you spend almost twice as much for a downtown postage stamp size room.  The reason it doesn't get more stars, the hotel is old and need some cosmetic touch ups.  The curtains in our room are ripped...and the toilet needs a new seat....yes a new TOILET SEAT.  For a weekend stay visiting family, or catching a Cardinals game can't beat it..but it needs work.I wasn't a huge fan of this place. It wasn't the worst hotel I have stayed at. The rooms were clean and the TV was very nice. The balcony was big, but very bare. There wasn't even any places to sit, but the view of the Arch was one of the best I have seen. The pool was about the size of a bath tub, perhaps a little smaller. Even though it was on the roof, which is cool, there was no room to move and only about 3 people could fit in there and forget about having your own space or being comfortable.I come out to visit the city of St. Louis and I now know to never stay at this hotel again.Service was very slow. The amenities were very very basic for this being in the down town area. I asked if there was a gift shop and the response was the only one is blocks away. The only reason i will rate it 2 stars is because if your lucky enough for a balcony. The view of the arch is awesome.I don't write a lot of reviews for hotels, but my experience has been so bad that I just have to warn people. I stayed here on a business trip in Jan. 2014. It's an average hotel. Nothing great / nothing horrible (except the heat in the rooms was really loud and either full blast or not working at all, but whatever, right? Not worth complaining about.)... or so I thought.On Friday March 28, 2014 at 11am my credit card was fraudulently charged for a second visit while I was home in MA. I called the hotel and asked to speak to the manager (who was unavailable), so I left a voicemail. The hotel has not bothered to respond to me. I am working with my bank to dispute the charge. I've had to cancel my debit card, I have to update my payment info in a bunch of places... this is really annoying! I'm just glad I regularly check my bank account and found the bogus charge. This is almost definitely someone at the hotel stealing credit card info; either to let a friend stay for free or to run some kind of refund scam. The fact that the manager hasn't responded means they aren't taking this seriously or they might even be involved. I wouldn't be surprised to find out I'm not the only one who's been stolen from!IF YOU'VE STAYED HERE IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON YOUR BANK STATEMENTS!Decent hotel in a great downtown location. I really don't have a lot to say about it because I didn't spend a lot of time in it. I will say these few things though:1. That parking lot is kind of scary. I was expecting someone in a hoodie and ski mask, holding a hatchet to appear at any moment. 2. That bed was pretty comfy. 3. I didn't expect a whole lot of frills but uhhh, a mini fridge would have been nice. Some rooms have them, some don't. I can't for the life of me figure out why any of them wouldn't. I get to sleep in this comfy king sized bed, but I have to sip room temp water? If I was expecting to spend a lot of time in my room, I don't know if I'd  choose the Crowne. But for easy access to downtown, a place to lay your head at night, and a decent bar area, this place isn't too shabby.Nice downtown hotel &amp; centrally located. My room was very clean and the lounge is beautiful. One downside was that my room had no thermostat...when I travel I do like having my room around 60. If I had stayed more than one night it may have angered me more than it did.Wow. I have way higher expectations for a Crowne Plaza. The other reviews really hit the nail on the head. This hotel is in desperate need of an update. The bathroom in our room was awful... granite countertops could not hide the awful black-mildew covered time around the bathtub. Ugh. The room was clean enough (thank heavens) but so outdated. We were definitely disappointed. We did ask for a room with temperature control and got that thanks to the girl at the front desk. Wouldn't stay here again unless the hotel gets a major overhaul.I am not one who likes to throw disrespect to businesses for that is how their employees earn the money. My bothers and I came down to St. Louis for some family business and catch a Sox n Cards game. I being the Red Sox fan was happy but a cloud tried it's best to mess up our 3 day stay @the plaza. After parking the car in a paid lot then checking in went to our room which was clean. We relaxed for a few then went to get a bite to eat came back to the room to relax. Next morning we go to the car only to find we were robbed security came police rode up on a bicycle. The Plaza did little to help they didn't even make the necessary calls nor did they seem to care. I take it they didn't want to alarm their customers that were checking in. This hotel is the worst place an outer towners to stay. Criminals target out of state vehicles and the hotel and parking lot owner must been friends with the thieves. I will not tell not to stay here but I will tell you if you do borrow some Missouri plates so the thieves don't target your car in a paid lot adjoint to the Plaza. The housekeepers never came to make our beds or clean the room. They should rename it Crowne Plaza Motel sorry motels cause this place doesn't deserve to be in business. One and only good thing is it is within walking distance to both stadiums.My guess is they get there business on convenience and location.  The rooms are small and awkward, they offer no breakfast, and parking is a mess.  The view is stellar though.  At least from my room","I have stayed at this location once before and am still kicking myself for making such a bad decision. Waited 30 minutes for someone to valet my car upon check in. There were others waiting as well and it's like the guy just disappears every now and then. Staff didn't even know when I asked the front desk but they really didn't care. Messed up my reservation and tried giving me a crappy room without deducting the extra I paid for a suite. Tried to find someone again to get my bag that the airline dropped off. Waited almost 1/2 hour for that as the bell mans excuse was he was parking cars. There was also several rooms with breakfast crap outside of their doors upon going to my room at 6:00pm. Sadly, this crap still existed the next morning (24 hours later). The room service food was crappy. Suggest going to the Irish pub right down the street (Tigin Irish Pub) only a 5 minute walk or Tony's Italian which is another good place. Liked Tigrin better with the live entertainment and good bar food. Another thing with the crown, my patio door don't lock no matter how much I try. The bed was cozy but the so called suite was outdated and worn. Careful not to get stuck in the bathroom as it's very, very, very small.Also had a worker walk right in two hours after I checked in. She never even knocked and just stood their when I said someone is in here and then approached her. Seemed a little fishy to me. Planning on scanning my belongings??Bottom line, I am convinced the Crown Plaza is a crap hole. Had similar issues with two other Crowns in WI. I am done with Crown Plaza's! They are all crap holes!!When I first checked into this hotel I was already disappointed. I was given a room that wasn't clean, the service and staff there needs more training on how to do there job and be professional. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone that is staying more than a 2 days. I was more concerned with the lack of cameras that's in the hotel more than anything. I can name a list of problems until I checked out. Never again. The only thing nice about this hotel is the lobby otherwise than that don't even waste your money.Booked a group of 10, relatively easy. Stayed Oct 20 for one night. The check-in was a nightmare. Apparently the first time the front desk team handled 5 rooms, 10 people? They couldn't get the process right within the property management system, issued keys to the same room for half of our group, and confused themselves on the credit card processing/billing (more to come on this later).Staff did not know the public transportation schedule/options to the airport. (Really?) When I asked about how to arrange transportation, two staff answered ""not sure."" Had to look it up myself. Received bank statement, found that they charged me twice for the same room. Called hotel three times. The operator transferred me to the ""Manager-on-duty voicemail"". You've got to be kidding!!! The voice mail stated they would call me back by the end of the current day. I called three days in a row and have yet to receive a returned phone call!!!!! Called the GM. No surprise, voicemail, no returned call.This is by far the worse guest response I have encountered. Avoid this hotel, they don't know how to run the basics.So, we called to make sure our sweet would be ready for us. We requested a room with an arch view and a crib and sheets and blanket for the pullout bed. All were confirmed to be waiting for our arrival. None of which we got without a room change and two calls to the front desk. Not to mention the urine decorated toilet seat, left up, after the room cleaning. Don't even get me started on how long it took us to get our car out of the garage.I was here for a few days for a conference. I wasn't expecting much as a college student. And i know there was a lot of us there too. But the customer service was very poor. Whether is was an attitude, or the fact that they took our towels and never replaced them and the AC didn't work in our room and the internet barely worked. And overall the rooms weren't that great.My friends and I came here for Cardinals game and this hotel was within walking distance. I was a nice hotel. I would come here again when I am in town.The hotel isn't in a bad location, but I definitely had a less than pleasant experience, and I'm pretty sure it wasn't an isolated experience.My biggest complaint has to be other guests.  I understand that the hotel can't control who is staying at their hotel, and I get that if you can pay the hotel rates you should be able to stay there, but there should be some limits.  I was at the hotel for a wedding, but the wedding block was spread out and I got stuck on a floor of drunk teenagers.  A drunk man tried to break into my room at 2 am, swore at me through the door when I told him that he was at the wrong room and I had to have security to make sure he didn't actually get in my room.  However, instead of putting him in the right room and asking his friends to shut down their party, security simply told him to stay away from my room.  Never mind the fact that after he tried to break in I actually wanted to be able to sleep peacefully.The hotel parking garage needs complete reconstruction.  It's very confusing, not easy to navigate and the further down you go the less safe it becomes.  I think part of the problem is that the Crowne Plaza shares the garage with another business, but there's got to be a better way to straighten out the parking.The view of the Arch was the best feature of the room, but if I were to stay downtown again I would definitely consider a different hotel.I see a lot of negative reviews on here, but I just stayed at this hotel recently after getting a good deal on Priceline and had a great experience. All of the employees I came into contact with were extremely helpful and provided great customer service. My room was also spotless when I arrived. Based on my experience, I'd recommend this hotel!Terrible stay! We left a day early. Pool dirty and small, whole hotel dirty, room smelled like mildew. We will never go back. Messed up 4 of 5 room service orders. Parking garage is sketchy. Don't try to go right to the restaurant, just terrible.This place was terrible. When we got back to the room after a long exhausting day there were no towels in the room. It looked like housekeeping started cleaning the room and quit. The beds were not finished being made. They were started but not finished. We called to get more blankets and towels. We were told that they ran out of blankets and we did get towels. we got five, asked for three. Was told that they run out of towels. Sounded like it was a common occurrence. We did valet parking since we were so tired. It took over twenty minutes to get my car. I heard different reasons. It takes that long, your car didn't get in the system properly. We did get the cost of the valet parking taken off due to the housekeeping issue. That was ironic since then parking was also a problem. Also getting an elevator was a problem. Wound up passing up four elevators before deciding to take one up to go down. It took forty minutes to get out of there and therefore I missed part of my conference. Would not recommend unless you like to be frustrated.Really disappointed in our stay here this weekend.  First of all there were no thermostats, just two outdated vents that you could not turn off.  If I had to guess, I'd say our room was about 85 degrees, and opening the windows did not do a lick of good because we were on the 22nd floor.  Without the door open there's no air flow at all.  All they could manage was to bring us a fan which was barely enough to get us through the night, which is all we were staying or else I would have made them give us a new room.When I was checking out, I told the woman at the front desk about how hot it was and she made no effort to compensate us for our discomfort, in fact the next words out of her mouth were ""It looks like you have a $10 charge for parking.""  I will not stay here again, and I wish I would have checked the reviews before making my reservation.I should have read the reviews before booking this instead of trusting the crowne plaza name.First, the good: The room itself was nice with a great view, unfortunately the balcony was completely barren. I guess I was lucky to be in a recently renovated one (2306). You'll get the same view in the neighboring hotels, so that's not really a selling point.Some of the staff, including the manager, are very nice.Now the bad: I booked the room for 3 people in a room with one king bed and one sofa bed weeks in advance. (They charge extra for people after 2 guests, bear that in mind for later)When I drove in, I was left to wonder where to park my car. Finally, I was told to go around the block to get in through an other entrance which brought me back to the original parking lot. Go figure! Directions in the parking lot are nowhere to be found and very confusing. The garage is badly lit and disgusting stuff is dangling from the pipes along the ceiling. Creepy! There is no elevator in the 6 level garage, so if you haven't dropped off your luggage, you'll have to haul it on the ramps where cars are going up and down.There was only 1 towel set in the room, so we had to request 2 more.The sofa bed wasn't made and there was no linens for it in the room, so I had to call the front desk/housekeeping again. Reaching anyone at either desk took forever. It'll just keep ringing. Wait for it. When you get someone to finally pick up, don't expect a greeting. I had to talk to someone 3 times to get linens. The third time, I asked how long it'd take since I was waiting to go to bed and it had been over 30 minutes since the last call that was answered. I was told in a very unpleasant way that I was the 6th person in line for house keeping duty! It was after 11pm!!!When the linens came (probably took a solid hour since the first call), I wasn't offered for the bed to be made, I was just dumped sheets that weren't ironed and a blanket - I closed my eyes hoping that they were clean ones... Fine, I was gonna make my bed myself anyways, since 2 of us were already sleeping and I was in my PJs, but I'd like at least to be asked... No sorry, no nothing.If you know 3 people are checking in, please be prepared to receive 3 people in the room!Also, the wifi connection just doesn't work, or is so slow that you can forget about it. I saw a flyer next to the tv cabinet advertising hi speed internet on the tv. Yeah right, as if streaming is going to work when I can't even connect my phone and read emails.One more complaint: the elevator system desperately needs upgrade for this 29-storied building. The wait time can be very long because of it, with a messy flock of people in the lobby getting aggravated... Splitting the elevators between those servicing the higher or lower floors could be helpful...Bottom line: look elsewhere, don't go there! You've been warned.And that's how my first yelp review goes down. It took a terrible place like this to get me worked up enough to write one.I'll give two stars because of the great view and location. Otherwise this hotel leaves much to be desired. The decor is old and dated. The paint is chipping.  The carpet was stained and dirty. My white socks were grey after walking around the room. The worst part was the bathroom. The shower was marginal and had minimal pressure. There was a vent over the shower with mold literally hanging out of it in clumps. Disgusting!! The sink in the bathroom would not drain. Parking was a nightmare in an old confusing filthy parking structure attached to the hotel. Despite the fact the we parked ourselves, we found a ten dollar valet parking charge on our bill, which we had to go to the desk to have removed. The TV was nice and modern, but it was tucked into a corner of the room and there was no place to sit and watch it. Overall- not someplace that I would ever stay again.Let me start off by saying that I have stayed a several Crowne Plazas and have enjoyed the experiences, but when my wife and I used priceline and got this place as an express deal for 45/ a night i should have known. There is NO WAY this place is a 3 1/2 star hotel its more like a 2 star. The hotel staff is very nice but the rooms were in such need of a makeover. We found what looked like blood spots over the wall, mold in the bathroom and a thermostat that didn't work. Oh and i forgot to mention the first night, no sleep at all. People slamming doors and partying all night long. Reminded me of 15 years ago in a frat house when i was a student. Called security twice with no solution, The next morning i asked to move rooms. The manager in the morning said she would call me when the room was ready for us to move.... you guessed it no call. when we got back from our day out we were given a room on a higher floor with an arch view but same issue, slamming doors all night, broken thermostat and dirty room. We ended up leaving a day early and just ate the last night on our bill. This place was way below our expectations for the crowne plaza name. Don't waste time or money staying at this place. Going to contact the GM and have this resolved..... VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!We got a great deal on priceline for the Crowne Plaza, so we left the toddler with Grandma and Grandpa and went out for a last pre-baby adventure.  The room was huge, but the heater/ac did not work and because we were in a Priceline room, they would not move us.  Finally after having to let his inner Papa Bear come out, they moved us to a room with working a/c.  Once I landed in the oh-so-comfy king sized bed, I was out like a light.  I would have given it four stars had they not given us so much grief over using priceline.  That was the biggest bummer for me.This is the second time I have been here, very enjoyable. People are friendly. Rooms are nice. Will be back again. Great bar. And bartender. I give Restaurant (Union Grill) 3.5 Stars. Food was decent.Pros:Great location. We walked to good restaurants (within 10 blocks)View of the arch.Big rooms.Cons:Air conditioner was weird.Housekeeping seemed confused about any request.We could hear everything in the hallway.The front desk did not know about their shuttle that was supposed to take us to the wedding. The parking garage was a disgusting maze with water leaking everywhere. The floor in our room was dirty. After a shower my feet were visibly dirty within a half hour. The bathroom was tiny.  The counter space was so small, I feared dropping things in the toilet. When I put the toilet seat lid down condensation built up and then dripped all over the seat when put back up. You had to put the lid down in order to flush the toilet. No conditioner. $2 for hot water and a tea bag. What happened to continental breakfasts?I stayed at this hotel for a wedding recently. The location of this hotel is great -- right in the heart of St. Louis and you can walk to both Busch Stadium and the dome where the Rams play. You can see the Arch from some views. The bedroom area itself was of good quality. What I didn't care for was the quality of the bathroom. The bathroom is very small and the handles to flush the toilet are like those from a public bathroom, which I absolutely hate.A few other negatives: The lobby seemed to be very crowded, like fire code violation crowded. Taking the elevator to a room is annoying, as the elevators run slow and you often have to wait to take the next lift since the first one is already full of people. It's very annoying to take a crowded elevator that stops at every floor only for the person who was waiting on it to be unable to get on it due to capacity.  For a hotel with something like six elevators, the service should be quicker and better.Lastly, the parking garage situation is rough in a lot of ways.I admit I tend to dwell on the negative aspects. There are worse hotels, but I don't know if this one is good for the cost.Stayed here on 8-31-14 after attending Card /Cub game..room was not available before the game as promised so I asked to use upstairs Lobby restroom  to wash my <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhands.It&amp;s=f8c232eb82e3373fe7288c3694efd07d41cc2df103d5cd005394f000c4f0df0e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hands.It</a> was being cleaned and even though someone was in a stall the housekeeper snarled at me for asking to wash my hands.  Nice customer service. They stored our luggage and preregistered us so we only needed to show our ID to get the room ..only 1 evening attendant at the desk..I waited 2nd in line..and older couple rudely butted in front of me and another desk clerk came to help them instead of me..my husband was told that THEY were  first..I assured them they were not..there was NO apology making us wait..again..the day staff in the front desk was  OK ..the evening..awful. The bellman was very good and took bags to our room.The only bartender moved like a snail with MANY patrons waiting for a drink. We went  down to the Hyatt where they know how to hire a bartender that knows how to move and serve a crowd. They should staff accordingly ..knowing when the Cubs are in town there will be MANY people willing to spend money. Bad management.The room was OK..on floor 15..one coffee packet for a double occupancy however. The toilet tissue dispenser was broken..so the roll had  to be up on the small sink where it got wet..really tacky in my opinion and it would have been an easy fix.The whole place could  use remodeling..carpet is nasty and it has an odor.  Maybe they need to watch a couple episodes of HOTEL IMPOSSIBLE to get some guidance.I think the staff of this hotel  needs some serious education  about the hospitality business,as there are MANY other choices in the area..We stayed at the  Hyatt the night before and sorry we left there to stay here. From the other reviews it seems this is their standardBeautiful hotel.  We our room was clean and prepared to our liking but the view, well, where else can you view the arch up so close.  Definitely have to work on the food though.  We didnt finish even though we were starving.  We had a sandwich and a salad, which had wilty rotty veggies, terrible :(","I stayed at this hotel Oct 28-Nov 3 2013 and on the last evening I found TWO roaches in the bed. This was on the 25th floor and I had a friend staying on the 4th floor who also had the same problem. The hotel did remove one night off the bill and the complaint seemed the norm. This hotel is in a great location but needs serious upgrading and a full fumigation.I stayed here a few weeks ago.  I had stayed here before and it was fine.  But this trip was pretty bad.  We needed a cheap box fan to stay cool, house keeping didn't clean our room or bathroom, I had to call down twice for towels, when the room was cleaned, they forgot to leave towels.  I called housekeeping and management but no one called back.   The toilet had to be flushed 4 or 5 times to empty.  Pretty sure we won't be back.This place is a dump, and may have the slowest workers I have ever seen. Everything about this place was disappointing. It started with arriving during a huge traffic jam as the cardinals game was getting let out. Yes this was not the hotels fault, but it forced me to use the Valet witch took 35 min to come get my car. Only one other car was ahead of me.  Then when I finally got into the lobby I was greeted by several other unhappy customers.  The wait to Check in was 45 min. Once again there was only a few people ahead of me.   I decided to stay hear since it had great views of the arch and the rest of the city. I called several months In advance to book a room with a balcony that faced the arch with a king bed. Of course they gave me a Room without a balcony and Faced away from the arch and had 2 full size beds.  When i called  the front desk to ask if i could be moved she told me there was nothing she could Do and hung up on me.  On top of it all the a/c did not work,  several bulbs were burnt out, the rooms were outdated, dirty, and smelled. The next morning the slow workers continued to disappoint me by taking over an hour to pull my truck up from the valet.    I was so disappointed with my stay that I decided to write and email to cooperate crown plaza asking for a partial refund.  Keep in mind that I am the type of person that never complains and have never done anything like this before.   Even they were slow to get back to me. After 3.5 weeks I received an email that basically said they were sorry for my negative experience. No compensation or discount.  Never again will I stay at another crown plaza hotel.This is by far one of the WORST hotels I've ever stayed in. When I arrived at 6pm after already requesting a single king size bed for me and my partner we opened the room to find that it had not been cleaned and there were 2 twin beds side by side. I went down to the lobby and the person at the front desk said there were no more rooms available. When I told him that I was traveling with a certain touring company... All of a sudden a room appeared. The towels in the room were stained, the air conditioning was barely coming out. This hotel looks like dump. It's old and not taken care of. Since I'm not from here I asked for directions and NO ONE that worked there seemed to know ANYTHING that was around their own place of business. The staff that I encountered were rude and unprofessional. Right down to the housekeeper that basically got mad that she had to clean my room ( which is her job) and by clean all I needed were towels and my bed made. All of the employees take smoke breaks in the parking garage making the hotel look and smell like a trashy bar. I've worked in hospitality before so I know what GOOD service is and I know how to handle hi volume. This hotel and its staff need a good attitude adjustment and face lift. You can guarantee that my company will NEVER stay here again and I will make sure that other touring companies know about this place. Boo.....!!!!Great hotel, really close to everything St. Louis has to offer, nice big bar with TV's huge workout room. Love that its like as soon as you drive into St. Louis, you are in the hotel. Parking could use some work, maybe a parking garage reno? Seems like it was developed for a smaller hotel. Stayed with a wedding group so no idea what the actual rates are.Ugh. This will be my last visit to any Crowne Plaza. They all are like this one.The lobby is deceiving - it's nice and looks like the hotel would be a good place to stay. The hallways and the rooms are old and dingy. The decor is dated, it's dinged up and has seen better days. The room appeared mostly clean so that's a plus. The room itself was poorly laid out but it was a fairly large room. There was a nook behind the TV. Yep, behind it. Big enough for a chair but that's it. But for the life of me, I can't understand why the room was spacious but they made the bathroom so tiny.  The toilet was almost under the sink.  This hotel is over priced. I don't know why Crowne's are old &amp; run down but they still charge like a higher class hotel.First stay at a Crowne Plaza, we usually stay at 4 star + properties but the price and location were fine for our firSt trip to St Louis.Parking: they charge for self park, $10.00 per night. The garage is pretty old and leaks water from the roof (it's not raining) and is pretty old and ghetto.Lobby &amp; Service: The MOD checked us in and was very nice and helpful with area resturaunts, the lobby is nice and clean.Room: it appears to have been referbished within the past 5 years but it was cheap and poorly done. The tub is blue and the finish is wearing off, the paint is yellow, the wall coverings are tan and the white tile is poorly refinished bright white with with putty patches throughout.The mattress and box springs squeak something fearce, the old windows don't block the street noise and worst of all the A/C was not keeping us cool through the night. I would hate to try sleeping in the summer months.The hallway on the 21st floor is unvacuumed and stained and the room doors are chipped and dirty, it's not very nice to see this condition when you have just checked in and going to your room after an exhausting day of travel.I would not stay here again in the future, pretty disappointed.More like 2.5 stars. The only reason they get that high is the location, and the room size. Really the location is great 17th floor room with a balcony looking at the arch that's nice. Larger than average rooms. Lucky we had a killer fire works show and concert at the arch it was fun to watch from such a great location. Things seam to go down hill from there.The street noise was overly loud I've stayed in other hotels that didn't seam to have this problem even in Downtown Chicago .Then there was the towel thing like the next day 14 hours later after several calls and broken promises finally got some clean towels. Ok great location but in serious need of some remodeling and general cleaning. My room was less than clean and I wouldn't even sit in the chair I'm not sure what happened in it. No flat screen TV ?Ok great location but the parking thing is like a maze and dirty, and who would put a dumpster by the only door leading in from the parking garage nice in the 100 degree heat. Ok great location walk to the Arch and some very good restaurants near by but needs some help.I actually bunked up with Rachel S. on her 2nd stay at the Crown Plaza Downtown STL, and for those wondering minds out there, we shared beds with our hubbies, not each other...I know you are all sorely disappointed! I have to agree with Rachel S. that our room, while decent, was nothing to get too excited about.  It was decent size and our beds were comfortable, though a full is never quite big enough for my hubby and me.  The carpet and decor needs an update, but we did score it on Hotwire for less than $100 a night, so it was well worth it.The service was fine for us from bell boy to reception desk to valet, we had no issues and I always think that is a plus.I don't know that I would pay the listed price on the website to stay here, but it wasn't bad for what we needed - a place to shower and lay our heads over Halloween weekend. :)It definitely worked and I would not be disappointed if Hotwire planted me here again.The Crowne Plaza seems to be one of the more overlooked hotels in downtown St. Louis, but it does not have as much to offer as some of the other higher end hotels in the area. The rooms are actually very large. The hotel is old, and you can tell that they have renovated the rooms, but you can still easily tell that they are old. The thermostat in our room was broken, but we were too intoxicated to bother getting another room so late at night. The customer service was friendly and accommodating. We were on the 21st floor and had an awesome view of the arch, which was nice! The bar was completely empty on a Friday evening and so was the lobby in general. I would prefer to stay at the Hyatt, Hilton, or Millennium any day, but the prices were cheap and service was good, so I'll give The Crowne and A-Ok.This place almost got a 5-star from me!  The staff was super-friendly and even upgraded my room for free to a corner room on the 27th facing the Arch...AWESOME VIEW!The previous complaints I'd read about the hot water were never an issue for me.  If anything, I had to watch how hot the water was when I started the shower or I would've probably lost a layer of skin!My room was a suite and it rivaled many apartments I've rented in terms of size.  It was spacious, clean, and nice.The hotel restaurant was not busy but the staff was very friendly. I ate alone while I waited for my party to arrive and my waiter and I passed the time talking about the NBA Finals that were going on.  The food was tasty and well-portioned - I ordered the 1/2 rack St. Louis style ribs.Con's time:The TV's are still tube ones and remind you of the hotel's age.  LCD/LED TV's would've been nice.  I did notice that there were some TV's stashed in some places so maybe they're in the process of replacing them.There is only free wired Internet in your room.  If you want wireless, you'll need to go to the bar or a few other places in the hotel and pay for it (listed in their Guest Directory).  I brought my iPad 2 and was pretty much screwed because I didn't own an Airport Express yet.They were skimpy on towels. I had 2 in the room and no wash cloths. The gym is nice and most of the equipment have attached TV's so you can pass the time. Unfortunately, the equipment is older and not gym quality and some of the equipment and TV's and equipment were OOC. Lastly, the path from the parking lot to the hotel goes past a dumpster and there is no way to avoid the smell.This is an older hotel, and I am used to staying in newer ones, so that may have colored my perceptions.  The staff was friendly.  The rooms were clean (and huge!) with inexplicably small bathrooms.  The pool was on the roof, and was really cool.  We had a catered dinner at the event we were attending, and the food was delicious.  They had a chocolate layered cake that was phenomenal!  Internet was free, which you don't usually get from a higher-end hotel.  Aside from the age of the hotel, and some iffy-ness with the air conditioner (it worked, but not well), I had few major complaints.  Specifically, the elevators were slow and inefficient.  I seemed only a couple were working at a time, and all were incredibly crowded, especially if you had luggage.  The parking garage was dirty, smelly, and dirty condensation leaked from above, which was pretty nasty if it hit you.  The buffet breakfast was very expensive, and seemed no different than the free continental breakfast you can get at other hotels.  Very overpriced.   It served its purpose, and the pool was cool, but nothing else was too special.  Fun tidbit: my mom returned to her room on Saturday night, to find approximately 20 towels, and an extra mattress sitting in her room, partially blocking her fridge/microwave/coffee access.  The front desk was puzzled, no explanation was offered, and the staff did not come to get them until the next day, despite several phone calls.  So they might have an elf problem or something, I'm not sure.I was very pleased with this place.  We were on the 23rd floor with a great view of the Arch.  We had a balcony, which, from what I understood, means we had a smoking room.  You can smoke on the balcony but not in the actual room.  Neither of us smoke, but the balcony was cool!  The room was HUGE.  We had 2 queen beds, a couch, chair and coffee table, desk/office area, a microwave, mini fridge, iron, coffee pot.  The wifi is free.  The bed was super comfortable.  The only gripes I have are 1) the bathroom is small and no fan, and 2). we couldn't adjust the a/c, it wasn't an option, and 3). the elevators were kinda slow.  The parking is $10, but the front office will validate your tickets.  I was overall pleased and will be going back soon.  It's in a great location, we walked to the Arch, and it took us less than 10 min.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.******Need to update and renovate.My stay was from July 31 to August 6.1. Lobby had awful smell.2. Too many flies in the lobby area.3. Escalator in lobby to the PR level was not working the entire time of our stay (6nights).4. Shuttle service provided has a 3 mile radius.5. Bartender, Sylester was nasty and rude - no tip.6. Bartender, Martiz is great. Friendly and very informative and knowledgeable of the city. Told us of great places to eat and to listen to music.7. Restaurant meals to expensive. Hotel offered meal discounts, which was not worth the service.8. Elevators were very slow.9. Unable to control thermostat in hotel room.10. Great view of ""The Arch"".11. Lobby furniture needs to be updated.12. Close to Monty's sandwich shop - great food.13. Hallways are very drab.14. Observation deck nice view of the city.15. Pool amd observation deck not handicap accessible.16. Most pay to use the computers in the business area.17. Laundry room is not a room. In the hallway on the 4th floor. Lost money in the machine to get detergent. This is not a secure area.18. Had to pay by credit card to use the computer on the PR level.We stayed here with two other couples last July. It took 45 minutes to stand in line to check in, only to be told there was not a room ready for us, but one was opening up soon. The other couples were able to go up to their rooms.  After an hour I called back and spoke to the manager who said  our original clerk must be lying to us because there was not a room being prepared for us. Really? Bad, bad, bad customer service. Not something you want happening after a long day of traveling. We finally got a room at 8pm at night. It was a nice room with a view of the arch, but I would not book here again.Another couple had a room on the smoking floor, which smelled very musty, and the air conditioning did not workMy husband and I opted for a Stay-cation and stayed at the Crown Plaza. It is crazy to me that I have lived here for 5 years and every once in a while I feel like a get a totally different view of the city!Pros: Great locationWonderful view of the arch and downtown from the rooftop. Most rooms have a balcony Pricing is reasonableWalking distance from several local attractionsCons: Decor is a bit tacky Rooftop pool is tinyHotel Restaurant has little options for healthy eatersThe bathrooms in the rooms are just kind of weirdWonderful service. Nice comfortable beds as expected at the Crowne Plaza.  The room is quite spacious and clean.  Awsome view of the Gateway Arch! The hotel is within walking distance to many historical sites.Whenever I stay at hotels, I will admit I only use Hotwire. I always get an awesome rate and it has never failed me. My stay at the Crowne Plaza was no different. When we got there, they gave us a king size bed (ooo wink,wink). The room was on the 10th floor and close to the elevator although we never had an issue with noise which was nice. The room was also very spacious. I honeslty can't complain about the room.My favorite thing about this hotel though is that it is literally like two blocks from Laclede's Landing and the Lumiere. Perfect! I don't want to take a cab, I'd rather walk and it was conducive staying here.A negative: the cleaning lady tried to come into our room twice when we had told them we were not leaving until check out AND I had the door hanger on there saying do not disturb..oh well..So we booked two nights at this place... and only stayed one(unwillingly)  We got into town super late.  Once we got to the room we tried to turn on the AC.  To our surprise there was no AC in the room.  You don't get to control your own room temp settings.  After we called to figure out what the deal was we then found out they have a 48 HOUR cancellation policy... So I thought we were going to be stuck staying there.  They promised to move us to a room that should be cooler and give us a fan.  While its not there fault the temp outside was unseasonably warm they should have some sort of alternative to make things better.Even worse the room they moved us to had a leak in the ceiling and when we woke up our bag was wet and so were some of our stuff.  Not a huge deal but still a pain in the a**.  The manager promised a refund for our troubles but its been over a month and I haven't heard anything.  Also, I keep calling and leaving messages and no one ever returns my calls...Update-  Just spoke to Samantha.  I dealt with Felicia the day that the carpet was wet.  Samantha now informs me that there was no leak from the ceiling that both security and an engineer said they didn't see a leak.  I stood there with security and the engineer and the engineer checked the non-functioning AC unit then confirmed the water mark on the wall and said it must be the unit above our room leaking down... DO NOT STAY HEAROlder hotel with newer furnishings. I had a room with a balcony which had a great view of the arch. Parking was $10/night. Overall my stay was decent.","['crown', 'plaza', 'downtown', 'hotel', 'positives', 'negatives', 'decent', 'place', 'lets', 'talk', 'positives', 'hotel', 'location', 'great', 'within', 'walking',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-st-louis-saint-louis,The Westin St. Louis,4.0,$$$,128,"Had a good stay here this week. The location was convenient and we had a nice view of the stadium and the heart of downtown. The room was beautiful, modern, and BIG! (I freaked out over the high ceilings... I loved them so much.) Everything was clean, service was good, and when there was no bacon or mayo on my fiance's club sandwich at the restaurant downstairs they fixed it immediately and didn't charge us for it, which was really nice of them (we actually ate in the restaurant twice and both times the food was great). We would absolutely stay here again.We spent 3 nights at the Westin next to Bush stadium. Her are the pluses and minuses. On the plus side the staff was all friendly that we dealt with. The room was large and clean, and the price with our group rate ($109) was very reasonable. We had a large bathroom with nice walkin shower. it is located right downtown with easy access (except for some construction). The food we were served at our business dinner was good. On the negative side we had a poor view (I realize not every room can have a gorgeous view of area) and the window was filthy/maybe they did it that way to obscure the view? The elevators are horrible slow and the bedside light was miswired where the wrong lights came on together. The thermostat was very touchy and you could not tell what temp you had it set for. I would really prefer that the toilet and or sink were located separately from tub and shower so you can sped up morning rush. The $30/ valet parking seemed a bit high to me. Overall it was worth the money we spent though I have tried to book here before and the price was like $400 at which point it would be grossly overpriced. .They say everything's bigger in Texas, but I've found that hotel rooms are bigger in St. Louis. A standard king room was big enough to be a suite at this joint. The bathroom is bigger than my apartment, and it sports a serious shower and a SEPARATE bath so nice that my wife ran out and bought some weird bath salts (but not the fun kind). I did find that despite many, many, many lights in the room, the lighting is actually terrible. On the other hand however, the blackout curtains do the trick and I could've slept in the fantastic bed for the rest of my life if I didn't have to fly home.The only thing sad about our stay was that some ignoramus has defiled the artwork* that was in our bathroom, but other than that, it was a beautiful stay. _____________*There was a lot of random writing on the painting, and above where it reads ""dry like an oil well"" someone has scrawled in, ""My lady parts are...""Great LocationAmazing BedQuiet RoomsI stayed at the Westin this past weekend 9/18 - 9/20. I read a few other reviews about the art in this hotel and I can agree that it's intriguing, repulsive, and borderline offensive (primarily speaking about the bathroom). The rest of the room and bathroom were beautiful. The room was spacious with large windows. The king size bed was luxurious and comfortable to say the least!There were some large stains on the carpet either blood or wine but large enough to notice. The shower and tub were clean and neat.Getting in the hotel was fine, parking was $20 a night but that's comparable for most hotels of that caliber and location. Both parking lots were full so I called the front desk, they directed me to the valet who told me to park in their lot. Getting to the room was a MAZE I walked over a sky walk and around the entire hotel before I got to my room. Needless to say the front desk didn't tell me about the easier way to get to my room.... :/We didn't get maid service for whatever reason so I had to call down to the front desk to get towels around 4pm on Saturday. An hour and a half later I had to call back because I didn't get new towels yet, 20 min later they arrived. PROHotel BedLocation Room SizeBathroom AmenitiesQuietCONStained Carpets - professional cleaner/replaced it was either blood or wine lol Lack of Housekeeping- Discuss with maids, timeliness of requests should be addressedRepulsive Bathroom ""art"" mentioning suicide and homicide - remove/replaceExpensive Bar - Get me out of my room and spending money with some enticement!I read the reviews posted here and thought this would be a great place. Wrong! They couldnt find my reservation. The room was dirty and dated. They tried to overcharge me in the restaurant. Will not stay here again, felt we were being scammed every step of the way. Paid an extra 10$ for a room upgrade? So for 10$ they put a fridge full of over priced shit for me to pay for? So where's the upgrade? Criminal!!! Is there a good Hotel chain out there? $21 a day for self parking? This isnt Chicago!! Just Criminal! Shady Hotel!!Extremely hard to find with construction all around it.  The rooms are very nice but I will use the Millenium, Hyatt or dried plaza next time.  This hotel just sucked to get to and when checking out the front desk could not do basic math.  My checkout was over a half hour or more.  The girl could not figure out how to give me a detailed bill with each charge.  She said they don't do that, I said you can't add right I had 4 things from the mini bar and at one glance I could tell it was around $13 and parking was $20.  She added 4 different times with 4 different figures then said you owe $47.13.  Lady you can't ad 20 +13 without a calculator or a computer.  WTF!  STAY IN SCHOOL KIDS you may need it to keep your job.  Never again too many better choices in St. Louis.  2 for the room only.One of the worst hotels I've stayed in, in a long time. The valet hit our car with someone else's luggage, the coffee maker in the room (king size bed in room) is in the bathroom, the shampoo and conditioner bottles in the shower were not full leading us to believe they had been used before and the artwork in the bathroom was extremely dark and had graffiti on it. There is no fridge in the room but there is Starbucks coffee and tea.Hmm pretty disappointing for a Westin.CONS- concierge said 4am the metro opened. wrong. good thing my friend told me that the first train wasn't until 5am...otherwise I would've missed flight.- housekeeping didn't replace our shampoo/conditioner- not sound proof. there was a concert by the ball park and you can hear everything perfectly inside the room- confusing layout... there are two buildings and only the 2,3, and 4th floors have bridge access between buildings.- no one is ever at the front desk...why??- took them like 2 minutes to finally answer the phone when I called- super expensive food in the restaurant- for some reason the tissue box (and all the tissues inside as well) was SOAKED- we had a 200 person conference, and the water pitchers were constantly empty. Definitely didn't fill them enough.PROS- overhead showers (i don't know what they're called, but it made you feel like you were showering in a waterfall...amazing)- decent sized rooms with big windows- large cardio room AND a separate weight training room with a good amount of equipment- walking distance to a lot of attractionsIn conclusion, either the hotel is understaffed, or the staff doesn't bother to provide good service. I wasn't impressed.My first time visiting St Louis and also my first time trying this hotel. I really like the location of the hotel. They are very close to every single thing so there was no need to take a car because everything was in walking distance. The hotel staff is very very friendly which is always a plus. Even the housekeeping staff came back to clean our room once we decided to go to breakfast even after we changed our mind with no complaints. Also room service at any hour they came in were very nice and respectful. The room was great beds oh my gosh were magnificent and the bathroom was cute. The price tag could be better, I tried going thru them first and it was not what I wanted to pay. You can do like I did and find a deal. Will I stay here again? Hands down yes I would and when I tell you hey are good. They are. GOOD!A return to the scene of the crime. I haven't stayed here since my bachelor party, nearly ten years ago. In fact, I made my wife make the reservation as I was afraid that I might be persona non grata. Kidding...sort of.When we arrived, the hotel was exactly how I remembered it- swanky, with an industrial touch. The hotel bar...uh, yeah, thank God, it's been ten years, and I'm sure none of the same employees still work here. I could opine, but I'll leave it brief and say that the ""morning after"" consisted of my group, and other guests that we befriended, drinking this establishment out of bloody Mary's and mimosas. Seriously, we drank them dry. The rooms. Still looked brand new. Spacious, with huge windows, and Westin's famous ""Heavenly Bed,"" which is the comfiest bed in any hotel. The bathroom. Uh, yeah- pretty f'n cool, with the glass doors, and a rainfall showerhead. Luckily, there was no random drunk girl, popping xanax like candy, bathing, uninvited in my bath tub this go around. Another story, in itself.Friendly employees, easy, reasonably priced valet, great modern, spacious rooms. No better location to catch a Cards game. Ten years later, it's still a great hotel.This place is baller. Like super baller. We arrived late on a Friday night (1 am), and despite out frustrations of 2 delayed flights, we were fairly tipsy and ready to go out. The guy at the front desk was super helpful, giving us recommendations for places to go out near the hotel. Best part ever... They upgraded us to the 7th floor, suite with pool table and amazing bedroom and bathroom. He have us a wink as he handed us out keys, and we had no idea that we were getting a free upgrade. Awesome sauce. The hotel is gorgeous. Great views of Busch Stadium, the Arch, and Ballpark Village. The breakfast buffet (we didn't get there until 11:30) was delicious, and although I never feel like I eat enough for the price, hubby are 3 plates and sent himself into a good coma. Great food for $15/ each. The ballroom (we went to a wedding) was gorgeous.Great customer service, great rooms an a great value for the location. Careful with parking, valet is $30 and there's a lot across the street for $15/day. Westin wins in my book.This hotel was wonderful!  I was in town for one night and had the lovely opportunity of staying here for the first time (Westin virgin!).  The staff at the front desk (valet and concierge included) were the epitome of excellent customer service.  Anyone in the service industry could take notes from this staff in how pleasant and helpful they are.  My room was spacious, comfortable, clean, and quiet, all very, very important to me with how much I travel.  I don't think I could find anything negative to say about this hotel if I tried!  I will most definitely stay here again my next trip to STL.Good view overseeing the stadium. Spacious room. Love all the layout with clean new bedding and huge bathroom. Service is good that they were fast to deliver the slippers we needed. We ordered room service, it was fast too and they can accommodate your need like.. i only want half dozen of the wings and they did so. Might be bc they only have the boneless ones while I originally wanted the bones. Food itself is just so so. We were there on a Thanksgiving night, hence we won't bother to look for a restaurant opens that night. You need to pay extra for parking though. And there's no laundry onsite and they sent us to Hilton next door instead.Nice place, comfortable beds. Way over priced for the tiny room though. Bathroom was really nice and the view of the stadium arch was really neat. Staff was very great and bartenders and waiters downstairs were fun and nice. Glen the bartender was super funny and very personable. The manager guy who was working was a complete jerk and very rude when any of the ball players were around acting like he was the FBI and nobody could even look their way. All in all, I have stayed in better places and for $584 bucks a night should have been top notch!We are currently staying at your Westin in St. Louis. We wanted to notify you that we were in room 373 in which the carpet and beds were covered in fleas. We had fleas hopping on our feet as we walked. The called the front desk who sent someone over to give us new room keys. The representative, who was very nice, had no idea why he was coming over. We called again to tell the front desk to make sure they were clear on the situation and all they told us that the room was now closed out. We were upset about the customer service until the manager called to express his concern a bit later and provided us vouchers due to our experience.Really not the best place I've stayed in St. Louis. The entire hotel is done up in so many shades of brown. Browns I never knew existed. Browns swirled together. Brown walls, brown floors, brown carpets, brown elevators, I felt suddenly color blind! The saddest part is that it looks newly redecorated! Apparently by someone with an obsession with doo doo. Lobby front desk is tucked away a bit oddly and there is NO COFFEE SHOP here. Be forewarned there will only be carafes of burned Starbucks to greet you in the morning.  But there does happen to be a juice bar where you can order up fresh made juices and smoothies. I guess outfitting that joint to include an espresso machine wasn't in the designers budget. But c'mon, espresso is BROWN, it's so logical!Room was meh. Sheets very scratchy and pillows all thinly stuffed feather (i.e. will flatten out in 10 seconds of head weight). TV was set very low for lying in bed watching, would have to sit up against the headboard to see anything. ZERO outlets at the bedsides, charge all electronics clear across the room. Room thermostat is a 70's relic where you move a lever back and forth between 65 and 75 and hope you re achieving something comfortable. Single sink in the giant bathroom along with a tub made for Jack Sprat but definitely not his wife. Shower had a cool rainfall design but rain isn't going to wash that shampoo right out of my hair now is it?? One entire star is awarded to my friend in the bar who was friendly and helpful with neighborhood tips and poured a stiff drink. You, my good friend, should go apply at the Cheshire where you will be appreciated!We only stayed one night- we arrived semi late and left pretty early in the morning so I didn't have the chance to see many amenities but we had excellent service. The bartender and all the staff were extremely friendly and we felt very welcome. Right next to Busch stadium which is exciting. Great rooms with plenty of space, all very clean and nice. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone who needs a place to stay in Saint Louis.Great view of the Arch from here. Came with a girlfriend who was SPG Gold or something like that, so they upgraded us to a suit, which was great!Location was very convenient-- right next to the Stadium MetroLink stop, right across from Ballpark Village (which is great to go out at on the weekend), and the gym is pretty nice too, with full length mirrors (useful for shadow boxing). Breakfast was pretty good too!If you like baseball and it is the season, then having the stadium across the road has its benefits. This one of the cleaner hotels in St Louis.The downside. The rooms with x19 are sandwiched between what sounds like the kitchen extractor fan exhaust as it makes it way to the roof and the railway station outside. The electric hum of the trains and announcements do wear on you and start waaayyy early and end early morning too. Not exactly a relaxing or quiet room. The corridor in the morning is littered with the trays from guests that have ordered room service.I met a friend at the hotel bar and they were out of Ginger beer.  This was after a ten plus minute just for service. The breakfast service is a lot better but doesn't make up for the rest. Overall, I would much rather stay at the Hyatt or Hilton, both are downtown.Great hotel, service, and location. I was in town on a non-baseball game night and got a room for half off (~$100) via Trivago.","The bathtub has hair and garbage which did not get any clean.It should not be seen in the Westin as I supposed.It was horrible.I had to call room service to clean it at night.Very nice hotel however the filthy bathroom left a bad taste in my mouth.  I expect a 4 star room to be spotless.  In addition, you have to pay for wifi and parking.  In the future the Drury's will be earning my business.I expected better, to be honest. $20/person to park started off the rather unmemorable experience. There's no direction signs to show you where the front desk is so I stood for a couple minutes like a moron. The room was gorgeous and modern and spacious with plenty of light. The bathroom was large and well appointed. The bed was lovely and comfortable. But. The WiFi is expensive, they charged $1.99 for a local call made from the room, and the tub was narrow for a soaker. Everything was outrageously expensive, which I expected. I didn't expect so many nickel and dime tactics from a superior-rated hotel. Honestly, I don't think I'll be back.Oops! I accidently rated the other hotel we stayed at and got them confused.... (it was a blonde moment).The Westin is a great location if you're walking to the game.  I always find that staying at a Westin property is normally quite a good experience.This hotel by far does not disappoint.  The room is spacious, beds are comfy, love the toiletries and the gym at this hotel is super.  Lots of machines and all of the equipment is new.Loved it. The only downfall is they totally need to upgrade the towels.... those suckers are rough!Nice comfortable rooms, great service from front desk and doorman. I can't recall his name but very good with kids- they want to go back to visit.Ultra-mod hotelFood wasn't all that swellFor as much as the priceIt would have been niceHad they bought 'happy' paintings on sale.Note:  Giant rendering in bathroom (as reviewers on another site noted) has a serpent and an oozing limb, along with various handwritten notes from someone in a deep, dark depression over a failed romantic relationship.  I guess it's in all the bathrooms.  Makes you leave there pondering the mental state of the artist, as well as that of The Westin's management team.We stayed at this hotel being two adults and a 10-year-old with two queen beds we truly felt like 1 million bucks, The hotel staff was very friendly, they had an on-site restaurant and bar, and the location was pretty cool. Right across the street from Busch Stadium, and within walking distance from the Gateway arch and the old courthouse and well near the Soulard district. Up-to-date modern clean and well designed, this was a great place to stay in St. Louis. Everything about the hotel was fantastic except for one single thing that left a bad taste in my mouth, and that was paid parking. It's very hard to feel as a ""guest"" when one of the first things you do when you arrive is get charged before you even walk into your own hotel room. I know that this is common practice for many large hotels however it is a practice that in my opinion is in very poor taste, and thus loses a Star just because of that. we stayed on the seventh floor opposite the stadium and yet our view was still interesting and captivating. I would definitely recommend this hotel to many people when staying in St. Louis.Our room was lovely, and very comfortable. The parking staff was friendly and prompt, and front desk staff were courteous and helpful, which was good because there was no concierge on duty, at 4:00 on a Friday.After a day's worth of driving, then walking for two hours to see the Arch, we went down to the restaurant to eat, instead of going out, because we were exhausted. The hostess seated us, and we then waited fifteen minutes and had received no water, and no acknowledgment from any serving staff;  there were only two other tables seated in the dining room.  We never saw a server and we couldn't find the hostess, either. So, we just got up and left. I'm sure they thought we didn't want to pay their prices, but we gladly would have paid. They may as well not even have a restaurant. (Perhaps the staff was providing room service?)We were not warned, when we checked at 4:00, that our room was directly across the street from a rock concert. When we returned after walking the neighborhood to find a place to eat (which we would have preferred not to do), we asked a second desk clerk about the music and he said, ""Yep... there's lots of music. They have concerts all the time."" We could not even hear the television in our room. Mercifully, the racket ended at 10:00 pm.All in all, this hotel stay was acceptable, and the physical environment was five-star. But the racket across the street and the dining room experience put a serious ratings-dent in this review.When I stay at a Westin, from the time of booking to the time of check-in, I start a slow chant:""Heavenly Bed. Heavenly Bed. Heavenly Bed.""For you see, I am a big dude, married to a big dude, and we have two big dogs, with whom we share our bed. I am a light sleeper, and I toss and turn. I essentially never get a good night's sleep, and the Heavenly Bed cures that. But when I checked in to room 460, my bed was decidedly not Heavenly. It was more just like ""bed."" I wept.But notice that 4 stars I still gave the hotel? That's because regular-bed aside, this place is great! I'm assuming it's newly remodeled, because both the lobby and our room were really great. The room's bathroom was HUGE, with a massive soaking tub and also a glassed in stand-alone shower. Oh, one thing: the towels were pretty dang rough. boo. Locationwise, it can't be beat. Literally across the street from Busch Stadium and on the very same corner as a metro stop, it's convenient as can be. It's a really good hotel.And the cherry on top? We got this badboy on Hotwire for like $60 a night after taxes. That's just an unreasonably good price.Westins always surprise me. They don't have the branding like Four Seasons or the Peninsulas or the Knickerbocker...but they always manage to dazzle me.The Westin may be my new favorite downtown St. Louis hotel.I needed a staycation room. I was thinking of the Cheshire at first because that's where I usually put people up at, but there were people joining me that hadn't been to St. Louis, and I really wanted them downtown. So I hopped onto Hotwire, crossed my fingers, and got this 4-star Downtown hotel for approximately $70 for a Saturday night in December after taxes. The stay rocked. The good:*It's a gorgeous room! Roomy and really nice and sleek.*Heavenly Beds ARE heavenly! I could stay in one forever. Also, they tell me that the rollaways are made from the same material as the Heavenly Beds and are supposedly better than the rollout couches. *I could live in the bathroom alone. You could fit an entire group of people in the shower (not that you would want to) and the deep soak tub looks amazing! I wish the bathroom had a vent thing though. *It's really really quiet. But it's the off season, so I imagine that on a game night, it would be really really loud. *It's a little off the main downtown traffic routes so you do get some privacy in the off season while being really close to 64/40. The bad:*If I hadn't know where it was, I'd never have found it. The main entrance faces south towards 64/40 and to the left of it is the Metrolink and then Busch stadium.*Parking is $27 for valet, $22 for self parking. There are some lots that are cheaper around the area, especially during baseball season. *Internet is $11/day. *It's so close to Busch. I think it wouldn't be so relaxing during the summer. *Obviously, since it's a nice hotel, the attached restaurant has pretty high prices for average food. *Nothing else really nearby. Check in is at 3 PM, check out is at noon. At some Westins, they may allow for a late checkout on the weekends, but I'm not sure if this one is one of those that do it. 24 hour fitness center with spa options during the day. They also do participate in the Run Westin program where they do have a running route for you if you're interested, and sometimes you can even borrow running shoes. I'd definitely be back for another staycation.We booked this hotel for a RIDICULOUS deal thought hotwire.  I think it was no more than $80 bucks a night WITH taxes, so that was a plus to begin with. This hotel is HUGE - I think it is in an old factory or something, and there appears to be only one elevator to each floor - our room was a bit of a walk from the elevator and near a skywalk or something that went to even more rooms. (Please note that this was NOT an issue though).  The room was spacious, and clean (albeit for one stain on the carpet, that again, didn't phase us really, and when we let the front desk know about it, the immediately offered to move us to another room).  Our room did NOT have a view of the arch (not all rooms do, only the ones on the side of the hotel closest to the ballpark).The bathroom - OMG.  Large soaking tub, HUGE rain/steam shower (I seriously still miss it).We had such a great time in St. Louis, that we decided to stay an extra day - no issues, front desk team was above and beyond helpful, even sending mail for us, arranging for a taxi for us when we went out (don't want to drink and drive, right?) :)Would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat when we return to STL!  Only comment - in this day and age, WiFi should be free.It's nice place , but not clean as you expect it , there is dust on lamps and other areas , bar cooler its not clean They didn't clean the room till 3ish ! For the price they charging people I deserve more ,,,We had breakfast and service and food was okay not excellentWe live right across the river in IL, and with bad weather coming in and floor seats to Frozen on Ice at the Scottrade Center for my daughter's 4th birthday, we booked a last minute room in St Louis for the night to avoid the drive in the snow and ice. We booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> and got this room for a STEAL. We paid 75 bucks for the room and since we had never stayed at the hotel, we didn't know exactly what we were getting into. We arrived and the valet immediately helped us in with our luggage so we could grab our kids. We checked in and were upgraded to a king suite for no additional charge. We got to our room and it was HUGE! Giant bed with a view of the Scottrade Center (most want to see the arch, but we were fine with our view because we got a good idea of the traffic we would be battling the next day to get to the show). We ordered pizza and spent the entire evening in our room with our family. There was a giant soaker tub that was super comfortable and a glass encased rainfall shower. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was glorious. They brought a roll away bed upstairs for my 4 year old, and I was thinking it would be something like a hard little cot. NO WAY. It was a twin sized bed with an equally comfortable mattress and luxurious bedding! It was probably one of our best hotel stays ever. The next morning after 6+ inches of snowfall, the valet was waiting and helped clean off our vehicle while we loaded up our kiddos. I couldn't be more pleased with the staff, cleanliness and value we got.The only complaint that I have is that WiFi cost close to 12.00 for 24 hours of access. That's literally all I can find to complain about, and its not a big enough deal to lose a star! 5 stars Westin! Great job! We will be back!I booked this room using Priceline's Name Your Price, and I must say, this has been the best deal I ran into, by far. When we got there, we were approached and greeted by the valet outside. They were very helpful in getting our bags out of the car and helping us into the hotel. Since I already paid via Priceline, check in was a breeze. The front desk clerk was incredibly helpful and efficient. He let us know we had a ""great room"" on the top floor. And great room we had! We had a GIANT corner room with floor to ceiling windows on one wall, two very large beds, a giant bathroom complete with a soaking tub and a huge glass-encased shower with a fabulous shower head. We were blown away by the deal we got. Everything was sheer perfection. The beds were super comfortable, the pillows plenty, a lot of TV choices, and the bathroom shower was phenomenal. Overall, I would DEFINITELY stay here again!!This is my first stay here. The hotel is a nice modern look to it. The bed is very comfortable and the bathrooms are really large. The house cleaning service was really fast and did a great job.My only complaint is the front desk and front desk manager. This is the only Westin I felt that was not friendly, the business center was where they told me go the person have me the wrong directions. I asked if it needed a key and she said no. Then when I walked up there it was locked and required a key. The sign in the business says if you need copies you can go to the front desk. I was there first and ask the front desk for a copy. I tried calling the front desk for information it took 5 mins of a ring just to get someone to pick up the phone. It is really great location. Just horrible customer service for a Westin!Totally just left my laptop in a cab. Told the bellhop. Guy straight takes off running, jumped in another cab and began to chase my cab down, ran two red lights in downtown STL, caught the guy and retuned my laptop in 7 minutes flat.  Freaking ridiculous. Shawn is the damn Navy Seals of bellhops. Very impressed.If you are traveling for business, this is not a normal Starwood property. The rooms are massive and beds comfortable. Staff are very friendly. On the other hand, you can hear your neighbor's every move, the bathrooms are poorly lit, business desks only so-so and accessing the fridge requires that you use the minibar key which may incur a charge.Quality hotel; far less than quality service.I had a very negative first impression when it took the hotel 2.5 hours to get my room ready after I came to check in after 3:30pm. I came with a large group of people who booked our rooms well in advance, and still they weren't ready by the time of check-in? I've heard very rude and unflattering remarks of how staff treated some party members of our group when they tried to check in early ahead of the group because they were traveling separately. (Please understand: our group is coming from Philly via an 18 hour road trip to get here to St. Louis for a FIRST Robotics Championship competition that's been hosted here for several years now and that has been alerting businesses in the area of our 30k-40k people incoming presence.) I find it ridiculous that it took them so long to clean up our rooms when we booked in advance, they knew that they were going to receive several groups of 30 ish people, and y wet it still took them so long. Absolutely ridiculous.It really continue to roll downhill from there after that initial impression. Breakfast is a ""buffet"" for $18.40 every morning. Wi-Fi is not free in your rooms; you have to pay $14.99 per night to have Wi-Fi access and you are only allowed to use up to 3 devices to use such services. Access to the room bar/fridge is very expensive, adding an 18% service fee plus additional 10% tax on whatever alcohol or candy you found worth it enough to rake up such prices. Lobby food and drink that are kept behind the desk is expensive as well. $4 for a standard plastic water bottle. $2 for soda can; $2-4 for any of the candy bars or boxes. They carry various bathroom products for anyone who found that they forgot something or needed something. It seems well prepared and well stocked. You can have free Wi-Fi access in the lobby, which have okay seating and space, but is definitely not ideal for the businessperson who needs privacy and quiet to work. You may consider me a bit cheap from how much I paid attention to those cost details, but I'll inform you that these prices are absolutely ridiculous. They'd later run our water bottles so I eventually resorted to drinking the tap water for mostly free.I was placed in a room on the fourth floor, which is an adventure to get to everytime I need to leave the floor to go to the lobby. I have to walk across a connecting bridge after taking three turns to get there. It was very spacious and had a great bathroom (i included bathtub that is a bit tall, shower with fold-up seat, toliet with lots of space around it, singular sink with shampoo products, towels, and hotel blow dryer). Bed was comfortable, sheets were of a scratchy and thin blanket and a thick and much better duvet over it. You can't see the television from laying down; you'd have to sit up to do it. No outlets near the bed, you'd have to consult the desks set up across the room away from the bed. Lights are well placed in the room, Hotel cleaning service is accomodating to your requests if you leave specific instructions for what you'd rather they not do. For example, I specifically wrote a request down that my sheets did not need to be made, and they accomodating that for the rest of my duration so as long I kept it stuck to the television through the complimentary hotel post-it notes. They also seem to provide a laundry cleaning service for fees.This hotel was very nice and all, but I had such a poor impression. From check-in, to my terrible allergic reactions to the dry and windy conditions of St. Louis, to my complete disappointment in the lack of quality food services and places around Downtown St. Louis, and overall would reccomend this hotel to people who have the money and time to not care about the deets that I've pointed out.Decided to stay here for my birthday this past year. Bumped up my opinion from 4 to 5 stars. I had a bath tub this time.. Sweet relief. One of my favorite things has always been a big luxurious bathroom and this one is great. One thing I'd like to add is that I had the delicious breakfast buffet downstairs. It was so good. Loved all the fresh fruit. This is the best place to stay when going to a Cardinals game, especially if you have seats on the first base side - VERY close walk between that stadium entrance and the hotel.Stayed here when we were road-tripping during our move from Los Angeles to Chicago, and this place felt like pure luxury after staying in tiny motels in the middle of America. The room was huge, bed was very comfortable and we had views of the city. We were able to bring our pooch in with no pet fee, and they gave her a doggy bed, dog bowls &amp; a treat. They get 5 stars for giving our dog 5 star treatment! The location was great and was walking distance to the arch &amp; the ballpark. Room price was reasonable, and we got a deal for under $200 including parking at the last minute during the middle of the week. I believe this hotel costs more if you plan ahead and on the weekends. This was exactly the treatment that we needed after spending 25 hours in the car and the motels we had been staying in the previous 2 nights.","We arrived in town, did a quick walk around looking at the St Louis sites and for a restaurant for dinner.  Hemmed and hawed about going to Mike Shannon's or Carmine's but saw a sign in the Westin elevator about their bar menu and it was perfect. Didn't have to venture out on the streets and had a great dinner of superb apps and wine.  Crab cakes were fabulous  as were the other selections and wines. and waiter was really great.Had a very pleasant short stay. Always love this hotel. It has a very substantial amount of space! Love the lay out, the high ceiling, the bed and of course the roomy clean bathroom!Fantastic rooms, and service overall. The beds are amazing like all of the Westins. I have only one complaint and it seems it is rampant in St Louis, as it happens at the Four Seasons as well. When I pull my car up to Valet, why in the world don't the Valet attendants open the door for my wife? It happens every single time. I still give great tips, but it would be nice if they open her door, not mine. I don't need my door opened.Either way, thanks for a great stay!Great experience. Large room with ample plug-ins you don't have to be a gymnast to find...HUGE bathroom with separate walk-in shower and soaker tub...and the perfect bed. Check-in/out was fast and easy. We enjoyed the bar for a couple of hours after the Red Sox game, too - worth the price for convenience and a very friendly staff. The breakfast buffet was also yummy. The best hotel valet parking experience ever - super nice guy, WAY faster than most (I'm looking at you, Intercontinental Chicago) and very reasonable. This easily the best place to stay if you're going to Busch Stadium. It looks like it opened a month ago and everyone acted like they actually enjoy working there.Great room, large and spacious with big beds. Everything was clean and very nice, we were able to check in and out quickly. Just beware of the breakfast buffet,  it was $ 50 for two people and I'm almost certain they used powdered eggs for the scramble eggs.Great location but they charge you for everything possible- Internet, bottled water (even though it looks complimentary), parking, etc. For being a 4-star hotel, I expected more. It was not as clean as it should have been (black spots in white duvet cover, shower head, hallways/elevator smelled and needed to be vacuumed). I visit STL often and will not be coming back. Customer service is of little to zero help and I spoke with 3 different people who treated me like I knew nothing. Unfortunate.Loved this hotel. Booked with a wedding block and the price was fantastic. The location is wonderful (even though I'm a Cubs fan) and all the amenities were wonderful. The beds were amazing---I don't think I've stayed at many Westins, but they are definitely up to something with their Heavenly beds. The bathrooms in our room were lovely---the deep soaking tub was irresistible. We ordered room service and the employees were great. Wish the wifi didn't cost an arm and a leg. It always surprises me that more expensive hotels charge so much for wifi, but cheaper hotels include it. But it was nice to unplug for a few days. Although if I needed to use wifi, I would have been really disappointed. My only complaint was that I called ahead of time to ask where my mother and I might be able to get a manicure/pedicure prior to the wedding and we were told ""I don't know....."" How does a hotel staff member not know where someone can get their nails done? I can't believe we were the first ones to ask. And no offer to ask someone else, or find out for us. Oh well---we ended up at the Four Seasons Spa and it was fantastic.Charged for little things that are usually complimentary at Marriott or Hiltons. Hairspray, nail files and shaving cream. Ok- it wasnt that much. But when I had to ship my sandals back after forgetting them (my fault, I know), they shipped them the most expensive way after specifically asking them to be shipped the cheapest way possible. Its the little things that matter- I wont be staying at a Westin any time soon.Amazing rooms , huge bathrooms &amp; just amazing service!! The rooms were big enough for any size family &amp; the breakfast was hot &amp; delicious!Our stay over Christmas at the Westin was fantastic!  If you are in town for a baseball game, you can't get any more convenient to Busch Stadium.  It is also close to the other sites in downtown like the Arch, Citygarden and the old courthouse.    The rooms in this place are huge!  The bathrooms, likewise, are also very spacious.  They also had a rainfall shower head which was a nice touch.We tried both dinner and breakfast here.  The breakfast was just so-so.  The dinner, however, was really good.  The toasted raviolis were good, which is something everyone must try while in St. Louis.  I also had a salmon salad, which had an Asian-style dressing, which was fantastic.   This place is also pet friendly, which is nice.  Our dog got welcomed with a giant milk bone and they provided a dog bowls and a dog bed too.Wonderful hotel!! My favorite place to stay when visiting downtown St Louis. Rooms spacious, staff wonderful, bathrooms are amazing. Highly recommend. Also make every effort to visit the spa while staying (even go to spa if I have to stay at another downtown hotel). Affordable, polite staff, and Jen is incredible. The best massage I have ever had.Thank you Westin! Nothing worse than not feeling well when traveling for business. Your customer service is ALWAYS the best in the business. From the upgraded suite with some of the most comfortable bedding in the industry to your (free) breakfast which was one of the best/healthiest I've had all year, you made me feel as close to being at home as possible. And you found me an urgent care 5 minutes away!  #starwood #platinumforlifeA really nice place to stay especially if you are trying to go to cardinals games. Pretty clean and good service. Love the proximity to Busch stadium and flying saucer and joe bucks. But other then that not much around  cuz it's pretty much on the highway.Really nice place with outstanding customer service.  Rooms were very nice, though the 2 Queen beds seemed more like 2 full size beds to me and my family, they were very comfortable.  We got a good deal on the room for 100.00 a night including free valet parking and breakfast for 2. We were visiting family for Christmas and the staff were very friendly and accomodating even though it was a holiday.  The bath rooms come with a deep soaking tub and a seperate shower both were very stylish and very pretty to look at.  We loved it!There is no pool on site but the front desk clerk said we could use another nearby hotels pool which was just fine.I would recomend this room, as it is a very nice place for the money.  Also loved the Starbucks with the in room coffee maker.    Very nice touch!I have now stayed here three times and every time my stay is better than the previous stay. Service- from the valet, bell men, front desk and Clark Grille staff- everyone is helpful And seems genuinely happy to be there.  Great rooms with a really nice bathroom dual shower head option, massive bathtub, and updates. Without asking was granted a platinum upgrade to a great room. The location is near the ballpark and great eats and drinks on Washington street and 15 minutes from ""The Hill""- the historic and amazing Italian Mecca of the Midwest! The lobby is cozy with a roaring fireplace and the hotel always smells like a Westin- yes I believe it is a special delightful scent.My fav place to stay in the Lou!!!My boyfriend and I stayed here over Valentine's Day and it was great!!We got a room through Travelocity and the price was a little high, but it was kind of last minute and i guess bc of valentine's Day, prices were a little higher than usual.  At least, that was my guess.We got a king bed room, which was on the 5th floor, but our view was not that great.  When looking out the window, it was a view of the parking garage.  if you looked to your right though, you could see the Arch and the new ballpark village that's being built.Our room was really big and the bathroom was huge! The shower was really nice and clean and so was the tub!The bed was also comfortable and big and I slept really great.  I definitely want to stay here again when i get the chance!We arrived just before a baseball game (the hotel is across the street from the stadium). It was a zoo outside, but we were able to valet the car with no issue. I think you'll want to valet if there's anything going on downtown. We found the staff friendly and the hotel in great shape. Comfortable bed, big bathroom with both a tub and a shower. No complaints here, all good.I loved my stay here. The staff here are fantastic - incredibly welcoming and helpful. The rooms are beautiful - I got the opportunity to stay in one of their king-sized luxury suites. I wish my apartment looked like the room! No joke. They have Starbucks coffee for you to make in the room, and there's Showtime provided for on TV. The rom came with a comfy couch, an executive style desk, and lots of storage. The bathroom is fantastic as well. It comes with a shower and tub; really large. The Westin made my stay in St. Louis really relaxing while I was here for a conference. I had some really long days, so it was great to come here and feel like I could rest well and retreat. I'm actually sad I couldn't take more advantage of my room and the hotel's amenities. I chose for them not to clean my room during my stay there. Each night you choose that, they provide a $5 gift card for you. The gift cards are redeemable at the front desk for snacks and drinks or at the restaurant downstairs. On my last day, I chose to use it at the restaurant and treated myself to their breakfast buffet. Yum. It came with sausage, eggs, bacon, oatmeal, fruit, and more. The Metrolink has a stop right at the Westin, so it's incredibly easy to get here from the airport. There's a computer in the downstairs lobby for you to print out boarding passes when you check out, or you can actually get the front desk to print them out for you. If you're reading this, I hope you find your stay at the Westin as relaxing and convenient as I did!Best Hotel in STL! The rooms are larger than your avg hotel rooms and the housekeeping dept keeps them very clean. The front desk is very nice and they always provide the best recommendations on where to have dinner to confirm what I read on yelp.. Stay here if coming to St. Louis. It is the place to stay for sure.Nice spacious room. Employees are friendly. It is one of the better Westins.Valets are pretty slow, so make sure you give them ample of time.","Had a great experience at the Westin.  Great old building that has had a refurb inside.  Great downtown location fairly close to the trolly line which made it easy to get to the arch, city gardens, dinner etc.  Room was really nice, clean, and bright.  The workout facility is nice and the only downside compared to competitors is they don't have a pool.  I thought the breakfast was really well done although one day they were understaffed and service was really slow.  We didn't complain but they noticed, apologized, and paid for a breakfast.  A real nice gesture.Great hotel!! I would recommend staying here. We did have an issue with housekeeping not cleaning our room the first night, and a miscommunication on not replenishing our coffee stock and cups. But overall it was a good experience. The restaurant there has some AWESOME BBQ sandwich and sweet potato fries! I would definitely stay again!This was our 4th stay here and two of the four weren't good; however, this last time we were given a huge suite, away from the freeway off-ramp and the room was clean and everything was in good working order.  The staff here is phenomenal -very helpful, friendly and seemingly sincere in their happiness and desire to provide quality service.  The restaurant was ok...convenient but somewhat pricey for the quality of food (the food quality is ok, the price is high).  Ultimately, we will definitely stay here again when in the area.  It's convenient to the freeway and pet friendly!Great room. Nice hotel. Very swanky. Great view of downtown. Very friendly staff. Only downside is 20 bucks on top of room just to park in an unguarded and halfway plowed parking lot. Parking should be free for guests in my opinion. If parking was free this would be 5 stars.I had my wedding at the Westin in August, and it was fantastic. The rooms we stayed in were beautiful and well kept. The ceremony space was phenomenal, and the Promenade was absolutely perfect for cocktails and the reception. With the help of the event planners Heather and Shannon, everything was perfect. I couldn't have asked for an easier day in a better venue.I didn't want to leave my room! It was so huge and relaxing. I could have lived in the bathroom, it was so big. There was a nice bathtub separate from the shower. The shower had  a giant shower head that made me feel like I was under a mini water fall.The bed was a whole other world. I didn't want to get out of it once I got in. It was so comfortable and the thick, fluffy comforter kept me warm and cozy on a cold, St. Louis night.The people at the front desk were very helpful and made the check-in and check-out process very easy.I would definitely stay there again.Great place to stay, and a great location too! First Class All The Way!I love this place!  The rooms are huge, the decor is really nice, and the staff has always been very nice.  Since it's right across the street from Busch Stadium, it would be a great place to stay if you are going to a game, and needing to stay the night.  But I can imagine that they fill up in advance, so plan ahead.We stayed at the Westin in St. Louis on the 29th of November.  My wife and I were in Missouri to see her brother graduate from basic training and AIT for the army and wanted to stay in St. Louis one night before we left.  We reserved a room with a view of the stadium, as my wife is a huge baseball fan and loves seeing different stadiums.We got to the hotel a bit early.  1:15 PM to be precise.  We fully expected that the room might not be a ready and we may have to wait a little while.  We checked in and the young woman stated that it was not ready, but that she would contact house keeping.  She did offer me another room, without the view, but I stated that we could wait a little while.  She swiped my credit card, and we sat in the lobby.  While we waited, my in-laws who were staying down the street at the Hyatt showed up.  They had no problems checking in early there. At 2:45 PM, a full hour and a half later, I approached the desk again.  I was admittedly a bit angry by then.  The young woman I had spoken to before was no longer at the desk.  It was apparent to me immediately that the young man at the desk had no idea we had been waiting.  He also offered us a different room, at which point I explained how long we had been waiting and asked how close they planned on cutting it, since their official check-in time is at 3:00 PM.He apologized profusely and contacted house keeping.  The room was ready.  I think he could tell that I was angry for waiting so long, so he offered to add breakfast to the reservation for no charge.  I told him I had already added it and paid for it.  He then offered me two beers and an appetizer at the Clark Street Grill.  I accepted them, but to be honest - I had never been to St. Louis before.  I was only there one day and flying out the next morning and this hotel wasted an hour and a half (nearly two hours by the time we got in the room) of my time.  To me, that's worth more than some food and drink coupons, but I fully understand that he probably wasn't authorized to do much more.We got to the room.  It was spacious, clean, and the bathroom looked great.  I immediately noticed we had no refrigerator in our room.  I know I could have called the front desk, but when you pay as much as you do at a Westin I shouldn't need to make a call to have a refrigerator.  The windows were dirty, but the view of the stadium was still decent.This is the one hotel I've stayed at and had my entire stay ruined at check-in.  Additionally, we had been in the Ft. Leonard Wood area the two nights previous to this, and I paid less for two nights (total) at the Hampton Inn in St. Robert.  For that price, I had a jacuzzi and a king size bed.  I had no problems at check-in.  Check-in in general was more efficient and friendly.  Breakfast was included.  I had a fridge.This is a luxury hotel??  I'm sorry I cheated on the Hampton Inn, but the Westin looked so nice and the location was right.  I will not make this mistake again.The spacious bathroom with both a tub and a shower is the premier feature of the room.  The cheap AM/FM radio was useless.Checkout was a disaster.  I thought standing in line at the front desk to checkout was a thing of the past.  Not hereVery Noisy! The hotel was located next to Ball Park Village which was great! It was snowing and cold but it's so close to the entertainment it was a very short easy walk to all the fun. I attempted to get some sleep from the time we got back at midnight to 4am. Finally I had to take a sleeping pill because the noise outside. Everyone is leaving the bars and they seem to stand in the parking lot screaming and yelling for long periods of time. The windows do Not provide any noise reduction at all it was ridiculous! I was on the 4th floor and I could hear peoples whole conversations outside (drunks tend to talk Very Loud!) ALL NIGHT LONG I heard screeching tires in the parking lot.. car alarms going off.. people honking at each other. It's really a shame when I stayed back in 07 it was the best nights sleep ever! It was quiet and cozy but now that all the bars parking lots are directly next to the hotel its nearly impossible to get any sleep! We are not very picky people my husband and I are both 30 so we understand the whole night life thing. For the cost I was VERY unhappy that I was woken up the whole night.Still my favorite hotel in the midwest.  Following a few prior visits, the Misses and i celebrated a wedding Ann over a weekend here following my last review.  One of the attendant/ valets--Kris asked us why we were staying; upon arriving back to the room, we found a small champagne and chocolate platter waiting for us.I emailed the GM upon returning to say ""thanks"" and compliment Kris for his friendliness; as well as the goodies.  Have stayed at the hotel a few times subsequent since the review.  Seen Kris everytime--point is not about stalking!  Rather, people--staff is awesome here.  They are tenured; they like their jobs; they stick around.Also want to compliment bartender Orlando this time.  Had to send a past-prime Fat Tire back (that stuff has a ""best by"" date-- to my surprise, it was well past and tasted a little past.  Orlando was great about it; comped the replacement drink.  When i visited the bar a subsequent time, he tried to pass on a tip for my single drink that time (saying i was ""too kind to him last time."")  Good people at this hotel.Great hotel, stayed only a night, but man it was awesome,  HUGE room size as well as bathroom space.  Customer service was great and it is literally 10 steps from Busch stadium as I could hear the baseball game and the fireworks, which maybe a problem if you're a early sleeper or something.  Very clean and I would use again!What a great hotel experience!-Huge rooms-Friendly staff-Quick room service -Comfy beds It's an all around phenomenal experience for pretty inexpensive. I'm not sure if this is the norm in St. Louis, but if it is the my standards are set pretty high for future visits.In SD now visiting family. And our hotel here is so so. But this place was awesome.  All I can say is Jacuzzi bath tub!!! Very nice staff and comfy beds.One of the best parts of this hotel was the staff, extremely friendly and helpful. They accommodated us very well.We ended up getting a room on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> for about $100. We called and requested a room with a view. Our room was amazing, very spacious bedroom and bathroom and we had view of the Cardinal's stadium. The bar downstairs was good as well, recommended the mixed drinks! The breakfast was also delicious with a high selection to accommodate everyone. The location is great too, so many things within walking distance. When I go back I will definitely stay here.The only downside was the parking was a little creepy, but nothing to really complain about.Much nicer and more comfortable than the average hotel. It's a chain, but luxurious enough to feel special. Great fitness room. We found a good deal online and were very glad we stayed here.Stayed here a couple weeks ago. Here's the rundown from a biz traveler standpoint:-interesting location, perfect for a game, not sure how good it is for meetings-great internet speed - 2.53Mb/s down <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speedtest.net%2Fresult%2F1182126629.png&amp;s=614bf7785966a5d28b56f4f57f56768e0f171f3cd6b512fb9bdae649a5f5a6b5"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net/result/118...</a> -Gym was really odd - it seems like a relatively new hotel but all the gym equipment is 20-30 years old-Heavenly bed delivered a good night's sleep-Solid breakfast that's included if you're platinumNo brainer if you're here for a gameWe stayed here last night on our way home from Atlanta. We selected it first because it was a Westin, but secondly because they accept dogs up to 50# and we had pour Boxer with us. We were very happy with how nice the property was. When we checked in we signed a waiver about our dog but it was very basic. They asked if we wanted food and water bowls and a Heavenly dog bed and directed us to a park just across the street where we could walk the dog. We had dinner in the bar -- appetizer of potato skins and dinner -- a wood fired sausage pizza. It was all good! The room was very cleansed larger than w expected. No pet smell at all. In fact, you would never guess you could have a pet in a hotel this nice!We would definitely stay here again. It's also just across the street from Busch stadium!!I do not have any other hotels in St. Louis to compare this one to, and I wont.Starwood at it's greatest.  Look out my window and I see Busch Field, close the drapes and I don't have to be reminded this is where the Cardinals play.Very big rooms and huge bathrooms with separate tubs.  Excellent showers.It's your choice, walk down to the Arc or whatever and stand in line with the other tube sock to the knee fanny pack crowd, or walk down 7th and discover an American classic neighborhood with bars and restaurants catering to locals and the Cardinal baseball religious.And then look up and see where Budweiser Beer was born.  You can't miss it.St. Louis might be on to something.","I was pleasantly surprise by this hotel.  The room was spacious and the bathroom was very nice also.  The check in was pretty slow and we waited about 1/2 hour before our room was ready.  I had asked for an upgrade to a suite, but was declined because they had a group that took the rooms.  We found out later that the ""group"" was a professional hockey team.  We were also there for four days and the staff graciously offered to have a refrigerator delivered to our room.  It was bigger than the minibar fridge, so we were able to store food and drinks for the entire weekend.  The beds were not as comfortable as other hotels, but the bathroom made up for it.  The separate bath and shower was a nice touch, as was the over-sized bathroom counter space.  The outside of the building looked much like the rest of St. Louis, ie drab, but once inside, it was modern and new.  The gym is separated into three different rooms.  Some of the machines were out of order.  There is no pool.  The cafe downstairs served buffet breakfast.  For the $15.99 price, it is pretty limited.  If we ever have another reason to return to St. Louis, we will definitely try this hotel again.Spacious Room, Great Atmosphere, Awesome Decor and the customer service was Excellent. I cant believe I paid less than $90.00 with free parking and breakfast. This was a great deal. If they had a refrigerator and microwave in the room, it would be the best hotel ever.Enjoyed my visit very much. Huge room, nice decor, good food, great drinks, friendly staff, best location to Busch Stadium. All around great experience.My three friends and I decided to take a road trip from chicago to st louis for the blackhawks vs blues game this past saturday! The westin in conveniently located about 4 blocks from the scotttrade center. It's only about a 10 minute walk from the arch and right across from busch stadium.The room was huge and so was the bathroom, and the beds were very comfy! They have overnight parking for 20 bucks which is not bad at all for hotel parking!I will definitely be back next year for another hawks/blues matchup!Nice rooms.Ridiculously convenient to Busch Stadium.Friendly + helpful restaurant team, even right @ 6am when they've just opened.very clean and comfortable. Great location..checking out today to go back to LA, but highly recommend !@!My son and I visited St Louis to tour St Louis University and enjoy a Rockies vs Cardinals series. We decided on The Westin for its convenient location for both purposes and the Metrolink access. We did not rent a car. The Westin allows for easy walking access to most everything you'd need for a weekend stay.The facility interior is beautiful. The rooms are surprisingly large. The restaurant and bar area is clean, open-air and convenient for a full day from breakfast to post-game nightcap and snack. The visiting team stays here so if you're a fan it doesn't get any better for being up close to the stars.The staff is very friendly, approachable and helpful in every way. We needed directions to the university and around construction that had closed the Metrolink stop. Meranda (I believe) took all the time needed to specifically direct us.- and with a nice smile. We ate a few meals in the hotel and all were excellent. (I wasn't crazy about our waiter Ronnie's technique and lack of organization, but he sure is friendly). I know that if we do return to St Louis, either for a campus visit or a baseball trip, The Westin will be our priority choice.My wife and I are staying here for our first anniversary. At check in, we informed Yvette S., the front desk agent, that we are celebrating our anniversary. When we came back to the hotel after lunch, we received a phone call from Yvette asking politely if we drink alcohol. We confirmed, and she told us that she would send up a couple of complimentary drink tickets or something to celebrate. A few hours later, after we had dinner, we came back to our room and discovered a bottle of champagne and a fruit plate along with a very personal handwritten card. We feel so welcome and will definitely book another stay at a Westin Hotel. Thank you to Yvette and the staff for the wonderful hospitality.My husband's birthday weekend, thought we'd splurge a little on a nice hotel for our road trip across I-70. It was worth it.Our room (a single king) was big and beautiful. We are about to remodel our attic into a master suite, and I will definitely be taking some design ques from the Westin. Great reading lights - little sconces on the nightstands, and additional small pendants that hang above the bed from the ceiling. Brilliant! I want to take the Heavenly Bathroom and plunk it down in the second floor of my house.The Heavenly Bed was very comfy - not too firm, not too soft - but the sheets were just ok. Seemed a little stiff, and not super soft - hence the four star rating. We were on the third floor with a view straight down the driveway, right over the front awning. Not great, not terrible. Parking was pretty convenient - it's right across the street, and there isn't a lot of traffic or anything. I don't recall seeing any mention of the parking situation on their website when I booked it, so I did have to call to figure this out for sure. The parking attendants at the lot are all super friendly.We did not eat at the Clark Street Grill; we opted to go out and about for all our meals, so I can't really comment there.The Cardinal's were actually in Kansas City playing the Royals this past weekend, but I'd love to go back to STL for a ball game when the Card's are in town, and I'd totally stay at The Westin, then, too. The location right across from the ballpark is great.A Westin is a Westin is a Westin (unless you're in Seattle, in which case it's more like a Motel 6).  I mean that in a good way though, they're consistently good quality - friendly staffs, nice clean interiors, comfy beds, decent gyms and edible restaurants.  This property is no different - definitely a quality option in STL.P.S.  If you're a baseball groupie this is THE place to be.  The hotel is right across the street from the stadium and there's a good chance you'll be shacking up alongside the visiting team when they're in town for a series.  I was here back when the All-Star Game was in town and the whole NL (or was it AL?) roster was there....Prestige hotel and extremely nice rooms!! Extra big bathroom!!!!I have not stayed at this hotel, but I did have occasion to eat at the restaurant twice. On the first occasion, more than two years ago, the place happened to be packed to the rafters, seeing as how it was a game night. Even so, the service was quick and professional and the food was above average, especially by hotel restaurant standards. My second visit to the restaurant is fresher in my mind, as it was last Sunday, before a matinee performance at the newly restored Peabody Opera House. The restaurant was decidedly less crowded on this visit--in fact, I was the only patron. Even so, the service was attentive and I did not feel rushed or under a microscope. My order was relatively pedestrian  (potato and leek soup along with a glass of the house chardonnay). The soup was good, though it could have been a bit warmer by temperature. Considering that my options that day were fairly narrow--between a hot dog table outside of the Scottrade Center and the fast food alley setup within Union Station--I am forever grateful to the Westin for providing a civilized, pre-show dining experience.I am reviewing the RESTAURANT only.  Absolutely...NEVER had a bad meal here.  In fact...the food here has been outstanding.  Hotels are normally not known for there restaurants...but believe me...this place is impressive.  I had the French Onion soup.  Normally...I never order soup at a restaurant.  I have to say...bar none...the best I've ever had.  The onions were tasty the cheese was oozing off the bowl...  Go!  You will be impressed.I'm in StL for work, and I must admit, I love Westin rooms.  Their showers are amazing.  And so are the bathtubs.  Beds are comfy, and the rooms are spacious.But.  There's always a but, right?What's up with housekeeping?  Is my room always last to be done?  Is that why you arbitrarily pick things to make up? My bed is always made, and I thank you for that, dear housekeeping ladies and gents.  But why must you give me a different number of towels each time?  Can you at least give me more toiletries on a consistent basis? I have thick hair, so I need a new tiny bottle of conditioner every night.  Please? Pretty please?  Perhaps new glasses sometimes would be nice, I don't like reusing my glasses everyday.Worst customer service I have ever experienced at a Westin. Upon arrival the first day room was not prepared, had to wait 2 hours. Took 45 minutes after requesting room service menu for someone to bring it to our room. Took and hour to receive our breakfast that we placed an order for the evening prior. Would have expected a little more from a westin.The good: really nice room and at a good rate ($99 + tax, etc); more space than I imagined I would have and, yes, the bathroom is large. The bad: when I called for a room the same day, the representative told me only one room was left and it would be $139. Luckily, I knew about the Internet rate (and that is was available) but since I was driving, I opted to call. Curious though. More bad, food is so-so and definitely overpriced, even by hotel standards. Chicken and asparagus were both overcooked. Bathroom soaps, etc smell awful. But that's probably just me.  I'm sure some people love them.  But this is unusual for me.  Typically I am neutral to these sorts of things.  This alone would keep me from staying there again, unless I brought my own bathroom supplies!All in all, great room, questionable service/booking policies, good price in the end.Pro:The location-As long as you are a baseball fan. We were there over the Cubs-Cards series weekend and the place and parking lot were packed all the time. So it just depends on your reason for being in STL whether or not this is a plus.The rooms-They are nice and decorated in the typical Westin fashion. Very quiet with a spacious bathroom. There is a separate shower &amp; tub in the room.Parking-Plenty of parking due to the self parking lot for hotel guests and employees only across the street. Metro-The stadium metro stop is right next to the hotel which made using the train really easy. Con: Long hallways-It takes a while to get to your room because of the layout of the hotel. Next time, I would request a room closer to the elevator.Pay Internet-I don't use my laptop too often out of the house, so it is bother that you have to pay $17 a day to use their internet, but it is free at the cheaper Four Point Sheraton hotels by Starwood.No bad things to say about this place! I travelled with three friends watch the Blackhawks vs. Blues game and the room exceeded our expectations. The beds were large and oh so comfortable. I normally have an extremely hard time sleeping in foreign beds since I'm so in love with my own but I had no problem falling asleep. The bathroom was huge with a full bathtub that I later enjoyed a relaxing bubble bath in. The parking was only $20 for the night, not bad at all. The Wi-FI was pay per use but we weren't concerned with that since we were only there for the night. It was within walking distance of the arch, several restaurants, the Scott Trade Center, and is directly across the street from Busch stadium. The concierge was extremely friendly and gave great walking directions and suggestions. I can't wait to be back next year!Nice hotel with spacious, well-designed rooms and on-par Westin service.  The location isn't the best if you're not a baseball fan (up along Washington Avenue would be more in the thick of things) but the MetroLink station certainly is convenient.  Speaking of that station, why isn't there a lower-level connection from the hotel to that platform?I'm a bit disappointed that the character of this old warehouse has been preserved only on the exterior.  The rooms might as well be new construction, save for the high ceilings and generous windows.Very cool hotel in a kind of large warehouse / loft type building.  Very nice staff.  We had a bit of an issue I won't elaborate on but they handled it well above and beyond the call of duty.Amazing bathroom.  Out of this world.  Huge.  Very cool, spa-like, modern tub at one end.  Very big glass enclosed shower on the other end.  His and her wash basins with black stone top.  Thick luxurious towels.The room was very large with high ceilings.  Bed was top notch.","['good', 'week', 'location', 'convenient', 'nice', 'view', 'stadium', 'heart', 'downtown', 'room', 'beautiful', 'modern', 'big', 'freaked', 'high', 'ceilings', 'loved', 'much',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-saint-louis-clayton-clayton,Crowne Plaza Saint Louis - Clayton,3.5,$$,81,"Another fun NYE at the Crowne Plaza Clayton!This rating of four stars is due to the quality service and the nice room; it would have been three stars if I relied solely on my experience with the dinner and bands for the 2015/2016 NYE celebration.Having said that, this was our second year in a row to partake of the NYE festivities at the Crowne-Clayton. Our first experience, food-wise, was much better!We purchased the top tier package: Room, steak and lobster dinner, unlimited drinks, 3 bands, NY Day brunch. The cost was $170 per person.Let me tell you, for $170 I need a much better dining experience! My steak was mealy (you know, when the cut is sub-par and too much tenderizer has been used) for a supposed filet. The lobster was extremely fishy and chewy. Face it, I LOVE to eat and this just wasn't up to par. I ate only portions of each and that's not normal for me! The twice baked potato was meh, and the salad and dessert (cheesecake) being average. And normally, the brunch the next morning is the true highlight as it's a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds. Well, this year it was beautiful to look at, but so, I don't know...weird? Odd combinations of things, maybe trying too hard to have too many ethnically diverse choices? One example that was odd is that there were tons of sliced cheeses and meats. Sounds great! But NO crackers to eat them with. Was I supposed to put them on the waffles or pancakes? The cold pitas maybe? Who knew. And one section of the dessert table was raised (maybe for aesthetics?) so high that I couldn't reach anything on it. I'm not 2 feet, 4 inches! I'm a normal height woman at 5'4"" so this was just weird. I will say there were lots of choices, I just found many of them odd and without continuity. Last year's was MUCH better!Now, for the bands. Two years in a row we've been in the main ballroom where the ""headliner"" band is. That's two years in a row that the band has, well, frankly, sucked. We found the DJ in the basement and the band on the first floor to be much better, but such small rooms that everyone was trying to pack themselves onto tiny dance floors. End of music rant.The room! The room was VERY nice! King sized bed, tons of extra floor space, counter space, room in the bathroom. There was a microwave and fridge. The TV was incredibly small and outdated, but we weren't there to watch TV. The room was also clean and there were plenty of towels in the bathroom. Two downsides to the room: the bed was SO high off the ground I needed the ottoman to get up on it. I'm really not THAT short folks! What is it with the tall stuff at this hotel? And the make up mirror in the bathroom was sitting on the counter, not mounted on the wall. That was back-breaking to use! Terrible design.The service! The service was GREAT!!! Seriously, from check-in, to dinner, to drinks, to the servers at the brunch...all top notch! Even thought the drinks were included, I gave the bartender I went to a $20 because he was busting his butt to keep the line moving!The lobby, etc., are very beautiful and clean. They need more elevators, but it's an old building and it's been an add-on process so I can see how this has happened. Parking is convenient and attached to the building.Overall, it wasn't too bad. I think my better experience the previous year is what is keeping me from rating it much lower. That, and the great service and the friends we've made from doing this two years in a row. However, I don't think we'll try it for a third year. I would stay here again, just not do the NYE thing.This hotel is conveniently located if you are looking for a place close to WUSTL or if you want to stay in Clayton. The hotel is kind of old, but good enough provided it is not super expensive. Definitely it is not a 4-star one: no 4-star hotel gives plastic bowls in the breakfast buffet. Besides that, the breakfast is good, with plenty of options. My room was big and clean, with a comfortable bed, although the A/C was old.Very pleased with this hotel.   There was a large loud wedding tonight but that made it nice and lively with a lot of drinking and bass pumping music that ended before midnight.   Both the indoor and outdoor pools were open late - nice.  One of my pet peeves about hotels is when the pool closes like at 8-9 when we never get home before dinner and like to swim late before bed.    For a 50 year old hotel it's been preserved quite well and is in great condition.  Beautiful hardwood floors and carpets, lovely lobby with abundant chandeliers and mirrors everywhere even in the rooms.  Great HD TV and channel line up, fridge and microwave, clean restrooms and bed.   Fast WI-FI (on it now and uploaded dozens of photos to Yelp real fast).The shuttles are fast and friendly and will take you where you want to go in downtown Clayton (small) free until 11 pm.   When we called for a pickup our driver was there in less than 5 minutes.   Nice guy that knows the area.The AC is pretty loud (you operate it from the wall controls, not the ones on it).   When we asked the front desk how to operate it the lady was obviously tired of answering that question and told us to read the sign on it saying that you have to use the wall controls (there is no sign), but other than that the staff is friendly enough.   Only a two block walk to hop onto the metro line and scoot on into downtown STL.Free parking garage on weekends, free breakfast buffet (EXCELLENT!) and a one block walk from some of the hottest restaurants and night life.  Reasonably priced compared to downtown Saint Louis.  Excellent service easily squeaks out a 4.5 rounded up to 5.   Love the staff here.What a great staff !!!!   The made the stay awesome !!!!   Rooms were large and very clean.  Rooms come with TV, mini fridge, coffee pot, and microwave.   With your stay, you get complimentary breakfast buffet.   There is Fresh fruit, eggs, dougnuts, and all the fixings.  You can also get waffles and omelets upon request.   There is also a gym and pool.  The hotel is in the nice part of town, a little ways from main down town.  But the metro is right around the corner to make transportation easy.  Make sure you get the green tickets from the front desk so that you can get in and out of the parking garage during the day.As someone loyal to the Hilton brand I was initially skeptical of staying at the Crowne Plaza (IHG). The skepticism was undeserved as the Crowne provided a solid 4 star experience for our conference.Pros:On-site restaurant and bar with happy hour. (Breakfast buffet with made to order omlets made for a hearty breakfast)Up to date amenities including: LG flat screens w/ HD, mini fridge and microwave, safe, and desk. Variety of restaurants that are walking distance including Starbucks, Subway, Ruth Christ, Morton's Steakhouse, Sushi AI, etc.Great white glove service during catered meals Great front office customer service (from shuttle pickup to housekeeping)Complimentary ArcadeHeated indoor/outdoor poolCons:Property feels a bit dated (Its an older property)*Crystal Ballroom AC sounds like car slamming on breaks every time it comes on*Overall a successful conference thanks to the staff!Thank you for the great hospitality!Extraordinary service is hard to come by, but I think we all appreciate it when we find it. It's usually the little things that matter most. The Crowne Plaza certainly met the criteria for outstanding service, and here are the little moments that mattered to me:- Free shuttle ride to/from the airport (just call the front desk)- Allowing us to enjoy the breakfast buffet while we waited for our rooms to be ready despite not staying at the hotel the night before- Getting our room ready for early check in before 1pm- The maid introducing herself and telling me to let her know if I need anythingI would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend, and I will most likely stay here again when I come back to St. Louis.This review is in regard to the venue services.  We worked with Brenda Hinton here to host our wedding reception.  We were thrilled at the affordability of this place especially in comparison to the price per person at other locations in St. Louis.  There is a minimum of how much you can spend here, however, but after that there is no room fee.  Brenda is amazingly helpful and nice.  She met us to tour the lower ballroom where our reception would be held and she was great about answering our questions.  She continued to offer us excellent customer service as we planned our menu, drinks, appetizers, everything.  She also had unending patience with us as we changed our head count several times!  At our reception, the service was phenomenal.  Many of my guests complimented the ""white glove"" service and loved having a seated dinner.  We were very happy with how our food turned out and the room was set up perfectly!  We also had many guests who stayed here for the wedding.  The front desk assistants were helpful in handing out our guest bags.  There is also a complimentary breakfast buffet in the morning for overnight guests. I highly recommend the Crowne Plaza as a reception venue.  I think the best part is Brenda, she is amazing!Very nice Hotel!!! Big rooms, we stayed in a 2 queen it was nice and clean comes with a mini fridge, coffee pot and microwave.. They have complementary breakfast very good and made to order omelettes and waffles, the owner was at breakfast greeting everyone and introducing him self asking how was are stay and if there was anything he can do for us. I thought that was very nice you don't see that so often in this big Hotels... Over all our stay here was very nice and most definitely will be coming back..... One last thing they have a pool in door and outdoor and the best thing of all in the FREE arcade games they are old school but it was sooo fun playing with the kiddosI'm putting 5 stars simply because of the customer service. The doorman was a pleasant surprise on greeting, the front desk lady was very helpful and nice. The opener of the hotel even came down to real fast one morning and spoke with me and others and handed out his business card. Great service!The hotel itself is by no means a 5 star resort. It's clearly old. But the service far surpasses any need for speedy luxury. I'll definitely stay here again when I'm back in the St. Louis area.This hotel is wonderful. It's truly my home away from home. The staff is the BEST part of the hotel.From the managers to the staff in the restaurant they either know me by name or at least recognize who I am when I arrive. They restaurant breakfast is phenomenal. When I walk in they already know how I like my eggs prepared and are ready for me.The hotel proprietor, Pete, is an amazing, courteous, gentle soul. Special thanks to Erik for ease of booking a room and always taking care of me. Now that they have improved the fitness facility, the upgrades meet my daily work out needs.While the rooms are a bit dated, they are classic and classy.I love the perks of complementary breakfast and evening cocktails and apps (earned for frequent visitors). I think my only criticisms would be sometimes noise issues as the walls are not very sound proof. And I'm super bummed not to accumulate IHG points as they are privately branding at the end of the month (hopefully they keep the other perks). Thanks Crown Team for making me feel at home!Couple things about this hotel -- Everyone I interacted was crazy, super, genuinely friendly. Someones people who are crazy super friendly are creepy and ungenuine. All these people were legit. From housekeeping to front desk to restaurant people.- The owner, a nice old man who looks like everyone's favorite grandpa in a suit, walks around the restaurant in the morning to greet people, say hello and give out his card. It's cute.- The breakfast buffet is amazing for a free hotel breakfast. They have real eggs, an omelet station with VEGETABLES, and the buffet line also had VEGETABLES. VEGETABLES ON A FREE HOTEL BREAKFAST BUFFET OMG. I ate dinner at the restaurant one night as well and while it wasn't the most tasty or gourmet thing ever it was a good value and came with, you guessed it, a good amount of VEGETABLES.- Negative - there was some sort of drip from the room above to my room, outside the window, and it drove me freaking nuts, so I kept the fan on the whole time I tried to sleep. Also one night the person next to me was watching TV kinda loud but that is not the hotel's fault. It was her fault.I'd totally stay here again.First, I will say I wish I could rate this hotel with 5 stars.   We spent 3 nights at this hotel and were pleasantly surprised by the hardwood floors in the room as well as the overall cleanliness. The staff was absolutely excellent and helpful (not like it was a difficult check in process) and all amenities were in very great condition.  The pool was perfect temperature for the St. Louis heat and fresh towels were available pool side. The hotel is in a prime location and everything from Chipotle and subway to fancy 5 star restaurants are within walking distance. Also, the Metro station is only 2 blocks away, making travel quick and convenient.The free breakfast is a full hot buffet. It was classic American breakfast foods and was well worth it, enough said. The only reasons why I removed a star are relatively minor except for one major bump. The minor; There was no air fan in the relatively small bathroom (which was small enough you were unable to get into the bathtub without shutting the door first).  Even though the signs say the front desk would have quarters for the coin operated laundry, no one had any and we had to venture out to get some (no coin machine on site). The major point (in bold) , DO NOT BOOK IF YOU HAVE AN EARLY AM FLIGHT.  When booking online the amenities include a free Airport Shuttle, however not listed in the information was that the shuttle didn't start running until 6am (with an average travel time to the airport of 15 minutes). We were unable to book a custom trip time and ended up using the metro train to save money we would have spent on a cab. Dragging our luggage through the metro wasn't unbearable,  however when booking the hotel we were under the impression that we would have an available shuttle. Overall,  it's a Damn fantastic hotel and I would stay again.This hotel is excellent. The staff and service were extraordinary. From the rooms to the conference accommodations to the complimentary breakfast, I was impressed beyond belief. I travel to STL quite often. This hotel will be my choice every time.I arrived after business close (11PM), but the desk clerk was helpful and attentive. This hotel had deck parking under/beside the hotel, but it had a nominal ($6) charge. I'm not sure if that was listed in the booking. My room was beautiful with crisp white linens on a King-sized bed, chair/ottoman, desk, and spacious bathroom. The AC never turned off! It was a little chilly with it on, even in the summer heat. The lobby and restaurant are beautiful. The breakfast included a chef-attended waffle and omelette bar-- which was extra nice. There was a HUGE variety of hot and cold food with a friendly wait-staff, even though it was a buffet. This hotel was a little bit pricey, but it was well-worth it for the lovely room, large breakfast, and convenient location.Not a bad hotel. Definitely very nice in terms of design and layout. Gym wasn't bad for a hotel either. Front desk customer service was excellent, however, the restaurant's left a bit to be desired. The room was nice, but old. Overall, I'd recommend for another visit.I stayed at the Crowne in Clayton for a wedding this past weekend. It was a treat. Here's why:* Parking was easy and presented no challenges.* The breakfast (make sure you get tickets when you check-in) was great and high value. I'd urge you to save money and do this instead of going out to breakfast.* Free bottled waters on demand at the front desk. Coming in after a late night? Make sure you swing by the front desk so you can have that bottled water on your nightstand when you finally retire.* Convenient location enabled us to walk to plenty of good bars/restaurants in Clayton.* Friendly and attentive staff. Danielle was the standout.My one con:* Late check-in time. It's not until 4:00pm, so make sure you are aware of this.For those looking to find a high-value hotel in the Clayton area, I'd urge you to consider the Crowne Plaza Clayton.I booked a room in St. Louis at what I thought was a nice hotel for one night for my family. We got to the hotel and I stated there were 4 of us and had to have two beds. The lady was rude and stated they were booked and I bought a cheap room off price line and I get what I get.I told her there were 4 of us and we could not fit in a single bed, she said they would send up a roll away bed. We got to the room after getting lost in the parking garage because she had me park in a different building's parking garage. The room was tiny, and when they brought up the roll away bed there was not enough room to set it up, so they took it back out and left us hanging with a $140 room that would not work for my family. I tried calling priceline, I tried calling the insurance protection, and then tried to get a new room through the front desk.  No one cared or would help. We ended up having to buy another room at a different hotel for the evening. This was the worst experience I have ever had on vacation and I really don't appreciate that we ended up having to leave the hotel and spend another $200 to stay somewhere else. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!I stayed here with my family for 3 nights last week and we really enjoyed our stay! The front desk was nice upon check-in, they greeted us with water bottles. Rooms were spacious and clean, the hardwood floor was great! I liked the thermostat being on the wall, it was easy to keep the room at a nice temperature. Room service cleaned our room thoroughly every day. TV's were nice, with a good selection of channels. Mini fridge and microwave come in the room as well! Our room had 2 sinks, one of the sinks is outside of the bathroom which was great! I always hate getting ready in a foggy mirror while someone else is showering. The FREE breakfast buffet is what really won me over... They have everything! Fresh fruit, waffles and omelets upon request, hashbrowns, pancakes, muffins! I was so excited to wake up and eat breakfast every day; our stay was during the week so there was always a spot to sit in the dining area with no wait. The hotel is in a nice/safe area, about 20 minutes from downtown. The only complaints I had- no bathroom fan, both the indoor &amp; outdoor pool were WAY too cold to enjoy (front desk told us the pools were heated) and the blankets could have been more comfortable. Luckily I brought a soft blanket from home, I found myself waking up a few times in the middle of the night because their blankets were so uncomfortable. Overall, I'm very pleased with our stay! --Be sure to get a few of the green tickets from the front desk so that you can get in and out of the parking garage during the day!I booked this hotel as a way to be close to the downtown area, but to save a few bucks. It was a 15 minute drive from the main downtown, which was awesome, and the area it's in is nice, but it did shut down early- hardly anything open at 8pm on a Saturday night!!We had a double room in the 'executive tower', with clean and comfy beds, extra pillows already in the closet, and a bathroom that offered a tub and a separate shower!The front desk for check in and check out were beyond nice and gave us free bottles of water on arrival.The free continental breakfast the next day was awesome! Eggs, two kinds of sausage, two kinds of potatoes, pancakes, french toast, pastries, and a build your own omelette bar. I would've loved to have had one of those omelettes, the looked amazing, but we didn't want to wait. The food was pretty good, overall. The reason I give this 4/5 stars was because of the parking. There is valet, and a free garage that's connected, but the entry way into the garage is so narrow and awkward of a turn in, with a steep ramp down beside it, we had trouble seeing due to the logistics while turning in to the garage- a little scary!! Also, the walls are thin- we identified at least 3 kids in the room next to us. Very easy to hear into the next room!Other than that, super impressive place to stay. I would definitely return.Your experience here will vastly differ depending on who check you in at the front desk. One person from our group got superstar treatment from the receptionist, she was able to check in at 9 am (normal check in is 4 pm), upgraded room (make sure you sign up for a free membership there and you could get a free upgrade too!), free bottled water and maps to local restaurants.A different person checked us in, we couldnt check in until 4 pm, no water, maps or anything else. She wasn't unpleasant, just not as thorough or as friendly.The room is nice, clean and comfortable. The hotel itself is a bit older and it shows on the weathered carpet and faded decorations. Great WiFi connection.Huge breakfast selection with tableside service for drinks. The owner, a nice senior gentleman told me about the omelet and waffle station. Walking distance to a few eateries, 15 min walk to the Galleria Mall. Safe neighborhood.","I stayed here recently while on a business trip. I was a little nervous when the trip was booked because I read the reviews and there were a lot of complaints about noise. Being a light sleeper as it is this made me sad. But I'm a problem solver and so went to the store and purchased some ear plugs for my trip. No noise issues for me. I slept straight through the night each night. I could tell that the room I was in had been remodeled but it was nice. The room has hardwood floors which I thought was pretty cool. You don't normally see that in hotel rooms.The lobby is grand looking with a huge staircase heading up to the second floor. And for a hotel their gym was pretty decent and open 24 hours (yay me). You do have to pay for parking which is a bummer. In the past I have only encountered this in hotels in much larger cities like Chicago, Dallas or SF. It wasn't crazy expensive, something like 8 bucks a day but still a bummer. I had breakfast included with my reservation. I generally skip the hotel provided breakfast because they are buffet of cheap pastries but these guys go all out. The cheap pastries are still present but there is a hot breakfast buffet and omelet station. The staff working in the restaurant were also super nice. The owner even stopped by table the last morning of my stay to ask how I liked the hotel and if I was enjoying my stay. Nice touch.When I'm in St. Louis for business again, I'll ask to be booked here.I'm in-house as I write this review.In short, the value for your money is incredible. The staff is first rate. The rooms are a slightly older decor, but they are 100% clean, the water is hot and water pressure is good. The area is safe. The breakfast is one of the best I've ever seen for a comp breakfast.Soon the property will be going independent, changing flags from Crowne Plaza to being just the ""Clayton"". I certainly hope they do well as they are worthy of everyone's patronage.The staff here is amazing. I stayed here for two weeks with a big group for work, and management, front desk, servers, and drivers were friendly and accommodating. There is a clean and decently equipped gym with tvs; the laundry room was equipped with 4-5 washers and dryers and a TV; and breakfast offered excellent choices. The stand out is definitely the customer service here. Everyone always had a smile, and they even gave free bottles of cold water, which is a nice touch considering the 90+ degree weather in the summer. The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars is the bedding. This may be more of a preference, but I prefer fluffier blankets (like down) and pillows that do not sink all the way down. It would have also been nice to have some rotating options for breakfast over the course of two weeks. To end on a positive, this hotel has $2-3 happy hour drinks and is located next to a metro stop and chic restaurants.This poor girl is tired. In desperate need of rejuvenation. She was once a beauty in the 80's, but is now dated and overdue for a major renovation. The rooms have received a modest updating, but the bathrooms haven't been touched. However.... The staff was incredibly friendly and professional, and the amenities made up for the shortcomings. Free wifi, water bottles at check-in, and a full buffet breakfast - not just yogurt and cereal, but made to order omelets, waffles, and hot breakfast items to make other budget chains jealous. If you can look past the dated decor, this is a decent value in a great location.I'll preface this review by saying all other experiences with Crowne hotels have been pleasant. However, this particular hotel and stay was anything but.Negatives: hotel is old, room was not clean and in a general state of disrepair. We found LOTS of hair on our shower walls, nasty stains on the bedding, and things just falling apart everywhere. What's worse? The management decided to have some contracting work done this morning. Soooo...at around 7:00 am I was roused to the sound of drills and hammers throughout my hallway. I'm encouraged that they are fixing things but need to find a better day/time to do it. Parking was not free and cost $6 for our stay.Positives: location is great...roughly halfway between the airport and city center. There is plenty to do and see within a 20 minute driving radius. The included breakfast is good and the fitness center is adequate if that's your thing. Pool looks nice but we didn't use it. Finally, while at breakfast, the owner was there walking around and talking with guests. He didn't specifically ask about our stay, and we didn't offer any suggestions, but it was a nice gesture.I took my kids here for a little St. Louis mini-cation. I chose this hotel based on it's location close to the Galleria, the Zoo, and the City Museum. The location was perfect. You do need to be aware that the hotel is in the middle of the city and there is a lot of traffic and city driving. The parking garage for the hotel is large and they do not have accessible carts for self loading. They have lots of friendly valets available to assist you for $$ of course. The breakfast buffet was the best I have seen for one included in your room price. They had a made to order omelet station and Belgian waffle press. The room was clean and spacious. For families traveling with kids, the pool and free video game room was a huge highlight. The pool is half inside and half outside which is quite a novelty for kids. Not sure how that works in the winter. I might have given a 5 star review but I was a little disappointed in the bedding in the rooms. The pillows and sheets were premium but the coverlet was paper thin and we all had to request extra blankets.Worst.  Service.  Ever.  I've stayed here twice before for two extended stays with work (a federal agency) and had a good experience, so I thought it would be a safe bet for a one night stay as a private citizen.  Oh how very wrong I was.  I would've rather stayed at a no tell motel on the side of the interstate in the middle of nowhere (and probably would've been treated better). Should we ever be in St. Louis again and this is the only available hotel, I will sleep in my car first. First, we were not recognized as IHG rewards members (platinum level) and we're not offered our choice of a welcome snack bag or welcome points, as is customary in IHG properties.   More importantly, they were rude and completely lacking in common sense when it came to our room.  We booked a king but were placed in a two queen room.  My first call to the front desk resulted in being told that the central reservations indicated that we asked for a two queen room.  After finding my confirmation email, I called back, provided my confirmation number and asked to be placed in the room type that we reserved.   I expected it to be an easy fix, after all I had a confirmation email. WRONG!  I was basically told that I was lying and that no king rooms were available, and I immediately expressed both my frustration and concern about the problem.   The desk clerk then said that he would have to see something in writing before he could do anything.  Really?  He just told me a minute earlier that there were no king rooms available, so why not just fix the problem instead of demanding written proof????   Sooooooo, I walked down to the lobby, handed over my phone and allowed him to see that I was not a liar and had in fact been confirmed for a king room.  With the click of a button, we were placed in a king room (again after being told that none were available).  Absolutely unacceptable!   Add to this the fact that the king room had greasy foot prints on the laminate flooring and the fact that the parking garage was incredibly iffy as far as safety given the random people walking around looking at the cars (had I been traveling alone as a female, there is now way that I would've felt comfortable in it).   I even called the IHG customer service number to report my concerns, and a week later I still have not received a courtesy call from management at this property, which further suggests a lack of commitment to customer satisfaction.  We will not be back at this property.  Ever.My meeting at the Ritz: but rooms were sold out so I saw this was close and booked it.  First off, the neighborhood is safe and quiet but rather dull, fortunately you are between 2 stops on the Metrolink to hightail it out of there for something more stimulating.  The hotel lobby and entrance is fine enough, a bit old fashioned but well polished and clean, appears to be a common place for weddings and parties.  Once you get beyond this however there are a variety of sights and smells that betray a less well-kept establishment.  Strange dentist-office like fumes waft in the halls.  The doors appear poorly painted from the outside.  The pool area is difficult to figure out how to get in and the key card machine looks like it is falling off.  The sauna did not get very hot at all.  There were people yelling intermittently out the window all night, a deep throbbing mechanical sound from underneath, and cooing pigeons that sounded like they lived inside the wall. The interior of the room itself was standard and the bed was nice, the external elements around the rooms were just discouraging.   There is an attached restaurant where you can get complementary breakfast buffet food, which was standard and nothing extravagant.Very dated, not very clean and not kept up. Antiseptic smell. Would not stay there again. Parking is cumbersome.The hotel is very beautiful and in a very good location near forest park.  the area is walk-able and if we had wanted to I believe there was a free shuttle the we could have used.  The Breakfast was excellent and the owner even came out and greeted us himself.  It was also a very reasonable price.  We had a great time here!I stayed at this hotel last year (2014) in February. They have a nice breakfast in the morning as well as good food at the restaurant later on in the evening. I ordered room service once and it was wonderful. The pool was a bit noisy with all the kids in there but that's ok. The pool was very well maintained, heated, and part of it was indoors which was great because it was during the winter. The only thing I did not like was when housekeeping came to my door repeatedly during the last hour before check-out, knocking on the door twice reminding me it was almost time to go and I was in the shower. I do not like to feel rushed. Despite this, I would go back if the price is right.Ok, I just HAD to write a review about my experience here! First of all, free shuttle to and from the airport? Chyea! Gettin off on the right foot already crowney p! Second, free WiFi with easy login worked flawlessly. This may seem like a weird thing to notice, but I travel a lot for work and this is crucial! Thirdly, a story for you...After I was done with a late work call I wanted to grab some dinner. It was about 10ish, so what do I do? Yelp it of course, to eateries in the area with kitchens open late and decent food. After settling on a tapas place, I head down to the lobby and ask the concierge if it's safe to walk in the neighborhood at this time because I'm not familiar with the area. He asks where I'm going, and then what happens next? He actually gets up and personally walks me the 5/6 blocks to the restaurant. Then we get there and he actually knows the owner too - hands me off and tells him I'm a guest at the hotel so he should take good care of me. Are you kidding me? If that ain't some southern hospitality for ya, I don't know what is. Concierge of the month award anyone? Good service like that always overshadows the little things, like an outdated room or less than impressive breakfast. I'll be back just for the great staff.This Crowne Plaza was the fanciest one I've been to.  The lobby was beautiful and our room had hardwood floors.  I slept very well here.  The desk was very helpful also.  The entire hotel was updated, clean and friendly staff.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat and also recommend it to anyone going to St. Louis.I get off my flight, call the hotel, and they send a free shuttle to pick me up from the airport. The driver was nice, but the front desk lady was even nicer. Superb staff here, even got free bottles of water from the front desk upon checking in. After I checked out, the concierge took my luggage for safekeeping as I visited Washington University. He was extremely nice and helpful and walked outside to show me where the bus stop was. The room is comfy with a fridge and a microwave. Plus the free breakfast is good! The entire atmosphere here is very nice and I'm very pleased with my experience here. Would definitely recommend it!This is 3.5 starsLocation and price are unbeatable. The hotel is in a great location. Downtown Clayton is packed with restaurants an things to do. Also, it's located right by the train, which takes you straight to wash u, Busch stadium, or many other attractions.  The rooms are clean, but small.  Nothing to complain about. The maid service didn't come one day, but no big deal...Bonus: the free breakfast is very good but on weekends is a complete zoo. Get there early!!! Great coffee.Came to St. Louis for a wedding and they had booked a block of rooms at this hotel.Pros:- Free shuttle to and from airport- Free breakfast buffet (omelet chef, anyone?)- Free wifi - Nice lobby area- Dry sauna- Arcade room with free games (although at time of review, Mortal Kombat was broken)- Walking distance from several good bars- Comfortable bedCons: - Far away from downtown St. Louis- Hard to find your way around their multiple towers- Pool area is in the bowels of the hotel and the hallway to the pool is either under construction or is the set of a horror movieReally, the pros outweigh the cons.Miss C., her friend and I went for an after-wedding brunch Sunday, sponsored by friends of the groom. Signage helped us know where to go as soon as we walked into the lobby of the hotel. That was incredibly helpful.The room was spectacular. The food was great. Fresh fruit (grapes, strawberries, pineapple, cantaloupe, maybe some honeydew), wonderful scrambled eggs that were still moist and topped with parsley and red (roasted red peppers?) so they didn't look so yellow.Bacon perfectly cooked ultra-crispy yum. Sausage links I didn't try. Waffles I didn't try. Many, many muffins and croissants and Danish I didn't try -- they were all beautiful. Bagels, cream cheese in many varieties.Grapefruit juice. BINGO!! Orange juice, cranberry juice.What was so spectacular -- besides the food I got ('cause I got the food in the buffet that I wanted) -- was the service.Making sure we had coffee and juice at the table, clearing plates, bringing a glass of ice. Filling waters. Checking all the time to ensure we were getting what we wanted and needed. Incredibly polite. Coffee service was important, 'cause I believe we emptied the carafe at the table pretty quickly.And it was great to talk with more of the wedding guests after such a spectacular event Saturday.We had a wonderful stay with our large dog and 7 year daughter. The staff was outstanding, helping us with anything we needed. The room was comfortable and the breakfast far exceeded our expectations.This hotel is the perfect example of ""Don't Judge a Book by Its Cover"", but in a negative way.When we walked into the hotel, the lobby was beautiful. Nice chandeliers and great customer service. I was surprised that this hotel was actually 3 stars because it look like 4 stars and up.Then I walked up to my room and then that's when things got bad.Here is my breakdown of my hotel experience.Pros:- Free self parking- Free breakfast buffet- Free wifi (even though it didn't work for me)- Nice lobby areaCons:- The floors with the rooms are ancient looking. Ugly carpeting and the hallways smell terrible. - The rooms were small and ancient as well.- The bathroom was dirty! We found cheez-its on the bathroom floor. - To access the parking garage, you have to go through the second floor then walk down the stairs to the first floor lobby and then go through the silver elevators. You can't access it through the second floor. I got this hotel through priceline so I'm not super surprised by the appearance. They did a very good job of decorating the lobby because that is where the first impressions come in. I would probably stay here again if I needed to be close to the Galleria, but that's about it. There are a lot better hotels around.Our room (a suite) was dirty, the fridge was leaking all over the floor, the bathroom was falling apart, and the decor was so old!","Your mileage may vary couldn't be more true than for the Crowne Plaza. I'd stayed here numerous times over the past year and had given up on the place due to small, outdated rooms. Fortunately, the competition in the area has major maintenance/upkeep issues, so I gave the Crowne another try. This go around was the first time that I've stay in the newer/upgraded section of the hotel (over at least 8 previous stays)...I must say that this part of the hotel is night and day difference. For the area, this is a 4+ as it's much nicer (wood floors, larger rooms, updated, etc.)...However, if you get the smaller outdated rooms, you're in the 2 range.My dad and I took a trip to St. Louis to watch the Cardinals and I went through Priceline to get a room.  I was very pleased to find out our hotel was the Crowne Plaza.  Upon check in the attendant was very pleasant and helpful.  The room was small but very clean.  All of the staff was very nice to deal with. The free breakfast was as good as free breakfasts gets.  On the second morning Pete Zes, the owner, stopped by our table to make sure we were having a good stay.  He was very sincere and very interesting to talk to.  He made a great impression and along with our experience I would definitely recommend staying here.I stayed here for a week. The breakfast is hands-down the best I've had. There is a made to order omelet and waffle area as well as a ton of hot dishes (corn beef hash, biscuits and gravy, sausage, etc.), oatmeal, fresh fruit, baked goods, etc. The rooms are also very nice. I was in a double queen (free upgrade) with climate control thermostat (as opposed to off/on), fridge, microwave, and safe. The complaints I have with the room is that the bathroom is so small it feels like you are always hitting the door and there is no fan in the bathroom. Since there is no fan in the bathroom, I can see evidence of mold growth that looks like it was covered up at one point. Lastly, I was really excited about the indoor/outdoor pool and sauna, but the pool was not maintained and you could see stuff floating in it. The outdoor area is also in the corner  lower level of the hotel so it doesnt get a lot of sun. Overall though the rooms were good, breakfast great, and hotel staff very friendly and helpful.Good stay. Free parking, wifi, and breakfast buffet. Greeted promptly and courteously. Room was clean, large, had amenities, and in working condition. Would stay again. Decent price.Stayed overnight on our way back to West palm beach, our room was clean and a/c unit worked great! We were able to be walking distance to the metrolink. We enjoyed the stay and loved the breakfast buffet in the morning and the hospitality was great! The owner Pete was in the restaurant going table to table greating the guests! How often do you see that? We took the hotel shuttle to Stl for our flight home and we will definitely stay again!I would recommend this hotel as a stay for a night of partying nearby in the Loop only. There are a lot of pros to this hotel but one MAJOR con. Pros: - Free breakfast buffet with hot, cooked foods!- Indoor heated pool and FREE arcade games!- Free self parking- Comfy bedsCON:- Absolutely NO sound proofing anywhere. Seriously, you will wake up in a cold sweat thinking people are in your room shouting at you when in reality, they are in the hallway just talking like normal. I think the walls are constructed of paper mache. Thankfully, we had been out on the town and were just exhausted and drunk enough to manage 5 hours of sleep through the hallway noise. But if you have kids or are on a romantic trip or doing anything besides getting drunk, not gonna work. Our room was one of the renovated ones but it obviously didn't include any work on wall insulation. The pool is pretty hard to find and most of the staff is really lazy and will not show you where it is. If you are in a dank twisty stairwell into the basement, you are on the right track. BRING EARPLUGS!! And noise cancelling headphones. And your iPod. And a white noise machine.Rooms are not that clean, especially the restrooms. Every wall, elevators in this hotel looks beaten and I believe this building is really old!   Personally, I would never stay here again.We stayed two nights. I booked the room through Priceline two months in advance. I read some reviews that said the walls were thin and to request a room in a quiet area. So, I sent an email to the hotel to that effect. We were given a room on the fifth floor in the Executive Tower. The room was huge. Two beds, large bathtub with separate shower, comfortable beds, plenty of room. We noticed some noise, but nothing out of the norm for a hotel. It was perfect. Some friends of ours had a room in the part of the hotel, and their room was rather small.You get vouchers for the free breakfast buffet located in the onsite restaurant. The food is delicious for being a buffet. You can also order an omelet and/or waffles made to order. We ordered a pizza through room service. Fresh ingredients and good flavor.Also, they have shuttle service anywhere within a 3-5 mile area. We were able to go out without having to pay cab fare. We encountered many members of the staff throughout our stay and each person was courteous and helpful.Overall, this place was amazing and beautiful and we had a great experience there. If we are ever in the area again I will definitely book here.Stayed for four nights at the Crowne Plaza Clayton and had a very solid experience. Perks include free wireless and a free, enormous breakfast (omelet station, hot line, cold line). The staff were extremely friendly and the location convenient. Complimentary shuttle to the airport. The physical plant is in the midst of a refurb but it's mostly quite nice. Comfortable bed. My floor (8) was a little loud with early risers and families. I think they offer quiet floors -- worth asking about. Great value for the money and I would stay here again.Have stayed here twice before because the rates are great for Clayton. It's an older hotel but clean with a free hot buffet breakfast. Rooms are a little small but nicely decorated and service was good. However, there is no sound insulation between rooms so we've had trouble sleeping through the night both times. The first visit we had a room by the elevator, and doors opening and shutting sounded like rumbling thunder. The second visit we were further away, but noise from the hallway and other rooms still woke us up. I think next time we'll try staying somewhere else in search of a quieter environment.My kids and I stayed here for 4 nights 10/21-10/25. We had a pleasant stay without too many complaint.The Good: Staff was friendly. The heated Indoor/outdoor pool was excellent especially for swimming in the middle of October. Free arcade room connected to the pool area was great entertainment for the kids. They are old games from the 80's but my kids enjoyed them and it was kind of fun for me to play games that I used to play when I was their age. Free breakfast buffet everyday. The owner of hotel was at the buffet every morning greeting guests which shows he cares about his customers. One morning the fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate out into the cold weather. My daughter had just gotten out of the shower and was wet and cold. One of the ladies from the cleaning staff gave her coat to her to keep warm while we waited. It ended up being a false alarm but it was a nice gesture from the staff member. Hotel restaurant was not bad and was not pricey like most hotels restaurants are.Not so good: Walls are thin so you can hear most everything going on in next room. We had a room at the end of the hall so we only had one side to worry about. Honestly it did not wake my kids up when neighbor used blow dryer so it was not that big of an issue. Pancakes at breakfast buffet were hard and not easy to cut. With buffet being free it was not that big of a deal to me.I got the room for a great price through Priceline. I would definitely stay here again.cons: Single room was small with very small bathroom.  Older building so we could hear everything out in the hallway. If noise is an issue for you, I'd ask for a room in a quiet area (ours was close to elevator).pros: Decent sized fridge and a small microwave! Service was excellent! Very nice helpful staff. Room was clean and bed was very comfy.Had a stay-cation in clayton where they have some cute shops and restaurants. The suite was very reasonably prices but you get what you pay for. The hotel is older. Pool was heated, very chlorinated, older but clean. Good for the kids- there were several playing in the pool. The reason it got a two star is for cleanliness. The fridge had not been emptied and the coffee cup was filled with someone else coffee!! I was not expecting it to have coffee and spilled it on myself- gross!!  There was a boogie wipes empty pack under the couch.This hotel was very nice. The place was clean and spacious. The staff was all very friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was great with many options. Great stay.I lost my jacket in one of the rooms after the chess tournament. I gave them a call the next day and told me they did not see my jacket, but gave me a call a day after and told me they found it. They are very honest, courteous and helpful.Despite mixed feelings based on the reviews here, I made a reservation under my Priority Club membership (which is free) and when I got to the hotel, they'd upgraded me from a queen room to a king room at no charge. Check-in was fast and friendly. They asked if we wanted to stay on a lower level or higher level and we chose higher level. I'm glad we did because they put us on the eighth floor, so we didn't have anyone stomping around above us.What others have said about the noise level is true. We happened to stay there while it was quiet with the usual type of guests on the floor (couples, families with kids), but unfortunately, while we got a renovated room with digital temperature control (we blasted the A/C!), ""hardwood"" floors (laminate), and the bed was amazingly comfortable, the walls and door are paper thin. It takes away from the comfort of the experience when you can hear someone urinating in the next room over and you're laying in bed. Space wise, the room was totally fine, but because the room we were in wasn't very deep, the door was only a handful of feet away and so any and all noise was heard on the hall (and that's a two-way street). Also, we were on the eighth floor but we could hear sounds from the street below. The building is old and not well insulated.I think they are still renovating certain wings because the second floor hallway near the door that leads out to the parking garage still REEKS of smoke, despite the fact that it's a non-smoking hotel. A great perk for staying here, especially in Clayton, is that the parking garage was free all weekend. We were also given vouchers for the breakfast buffet, though we didn't end up using them because we were headed out to brunch the next morning. Check-out was fast and easy, though we were not asked how our stay was. I would have said fine but still. I'm giving it four stars because our experience was fine and it's a very convenient place to stay but I will caution those who are sensitive to noise (as I am) to not stay here if you really want it QUIET. However, the bed was insanely comfortable and the bathroom was lovely! All depends on how you weigh out these pros against the cons.This place was really a disappointment.  First, there are no deadbolts on the doors...I don't like that. I was traveling with a coworker who ended up in a terrible room immediately off the lobby and where you enter from the parking lot... Very noisy. When we checked in she asked to be moved, they said they were sold out but that if she was unhappy with the room to come back and they'd see what they could do. So she asked them to just see what they could do now, and the guy at the desk says ""well we're sold out so we can't do anything."" Um, so why the heck did you offer to do something????  I'm in my room getting ready for bed, and can't stop sneezing.  Finally realize all the pillows are down, which I'm allergic to. Call the front desk...""well, I probably can't get you one tonight but I can do it tomorrow."" 25 mins later, no pillow. 11 pillows in the room, finally found one foam one mixed in with the rest so I got to spend the next day with bloodshot eyes and sniffles.  And then despite the hardwood floors there was hair everywhere in the room...floor, bed, shower...and mildew all on the shower curtain liner.  Seriously, never going here again. The one by the airport is a million times better. What a disappointment.The Good: 1) Great location. Located close to Forest Park, Washington University, and Delmar St.2) Affordable pricing.3) Old building, yet updated facility.The Bad:1) NO Air Conditioning! Let me say it another way- you have no control over the temperature. I am typically cold natured, but I was sweating at points in the room.2) No fan. Only noisy construction in the morning. I need sound to sleep soundly.3) On our 3rd day, I asked that the sheets be changed, which they did. Yet, they then failed to touch our bathroom besides changing out the towels. I can live without a streak free bathroom- but should I have to when I am paying? I think not.We decided to check into the Crowne Plaza Clayton for a quick night's sleep between arriving late for a road trip and having to get up early to be at an event we had planned. Sadly, the only thing we needed the hotel for, it didn't really provide.First, the pros:+ The staff was courteous upon check-in, and we received vouchers for a free buffet breakfast in the restaurant. + The hotel is very clean+ The complimentary breakfast we received was actually quite nice, including a made-to-order waffle and omelette station and several hot and cold items (breakfast meats, potatoes, french toast, pancakes, biscuits &amp; gravy, cereal, breads, danishes, yogurt, etc.)And the cons:- I have never stayed at a louder hotel in my life! Everything in the room seemed to make noise, especially the air conditioner! It was definitely pumping out cold air, so I don't think it was broken, but the noise on it was like a rumbling gas generator - and each time it would kick on, it was enough to wake me up (for comparison, at home, our bedroom is above the garage, and the garage door opening right below me doesn't even get me to roll over at night, so I'm a sound sleeper). We had a nice sized mini-fridge, but again, every time it kicked on it was so loud! I awoke frustrated and exhausted. Add to that the fact that we could hear people coming and going all around us - there is no carpeting, which I'm sure makes it easier to clean, but I think it also makes everything happening outside the room carry and echo more. Between kids running to the pool and our quiet neighbors getting to their room, it was midnight before the appliances alone kept me up. Obviously I can't vouch this problem existed in every room (the loud A/C specifically), but it did for us, and it was terrible.- The complimentary shampoos, conditioners, etc., were only half-full. I know I shouldn't expect much out of complimentary, but I was a little surprised to see this. The light in the bathroom was enough to shine through them as they sat in their little dish on the counter, and when I picked them up to hold them to the light I saw I was right. I don't know if they were previously used or they just only fill them halfway. Just seemed odd to me.I expected more from this hotel. I've heard great things about Crowne Plaza as a brand, but I've had much better experiences at Holiday Inn Express and Comfort Inn type hotels.Had the opportunity to stay at the Crown Plaza during a recent work trip. I loved this place before I even got there... Upon landing in St. Louis, I called for a shuttle pick up - when the shuttle got to the front the hotel called to Make sure I found the shuttle that had arrived. Checking in was quick &amp; easy, the person at the desk was efficient. My company had already booked accommodations in advance, and they were able to look up room, breakfast, etc. without any trouble. The rooms were clean and spacious, and I really appreciated their little additions that made the stay that much better. They included a little sleeping kit that included and eye mask, ear plugs, and lavender scented sheet spray... Definitely used all three! Bath set was pretty standard.. With the addition for a mini mending kit.The other staff at the hotel all extremely helpful with lots of suggestions.","This is a very nice historic like hotel.   The lobby is grand, and the hotel is very updated.   Priority members get free parking, Internet, and breakfast.  Very affordable.   Good location.  Will be backLast year my boyfriend and I did the New Years Eve party at the Crowne Plaza and it was by far one of the best hotel parties that I have ever been to. The package included all you could drink, a hotel room and dinner as well as brunch the next morning.Our room was beautiful and we slept very comfortably. Dinner was delicious, as they served a lobster tail stuffed with crab meat and a filet. We were stuffed before we ever started drinking! The alcohol was top shelf and there were three different ball rooms where three different bands played.Overall, it was a wonderful experience.Hotel staff was decent, however the restaurant staff was very sub par. Our first night the bar tender appeared to be extremely stressed and overwhelmed and not friendly. The free breakfast was over crowded and it took us nearly 15 minutes before we could get a clean fork. I would have rather paid for breakfast than endure that! The bussers were practically throwing dishes down, clearly not enjoying themselves in the slightest bit. The pool is more of small whirl pool with maybe 10 seats and most of it is shaded, so laying by the pool wasn't even an option. I would never stay here again.We have no complaints!  The only thing I could say negative is that it could use a little updating but other than that...we are very pleased.  The staff is all very nice.  The beds are very comfortable.  We got a great price on hotwire and free buffet breakfast included.  Overall very happy!Best hotel ever in Saint Louis and Clayton, MO area.I was here when the hotel is renovating, yet it still delivers a top notch service.  This hotel is great with hardwood floor.  I seems much cleaner than carpet.   Staff here is super nice.We stayed one night here. The customer service was great! It is an older hotel, and needs some updating, but over all we enjoyed our stay!I recently stayed here for a family member's wedding.  The hotel exterior and lobby are somewhat dated but the rooms are reasonably modern.  There is free wifi but it is slow with spotty ability to connect.  Loud hallways made for early wake ups.  On day 2 of our 4 night stay a bad odor developed in our room and persisted after being cleaned by the maid service.  This wasn't acceptable given the cost of the room ($130 a night) and my wife and I elected to stay at the Hyatt at the Arch for the remainder of the trip (cheaper and cleaner).  Not impressed with this hotel.Perfectly fine hotel. I was a nervous based on the mixed reviews!-Polite and competent staff-Fast check-in-Free shuttle service to/from the airport -Good sized room, clean and what we requested (king)-The A/C was fine everywhere-The grill/bar was ""okay"". Breakfast was fine, for a hotel and the bar staff was kind enough to stay open a tad late for us after the wedding upstairs-We were there for a wedding which was held in the ballroom. The food was solid (for a wedding) and the staff was hilarious-The elevators are a tad confusing. We had people all over the hotel (as it was a family wedding) and there was constant confusion as to what elevator one had to take to get to their room and if they were on a floor we could get to as ""Non Executives"". Several times, we ran had to run errands only to borrow other family's room keys to ensure we could get back to floor 5 or 6. -Maybe not hotel specific, but have you ever been to a wedding where the waitstaff starts out dinner service with a choreographed dance number to ""Be Our Guest"" from Beauty and the Beast? Me neither While nothing short of downright odd, it was hilarious and the staff was all good natured. Overall, for $100 a night, walking distance to things in Clayon etc, I'd stay there again.This hotel is the absolute worse in Clayton. The nightshift manager had me kicked out of hotel for no reason. Wrongfully accused and the cops show up at 1 am to say I have to leave. Now mind you it was my birthday to make his entire experience worse. I will never stay at the crown plaza or any affiliates. They are a racist driven property and caused displacement based on Rae and assumption. Without any proof or reason had me leave in middle of night. Again crown plaza and any priority club reawards properties have lost a customer for life.. The absolute most terrible experience! Fuck crown plazaFirst off, I have to say that the customer service in this hotel is bar none the BEST I have ever seen. Concierge, Valets, Desk Clerks, Housekeeping....lovely. They really did want to make sure my stay was great. I was supposed to get there Thursday night, but my plane was cancelled. So I called to let them know I would be arriving Friday and I wanted to make sure I wasn't charged for Thursday. Not only were they so friendly, but they changed my reserves to Friday morning and allowed me early check in. The downside to this experience was the actual hotel rooms. The bed are their signature heavenly beds, which I won't lie, are amazing. However, the walls are VERY thin and the A/C won't go below 70. For TX people, this is NOT OK. We are constantly hot. Especially after a night of drinking, your room needs to be about 40 degrees. We constantly heard ""sounds of love"" through the walls at all hours (rock on). The toilet in the bathroom was like industrial strength, one you'd see at an airport. The shower was NOT a garden tub, as the hotel amenities said it would be. The room has the nicest flat screen LCD TV that I've seen in a long time. However, they hooked it up using a regular cable. So the picture was terrible. Why spend all that money on a nice TV and hook it up with a cheap cable? The thought is beyond me. We couldn't find the key to the mini bar anywhere. The hotel lost money there. Not only that, but I can tell this hotel has been here a while. The floor we were on had a large ballroom...which hosted a wedding Saturday night. A Ballroom on a floor where people are staying? What? Also, the elevators were so slow and smelled terrible. Oh, they also allow pets in here. So you can bring your puppies. At first the woman at the front desk said that they don't have a walking service, but then one of the bellman said he would walk my friends dog. For $10. Cool. The sports bar in the hotel, is apparently the best in the city of Clayton. Lots of TVs, good cheap food...etc. Good times. I would come back here. I think. I would just ask to stay on another floor. It's also in a great location and everything in Clayton is within walking distance. So great.2.75 stars.Why wasn't there air conditioning throughout the building? The stuffy hallways, gym facilities, and dining lounge caused rivulets of moisture to soak through layers of tulle and satin, rendering our wedding garments an unkempt mess. The noxious odors wafting from the dark panels and ancient carpets of the original hotel compelled us to sprint through the labyrinthine corridors seeking fresher air, further saturating our clothes and sensibilities. Thankfully the beds and pillows were wonderfully cushioned (better to ease the headaches resulting from countless glasses of champagne) and the showers were generously designed, though they lacked sufficient water pressure.I stay here a few times a year for business and am always satisfied with the room and the service. I recommend the Executive Tower rooms as they are newer just seem more fresh. As one Yelper said here the balance of the hotel is an older refurbished hotel and the rooms definitely show it. I stayed here just a couple weeks ago and it was obvious that they are continuing upgrades which I have noticed over the past few years. All of which are positive. The Clayton area where this hotel is located is tops for foodies. You will never be without choices for a meal. Some of the best restaurants in the city are within walking distance of this hotel. My only negative comment is that the fitness equipment needs an upgrade. I know this is not a money maker spot for the hotel however many of us need a good workout room.Fantastic hotel.  They take great care of the guests, especially if you are a Priority Club Member.  The times I have stayed there the give you coupons for a free drink at the restaurant, 10% off the restaurant, and a free in room movie.The beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  The bathroom has a seperate shower from the bath tub.The actually have a full gym with dumb bells and cable machines.Not that familiar with Clayton, but the location seemed nice. Numerous restaurants and pubs within walking distance in the down town area. The hotel seemed a little old, but they did upgrade me to a suite. The staff is friendly which is a big plus. They had a free breakfast buffet and the hotel bartender was nice too. If I was back, I wouldn't mind staying here again.We showed up late in the evening to check in and even past 10 pm in the evening the staff was still upbeat and SUPER nice. I think the front desk guy's name was ""Rex"" and he was just awesome, very personable and a great sense of humor! The hotel was gorgeous and the room was very nice too. The view definitely could have been better (either a jail or a parking garage were our options) but then again, a business can't choose who buys the lot next to them. Everything was clean and they even had a little comfort package to help you get to sleep (eye mask, lavender pillow spray, ear plugs). The only reason it's not 5 stars is the fact that there is no breakfast with the room of any kind that you don't have to pay for. Even just a small continental breakfast with free bitty muffins would have been nice. Any room over $100 and I expect some snackage come morning.First of all the concierge here could not be nicer. From the main lobby this hotel is quite pleasing to the eye, there is a large chandelier hanging the high ceiling, the floors are an elegant cream colored marble etc. Based on the first impression of this hotel one would expect their room to be just as nice. However, my room was stuffy, dated and really just not nice to look at. If I were visiting St. Louis and had booked this room I would have been really disappointed based on room quality and the cost of it per night. Apparently this hotel is due to have some major upgrades in the near future so that is good.  The customer service makes this a 5 star hotel but the rooms are an eye sore and deserve 2 stars. This is a pet friendly hotel also which gives it plus points.Stayed here over Memorial Day Weekend and was pleasantly surprised for the very economical price. We especially liked the free parking! We did get a room in the older section of the hotel but the beds were great, the pillows were soft and we didn't have any complaints! One weird thing, no courtesy hair dryer in the room and we had to ask for a refrigerator as the only one in our room was a room snack bar one that they don't allow you to keep your own personal items in that fridge. There were a couple of weddings and receptions going on but we didn't hear a thing from those groups. It is conveniently located and we were able to get around the city easily. The Galleria Mall is incredibly close by as well as Delmar Ave and Forrest Park (all of which we took advantage of). Overall, definitely worth the money for the price!If yelp would let me, I'd give the Crowne Plaza-Clayton 4.5 stars.  It's clearly a refurbished older hotel, but the rooms are nice and large (especially the bathrooms).  It has a pool that's far enough away from most of the rooms, so that the whole place doesn't smell like chlorine.  The gym is also pretty good-- not large, but only a few people were using it.  One nice thing is that, Crowne Plaza is all about getting a good night's sleep--the bed was luxurious and they even provide a sleep cd, earplugs, and a bottle of aromatherapy linen spray!All together, I think it's a good place for both business travelers and families.Stayed a night before visiting Wash U. Service is fine and I got a good night's sleep, but the whole hotel is pretty darn outdated. Doesn't feel like a Crowne Plaza at all.Maybe the hotel itself as a whole is nice but my daughter and her friends stayed there recently, put down their credit card to secure the room, paid cash when they checked out and the front desk person conveniently forgot to credit their account. Now the hotel is not crediting her account. I gave the girls the cash for the room so now I have to pay double! I think this is horrible. I would never stay there again!!!","My husband and I typically like to stay at Crowne Plaza hotels if there isn't an Intercontinental Hotel in the area. Last night we stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Clayton because we've done both the Downtown and Lambert Airport locations - we wanted to try something different. First off, I think the hotel picture is misleading. We were led to believe this was going to be a pretty nice hotel. Not so much the case. The hotel staff is SUPER NICE. We are Priority Club Platinum Ambassadors and they automatically upgraded us to a suite on the 8th floor. However, this room proved to be a disappointment. The room was very small, smelled bad, and had a creepy heart shaped jacuzzi with mirrors everywhere. Seriously, all that was missing was shag carpeting, a stripper pole, and a strobe light. When we weren't happy with the room, the staff was very accommodating and even let us look at several different rooms and choose the one we wanted. We chose to stay in a 2 room suite on the second floor because it was the best of all our options. This room was nicer and in an updated tower of the hotel (our first was not) but it still smelled funny. We opened our mini friggie and found someones half drank bottle of Grey Goose so the fridge hadn't been checked apparently. Our bathroom had two showers (one tub/shower and one walk in shower) and the hot water didn't work in the walk-in shower so we had to use the tub/shower. We stayed at the hotel with another couple and their room next door to ours was super nice with an electric fireplace. Only two rooms in the hotel have these - room 800 and room 2014. The beds were very comfortable but the curtains on the windows were sheers and had no heavier curtain to pull shut so light shined in the room all night long. When we stood on the balcony of 2014, we could easily see into our hotel room due to the sheer curtains. Not good at night if you don't know the people next door! The hallways and lobby of the hotel are warm, however, the lobby is very pretty. The floor is marble and they have beautiful chandeliers. Hotel valet was $19 and self-park was $10 for a day - which they comped us for since we were Platinum Ambassadors. There are several meters outside the hotel which are free on weekends as well. I will say the area of this hotel was nice as Clayton is and the hotel is pet friendly. Lastly, we used rewards night points for our stay but was still charged $28+ at checkout due to taxes that the City of Clayton requires the hotel to charge guests (supposedly...) I've never paid a dime upon checkout at any other hotel when using reward nights. I guess in retrospect this hotel isn't HORRIBLE, but I won't be staying there again anytime soon.","['another', 'fun', 'plaza', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'due', 'quality', 'service', 'nice', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/lemp-mansion-restaurant-and-inn-saint-louis,Lemp Mansion Restaurant & Inn,3.5,$$,80,"Attended the Lemp Halloween Bash in October.....Loved it! 4 hours of open bar(s) and buffet(s) and the freedom to explore. There were tables and chairs scattered around the grounds and inside the various rooms, so there was always a place to sit. Most of our time was spent on the Scavenger hunt but only got about halfway through, couldn't find Otto the Bartender. It was a costumed event and as you would expect very interesting and creative sights were seen. We dressed in Edwardian clothes to appear more friendly to the ghosts that are said to inhabit the mansion and did in fact get a bit of activity on our equipment. We will be attending again next yearWhat a fun place with a romantic spooky feel!We came here for a book club meeting. We had read the Night Sister by Jennifer McMahon. The setting of the book featured a hotel and some paranormal activity so this location was the perfect setting for discussion.We came for the Sunday fried chicken dinner. It was easy to make a reservation for a large party (#14) and it felt like Friendsgiving as we passed the sides down the table. They replace the empty bowls with more food as you go. The chicken was some of the best I've had in MO (actually THE best thus far). The sides were great and there was a wide variety. A few in our group are vegetarians so they joined in despite it being ""fried chicken dinner"" and partook of the sides. It's a great deal for 17.95.The service was good especially for our large party.The Lemp is beautiful. Some of us are returning in December for the tour!I visited the murder mystery dinner for a friends birthday. The show was between each course and the actors were very funny. Lots of audience engagement as well. The salad served was ok - if you don't like a lot of dressing I would ask to get dressing on the side. There are also vegetarian options but just call ahead of time to let them know. The actual dinner was delicious! It was very much that Sunday dinner kind of meal and the dessert was also very good. There is also wine served multiple times throughout dinner.  It's definitely a fun place - I don't think anyone would be disappointed here!I just thought this place was awesome! I love history and I love tales of hauntings so I knew this was a must while in town for the weekend! I would have loved to do the ghost tour but they are only given one day during the week :-(. Made dinner reservations and was seated promptly in a gorgeous room at the bottom of the steps. The food portions were large and I thought my Steak Charles was great! My mom got the seafood ravioli special and said it was really heavy and salty, disappointing. Definitely take a walk around the house after dinner, the bathroom is awesome and the woman in the back gift store was telling interesting information about the history of the house. Next time I'm in town I'm staying here for the night! Don't forget to check groupon before going for dinner!I realize a lot of people give it less stars but you have to take into account that this place is more than just a restaurant. It is a piece of STL history.  The employees are great, the bar, though small is awesome.   Haven't eaten here in a while ( just hung at the bar) but it was always good. Their family style fried chicken dinner is the best!We very much enjoyed our dinner at Lemp Mansion this weekend. The food was So good. You know you are in for a good meal when the bread and butter are divine, the bread was warm biscuits and the butter was sweet and creamy.  I had never had Beef Wellington before, it was perfection. My boyfriend had the ribeye, which was huge and he also very much enjoyed. We also very much loved the charm and history of the mansion. There was some type of murder/mystery dinner going on in one of the dining rooms, it was kind of loud, but they sounded like they were having so much fun. Its a really good date spot, definitely something different :)Met some friends for dinner and some entertainment.  The dinner show was murder in maybury.  I played a Japanese man named Slung Low.  Anytime someone said Japan I had to stand up and clamp my hands together, bow and say AH SO!   It's $53 person for the meal and the show with a 14% tip In the price.  The salad had to many onions for me but it was still ok.  The fried chicken with red potatoes and garlic green beans was awesome.  We had tuxedo cheesecake for dessert.  That was a great dessert to end a meal.  Two glasses of wine come with the meal.  I don't drink wine and they were coming by offend with the wine during dinner.  The actors were great and everyone else played along and made it very enjoyable.  I had a lot of good laughs.  I wish my character had more lines in the shows, but not all the characters were in the show.  So if you go your character mite not have very mine lines are like my wife she had none.  Which she did not mind.  They do different shows every month.  If your looking for something different and fun I would highly recommend going.Lemp Mansion was an experience I enjoyed my visit here.  I brought my wife on a date here and the food was good, a bit pricey for me.  I love the inside of the dining area where we were seated, very romantic and they have a little bar area in the back.The wait was not bad at all, my food was pretty good, I am not a fan, but that could easily change, I only been there once so I am basing everything off of that one visit, perhaps when or if I go again, I could become a fan.  I had the prime rib and it was delicious from recollection.  My wife had a fillet mignon steak and chicken sort of entree, nothing impressive she said. Nonetheless, she enjoyed it, and I know my entree was good.  I will have to visit this place again as the time I am writing this review and the time I ate my food are just too great to remember every detail of the meal, having time between that meal and the present and putting it all together in a review is not feeling to cool, which tells me I was not impressed.  I know I would like to visit there again, which means they deserve a chance to ""WOW"" me!If I get there again, which also tells me it is not on a list of places to visit before I try some new ones, that it was not spectacular meal, I will order a different dish.  Sometimes that can make a difference or tell the truth in a restaurant.  I never try to get stuck on one dish too much, unless it is just freaky good!I say give them a try, even for a date night, I think you will enjoy it... however, I don't think you will be impressed.I am a fan every time I go on a road trip and we pass by this place we got to go especially for the Chicken dinner on Sundays! The bomb! all you can eat orgasmic of flavors! its ridiculous! I love love love the food! served fresh and hot and the waiters are always on point!The house it self I have never stayed the night will one day! (bucket list) but the first time coming here Me and the person I was with at the time experience something we cannot explain! it still freaks me out! so we go to the little museum shop in the back of the house and this nice lady gave us info on the house and history of ghosts in the area! as she was speaking I saw my partner looking all weird but didn't say anything till we walked away and said ""did u see that dude behind her old man he looked weird"" I said ""there was no man behind her what u talking about"" and as we exited the Lemps doors I kid you not we both felt so dizzy and out of breath like as if we toke a drug and we are getting high its hard to explained it was so bad both of us sat down on the benches that are outside the house it was hard to breath and see! As we both sat  there trying to get each other together to walk back to the car we both ran and felt creeped out! it was like someone hit us or we walk through something I will never forget that experience it was def not welcoming feeling it toke us a good 30 mins to get back to normal as we drove farther away from the house the better we gotThe second time I went I didn't experience anything Thank ya lord! but I did experience that super delicious food! well def come backWasn't where we had planned on going for my birthday dinner! But ended up being an amazing night!! Had a dish I've always wanted to try (beef Wellington)!! Most places no longer make it. So I was over the moon when I saw it on the menu! Service was amazing and the food was awesome!!! We will be back again! Next time we will go for their dinner theater!!We went with a Groupon for $50 and with an appetizer and no drinks, ended up spending about $25 on top of that.We were seated in a small room with maybe 6 tables. The walls were painted with a mural of leaves and the room was relatively quiet compared to the dinner theater happening in the room over. Our waiter was EXTREMELY professional, but not overly personable by any interpretation of the word. When we asked about the Lemp ghost stories, he seemed annoyed but quickly brought that professional (fake) smile back and suggested we could find any information we're interested in at the museum. (Side note: The ""museum""/gift shop did NOT answer any of our questions. We'll research the history on our own before our next trip or hope for a run-in with a more friendly/approachable staff member.)AS FOR THE FOOD- yum! They offer complimentary rolls and honey butter to start. The appetizer we ordered wasn't particularly impressive- fried mushrooms with no flavor in the coating. My fiance ordered the Prime Rib with green beans (no substitutions for the sides. They will tell you what will be served with your main course when you order) - ordered the meat medium and it was cooked to perfection. It was a nicely marbled cut and very flavorful. He loved the horseradish cream mousse they serve with it. I tried the Wiener Schnitzel simply because it was fun to say. The description in the menu is ""Provimi veal dusted in flour, sauteed, topped with bordelaise wine sauce."" The meat was tender, but overall, to my simple taste buds, it tasted like country fried steak and brown gravy. It was served with potato pancakes, which were the star of the show, and cold cinnamon apples. Glad to have tried it, but not interested in ordering it again. We will absolutely be back when we feel like splurging for a nice meal. I've got my eye on the Beef Wellington next time! Heads up- a 20% tip IS included automatically on any ticket with a Groupon, and the waiter didn't happen to mention that when he dropped off the bill with a blank tip line. We just noticed the major increase from our total.I recently was invited to a friends birthday party at a Comedy Mystery Dinner at the Lemp Mansion, I really didnt know what to expect but I thought it would be fun because I have always wanted to take in an evening in one of the most haunted locations in Saint Louis.I arrived around 6:30 to find some of my party already sitting in the dining room, I quickly grabbed a drink from the bar and decided to take my seat. It wasnt long before the cast of the show started to arrive and hand out our roles for the evening's show. The staff was friendly and the show was entertaining, however it really requires everyone to get into their assigned role and take on the part to be the most fun. The show itself was split into three acts, each of which were split between each course of our meal. The food was ok, it started off with a salad, then later came the entree which consisted of chicken rice and broccli. I am not a fan of broccli, and really wish that they would have had some type of option for substitution. In fact I noticed several people at my table of 15 passed on the broccli. The desert was a chocolate cheesecake which was pretty rich, so if you are not a fan of extremely sweet and broccli you might leave a little hungry for the $50 price.I picked up a groupon to the Lemp Mansion Restaurant on a whim. I have been back several times since. I didn't know what to expect when I went in the first time. The experience is one of a kind. The Mansion is old, and it is clear that the dinning rooms used to be functional parts of the house. One room serves as a bar complete with stained glass. Another is set aside for a murder mystery or dinner theater that is put on during the weekend. The food is a bit eclectic, with German, Italian, and American fare. Everything I have gotten there has been excellent. The staff have always been friendly and very efficient. I would highly recommend taking a chance on the Lemp Mansion if you are looking to get out of your comfort zone and just check out a restaurant that is a little different.We went for the Sunday Family Style dinner.  All of the food was well prepared and the wait staff were very attentive.  You will not leave here hungry.  Some of the items of special note were the chicken, green beans, apples and the ham.  The head waiter was also very nice to tell us about the history of the home and a lot of details we may not otherwise have heard unless we went on a tour.  The desserts fell a little short.  While the lemon meringue pie was very good, the chocolate pecan chess pie was not very good.  Other than the desserts, the entire rest of the meal was exceptional with great service.Sunday Chicken Dinner with friends today.  Seated promptly, good attentive service, tasty array of home cooking.  An experience I'd recommend for anyone wanting to play St. Louis tourist but not an every Sunday event.  Skip the Bloody Mary and fill that space with delicious mashed potatoes &amp; gravy.We had the pepper steak and it was superb. My friend from NYC said it was comparable and probably better to what they have there, considering the medium range price and the Gilded era atmosphere. Steaks were cooked perfectly to what we requested. Service was excellent, came on a Wednesday at 830 so it was not that busy.Awesomely unique spot in St Louis definitely worth checking out. Had a great meal here with awesome atmosphere. Homemade toasted ravs are great. Can't go wrong with any steak special of the night. Also, please save room for Bananas Foster that is prepared table side. Definitely worth going to for dinner or I hear the dinner theater shows are fantastic! Cool place!!Went for lunch today. I've lived in the area my whole life and had never been in the Mansion before, although I've always been fascinated with the home and It's history. My review will be very mixed because there were some things that were great, and some not good at all. First the good...nothing bad to say about our waiter. We didn't really interact with each other a whole lot but he was pleasant and attentive. And the house made toasted ravioli were the highlight of our lunch. They were awesome. The home itself was everything I imagined it would be. I've lived in old homes in St Louis all my life so the condition of the building seems pretty appropriate to me. The old fixtures in the ladies room, I thought were pretty cool. I did feel uneasy in the ladies room though and don't really know why. The couple things that weren't so great....The bread, I couldn't tell if they were suppose to be rolls or biscuits,  seemed to be old and reheated. One of them was so hard it couldn't even be eaten. The marinara sauce that came with the toasted ravioli tasted good but it wasn't warm or hot, it was cool with some cold spots. And my sandwich....I ordered The Prosperity,  could have been very good if it wasn't completely drowned in Cheez Whiz. I mean, literally drowning, in Cheez Whiz. And the bacon on my plate was definitely the kind you buy already cooked and heat in the microwave.  My daughter had the chicken strips off the appetizer menu and said they were ""just ok"". Maybe their dinner is better, my son and his girlfriend went for dinner and said that their food was amazing. I think we'll go back sometime for dinner or the Sunday chicken dinner based on other reviews. Overall we had a pleasant experience but the food could have been better.Would have been lovely to have experienced the murder mystery dinner, however upon making reservations a discussion about policy and IMS trade dollars resulted in the most sour customer service experience I've had with an adult in years. Policies are made to separate business from egos. I felt their policy was a tad rigid. I also, think any IMS trade has been more seamless and usually requires a phone call to verify on the receivers end. Just my opinion as customer.  I was still ready to set the reservation. Instead, the conversation was ended with a hang up. When I called to have a word on how the discussion with Patty was handled, Paul, her brother did nothing but commend her as her partner and stated, ""we all aren't our best all the time.""As a business owner, i know about both business etiquette &amp; policy. I feel this transaction was so poorly handled. I would have been better off talking to the younger daughter who may understand respect of others and would not have taken my inquiry as a personal attack.  Perhaps she would have been able to move past differences and continue with the reservation versus her hanging up like a brat. Good job, partner, good job.I love learning more about the paranormal and the supernatural, so this was always a place I wanted to go, and I finally got to this past summer. First of all, you have to call ahead to reserve a spot with the tour group. You must bring $20 in cash. They don't accept anything but cash. And if you're bringing anyone under 16, call and make sure it's okay. One of the tours is strictly for adults! We got there at 7:00 pm, I believe, and there was a two hour introduction. We were all under the impression that it would be just thirty minutes, maybe an hour, before we began touring. It was a bit much, but it was very thorough and informative. Our guides went through the history of the building, who lived there, who died, and how they died. We heard a couple things from upstairs, that sounded like a piano being played. The tour was very interesting and a couple of the rooms, especially the room where Billy Lemp killed himself, gave me some odd feelings. I swear I felt something touch my hand. The interior is beautiful and well-kept. It just adds to the feel of the old haunted house. We got up to the third level, where the young child's room was. He had suffered from elephantiasis, we were told. There was such a sad, yet sweet feel to the room. This is where she turned out the lights and asked the spirits to appear. There wasn't much activity, but the dog, Serva, did come into the room. My cousin and I did see something kind of smoky, but we couldn't tell if it was our imagination or real. I really enjoyed the whole tour, and it inspired me to do more research on spirits. I was very impressed with all the staff knowledge, and they were all very helpful. They also showed us a lot of cool pictures of spirit activity. They looked pretty convincing, and someone among our group took a picture with their iPhone and caught a huge orb. That was kind of crazy! If you're into stuff like this, this is definitely a good place to go. I would have loved to stay overnight! Maybe I will in the future.","Bacon potato corn chowder, dinner salad and wings, decent prices Wonderful Atmosphere Fair Fare good place to lunch.We have been here on 2 different occasions.  The first time we went in a Saturday night with a groupon. The place was stuffy and the waiters were stuck up. The place was empty and the food was bland. We were mad we still spent over $60 in addition to the groupon ... And at the fact that they add 20% tip to the bill!!!The second time we went for the Sunday chicken dinner.  For two people they gave us a lot of sides but started us off with two chicken wings and two drummies. The only sides we liked were the macaroni, mashed potatoes, and gravy. The others were just meh. We then asked for white meat chicken and waited 10 minutes and the waiter came back with more wings. We repeated that we would like chicken breast and he said the wings are white meat but he can get a breast if we wanted one... Uh, yes we would.  So we waited another 10 min and he came back with 2 breasts. Overall the chicken was dry.After two different tries and the price of this restaurant, we will not be going back.We are ghost hunters. Let me start out with that. We like creepy, but look for clean, maintained, cared for places. In some areas, Lemp Mansion hit the mark, in other's it didn't. However, I would venture to say that in the places it didn't, it wasn't for lack of trying. This history of this place, and not just the Lemp history, clings to the walls like some kind of psychic grime. It permeates the place, extending dark tendrils of energy into every square inch of the site. The Jou Jou is heavy and obvious and no amount of scrubbing will be able to get that out. It was just what we were looking for. We stayed in the Elsa Suite, which is on the top floor and rumored to be the most haunted. The suite is in very good shape, although the hall and stairways leading to the room could stand a carpet cleaning. The room directly faces the freeway, and being there in the summer leaves you dealing with a swamp cooler in one window that has a very thin barrier to the outside, letting in a tremendous amount of freeway noise. That said, the room delivered. Upon entering, I immediately began to experience vertigo and bothersome neck pain that lasted until I left the room after having to lay down on the bed for 15 minutes.  During the night, and above the din of the freeway, my husband and I heard loud sighing and breathing that came from neither one of us, and located in between the bed and the mirror across from the bed. We slept with the light on until after 4:00 am and when we finally turned it off, I awoke to an interesting dream that detailed what I believed to be an injury of a person who had been there before. The staff was VERY nice, very responsive and not rude as prior reviewers stated they experienced. I would have given this place 4 stars, for the experience, because if you are looking for haunted, this is the place. However, the partition in the window around the swamp cooler in the Elsa Suite was pretty flimsy and let in a ton of noise. The bed was comfy, the room clean and the ambiance, everything it's cracked up to be. Go here with your eyes open, don't expect the sleep and you'll have a grand old time. Visit the gift store and have a conversation with the curator. It will be a good use of your time.....Happy Hunting.Went to the murder in Marbury dinner theater. First time for me. It was great! The actors are fantastic sports! They handled would be hecklers gracefully. The food was delicious with generous portions. And the servers are fantastically hospitable. My only concern is the intimate proximity of the tables. But I suppose bumping a chair here or there gives you grounds to spark small conversation.We just had our 1st dinner at the Lemp tonight. We used a groupon we paid 25.00 for 50.00. The food was just ok and service was as you would expect. But nothing exceptional at all We had our 1 yr old with us and asked if they had a kids menu. Our waiter said no, but we can do chicken strips or white pasta with chicken. So we order the pasta. When our bill came the kids pasta was 11.95. Then we noticed he added 20% gratuity! WHAT??? They stated on the menu party's over 6 would be charged 18%. I hardly think my husband, 1 yr old and myself are 6. Basically the extra $25.00 coveted our gratuity. Disappointed to say the least!The Lemp Mansion is known for the historic preservation of the old home of the famous Lemp Brewery family, ghost hunting, murder mystery dinners, a B &amp; B, etc.  Overall, it is a neat place to visit, if you can handle the smell of old musty things.  When it comes to the food, eh.  I've had dinner and lunch twice over the years and wasn't impressed.  But, I heard about the family style fried chicken dinner on Sunday and decided to give it a go.  We were greeted by a waiter in an oversized, wrinkled, dirty, suit/costume?  It was comedic at best.  He stopped by to tell us that his assistants would be by to deliver our family style meal.   Little by little, it came.  The chicken itself was well seasoned.  It was good except for the thighs, which tasted very very old.  Let me repeat...very very old.  The corn was floating in butter, the butter that came with the bread was NOT fresh, the gravy was soooo friggin thick, etc.  Not good.  The upside is that there was a ton of food.  But, the servers were not attentive and the whole experience, not great.  Next time I go, it will be for a tour, not for the food.Place was freezing cold 63! My salad had shrimp that was cut lengthwise and laid cut side down so it would appear that you had more! The Mayfair dressing was good and the clam chowder. The ravioli had spinach in it so my son didn't like it. Our waiter was very nice and attentive staff. We won't go back.A bit crusty.  The waiter, not the food.  The general ambience is old and musty.  I get the idea the rehab of this restaurant was done in the 80's and not much has been done since.  Still, it's a very interesting place to just walk around.  My wife tells me there's a shower in the ladies room and one of the employees said it was the first shower in the US, imported from Italy.  There is a little museum with an attendant docent who has apparently encyclopedic knowledge of all things Lemp.  It was fun peppering her with questions and I think she enjoyed it too, although she was also a bit crusty, so it was hard to tell.They feature a lot of chicken dishes here.  We tried the Chicken Lilian, named for the famed ""Lavender Lady"" who married and divorced one of the Lemps way back when.  Her namesake chicken dish was rolled stuffed chicken breast, breaded and baked, then placed on linguini with cream sauce and more cheese on top.  It weighs in at about a million calories, but it was very good.  Just a bit overcooked, but that stuffing has to cook too, which makes it a challenge.   We also had the Chicken Marsala, which had an unbelieveably delicious sauce with red and yellow peppers.  Not sure what else, but it was great.  It came with mashed potatoes, which were not real hot but tasted good, especially with the sauce. After dinner and nosing around the museum, we walked up the stairs to get a feel for the Inn part. It was appropriately spooky and dated.  Although we just came for dinner, most of the customers that night were watching a dinner theater and there seemed to be lots of laughs.  We'll probably try that sometime.  I give the Lemp mansion a lean 4 stars mostly because it's such an interesting place.I've only been there once and that was for lunch, but quite possibly the best tasting meal I have had in St Louis for 3 years. Plenty of reasonable appetizers, lunch sandwich choices and entrees.  I HAVE TRIED TOASTED RAVS ALL OVER THIS TOWN, AND THESE ARE BY FAR THE BEST THAT I HAVE EVER HAD!  The ravs had grated cheese all over, and despite a slightly small dipping sauce, I will get them over and over again. The cod entree was delicious with great mashed potatoes and veg.  I had the soup instead of salad and the chicken rice was great tasting. Add a couple of small pretzel dinner rolls and it was a complete taste sensation I will remember.(they are NOT open for dinner every night)My wife and I have been going to dinner at Lemp Mansion for over 10 years.  These days we get there about 6 times per year (since a lot of other restaurants decided to cut corners) and we have had the Chicken Lillian (my favorite), Chicken Valle Douge, Fried Shrimp, or Chicken Lamar.  They also offer a shrimp Cajun pasta special on occasion that is also outstanding.  Service is top notch and we ask for Don or Matt.  The food comes out hot (surprisingly hard for some restaurants to do) and in a timely manner.  We also get (and highly recommend) the dinner salad with the (creamy Caesar like) house dressing.  The rolls are also very good and they are served with a honey butter.  I would recommend reservations a few days ahead of time, but we were able to get 4 of us a table on a Friday in November with a hour notice.  The dining rooms are unique with ~14 foot painted ceilings, neat wall decorations, and a fireplace in one of the rooms.  Prices are also very reasonable for what you get.  My only tweak was to ask for adding some Craft beers to the menu.  They said they are working on some and hopefully they'll have some in the near future.  My wife is happy with the wine selections, and don't forget to check out the gift shop after dinner.  So if you want excellent food and top notch service at a fair price in a very unique setting, this place is for you.Update:  Had a great dinner, again, on February 7th, and now they offer Founders Porter - great beer to complement a great meal!I went here last night with a Groupon. I paid $25 for $50 worth of food. I had no idea that they automatically charge 18 percent gratuity when you use a coupon.  On their menu it states that gratuity is added to parties of 6 or more but it was only two of us. What a total rip and the food was horrible. My friend and I ordered the steak Diane and it was soooooo salty.Even though this haunted mansion is known for its Halloween horrors,  my first experience here was for a Thanksgiving horror.My mom really didn't want me to cook Thanksgiving dinner for her (a more realistic statement would have been that my mom BEGGED me not to cook Thanksgiving dinner for her...). Our best options looked like some revolving restaurant at the Millennium, or Lemp. I chose Lemp because I had never been there and thought it would be a cool STL tradition. And also, a more realistic statement would have been that I chose Lemp because it was HALF the cost of the other restaurant. I really had to not look at Facebook as we made our way down Cherokee, which seemed just as abandoned as usual. My friends were discussing Wal-mart workers striking and the ""horrible people who make other people work on Thanksgiving"". Clearly my friends have never worked retail or in the service industry. I used to beg to work Thanksgiving. Seriously. Get paid time and a half, boss usually buys us lunch out of guilt, and make it home in time for dinner without having to help, and everyone's already drunk enough that they forget to ask you why you are still single. And as far as waiting tables, again, begged for the Turkey Day shifts. Pity tips and drunken, overzealous holiday cheer. Now THAT'S a holiday bonus. Stone me now, but I don't really feel too sorry for *most* people who have to work on Thanksgiving. Most of us have done it at one time or another in our lives. That being said, I don't think the people at Lemp have the same perspective that I do, because pretty much every staff person we encountered looked pissed, hungover, stressed, and super unhappy to be there. We were directed to the Grand Hall even though we had reservations at the Mansion, which was annoying, except we got to ride in what could only be described as a cattle elevator. Once we finally arrived at the Mansion, the completely rude hostess snapped at my mom and made us wait awkwardly in the cramped foyer 15 minutes past our reservation time (noon). We were seated and given a lackluster explanation of the process (family-style meal), and then given the opportunity to order drinks.We didn't seem to have a designated waiter, and three different people waited on us throughout the process, which was slightly confusing. Clearly the system broke down. I had extremely low expectations (as I do with going out on any holiday), and the food here still failed to meet them. It was pretty disgusting. Seriously. First, all the food was ice cold. I get that the whole family-style thing would make it difficult, and that doing it buffet-style would have been impossible with the layout of the building, but they could have done a better job. I mean seriously, all of it, cold. The turkey was the worst, cold and salty, stringy. It's like they just shredded it. The stuffing tasted good, but was just sticky cement-like goo. Everything else was forgettable.The mansion was gorgeous, but the mood was really depressing. By the end of the experience, I kind of got why this mansion is famous for all of the suicides that took place there.The staff were working their asses off, and it's a really cool neighborhood with a certain charm and mystique. I'm definitely going to return for more St. Louis fun, but I have to give this an ""I've had better"" rating, and wouldn't bring anyone here that I was trying to impress. P.S. Sorry for being the dick that made you all work on Thanksgiving. If you had eaten a Thanksgiving meal that I cooked, you would understand why it was necessary.P.P.S. At $24.99 a person, I still think this place was a good value and would recommend it to others. Just come with the right attitude, because if you're depressed when you come here, there is no hope for you.Called for reservations.  Said not needed no waiting.  Arrived 20 minutes later and was told a hour wait for two people.  Told him we were told no waiting 20 minutes ago.  He said maybe it would only be 30 minutes.  Very disappointed.  I wouldn't eat at lemp if I was paid.  I've eaten there many times in the past and recommended Lemp to friends but I guess their service has just gone downhillI recently attended the Lemp's Halloween Bash and it was my first time at this historic St. Louis haunted landmark.The place was packed so I was not able to fully enjoy it but the staff was pretty nice in keeping everything running smoothly with the event.  They had 3 bands positioned around the premises, and you could go in and out as much as you wanted.  They had a small selection of food, which you paid for a bigger selection so I was disappointed in that.  Their unlimited drinks were limited to beer and witches brew from what I saw.I had fun and it was something new.  I hope to go back to actually see the place in the future.We're regular visitors for the Sunday Family Style Dinner, and enjoy it thoroughly. With all-you-can-eat pan fried chicken, roast beef, ham, mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans, mac and cheese, biscuits and more, it's a feast for the hardy to be sure. The chicken is exceptional and reminds me of home ... pan fried (not deep fried) in small batches; crispy and salty ... I expect to see Grandma come out of the kitchen. The gravy, too, is amazing. Made in small batches from the chicken fat, it's a real treat (and goes really well over the real mashed potatoes.)If you don't have a large party, you can usually show up and get seated fairly quickly. However, always make a reservation during the month of October, as this is Lemp's busy time, all the time.I have previously visited Lemp Mansion for an awesome rehearsal dinner circa 2009 and a great wedding reception era 1980's.  Tonight we had a Groupon for dinner and thank goodness!  It's a fun place with lots to look at and plenty going on.  There was a wedding reception in the yard and a mystery dinner theatre in one of the dining rooms.  Lots of customers in all the dining rooms.  Business was brisk!  We had reservations for 7PM and arrived promptly.  We were told to have a seat and that it would be about 15min.  We went to the bar and had a drink and the bartender was friendly. We were taken to our table within the 15min.  We ordered and our salads arrived-we got the Mayfair dressing for old time's sake, but it was more like Mayo dressing, very thick and greasy.  My honey loved the rolls with honey butter, me not so much.  He ordered chicken parmesan which was an enormous portion with 2 huge chicken breast halves and a pound of fettucine with tomato sauce.  He loved it and had enough for 2 more meals left over.  I orderd the blackened salmon and it was cooked dry as a popcorn fart and hard as a brick- I would have been embarrassed to serve it.  It came with mushy overcooked frozen veggies and hashbrown casserole.  Pretty disappointing for $22.  Our waiter did not check on us once. We got our bill, but didn't notice that the tip had been added and we added more, so the lame waiter got an awesome tip-our fault of course-we checked for items purchased, but didn't add it up-HI we know :(  So, as I said thank goodness for that Groupon.  I will stick to Lemp Mansion for parties only.  No more restaurant dinners here!What a beautiful mansion. My wife and I were in attendance of a friends wedding here, last October.  We had a wonderful time checking the place out and taking pics. The first time we heard of the place was on Ghost Hunters I believe, they did a show here talking about all of the ghosts. I didn't see any of those, but I did see lots of beautiful history.  The little bar was great, I really did love the dark ambiance of it.The Lemp Mansion is not only  a creepy cool old mansion but it is an Amazing piece of St Louis history (I wish the caves were still accessible). Like anywhere this place is what you make it. Go have fun and let your hair dan, the staff is great and might have a ghost story or two.The Sunday menu is exactly what you grew up on at your grandmothers house. Pan fried chicken not deep fried and gravy made from the chicken grease. The sides are outstanding, roast beef, ham w/pineapple, cinnamon apples, mac and cheese, green beans, corn, rolls,  and they just keep coming. Everything is served family style so bring your appetite and your wallet. While it may be a bit pricey at $17 per person + drink and tip, this isn't your average KFC, Lee's or Popeye's and the setting is worth the visit alone.I have spent the night here and we have had dinner, but my favorite thing to do here is to come here in the evening and sit in the very dark bar and drink, and maybe enjoy some handmade toasted ravs.  Nothing beats the ambiance, its so warm and cozy, even though its supposed to be haunted.  The bathroom is really big and in the middle is the first ever free standing shower in the US that was brought over especially for the Lemp family.Service here is really good, and if you are there on a Friday evening, dont be alarmed if you see people walking around dressed like a dead sea captain or a dead president, they do a dinner theater, that looks pretty fun.  Be warned though, that this place has a menu filled with provel.The fried chicken was really good. But everything else was cold, from a can, and just icky! This is a fun place to go to at least once because of the intriguing history and possible haunting. We went there to check it out and gorge on fried chicken. Everything is served family style, but it truly is all from cans and covered in either loads of pepper or random gravy. The mashed potatoes are definitely from a box, or at least, really taste that bad. Being a foodie, this was not for me. Glad I tried it though since my sister and I had a fun time scaring my Mom about the lavender lady ghost!","Went here with the BF randomly on Sunday to satisfy a hankering for fried chicken. (They don't come often, but when they do, it's best not to ignore.) The Lemp did a fantastic job.Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, mac and cheese, ham, roast beef, stemmed veggies, apple sauce and god know what else was on the table, it was all delicious. For around $17 a per person, yes, some might see this all-you-can-eat, brought to your table as a little pricey, but I thought it was well worth the money. Especially with the history and beauty of this spot.I have only been here for the Sunday family style supper.  Traditional homestyle food served in bowls for everyone at the table to share.Walking in the building made me feel like I walked back in time.  All the old mill work (wood trim) and high ceilings just seemed to make me want to turn off my cell phone and enjoy the moment.Having a group is nice here, because the group shares the table and food on the table.  When you want more just ask.  This is like a family get toether with people I get to choose and eat great comfort food...   Plus no clean-up.I remember fried chicken, roast beef, green beans and mashed potatos.  I know other things were on the table, but that is what I know I asked seconds on.  There was very attentive service that night.This was expensive (I think we spent about $100 for four with tip, great service) and I have not done it for awhile, but it is worth it.Not sure I'd recommend the Sunday brunch which is lots of heavy, German and Southern food.  Picture fried chicken (which was pretty darn good), green beans, corn, mac &amp; cheese, rolls with honey butter, cinnamon spiced apples, cole slaw, pickled veggies, ham, and roast beef in never ending quantities on your table.What I DO recommend is the tour.  It's $5 and the historian has memorized 15,000 pages of Lemp history (with 9,000 pages to go!).  She'll take as long as you want and you'll never exhaust her knowledge of the family history.Friends and I were on a roadtrip to St. Louis specifically to stay at the Lemp Mansion.  It is reportedly haunted so we decided to check it out for ourselves.  Some of us stayed in the Lavender suite, another friend stayed upstairs in the attic suite.  The Lavender suite is large with a separate sitting/dining area, and an amazing bathroom.  We ate dinner in the restaurant downstairs and enjoyed the Steak Charles.  This is a B&amp;B however breakfast is an assortment of muffins, breakfast bars, and juices left in the room.  There is a mini fridge and microwave in the hall which came in handy since dinner was generously portioned.  The grounds are lovely and often used for weddings and private parties.For those that don't know the story behind the Lemp Mansion, I encourage you do so before you read this review, a lot of cool background there. Semi-related, can you even remember life before Wikipedia?But I digress. Our department went to the Mansion today to celebrate a co-workers 15th anniversary with the company. She claimed that she never had a problem ordering different things on the menu since everything was delicious. Most of the entrees were between 8 and 13 dollars, which was fair. The waiter started us off with some fresh rolls with honey butter (I'm a big fan of that salty sweet combo). A few of us ordered the Szechwan Pasta with either chicken or shrimp. It came with steamed broccoli, parmesan and provel cheese, and a cayennne/cream sauce. I had no complaints with the dish - except I wish it would have had more chicken.Another co-worker ordered roast beef (dipped in au jus) and swiss sliders that came on wheat pretzel rolls. It looked delicious!For dessert, they had everything from New York cheesecake, to lemon meringue pie. I ordered the carrot cake (which came without raisins or walnuts, thank you!) with cream cheese frosting. The mansion also features Murder Mystery Dinners for small groups and on Sunday's they have family style meals where they bring out large portions of chicken, glazed ham, potatoes, green beans, etc. You can also order a few of the beers produced by the Lemp Brewery, including their Jurassic Dark beer. If you're a lover of haunted places, old mansions, and/or great food, stop by the Lemp Mansion. With hauntingly good eats, a spooky atmosphere, anyone in St. Louis would kill to be here.I participated in the murder mystery dinner and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I had been to another murder mystery event several years ago and thought it was cheesy/not worth the money.  This one is FAR better.  It had its corny moments, but they did a really good job of engaging the audience throughout the entire dinner and overall, it was really entertaining.  This lasted a bit longer than I had expected, so just be prepared to spend a good two and a half to three hours from start to finish. (Also - I went in jeans and was underdressed.) Efficient/courteous servers and really good food as well.I ate dinner at Lemp Mansion the other night, and it's not something I'm planning on repeating anytime soon.The thing that truly made the experience disappointing was the dinner company -- not mine, of course, but the other patrons around me.  My group was in a lovely room off to the side, with lots of ferns and paintings, but we had the misfortune of being seated next to these two families that were treating the restaurant as if it were their own home.  They were drunker than I've ever seen anyone in a restaurant in St. Louis, horribly foul-mouthed in front of their little kids -- a personal pet peeve -- and were acting disrespectful to the wait staff.  They were almost impossible to ignore.  It didn't seem to be ruining the meal for the rest of my group, so I didn't do anything, but I wish that staff could intervene when other patrons are being so obviously inconsiderate, instead of at times even egging them on!The food was okay, but overpriced.  I had the Szechuan Penne (albeit an uninteresting choice), which was about $18, but there wasn't very much Szechuan to it -- more white sauce and cheese than anything else.  I ate about half of it and brought the rest home for the next day, but even after baking it in the oven for 30 minutes there was too much oil involved to make it palatable.  The food gets a solid 3 stars, or maybe even 2.5.The atmosphere seemed neat, too, but there was just too much detracting from it to make it enjoyable.  It also seemed as if there was a similarly rowdy bunch of diners in every room -- including what seemed to be the loudest wedding party, etc. I've ever heard -- so nowhere was spared.  All I wanted was a peaceful dinner enjoying the Mansion's charm!On the way out, the crowd I saw around the bar was literally one of the douchiest-looking I've seen in St. Louis.  And I use that word very, very sparingly.I won't be back.Very interesting place if I say so myself. I read up on the history of Lemp Mansion before joining my family here for Thanksgiving. I wasn't moved by the rumored hauntings, but was in awe about its past. Anyway, to the review... for Thanksgiving, DO make reservations (thank goodness we did), DON'T plan to wait inside - the place was so ambushed that some groups were outside in the snow, so bring a heavy coat (they have a coat check-in). Once you've passed the host station, you have ample time to take a mini tour of the house. I don't know how many dining rooms there were, but the place was packed! They were servers hustling around you (with the greatest manners), bus boys immediately clearing off tables, and of course... the people smiling and enjoying a turkey dinner with their loved ones. We were seated in one of the many large dining rooms they had. Endless turkey dinner consisted of dark/white meat, cranberry sauce (legit stuff right there), stuffing (kinda mushy), good ol fashioned mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, dinner rolls, hmm.. green beans, waldorf salads and to top it off, pumpkin pie! Considering the amount of people they were serving to and the amount of time they had, it was a decent meal. I'd come back on an off-holiday, hearing that they have a pretty good lunch meal.We came for one of their murder mystery dinners and had an awesome time. While the show and the game was a lot of fun, The food was only ok, we started with the beer cheese soup (passable can taste beer and cheese, not too salty), salad was served with the usual dressing choices, nothing special here. The main entree had both chicken and beef: chicken was the usual semi overcooked dry meat. The beef was a little better but again nothing impressive about this meal. Overall the food only gets my 2 stars. I added one more star for the place and the show. The atmosphere of the mansion is super spooky and the perfect location for a murder mystery. If you get in early, you can look around the place, and if possible you can catch the last tour before dinner. There was also a bar to chill at while you waited for dinner to start. We had a pretty large group and they were able to accommodated everyone and allow everyone to play as big or as small a part as they wanted.My Lady and I was at a Masquerade Event....The Food was very Good and the service was superb!  I am a fan! It had a distinct look and was very moved by the atmosphere!I have lived in STL area all of my life.  I finally went to the Murder Mystery dinner and loved it.  This is a great place to go with a group of people.  Everyone participates, you make fun of each other, and you get to let your hair down.  The actors are nice and the crowd feeds off of each other.  The food is good but not great.  it's a preset meal so you know how that catering thing goes.  Yet the price for the event with the food is very reasonable.  However, the caramel chocolate pecan topped cheese cake was heaven.  I have never had a cheesecake so smooth so rich and not the least bit tart.  Loved it.  I will go back for sure!I went to the Lemp Mansion this past weekend for the Charles Dickens nightmare show, and indeed it was a nightmare. Only kidding...I went with my boyfriend and we sat with 3 others at a table. They were lovely. We started off with a few drinks, a name badge of a Charles Dickens character and then we began.All of the festivities were great. The theatre was very exciting and involved everyone at the dinner.  The food wasn't great, but normally at these theatre events the food isn't superb anyways. We had beer cheese soup (which was surprisingly good), a salad, steak and chicken and then a cheesecake to top everything off.I would definitely recommend a theatre for anyone who is interested in branching out and trying something new in St. Louis. If you aren't as adventurous I would say go do something a little less risque... (if you will)Update. the issue of multiple charges was rectified and the manager was efficient about the entire process. She also ask I clarify the price, $94 dollars not $100.00. That total was also after gratuity.If you like dinner with your theater or theater with your dinner, try the Lemp Mansion Dinner Theater. Saturday night was ""Clueless"", an audience participation play based loosely (very, very loosely) on the famous board game ""Clue"". We had a group with the Gateway Hemophilia Association which was a sponsored learning event by Baxter Pharmaceuticals so there was a power point presentation prior to the dinner. The Lemp staff accommodated our entire group and Baxter's presentation easily. The meal included a wonderful soup, a salad and the main entree which was a baked and breaded chicken and rice dish. The dinner roll reminded me of a pretzel type of bread. The desert was ""cheesecake du jour"" and was so rich I couldn't finish it. The staff was incredibly friendly, the bar prices are higher than I normally like but the atmosphere of having dinner in a haunted mansion more than makes up for it.I can't think of a bad thing to say about the place.  We went on sunday, so we go the family style fried chicken dinner that is standard that day.The chicken was crispy, green beans good, ham delectable, roast beef delicious, apple sauce splendid, and the mashed potatoes melted in my mouth.And it was reasonably priced.  $20 a person for all you can eat dinner, you can't beat that.Will definitely return!Excellent food!  Also, the staff went above and beyond to make you feel at home!  The mansion itself is Amazing!We went here for a wedding reception. The most memorable thing was the elevator at the end of the night filled with drunk wedding guests. There was an ""Elevator Operator"" that wore white gloves and it was an old school elevator that I was frightened may bust down due to how many people were on it, but we made it safely to the ground floor. It is a neat space however I never really saw the front of the mansion or got a good feel for how the place was laid out, maybe that is the point? I have heard good things about the Mystery Dinner Theater and whatnot though. There was one guy who was yelling at the wedding guests to keep the drinks off the dance floor. Dude, it's a wedding, people are going to bring their drinks on the dance floor......people need to get down AND get their drink on....it kind of goes together. Duh. Super cool bar though down the street, The Stable, basically the whole wedding went to this bar b/c the wedding ended at 11pm. They had great beers on tap.When I had my bachelorette party in September 2011, my Matron of Honor decided to have it during one of the mystery murder dinners at the Lemp.  In general, I had a lot of fun.  The house had a spooky quality to it and I would have loved to explore further.  The dinner was excellent and the show was very entertaining.  I was even called upon to act out a part in the show, probably because I stood out since I was wearing my bride-to-be sash and veil.  The only complaint came when one of my lactose intolerant friends called to make her reservation.  The dinner listed is heavy in dairy, so she asked what could be done to accomodate her.  She was told that they couldn't do anything for her, and she should eat beforehand.  She didn't think it was fair to spend $50 but not get a meal.The night of, my friends and I were sitting at our table discussing that particular outrage.  Someone (a manager maybe?) overheard and approached to ask what the problem was.  We told him and he said not to worry.  He then catered to my friend the entire night, double-checking everything she could eat and bringing out all of her dishes (and even some special dishes nobody else got) dairy-free.  I wish I would have gotten that man's name, because he really helped make the night that much better.I'm looking forward to spending a night here sometime and coming for lunch.Went to a wedding reception here and it was great!  The staff was friendly and helpful. It was SO hot the night of the reception and I think they could have put out more fans for everyone but overall it was great!  *(Yes, the open bar helped make my experience wonderful- but I'm sure I would have been impressed regardless)A couple different reviews.  We have been her for just dinner, no show.  Food was good.  The place is old, big, and a little erie!  I swear I saw a shadow in the bathroom!  Scared the heck out of me.    As far as the murdery mystery show...we got free tix.  So it was well worth it! ;)  The show was good, entertaining...not a blast...but was entertaining.  Don't know if I would want to pay $50 for it.  Maybe $35 to $40?  The dinner was decent...but not very light!  Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, etc etc.  My arteries clogged but it tasted pretty good!  On to more important things...NEW YEARS EVE AT THE LEMP...now I don't want to spill the beans and ruin how great it it.  But for $65 you get an awesome dinner, a full bar all night and The Hush Band.  We always have a blast here for NYE.  I think this is our 8th year here!  It's a great time!","The Lemp mansion is beautiful. The food is really fantastic as well. I would definitely recommend you visit Lemp and even eat there.  The overnight stay is fairly expensive and without the haunted tour its pretty pointless.I wish I could write a review about Betsy the docent, the person who gives the haunted tours for Lemp. She would get a big fat 0.0 for ruining our stay at Lemp.In 2007 I booked an overnight stay at Lemp for my sister and I for her birthday. We booked in early spring for a Halloween night. I contacted Betsy several times in an effort to ensure we would be able to participate in the tour. This was a big deal for my sister, something she really wanted to do. I'm still mad at Betsy to this day for just blowing us off and ruining our stay. HUGE waste of money.Here is my blog from our overnight:Our evening at Lemp was sadly uneventful. Betsy, for whatever reason, decided NOT to do the tour of the mansion which basically ruined the entire experience for us. She also didn't bother to return any of my last four phone calls in regard to the tour, which she assured me would take place when we spoke in May. The other guests were also disappointed to learn there was no tour that night. Now Betsy does tours all through October but Lemp is known for being haunted so how do you NOT do a tour Halloween night? The following morning I was beyond ****** to find out that Betsy was in the mansion bar all ****** night.I can't see myself ever spending the money to stay all night ever again after this. The tour was the entire focus of the stay for us and for the other guests. The house is great, the food  is amazing but Betsy definitely has put me off of being a repeat customer. I was a little disappointed to find that the bed in the room was only a full size for us to share and that the bath towels were really scratchy. Given the extravagant lifestyle of the Lemps I would think that larger beds and plush towels would be in keeping with the atmosphere.it's so spookyyyyy... my friends and i decided to be impulsive and stopped in for appetizers and a bottle of vino.we explored the gift shop and did some reading about the Lemp family before we were seated.  our server was very nice and friendly.  i asked him if he's ever seen any spirits around from working here.... his response: 'there are plenty of spirits in the bar."" HAR HAR HAR.the artichokes and especially toasted ravioli were scrumptious.  the bread/butter they bring to your table is delicious too...  honey churned butter that they do downstairs!i'd like to come back one day for the full tour.  sadly, they are offered only on Mondays.Here's the deal. The building is nice, the rooms are large, and the place has an interesting history. But the place is overpriced, the staff and management are rude, and despite a mildly creepy feeling undoubtedly due to my knowledge of the sad Lemp history, I didn't experience anything paranormal during my stay, even with camera, dvr, ouija board, etc. I wandered the dark halls by myself for hours trying to see something...  nada. The worst part was the rude management. I had my birthday party there and paid a couple hundred dollars for one room for the night. I had about six guests who spent a lot of money there at the bar. We were minding our own business catching up. The manager told us they had a party coming in and that we should probably leave the bar. They also said my guests couldn't be in my room past ten. What a crock. What am I, 17? Really disappointing, as I'd been excitedly planning this visit for some time. Next time I'll go to a holiday inn, at least they have a pool.went here for lunch with some friends. It's an old mansion.  If you dig that kind of thing, you'll love this.  I enjoyed the architecture, but the place was kind of a dive.  I kind of expected it to be fixed up a little more.The service was adequate.  No more no less.The food was bland and not as good as it should have been for the price.   I ordered a prime rib sandwich.  What I got was roast beef that was a bit overcooked.  It was probably leftover prime rib from the past weekend's brunch.  The fries were passable.My friends' dishes revealed this place's love for cheez-whiz (or maybe velveeta, whatever).  The prosperity sandwich was swimming in the stuff.  Here again, it seemed like the ham was leftover from the past weekend's brunch.  The poor sap who ordered the enchilada ate a few bites and was done.  In keeping with the leftovers theme here, I suspect there is a guy in back who stitches partially eaten enchiladas back together for later sale.None of us were impressed by the food.  I have heard the brunch is very good.  Maybe suckers like my friends and I subsidize brunch by purchasing mediocre food for too much money during the week.  I might try brunch someday, but most likely that was my last time at Lemp Mansion.  There are sooo many restaurants serving great food nearby.I come here solely for the lunch Chicken Salad and Sunday Chicken Dinners. I'm not really a fan of anything else on the menu (not at all actually) but the Chicken Salad is outstanding! Plus the staff is super friendly and nice and let you roam around ghost hunting after lunch. The house and the scary stories associated with it make for a fun old St Louis afternoon. Go to the bookstore in the restaurant and check out some victorian St Louis memorabilia and pick up the new ghost story book. It's awesome. They also have this cool cocktail hour and ghost hunting evenings on Thurs where you explore in the dark with a infrared camera!Just went over 4th of July weekend with my wife and it was amazing! I ordered the Steak Diane and it was cooked perfectly...melt in your mouth, delicious. I have always wanted to come here and being from Kansas City it's a long drive but worth it! The atmosphere it makes you feel like a beer baron back in the 1900's. The service was impeccable and attentive. For an extra special treat order the Bananas Foster...made table side...amazing! Hope to be back soon to stay in this gorgeous mansion overnight!We went for a normal dinner, not one of the mystery dinners. The food was tasty, but overpriced for the portion size. My average-sized plate of pasta and a few sprigs of broccoli cost $13. My husband had a tiny salad that barely covered a small plate for $6.  The service was pretty bad I have to say. The waiter was nice enough but we hardly ever saw him (while the large party next to us seemed to see him quite a bit). We felt especially ignored after dinner while waiting for someone to take our dessert order. It took forever for the waiter to return. Could be a cozy place for dinner, but we will not return.Had a really great work event here.  The staff bent over backwards to make sure that everything was just right and it was greatly appreciated by all.  The space is just beautiful and the food was spot on.  All in all it was a really good experience!I love a good ghost story, so I've always been interested in the story of the Lemp Mansion. It's fascinating and sends shivers down my spine. Oddly enough, the only time I've actually been here was for a wedding shower, which at first struck me as quite an odd place for such an event! It was kind of amusing because the room had a plaque stating ""so and so committed suicide in this spot."" Hello...creepy! I was eating it up. But we covered up the plaque with a decoration in light of the occasion. It actually does have the ""ladies who lunch"" feel. There are mostly lighter options on the menu. I had a southwestern salad, and it was fabulous! I also really liked that they had a little museum discussing the mansion's history. I really loved visiting the place and would love to go to a murder mystery dinner there sometime.Okay, before i just pretty much wrote about the food itself. However, this is about the dinner theatre. Everytime i go i have so much fun here! Perhaps it's because i am a dramatic person and it's cool to be apart of the whole expirence itself that i tend to love or just the actors who host it for you that keep it going. The food is good too, and they have a bar as well for those whom want to get some spirits with their acting.So just about everyone in St. Louis has heard of the Lemp Mansion and how it is haunted and everything along those lines. Well if people have yet to hear the place is also a great spot to get lunch. Yes, you can have lunch there, in the haunted house... bum bum bum...Anyway, the food at he Lemp Mansion is great. I went there for lunch the other day while in the neighborhood checking things out and I had made my way down around the mansion and I felt the ping of hunger. Looking at the Lemp Mansion I noticed that you could eat lunch there and since I was within the time frame of 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. that they serve food I went in.I ended up ordering the Gourmet Salad since I am a big fan of shrimp and bacon. The salad was great. It had just enough of each little ingredient so that one was not over powering the others. They had made a nicely balanced salad that I truly enjoyed.I absolutely love this place. I've been coming here with my family for at least twenty years. The atmosphere is unbeatable and very authentic/vintage. The food, though unhealthy, is to die for. Four stars for not having more selection but this is for sure one of my favorites.I'm only writing this review pertaining to the outside and the reception hall on the third floor a couple of buildings away. Outside was very pretty, as my friend's wedding was. Weddings in the last year have annoyed me in general but this was lovely. Beautiful day, beautiful ceremony. Star lost here due to parking. Yuck. Eww. Shame. There's a tiny lot by the restaurant that cant hold over 20 cars?? or lower. Most parking was done on street so ladies you will be walking in your wedding pumps. Didn't go inside of the restaurant, also didn't want to, something about the dark carpet wasn't talking to me. The reception hall was nice. Had to go up a freight elevator that was manned by staff, cute. The food was awesome!! My biggest pet peeves at weddings are the food and open bar. She had open bar!! YES!! And the food wasnt your usual chicken cordon bleu and bland veggies. No. Her buffet was yum yum eat em up. She chose all of her comfort foods, watermelon, pasta, grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, ceasar salad, etc. We were full. Based on the reception hall, I would recommend this place for weddings. Oh yea and haunted? Didn't catch that vibe anywhere.The Lemp Mansion is haunted. Whether you believe in that sort of thing or not, the second you see this beautiful house in Soulard, step inside, and take a seat in its dining room, you'll feel something. Whether it's a real spirit of one of the deceased members of the Lemp family or just the feeling of years of interesting history weighing on you, you'll feel something upon entering this place. Me? I won't go into the Lemp Mansion bathroom alone after a story my good friend, Brooke, told me, but I'll keep coming back to this lovely place again and again for the food. The Lemp Mansion serves lunch and dinner, specializes in traditional American fare, and I recommend the steak Diane (8 oz of tenderloin with shallots and mushrooms in a burgundy wine sauce). The Lemp Mansion also features murder mystery dinner parties, banquet halls, a huge Halloween party, ghost tours, a  bed and breakfast, and several other events throughout the year. All in all, the Lemp Mansion is a fun, historical, place to eat a meal and ensconce oneself in a little history. (The creepy ghost in the bathroom story I'll save for another time.)I'll skip the ""hauntings"".  I'm not much of a believer.  I do, however, believe in protein, and when I need protein for lunch I head over to the Lemp.  Don't get me wrong, I've been over for the Halloween party, and dinner countless times, but today, I'm thinking protein.  The Lemp has a lunch menu that includes prime rib - thinner than the dinner fare, but just as yummy.  Add a little horseradish sauce, have the salad with either the homemade french or homemade mayfair, and you have a meal that'll hold you over well into the day.We won the dinner theater and a  nights stay here back in May from SMOS's auction and went a while back. Just getting around to reviewing. The dinner theater was fun to watch but the food was meh. The starter was a corn chowder which I didn't try. Then next was a caeser salad but it tasted exactly like fish :( . And then dinner was served, it was some kind of breaded chicken with a white sauce over it, white rice mixed with peas, a roll, and something else(dont remember what it was). And then dessert which was some kind of turtle cheesecake. The dinner was pretty bland, needed some salt. And during the meal, the show was going on in between plates so you don't notice how long it all takes. The rooms are fine, nothing special to them. The beds are comfortable enough. We did explore after everyone left for the night which isn't as early as we were told. Everyone was gone by 1am. We didn't see anyone else while we were exploring but we didn't see any ghosts or anything either. The breakast needs work, it was two bags of chips, two cookies, a bear claw thing, some water, and some wine and a free bag. And when you check out in the morning you do look the door behind you and leave the key in the mailslot. It was an experience to try once but don't think we will book it again.We came here with a party of 13 for a graduation party. The server was pretty curt and not very engaging. He definitely was not rude - on the contrary, he just wanted to do his business and get out of the room. But it was a little off-putting.The food was mediocre at best. The onion soup was terrible. Probably the best thing was the salad with the house caesar dressing. The fried mushrooms were dry and not tasty at all. Most people got steaks and they were not great. For the price and the hype, we expected a lot better. We definitely would not return.Had family in town for Thanksgiving, and since we were in the midst of moving, we opted to go out for Thanksgiving dinner. Our choices were limited (and most were buffet, $60+ a person), but Lemp was offering a family style dinner at $22/person, so it was definitely our best option. While we had a reservation, we weren't seated until about an hour past it (which was fine; we had a drink in the bar, checked out the museum and wandered around a bit... well, as much as we could, since it was very crowded-- there's no real area to wait for tables, and since they were clearly very behind on the reservations, the entire front entry way/stairs/bar area was packed. Beautiful mansion, definitely a bit creepy (can't wait to go back for a ghost tour)...  Food was delicious. Family style serving was perfect for Thanksgiving. Service was a bit slow, but I think they were just a bit understaffed for the holiday, plus they're not well-equipped for upstairs seating (where we were seated)-- credit card machine downstairs, bar downstairs, etc. but it was really a minor inconvenience and not our server's fault. Definitely want to go back for a Sunday dinner (all you care to eat fried chicken, served family style) and check out the mansion some more.I went to the murder-mystery dinner on a weekend in April. Overall, we had a good time and the staff was friendly. I had never been to a mystery dinner and was looking forward to using clues to solve the crime. I was very dissappointed that in the end there wasn't really enough evidence to have figured out the perpetrator. The guilty person was chosen pretty randomly .(All of my sleuthing was pointless and I would have been better off guessing). When we first arrived we were given cards and questions to ask other guests. I asked if we were supposed to reveal what was on the cards or make up an answer. The host replied, ""Speak form your heart!"" So I still don't know if or when I should have revealed my secrets. The profiles and secrets on our cards were not pertinent in solving the mystery, at least the night I was there. It probably would have helped if there were more professional actors running the show (surprisingly, there were only TWO for an audience of 40 to 50). The actors also made a few sex-related jokes, but there were no kids in the audience so I guess that was ok.Also the ""chicken primavera with pilaf"" was dissappointing. It was more like bland, mushy chicken with plain white rice and a couple of re-heated frozen brocolli and carrot pieces. I did like the soup, salad, and dessert.The mansion itself was beautiful, and the upstairs bathroom was especially old-fashioned and interesting.I had to be a tourist and asked my sis and her hubby-to-be to take me here.  We went last night.   Sunday nights are ""family style"" dinners.  It's essentially a buffet with the server bringing you the food.  I like that idea!  Why waste time getting up to get your food??  We had fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, dirty rice (really too salty for my taste), corn, etc.  This is definitely comfort food.  If you come on one of the nights they're serving meals this way, make sure you're starving.  We were stuffed.  Dessert was included, and I had it, but couldn't finish it.  The restaurant also serves meals a la carte on other days.  Afterwards, we wandered around the house itself looking to see what goriness about which we could read.  it's a cool place, albeit a little run-down, but fairly well-maintained.  It probably looks much better in the daylight.  However, I'd definitely recommend it as a great outing and the next time I come here, I'd probably take a guided tour.  I wouldn't mind staying in one of the rooms, as it's also a bed and breakfast, just to tempt those ghosts to ""bring it""!",,"['attended', 'bash', 'loved', 'hours', 'open', 'bar', 'buffet', 'freedom',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/river-city-casino-and-hotel-st-louis,River City Casino & Hotel,3.0,$$,86,"I will start by saying this was my first stay a River City and I enjoyed it thoroughly! I arrived in Saint Louis on Saturday awaiting Sunday's football game against the Detroit Lions. My friend and I were looking for a nice hotel and for the rate, it was better to stay here than some motels. Upon arrival we were greeted by Ms. or Mrs. Pam! She was a Boss! Extremely kind, extremely helpful! Excellent Customer Service is a dying breed so seeing Pam excel in this area was great. No matter what questions we had she never once got annoyed or treated us rudely. She gave us a map of the entire place and showed us the best routes to take, if we need to call and make reservations, (which if you want to go to the Steakhouse you will need to) etc. After showing us how to get to our rooms we were on our way! We enter the elevator to take us to the 3rd floor and arrive to our room. Upon entry the room didn't stand out as amazing but was very clean and comfortable. However the bathroom was a better view than the room! Covered by a sliding wood door once opened you can't miss the tall glass standing shower door, brick/tile floor, two shower heads, (one in front on the wall and one above your head). The big glass mirror with a built in tv screen, marble countertop set with amenities! The toilet is off to the side behind its own stained glass door. Nothing like a hot shower to relax at the end of a long day! Early Sunday morning we tried the cafe in the hotel for breakfast. The menu selection wasn't very large. The price was a bit much for the quantity you receive but I enjoyed my breakfast! I purchased the biscuits and gravy with a side order of hash browns. That evening we headed over to try the buffet and again we were greeted by a friendly staff. Pretty good size buffet, not the best food I've ever tasted but still really good and nice variety. We had the cooking staff run a little prank on us that I found very funny! Glad the staff has a sense of humor and not uptight! Our waitress was friendly and made sure our drinks were refilled immediately. As far as the Casino goes I'm not a gambler. We went inside and passed through and it reeked of Gerito, icy hot, beer and cigarette smoke. Immediate headache from all the smoke! Over all a great stay, great service and a great time!Maybe 3.5 would be more appropriate but overall I couldn't complain too much.If you call ahead with a large party like we had (14 adults and 10 children), they'll accommodate you in one of the auxiliary rooms that are adjacent to the main dining area. There you'll have your own hardworking server, who will take your drink order and make sure it never goes dry. The price you can't quote me on because we had complimentary buffet coupons so I don't know how much, but I'd guess somewhere around $20-$25.In this instance, the brunch menu is eerily similar to the regular lunch and dinner menu sans the crab legs and seafood. Yes, they did have smoked salmon, muscles, eggs Benedict, scrambled eggs, waffle and pancake station, along with prime rib; but it didn't really differ from the normal menu. I wasn't disappointed in a sense that I ate as much as I could and still craved for more once I was full. Generally speaking, the hallmark of a good buffet is that they offer more than you can eat, River City fit the mold.One issue: the sushi preparers are mean and nasty and it's not unheard of, today was no different. Apparently you can order special made rolls much to the chagrin of the sushi preparer, the rumor is that they only seem to accommodate the guests that are familiar to them. In this instance one of my family members exchanged barbs with the sushi preparer to the point where had to be sent home. All he wanted was a roll, Jesus dude. The River City staff handled it well and apologized; but still...I'm writing my review based on the casino and buffet. I've been here a few times before and was never a fan. First off, I absolutely hate buffets so coming here was a bad idea. But when friends have comp and want to eat here I can't complain. When I'm here, I would just eat the sushi. I will ask the chef to make me some and I would just tip him. At least I know no one on the ""outside"" has touched the food lolPros: Tons of pastries! Able to order ""fresh"" sushi from the chef. Free food for me lolCons:Old and dry food. Food is bland. It's a buffet!!!! I've seen people coughing, wiping their nose, picking the food up with their bare hands! Omg disgusting! Dining area is also disgusting. Overall, I would never pay to eat here. I never paid before and never will. I don't know how much buffet is here but I'm sure it's over 20$ per person. If you love buffets then this place might be for you. As for the casino.....it's a casino. I've been to Vegas and let's just say I've seen it all! I'm not a gambler so that's that. But it's disgusting in here. They need better ventilation!! It smells like smoke hardcore! I'm not a smoker and I'm very sensitive. This is a deal breaker for me! But it doesn't matter since I don't frequent here. So if you like kissing ashtray...this is the place for you!I have only been here once but I would love to go back again after my experience. We were at River City Casino for my husband's company holiday party where they rented out one of the ballrooms for the evening. Upon arriving to the casino, there were several signs showing us where we were going with the company logo which was a nice touch. The staff was all very friendly and helpful. The party consisted of light appetizers to start and then a buffet dinner. Unfortunately we were talking to so many people we did not get to sample the appetizers but the dinner was fabulous. They had a salad, hot, and dessert bar and each one had very tasty food and again all the staff was helpful and attentive. I learned that they have a restaurant that is delicious as well so I really want to go back and try it. Overall I would recommend going to River City for a good time. Happy gambling!Here we have another situation where I wish Yelp would allow me half stars as I would honestly give this Hotel/Casino a 3.5 on my most recent trip into the area on business. I am originally from Kansas City, now living in Chicago, so I am no stranger to Missouri's riverboat casinos and their idiosyncrasies. I have generally learned to never expect greatness from them, especially when compared to their more iconic cousins out West, but this place was a cut above the norm. Most of the casino operators in Missouri are just subsidiaries of the larger gaming conglomerates from Vegas and Atlantic City like MGM, Harrah's, etc. This particular one is owned by Pinnacle (formerly Ameristar Casinos, Las Vegas). Guest services here was exceedingly helpful over on the hotel side. From the Valet from when I drove up, to checkout and all parts in between. Since customer service seems to be taking a dive across the board in just about every business on the planet these days, when I am treated especially well it tends to stick out in my mind. The room I stayed in was well equipped and semi-opulent, but again, if you have stayed in just about any mid-range casino-hotel before, it is not going to blow you away. If you are familiar with Las Vegas, River City rooms are not like those at the Aria, the Cosmopolitan, The Wynn, etc. Think more along the lines of the Mirage and you have about hit the center of the bullseye. The shower in the suite was extremely awesome, however. Very relaxing after a long day of playing conference room sharp shooter. Bedding is one area that casinos normally shine in, but these mattresses and pillows were semi-firm and only moderately comfy. This is not heavenly experience you get at some casinos with lavish down comforters and mattresses that are like sleeping on a cloud. However, at the price point offered, it is a pretty decent value. Bear in mind my expectations and needs for places like this are dramatically different when I am traveling on business. If you are just here to party and only need a place to crash after an all night bender, they will certainly do the trick. The gaming floor is fairly large for a Casino of it's size, and you should have no problems at all finding your table game of choice: poker, blackjack, roulette, keno, etc. Most of the casinos in KC comp drinks so long as you are playing at the tables, but that was not the case here. Not a huge deal, but that is still a nice perk that was noticeably absent. Like most casinos, you also have the endless stream of retirees over at the slots, mindlessly feeding their pension, 401K, social security, rent money, etc into the one armed bandits. Do they still have 1-800-BETS-OFF in Missouri? If so, you had better send a crisis team to this place. Overall, this is not a bad option if you are in the area, but it is not a particular standout among it's peers.Stayed here for work in Oct 2015. The check in staff was very friendly. The rooms are decent size, but the bathroom is to die for!! There is a TV within the bathroom mirror. The showers have a top and side shower head and a bench. The non casino area was very clean.Didn't stay in the hotel, this is just a casino review.  Casino was clean and bright.  I read on some other reviews that this casino is stingy on payouts. We didn't seem to have a problem winning on several slots so I'm going to call that bs.  The casino did have the smell of stale cigarettes, they could possibly do better on the air filtering.  The buffet was decent, nothing extraordinary.This was my first time at the Casino and I wanted to see Don Williams. The venue is on the hotel side of the casino, which I wish I would have know before I had to walk through the cloud of smoke. This event was sold out and Don was worth every penny. They had seats on the floor, but I got a seat on the risers and I actually think they were better than the ""expensive"" seats. Great fun place to see a show.New, fresh, clean hotel with impeccable service.  There is just nothing like a new hotel.  From the moment we entered our floor, we all noticed that ""new hotel smell"".  Our room is spacious and modern.  The bathroom is also spacious.  We really loved that large shower with double shower heads.  And yes, that TV in the mirror kept us entertained for no reason.  After a couple of hours, the hotel staff even called us and ask if everything met our expectations.  The area around the casino does smell very smoky.  All of the restaurants are close to the casino entrance.  The Buffet's entrance is inside of the casino.  I just wonder if the insides will smell smoky.  So one less star for that reason.  But all in all.  If you just use this casino hotel as a hotel.  It is very nice.  We especially loved the free valet service.  The location seemed out of the way, but it really was not that big a deal.  We would return to this hotel again.Was greeted nicely by valet service upon arrival. Valet service is complimentary and free self parking is available in parking lot and covered parking garage.Upon entering the lobby, I was greeted by the stale aroma of cigarette smoke but no one was smoking. The smell of cigarette smoke was only present in the lobby and casino.The hotel room was very clean, with comfortable bedding. The bathroom has a water closet, steam shower, built-in TV in bathroom mirror.There is not a pool, but there's a fitness center with new treadmills, ellipticals, and dumbbells. Towel service and bottled water is complimentary.I didn't eat in any other the hotel's restaurants, but the menu items were not overpriced. The casino floor is huge and there is a non-smoking section in the casino.  Adult beverages are not complimentary but soft drinks and coffee are complimentary.The hotel location is about a 15 minute drive to downtown STL.  There are no retail businesses within walking distance. I found the hotel on Kayak for about $155 a night including taxes. I was not able to find a comparable hotel downtown for the same price.Ate the buffet here last night and the food was not good at all. For $25 I felt ripped off when I left.  Potatoes were hard, shrimp was rubbery and meat choices were either dry or chewy.Ended up eating corn on the cob and bread mostly. Won't be going back, learned a lesson on another buffet.Limited tables for specialty poker games like...4 card, Ultimate TX holdem, Pai gow, Mississippi stud...only 1 table open for each game on a weekend. So waiting to play is a bore! Tried their new game called Lunar Poker...what a joke! The table has plenty of sucker bets and the dealer must qualify for you to win big! Way too much money to play...so don't expect that to last long. The restaurants are all pretty upscale so if your looking for a cheap eat it's the burger place. We tried the buffet which was decent but couldn't find a spoon and also asked our waitress who only came by once to drop off drinks and napkins and disappeared LOL!Stopped by with my boyfriend back in July. We had so much fun!!!! slots were so loose!! Roulette was fun. Tons of variety for slots. Lovely decor. This place seems new. We will come back for sure!I regularly stay at the hotel ! The gift shop has become a second home! The employees treat me like family and are nothing but kind and helpful ! I can always look forward to my experience and this hotel and their costumer service is excellent ! Kat at the gift shop is always so helpful to me and my family! Also Michael the food and beverage manager is very kind and helpful !This is one of the nicest casino in the St.Louis area. They can do better on their buffet tho! Not many choices! People here are nice! Very clean!I have stayed here 5 times in the last 6 months.  It has been an overall good experience.  I have learned to stay on the 6th floor, since a couple of times when we were assigned rooms on other floors-the rooms smelled.  The service is acceptable for this level of a hotel.  I have had issues on several occasions that had to be dealt with from room service to room changes to a closed gift shop; however, all issues got dealt with to acceptable level of service.  I really like the casino with one main exception (smoking).  I had great luck the first 3 times and walked out a winner.  On the 4th visit, I didn't do well; however, I played so much that my 3 day stay right before New Year's Eve (5th stay) was comp'd completely.  Sad to say that this last visit, I lost a record amount and didn't have any luck at all.  They were setting up for NY Eve the day we were checking out and everyone including the staff was very excited.  Apparently they do a great job ringing in the new year at the casino.  Their theme was ""hang with us"" and they had two acrobatic swings hanging from the ceiling of the common area along with a disco ball and DJ floor side.  I like this place but I am still feeling the sting of my latest loss.  Side note, I play table games-not slots.  Also, the casino dealers are some of the best casino staff I have dealt with in all the places that we have gambled.  They are the best of all the staff in the casino and hotel and restaurants combined.High Rollers beware, the most stingy casino I have ever been to. After a long day of driving, I saw this place and decided to give it a try. After playing two hours of video poker at $25 per hand; I was down several hundreds and ready to call it a night and keep going the next day. So I talked to the players club people to see if I can get a room and some food comp. (I am a high roller in San Diego/Vegas and casinos routinely offer me room/food comp) the nice players club lady spent a good 15 minutes hunting down host and reviewing account...and guess what I got? $13 at the fast food place and a twenty dollar discount for a $100 room. They wouldn't even comp me a drink at the brewhouse because my account is ""too new""...what a nice way to welcome potential VIPs. I will avoid any AmeriStar property like the plague from now on. With my rate of play, I never had any issue obtaining free room on a weekday and $30+ food credit...I guess River City is looking for a different kind of high rollers.It also irritates me a lot when the rep kept on mention that they are giving me a free buffet; dude, it was 10:30pm at night and the buffet shut its door two hours ago...can you exchange that stupid buffet for some dinner credit at the brewhouse to get me some booze to stay happy?I was in the St Louis are about a week age and decided on my last day to visit River City Cacino for dinner . First the bad points , If you plan to come here for dinner esp on a Sunday , get there early !! And be prepared to wait a long time in line .I was on my own and it would never had been happening  if I had to wait in the long long long line.I had only 90 minutes before I had to be at the airport.So I saw someone I knew sitting down so I told the manager that I wanted to join them before they finished dinner.She was nice enough to allow me to join them.I had a very nice dinner there . It was Seafood night, so I did get a bucket of Crab legs , Cold Shrimp and a few other seafoods like clam strips.It was very good , I would come back again but maybe a little earlier !!My favorite casino in town!  A huge one star taken away because of all the smoke but +4 stars because the place is beautiful, they have decent slots, table games are good (wish they had one more craps table though) and parking is easy.  It's a big place but I don't feel overwhelmed walking around and I don't feel crowded when at any of the bars or beverage stations. I look forward to returning!Absolutely wonderful buffet for Thanksgiving! This place is so pretty and has such professional staff members and I have so much fun here!! Love it!!","The casino is nice..... Bartenders were great..... But we took a cab here from downtown and the people at the entrance were the most rude, unprofessional staff I have ever had to deal with!  A wait of over 2 hours to get a cab.... And no car service available?  WTH?WILL NEVER RETURN OR RECOMMEND THIS CASINO! (The steakhouse was awesome!)Buffet was small under staffed and under flavored if the cold shrimp were any smaller you wouldn't be able to find them, the only reason I gave them 2 stars was that I had a very nice server first time extremely dissatisfiedTo start off, this place has no right to judge someone on how much they drink. I would rate them negative stars if I could! Tried to enter the casino after a wedding reception in the same building and some under qualified body guard turned me and several other guests away by trying to target us by asking if we drank at the reception.... HORRIBLE customer service! Will never be back and smells awful as well!I have been to River City Casino a few times before, but this was my first stay at RC Hotel. I booked a room for a Saturday night for $139. I wouldn't pay any more than that for a hotel room - especially at a casino. Remind you, the Hotel is only a few months old, but it is very clean. The distance from the parking garage to the Hotel and the distance from the room to the Casino floor are not as much of a walk as other Hotel/Casinos in St. Louis. I had dinner at 1904 and the food was good and priced appropriately. I played craps and blackjack from 9pm-3am and didn't lose money so naturally I was in a pleasant mood. After a number of $4-8 drinks, I slammed a late night burger from Burger Bros. I had a great night sleep in the King bed and checked out the next morning.For the room (with taxes), dinner and drinks, I spent about $220. The key is finding people who want to have fun gambling and play with them.Opportunities for Improvement:- Wait staff in the Casino took forever to bring drinks around. On a Saturday night, the supply of servers was inadequate for the demand of drink orders.- The shower water was bathtub warm at best. Maybe I should have taken a shower earlier than 10:30am though.- One of the dealers didn't move very fast and was kind of boring. Might be better to move those dealers to weekday AM shifts. For a table with $10 minimum bets, players expect more of an energetic ""atmosphere"".- No mini fridge in the room.Stayed here during the World Series - was there for work and it's where the MLB was able to get rooms for us stragglers.  They get two stars for the hotel room. It's spacious and comfy.  Nice bathroom and it's decorated well.   The one odd thing - all the rooms look out to parking lots - not the Mississippi River.  Granted the River could use some TLC (like a river walk or something) to spruce it up - but it's better to face the water than asphalt.  The casino, however is, meh.   And it's SO smokey.   There's a great white hall when you walk into the place and it's full of smoke. Gross.  There's also great people watching as it's not the glamorous types that frequent here.Great rooms, love the beds, shower with overhead waterfall and TV in bathroom mirror.  BUT...I the smoke in all common areas and casino is ridiculous.  I will never go there again.  I have been to Ameristar in Black Hawk and that casino is great.  This one is so bad from smoke that it almost smells in rooms.This hotel is beautiful! A complimentary valet service is included and the staff is extremely friendly. They even called minutes after i got in my room to see if everything was ""up to par"". The reason I give 4 stars is because the bathroom smells strongly of urine and the hotel lobby smells of smoke from the casino. Despite those small problems my boyfriend and I will be staying here again next time we are in the st.louis area.LOVE this hotel!! Gorgeous and luxurious rooms for a way more than fair price! The beds are super comfortable too! The lobby and mezzanine area is so pretty and plush, it feels like I'm in a resort! The concert venue is also great. I plan to see more shows there in the future. Can't say enough wonderful things about River City... Love it!Our friend was denied access for supposed intoxication. We sought assistance from management given the evident incompetence of staff. Gene ""manager of security"" was extremely useless and basically seemed  indifferent to the situation.  His customer service skills were negligent at best. Other employees were rude and unhelpful. We will gladly spend our money elsewhere.Used to be a frequent visitor for dining and gaming.  Would come for lunch with work colleagues and with family for entertainment.  Earlier this year I paid  to join the main bar's Passport Club.  Within just a few weeks after paying for the membership and numerous beverages, I was told the club was being revised and I would be required to start over.  I asked why I was not informed about this plan when I joined and was told there was no answer.  I asked if I would be grandfathered in to the new program at no cost and was told my membership and the previous progress was forfeit.  I asked to speak with a manager and was told no, but that Ron Battocletti, Multi-Outlet Manager, would call me.  Of course no call was ever received.  Not worth his time apparently....The sum of money in question is only $85 to $100 and it seems to take much more than that to receive any degree of acceptable customer service.  Ironically, River City gives away rooms every day worth 3 and 4 times this amount.  Yet the young woman I spoke with who claimed to be the Food and Beverage supervisor on this particular Saturday afternoon seemed to take great delight in insulting telling me I was out of luck.  As a result, I have not been back to the casino in months nor have the friends and family that used to accompany me.  The cost to the casino is this short time is hundreds if not thousands considering the gaming, food, and beverage dollars that have been lost as a result.  And for what?  $85 worth of a Passport membership that equates to pennies as far as the Casino's costs go?  Shameful to be sure.  Customers beware...this example shows that your business not needed and you will be treated accordingly.What a place to stay so Clem and the staff if very friendly. Rodney must say hi. he will give u all the respect. A true Five starAbsolutely terrible!! Went to the casino for an event and wanted to do a little gambling afterward. Went inside no problem but then about 30 minutes later all of a sudden security stops us and says we are ""showing signs of intoxication"" and says we have to leave immediately and do not allow us to notify a friend who was there with us that we are being asked to leave. 4 security guards escorted us out making it seem like we were a huge problem. That alone was rather humiliating. Then While standing out side the casino more than half of the people we watched leaving ON THEiR OWN and without security were not walking straight yet were allowed to stay as long as they wished???  Does not make sense and River Shitty will never be gone to again and completely ruined our night for no reason.I stayed here on a business trip in October and have very mixed reviews on itPROS- the rooms themselves are really nice. The shower has double heads, one on the wall and one on the ceiling of the shower, it is terrific- there is a completely unnecessary television built into the mirror in the bathroom, but it's fun- the Beer House is awesome. Over 200 different types of beer at the ready, and a friendly (and attractive) waitress staff. CONS- if you miss the first wave of housekeeping service, you're SOL. I left the hotel at 1p with the green light on (signifying my room was ready to be cleaned, there's a red light too for Do Not Disturb), and my room was never made up....3 of the 4 days I was there- the entire place is a big fog of smoke. It will stink up your clothes, and linger forever. - the Free internet speed in your hotel is completely non existent. Seriously, connecting on a 14400 Modem to AOL feels like T1 compared to this. All in all, the rooms are fine, the rest of it is pretty rough.This place is an absolute joke. We do a benefit called Night of the Superstars every year &amp; this year River City Casino &amp; Hotel was the place chosen for the event this year. The room by itself was $28,000 to rent which didn't include alcohol. Most people from the benefit also stayed in the hotel, us included. The benefit was over by 11 &amp; a group of us wanted to do some gambling. We try to get into the casino &amp; security told us that 2 people were too intoxicated to get in, which I was one of them. I had 1 glass of wine &amp; 2 beers from 530-11. We were having fun &amp; being goofy but not intoxicated. They told me to ""go sober up &amp; come back"". We then went to the bar across from the gift shop, had a drink &amp; tried to get back in about an hour later. I was told I was banned 24 hours from the time they didn't allow me in the first time. I then asked for a manager. The manager came over to me &amp; I explained what was going on. The manager looked at the guys accusing me of being intoxicated &amp; said I wasn't slurring my speech &amp; didn't understand why they weren't letting me in. The manager allowed me in the casino &amp; I was walking in one of the men that accused me of being intoxicated yelled at me ""I'll be watching you"". We were there for about an hour &amp; I was about to get a second drink when we went to the bar. I was denied a second drink because once again I was showing signs of being intoxicated. Over a 7 hour period I had a total of 6 drinks which hardly gets someone so intoxicated you should be denied access to  casino. This was suppose to be a fun date night out with the hubby &amp; it was ruined by the ignorance &amp; arrogance of these people. I will never walk a foot into this place again &amp; I plan on telling everyone about this experience.I docked a star for the location. It's a hassle to get to and is in a terrible area. With that said, River City is my favorite casino in the St. Louis area. It's definitely the newest and nicest. They're building a hotel that will be done sometime in Sept. '13.Food: I'm generally not a fan of buffets, but RC's is one of the best I've been to outside of Vegas. The Beerhouse has a cool atmosphere and a great selection of beer. Inexplicably they don't get a lot of sports channels, though (2nd tier stuff like Big Ten Network). Had a great steak and enjoyed the live music the one time I ate at 1904 Steakhouse.Casino: The casino itself is very nice and has the classiest decor of any casino in the STL area. Not as big as some others, but I wouldn't say that's a bad thing. The poker room itself is phenomenal, but not particularly busy. Go to Lumiere or Hollywood if you're just looking for poker.Entertainment: Judy's Velvet Lounge is a cool enough place to hang out, and they frequently have live bands there on the weekends.Summary: Overall, if the main things you care about are grabbing a good bite to eat and then gambling, River City would be my #1 spot in STL. If you're looking to gamble as just a part of a night out, I would go to Lumiere Place where you can combine gambling with going out at Laclede's Landing or the classier Wash. Ave. area.OK, I've been a few times lately and I'm still liking the great drink prices, GREAT customer service, and casino game choices.  I tend to win here at slots A WHOLE LOT more than at Lumiere, and I'm guessing that might be because River City is newer and still trying to attract business, so perhaps looser slots.However, I tried the Great Food Exposition buffet and was very happy I had a B1G1 coupon for the Friday night Steak &amp; Crab Legs special, because I would not have paid the normal $23.99 per person for it after a 1-hour wait.If you're a huge fan of non-stop crab legs, you might enjoy it and might get your money's worth.  Other than that, the steak was dried out, the other meat choices were just ok and the variety of shrimp was just ok.  (This was near the Mediterranean section w/ a couple other fish choices.) There were some typical Hometown Buffet options (green beans, corn, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese), some below-average-tasting Chinese choices, and then some decent dessert choices and a salad/fruit bar.I didn't see many bread/roll choices, no Italian whatsoever, and the only Japanese was a handful of sushi choices near the seafood.  No Mongolian grill, no chocolate fountain, no BBQ.The service was horrible... The slots were titter then a DUCKS ass (waterproof). I dropped $1800 in 20 min on the slots. I make great money and I'm not Cheep, so I'm not a bitter casino player, but this casino has ""NO love"". Beware of River City. Look for another casino...Another thing... My buddy and I came from the blues game tonight, we were drinking beer but not intoxicated... He was harassed by the employees at the casino saying ""you been drinking too much"" you must go!... So he was here for about 10 minutes and grabbed a cab home. He lives in Chesterfield, and as he walked out the door he abruptly said I'm never coming back to this casino. I'm not Exaggerating there was 200 people in the casino at this time of night(11:00pm). The place was a ghost town... I'am  mine boggled that they forced a gambling patron to leave. (Plus he's a big-time attorney in St. Louis)Bottom-line beware, beware, beware try a different casino... Plain and simple...ThanksP.pattiJust some words below to let you know I'm a real St. Louis'ntoasted ravioliHighway 40eyyyTed DerwesSlingerBecause you like nice thingsIn beautiful downtown BallwinThank you and here's my addressFirst time here and my husband and I came for my birthday. Check in was so easy and Carol at the front desk was great. Rodney is a gem!! He helped us to our room and explained everything about the hotel. What a professional. Every staff member we came across said Happy Birthday. They even brought up this birthday cake made of towels, gaming cards and dice! Then later that evening they sent up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. Nice touch! The room we had was the non smoking king on the 6rth floor. No smoke smell at all which is sometimes a concern at casino hotels. Room was clean, nice river view (south view), and decorated well. We felt like we were away on vacation when for us, since we live in the county, it was more like a staycation. Nice little spot to get away. Judy's Velvet Lounge was fun with the band they had and the Steakhouse had great dinner duo playing acoustic. Looking forward to going back for possibly my husband birthday this month and there after. Say Hi to Rodney... he will take great care of you!This place only gets three stars because of the decor and almost like vegas style encounter.  They lack on table games, if you come here during the week and during the day they usually will only have four black jack tables going, which will be very crowded, which means if you have a cold table you can't just flee to another table easily, you will have to wait.  They know how to get money from gamblers like us because you cannot flee your just stuck and you will just keep forking your money to the other side.Now slots they have a ton of, alot of uninteresting ones, but lots of progressive ones, it will keep you busy for sure.  This casino is very big in regards to what there is to offer in St. Louis.They also have a poker room, which I have yet to really see busy.All in all i wouldn't waste my time going out of the way to come here, i prefer the queen and lumiere for poker.First things first, let me preface my review with the fact that I have NEVER SET FOOT INSIDE THE CASINO! I know, it is odd to review a place you have never actually entered, but I have been here many times. This is my story:My husband &amp; I like to walk what we call the ""Casino Trail."" I don't believe that is the official name for it, but it runs along side the casino parking lot &amp; down the front of one of the entrances. We do this early in the morning, 7a-9a, at the latest, not when you would think it is the busy time for this casino, but it is busy during these times nonetheless.ANYWAY we have 2 little dogs, a shizu (Fuzzy) &amp; a chiwawa (Biscuit). Fuzzy has a very low threshold for heat. In other words, if the temp is above 50 degrees, he thinks it is the hottest day ever &amp; since we walk about 5 miles at a time, he gets hot. So when this casino opened, we would go over to the fountain that is located across from the entrance where valet parking is located, &amp; dip him in. Ok i know that sounds weird, but he is 8 lbs, we hold on to him &amp; just lower him in the water up to his neck &amp; pull him out. It cools both dogs off, then off we go back across the street again.A few words about the fountain itself, it's a nice enough fountain. It has some benches around it &amp; a little walkway, it always seems to be on &amp; is clean enough. They put some sort of choline based disinfectant in it (I wouldn't dip my dogs in if I didn't know that the chemicals they use wouldn't hurt them) &amp; it lights up at night. I've never seen it lit at night, but in the morning usually the lights are still on. So one day, we are doing our dipping, &amp; this bellman comes out. Now he can't be a bellman, cause this casino doesn't have a hotel associated, so I'm not sure in what capacity this guy is employed. I asked him but he never said. He was really young, so again assuming doorman type position. So this being like the 100'th time we've done this, he comes out &amp; says we can't do it anymore? We are like really? Why? He said it was disturbing the casino guests???? NOW River City is like any other casino, NO WINDOWS, the only people who actually see us are the valet parking attendants &amp; most of the time they aren't even around that early. So we look around, confused? He says, for lack of nothing else to say, just stop doing it. I asked a few more questions, just to be a shit disturber, but otherwise it was a pleasant exchange.The very next day we went back &amp; dipped the dogs again &amp; have been doing it ever since. The valet parking attendants still wave, everything back to normal. No worries. But it. was. weird. Bottom line, if you come to this casino to dip your dog, yourself or anything else in the fountain outside this casino, you can expect to do so unmolested 99% of the time.","I can honestly say I would probably never consider River City when going on my annual, one-time gambling adventure.  I happened to pass through it once to attend a birthday dinner in one of the restaurants tucked inside.  The interior was smelly and smokey - somewhat foul and unbearable at times.  I have no idea what happened on the inside but made the whole place look and feel older than it is.  The exterior gave it a nice appearance, but that's where it ended.  At any rate - I will certainly update if by some random chance I visit again and actually test out the gambling gadgets.Wow was this place busy.  We made the journey on a Saturday night and got familiar with their new parking garage because the entire parking lot was full.  It was a bit of a walk, but mostly under roof.  When we walked it, the place was jamming!  The tables were full and I was amazed at the amount of slot machines that were in use.  My neighbor loves to play video poker so we headed over that that side of the casino as the wives were headed to their favorite slot machines.  I would have to guess they have 100 video poker machines, and literally 2 were available.  2!  Obviously it didn't take to long to find 2 machines side by side, but wow 2, really!  After an hour or so the place did clear out somewhat and it was easy to jump from machine to machine.  We hit the blackjack tables as well.  Didn't find real entertaining dealers, but they were probably wore out from the amount of people that were there.For a reason, that no one seems to understand, I went to Saint Louis for 4 days for my 25th birthday.On my final night there, my friend and I decided we should just continue down the path of terrible decision making and go gambling. They said I was too intoxicated to be allowed in. Too intoxicated to lose my money in 5 minutes. This was based on me ""hunching over the ATM"", which was mainly just to hide my piss poor account balance from my friend.Whatever. We went to Lumiere Place, and not only did I get served, my friend won all the money. All the money. Enough hundos to shove into my cleavage, and utilize it as a boob wallet. So yeah, eat my Boston dick.I'm'a back up an earlier reviewer about the tightness of this casino - absolutely no love and no incentives.  You will lose money FAST here and become bored quickly.  They don't have the latest machines and got rid of the 50-hand video poker, which is one of the only reasons I wanted to even go here.If that wasn't bad enough, security wouldn't let me in with a federal military ID.  I was told some idiotic song and dance about someone with a military ID suing the casino, which is not a reason not to accept a military ID as a legitimate form of ID, which it is.  It even has my birthday on it and everything.  They were complete shits about it, which makes me wonder what other military spouses are being turned away from their shitty casino.  If not for the fact that I had an (expired) driver's license from another state, I would have been turned away at the door.  Morons.This place sucks and I regret leaving money here.I'm not a gambler so don't expect a review of the Casino, this is a review for the great food exposition located inside the casino. we try and come here on Christmas eve for the buffet and for 3 years we haven't been disappointed.  the food offered is a nice variety, seems to be a little more that what you get at other casino buffets,  and the food has been consistently good. different nights of the week they have different themed meals, tonights theme was italian so they base the main foods off the theme and work from that. the place was somewhat clean, lots of messy tables and very few bussers to take care of them however I attribute that to it being Christmas eve and being under staffed. Friday nights they have King crab on the buffet, which is surprisingly tasty and served hot unlike some other casino buffets I have frequented.  all in all the food is good, the service is good and its definitely a place worth checking out if your looking for a good buffet value.This review is for the Steak House.  The atmosphere was great but The food was over cooked and bland. Don't eat there.The Buffett was a-ok. It was messy and unkept and I was just expecting it to look more clean and kept for the price. It was busy and the food was not replenished. It reminded me of Golden Corral, at least they don't over charge for the buffett...Went with family and friends over Thanksgiving weekend. Decent place but one BIG complaint. The place reeks of stale cigarette smoke. Doesn't matter that they do have non-smoking section as it is on the same floor as the smoking section and just across the aisle. RC does nothing to separate the sections so the smoke permeates everything. Restaurants are OK, food good and decent portions. As lady luck would have it we won just enough to buy everyone in our party dinner and drinks...broke even and went home full and happy!I brought my handicapped son there for a Christmas/birthday trip. The staff was incredible to him. He got a birthday cake and was surrounded by people singing him happy birthday. The buffet was good and the waitress brought a beautiful plate with Happy Birthday in chocolate on it with chocolate goodies. The staff down to the people clearing tables was so nice. My son won a little as did his sister.We went here for a date night and it was a-ok. I really liked that they have free valet parking. The people were friendly. The buffet seems very overpriced and not very good. I would have liked a bigger selection. The bathrooms were kept very clean. Not a fan of casinos so not sure how to rate the gambling area, but it was very smoky and hard to figure out what games were where so we just wandered around until something looked interesting.The atmosphere here cannot be beat, until you go to the bar.  The service was horrible and the pricing was ridiculous.  The one saving grace of river city is that I did leave with more $ than I walked in with, however, I'd rather leave a bit down and enjoy my visit.I had to rate this casino on a curve, because my raw rating would have been much lower, but since it is a casino, I had to compare it to other casinos, so I guess it was A-OK.Very Disney-World-ish on the outside.On the inside, well-lit, clean, good service, and pretty much your standard slew of depressing, chain-smoking, elderly zombies staring at machines, blowing their social security checks, and not having fun.Now....I was really surprised with the lack of taste when it came to this place.  The presentation of the food was awesome and the drinks were great!  As a matter of fact, the drinks were awesome!  They have huge mugs (...I think 48oz) that you can drink out of for super cheap and if they don't have what you want on draft you can get the variety of bottled beer they had to offer.  However, back to the original comment about the food.  Though they had many different options....it was as if they forgot to use any type of seasoning on the food!  So, if your purpose is just to have a night of beer tasting and hanging out with friends this is the place, but don't count on the finger food to fill the void of a small hunger with your beer and social activities.My hubby and I have been fans of River City Casino ever since it was built as we love music and they always have bands on Friday and Saturday nights.We liked them on Facebook and were gifted a free buffet each at the Great Food Exposition, which is their buffet.  We decided to try brunch there last Sunday and it was very good!  There wasn't a wait at all, you were seated promptly and were asked if you'd like Champagne, a Mimosa or a Poinsetta to go along with your meal.  The good thing about going at the time we did is that because its a buffet you got many choices to satisfy your hunger.  So if you're not in the mood for breakfast, there's plenty of other options.We will definitely be back, esp since its down the street from us.I visited River City a few times to try it out and I must say I was impressed, I generally go to Harrah's but I think I like this one a little better, yes its not the biggest but the atmosphere is happy and fun! I don't go to the casinos often its actually rare when I go but when I do its fun...I think this is probably the smallest casino I've been in with the exception of course to the President Casino on the Admiral.  They have a lot of slots and table games and a dedicated poker room as well.  We ended up there after going to Southtown Pub because my friends wanted to see Neko Smith at Judy's.  The only real problem I had with the place was that you couldn't run a tab at the bar so it took a while to get a drink sometimes.  Also the video poker at the bar kind of made it hard to get to the bar and get a bartender's attention to get a drink.  I walked around the place several times and it was really neat on the inside and wasn't all that confusing to get around like when you are inside Lumiere or Harrah's.  I didn't get a chance to gamble while I was there but still it looked like people were having a good time.  The atmosphere seemed way more relaxed than the other casino's I've been too.  Oh, and $3.75 for Bacardi and Cokes are nice!Best Casino Buffet in close proximity to STL City! I like to consider myself a connoisseur of buffet's so-to-speak &amp; The Great Food Exposition does not disappoint! The top of the line selection includes everything you could possibly be craving from sushi to home cookin' favorites, to Chinese and a gelato bar - not to mention complimentary champagne during the Saturday AND Sunday brunch! The staff is professional and prompt, the food is always stellar and it is definitely NOT akin to the Lumiere Place buffet, which is simply (if I could insert the Mr. Ick face here - I would) ick!.This was my first trip to River City.  I really had high expectations as I was really excited about trying out the Burger Brothers first.  Walking in, the place looks amazing, as a casino should look though.  Went to the burger bar and even walking in I was disappointed.  It's a walk-up counter place, not a restaurant style like I expected.  I guess I was expecting similar to Lumiere's burger bar.  Very small menu, all written on a chalkboard above the counter.  Ordered food, and then waited 25 minutes for it.  Seriously?  For a burger (for me), Italian sausage for other person with me.  Crazy.When one of the chefs came back from his break, the other chef turned to him and said he was taking his break right now.  It appeared he left in the middle of making orders, which led to confusion in the kitchen.  The kitchen is small and intimate and the customers can hear everything said in there (not a good idea from what I heard coming out of there).  After finally getting my food, what a disappointment!  I thought for sure the saving grace would be that the food was amazing.  My friend barely finished half of his sandwich before he couldn't eat anymore because it was not good.  I ate all of my burger because I waited 25 minutes, I hadn't eaten the entire day, and I had already paid for it.The casino was nice, but there was hardly anyone there.  I realize it's a Monday night but wow, it was very dead there.Highly doubtful I'll be back to give it a second chance.Had a fabulous dinner at the Steak House for my husband's birthday.  My son's dinner was so beautifully plated that he took photos of it with his phone and showed everyone!!! He had the Oscar Filet Trio -- three beautiful filets served over asparagus spears -- one topped with crab, one with shrimp, one with scallop, all with a bernaise sauce.  So wonderful.  My husband went with the steak and fries and I had lovely scallops and leek risotto.  We all agreed that this was the very best dinner we have ever had at the Steak House -- which is remarkable when you consider how happy we have been with all of them.  After dinner, we gambled for a while, won some money and had a truly wonderful birthday celebration for the hubby.Pinnacle Entertainment owns two casinos in the St.Louis area, River City and Lumiere Place. Lumiere Place is located in downtown Saint Louis and while it typically draws a younger crowd it also draws some undesirables. River City is located in South St.Louis County, and typically has a much better type of crowd. The casino is large, probably bigger than Harrah's but not quite as large as Ameristar. The casino actually looks like its something right out of Boluxi or Tunica with its over the top design. Overall River City is a great place to spend an evening, the dining is pretty good and in the next year there will be a hotel and convention center attached to the casino.","I am NOT much of a gambling fan. I don't particularly like casinos but do have occasion to visit them for the dining experience. This is were River City Casino stands out. I heard the brunch at The Great Food Exposition was really good. I found out recently the hype is for real. The first order of business is to rename ""Great Food Exposotion"" to ""Great Food Explosion"". If you can think of it, they have it. I went with 5 other friends and we basically treated the place like a Roman feast. Unlimited champagne was the hook that got us there. The carving stations, omelette stations, fluffy waffles, insane dessert and ice cream station, seafood everywhere is what willl bring us back again.This review is for the Sunday brunch at The Great Food Exposition.  This is the best bunch around. Unlimited mimosas, Bacon, eggs, ham, blintz all the breakfast you could want. Then move on to the exceptional mashed potatoes and array of other great foods.  Don't forget to go get some wonderful gelato before you leave.  The buffet is the smallest one of all the casino's but the food quality more than makes up for that.Holy Smokes!  This place is smoky.  Like where is the ventilation?  We couldn't find anyplace in the casino where there wasn't smoke.  If you go, be prepared to strip afterwards and put your clothes in a plastic bag.  Besides that I always win at slots.Honestly a casino in St. Louis will NEVER get 5 stars from me until they ban smoking in the gambling area. But I digress.This place is actually really great. Nice outside architecture (a mix between a chain like Harrah's with a bit of upscale Lumiere Place vibe), kind of lacks inside but I was also more concentrated on my nickel slots. It didn't feel overly smoky and I could find a spot if I *really* hunted. Plays just like any other casino, so if you're in the area, go here.However, it is far away from even South County, so be prepared as far as travel planning goes...I really really like this casino. I'm not a huge gambler, but somehow I've managed to visit all of the casinos in St. Louis and Illinois. River City is near the top of my list (right under Lumiere, which takes first place for me!). First of all, it's a BEAUTIFUL casino. It's very spacious and nice. You can tell they put a lot of thought into the architecture. The ceilings are super high, and the ventilation system is awesome; even though the casino allows smoking, it wasn't overly smoky and gross like a lot of casinos. So that's always a plus in my book. Like most casinos, there are a ton of slot machines and table games around to play. The dealers and pit bosses were all super friendly. Be patient, though...because a lot of the dealers are brand new! The VIP lounge in the casino is really nice. It's large and bright, and the bartender up there was very sweet. There was also a lot of food up there to nibble on. And HUGE TV's!Now on to my gripes. Like I said before, the casino is HUGE. So why are there only TWO bathrooms on the casino floor? Don't get me wrong, the bathrooms are extremely nice, but it kinda stinks having to walk for what seems like forever to reach a restroom. Another gripe? The staff at the entrance of the casino. I guess I'm a really young looking 25, because I was carded every single time I walked into the casino. And every time I wanted to cash in my winnings. It felt like I was carded every time I turned around. It's fine, actually (and maybe one day I'll see this as a compliment!), but when I'm waiting to walk onto the casino floor, and the attendant pores over my ID for what feels like 5 minutes, it gets a little annoying. There's also only one place in the casino to cash in your chips. I went on a slow Sunday afternoon, but I can't imagine how crazy the line must be on a Friday or Saturday night! Despite everything, River City is a really impressive casino. I wouldn't mind going back. I recommend it!For a St. Louis casino this one is tops for me.First let's start with the free valet which is generally reserved for the likes of vegas and CT indian casinos.  Very much appreciated and very quick service. Next, on to the non gaming aspects.  Plenty of restaurants, a burger joint, the beerhaus, a steak place, and of course a buffet.  Whatever you're in the mood for they've got it.  Plenty of bars within the casino, Judy's being the primary location with an old school feel.  A stage with lower seating area / dance floor and stairs winding the outside up into a recessed bar with cushy chairs and plenty of cocktail tables.  Great aucostics, and some pretty solid acts coming through.Now on to the gaming.  This casino like a lot of St. Louis casinos is set up like a mirror hallway.  So you can walk straight through and when you get to the halfway point you'll see about the same thing on the second half.  Plenty of table games and modest limits on the tables.  A small poker room and both times I've been the crowd has not been all that bad.  Open seats on the weekend, friendly dealers, and clean comfortable seats.  It's got all the usual accurraments of a nice casino with the high ceilings, the blinking lights, the sounds of buzzers and chips flying, with no major detractions.  Maybe one day a beer while you're gambling in St. Louis be free, but until then I'll stick with what river city has to offer.So, on my previous jaunt i only went to the buffett and forgo the other delightful things inside the casino. I have since did pretty much everything inside there and can now write about my adventures! I am still not much of a gambler, but when the mood strikes me i will spend a little of my hard earned moolah on some of the different things that are offered here. I love the penny slots, why? Because my money goes further then it would at say the nickel slots. I'm cheap, well perhaps not, but i do know that it is fun to sit and let the wheels spin for a while. Heck, even people watching is fun here because of the wide variety of people who come and go from each little area they have on the gamily floor! I've since tried the Burger Brothers and Lewy Nine's. I have to say that Burger Bro's is okay, in the nicest sense even if it's only offering a small fare but the burgers are delicious. I did enjoy Lewy's a lot both for the enviroment and the food. I enjoyed the crab cake po-boy. YUMMY!  Once again, this is a great place to people watch with it being near one of the main entrances.I visited during a group event this weekend. This place is nice. Aesthetically, it blows the other casino's in town away. I can't comment on the games and dealers. I spent the time exploring and mingling. They have a bunch of different restaurant options, and they don't seem as overpriced as Harrah's or Lumiere.  Complimentary valet parking was a nice touch.Tip... the house brew as the brewhouse restaurant is very good.I wanted to express my utter disappointment in the River City Casino for allowing someone with an horrible attitude and no hospitality training as their carder. I recently visited the casino on Christmas weekend wishing to have a fun time for a few hours. The first person we encountered was a man named Mustafa who was utterly disrespectful to me and my girlfriend. Not a warming bone in that gentleman's body. He purposely set out to be rude to my gf. He looked us up and down several times, giving us awful looks that went above and beyond looking like were there doing something wrong...then as i walked away after his extra rude interaction he said to me ""if you ever grab you card again I will kick you out of here."" That interaction right there just set us for a not so great time giving us a bad taste in our mouths. I am a manager in the hospitality industry and have had several celebrities and groups of a thousand plus I work with and never have seen such an awful representation of a company. I would never want someone like that at my front line and first encounter with any of my guests especially during the Holiday Season.I did tell a manager on duty who offered us a meal to correct the situation. I declined as I understand the empowerment of making it right with a guest. I was not there to get something free I was there to have this gentleman, Mustafa, disciplined for his inappropriate behavior.My dad &amp; I had Pre-fathers day dinner here. A really nice &amp; elegant look to this place. The service was on point &amp; I'm loving the male waiters uniforms with the coat-tails. Very classy! Try the lobster &amp; macaroni with cheese, it's to die for!This review is based solely upon the Seafood Buffet which is on Friday evenings. My husband and I went to check this out about a month ago. AMAZING!! The King Crab Legs are huge and FANTASTIC!! We ate more than our money's worth in that alone. It was hard to crack them at first, but we got the hang of it. My hands had little cuts all over them the next day, but it was totally worth it. The peel and eat shrimp were huge as well, and very good. I also enjoyed the sushi. I was pleasantly surprised that the rest of the food was good as well. Usually I prepare myself to only like the crab legs, shrimp, and sushi at places like this, but the hot food was very good too. I did not try the steak because it looked like it was cooked to a tough rubbery consistency, but it's not a steak buffet right? The desserts were phenomenal as well. I have been to several seafood buffets in Vegas, and I have to say, I liked this one better! The ones that I have been to that have had King Crab legs, they were split in half for you, which means they were easier to eat...but they were cold. Being able to eat them hot, was sooo much better. I definitely recommend this! It is a bit pricey, but not when you consider all the food you get. If you don't like crab, I can see thinking it's too expensive. I took a picture of the desserts I got on my phone. Will see if I can figure out how to upload that.For the amount of money dumped into building this casino, and then all the hype about this casino before it opened, and then all the hype I heard about it after it opened....well, I was VERY underwhelmed by this casino. The place is smoky as hell.  I mean, the first thing I did when I got home was strip off my clothes, drop them in the washer, and marched to the shower to get the stink off my body (all this at 1:00 AM).  Even my underwear reeked of smoke somehow.  That's some powerful nicotine filled air.  Granted it was a Saturday night but seriously, get a better air filtering system.  Disgusting!These are not loose slots.  I'm not a lucky gambler, but I don't remember the last time I lost money this quickly.  All this and 7 dollar (Pincale priced) booze and color me not impressed. It is a pretty building and there are a ton of restaurants.  It kind of reminds me of the set of Gilmore Girls on the outside actually.  But all in all, it was a very meh experience.  Meh and smoky.  Will I go back, well yea, I'll probably get conned into it again at some point soon, but will I be the one doing the dragging?  Definitely not.  I am going to stick the less smoky side of the river with the loose as all hell penny slots at the Queen.  That kind of trashy casino just makes my day.For a StL casino, this place is nice (might be bc it's new!).  It def has that Vegas feel to it, with plenty of tables and slots for the gamblers.  There's plenty of dining options, and it seems like this place is always crowded.  It's def in the middle of nowhere, but it allows for them to have a HUGE parking lot that always seems full (not to worry - there are shuttles if you are parked far out).  I ""heard"" the valet was complimentary, but I didn't get to check that out.FYI - this place is suuuuuuuuper SMOKEY.  You WILL smell like a smokestack once you leave.  And not to sound like a total snob, but there is QUITE the variety of ppl hanging out, so be prepared for some interesting ppl watching!This review is for the Tuesday afternoon All You Can Eat Buffett.First of all, don't ask me what I was thinking for going to an all-you-can-eat buffett at a casino on a Tuesday afternoon.  Despite my wife's warnings about how I generally feel about buffett style dining (petrie dishes of festering bacteria), I was having a serious jones for mashed potatoes and gravy, so off we went.  Since we hadn't been inside River City Casino yet, I chose that instead of Lumiere because I knew they had ample parking at the newer venue.So into the looking glass go we.  First stop, the front cash register, where they ask you what you want to drink and charge you in advance.  In this case, for 2 of us it was $27.54 which apparently included one 12 oz glass of 2% milk (my request) and one 12 oz glass of iced tea (more on this later).So we're seated, and when they seat you here, they don't let you pick a table, they sardine you in between octegenarians or homeless or destitute social security gamblers and give your your napkin/silver.  Presumably, somebody will come around and look at your receipt to see which drinks you will get.  They don't trust you to have as many drinks as you want, when you want.  Very strange.  What am I going to do?  Overdrink their milk supply?  Hmmm...Anyway, salad first.  Other than the fact that it was the least variety of any salad bar I have ever attended, including say, Pizza Hut or back in the day when Wendy's had an all-you-can-eat, I couldn't complain too much.  Would have been nice if everything would have been stocked, like the cottage cheese, which was down to a spoonful, but I wasn't really there for rabbit food, so I had a nice little plate and let it pass.Next stop...meat and potatoes.  But, since we were seated closest to the ""Asian"" section, I gave that a perusal.  There were about 8 items on display, some looking like chop suey, some looking like a fried rice concoction, some noodles, some kind of egg roll.  It was all pretty depleted and unappetizing by look so I passed it up...in search of mash.Made my way by the savory meats and snagged a promising piece of fried chicken.  They appeared to have original and crispy going by the KFC formula.  I chose crispy and it was actually pretty good, in fact the highlight.  I also chose a freshly sliced piece of ""flat-iron"" steak that the server was cutting.  It looked moist and tender when he hit it with his chef's blade, but back at the table my butter knife didn't stand a chance and it was rougher than shoe leather.  The other meat selections didn't look that great so I passed.  On to the mash...As I approached the mashed and veg section I noticed a bowl of depleted yellowish-brown mess and some containers labeld ""brown gravy"" and some ""shephard's pie"" and some green beans and pastas.  Nothing looked good initially, so I spied a section down at the very far end with ""fresh"" sushi.  I had just had Drunken Fish sushi on Saturday which was pretty good and I didn't want to sully the memory of that visit so I circled back to the veg area and started doing circles like a jetliner in a landing pattern until one of the attendees noticed that I was grimacing at the mash bowl.  I was apparently sending out enough psychic signals because he fetched up a nice steaming hot serving bowl of fresh mashed.  Same yellowish-brown color, but piping hot so I dive in.  I grimaced at the gravy again but he didn't receive that telepathy so I scooped a ladle of the brown onto my mash and green beans and biscuit and head for the table.  My milk had arrived.  Yeah!Aside from the chicken and mashed and gravy and green beans I also had a small scoop of cheese tortellini on my plate that was just yuck so I pushed that off to the side.  I had considered getting a scoop of the shephard's pie but when I hit it with the serving spoon the top layer of mashed potato was so gelatinous and hard (at the same time) that I didn't bother.  It was looking pretty gross and possibly left over from a previous day based on the yuck visual and texture.Anyway, so I'm diving into my mashed and brown gravy and dipping my dinner roll and forking my fried chicken and picking through my green beans and it wasn't too awful bad.  I ran out of milk about half-way through and my server, if we ever had one, didn't seem to care.  I thought about making another pass to the mashed and gravy section but by this time more senior citizens had invaded and it was looking like dinner rush so I made my way to the dessert section and managed to find a piece of chocolate pie that didn't make me ill (more like mousse than pudding, but not inedible) and I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream that was absolutely unidentifiable as vanilla.  I was not full by any means, and certainly a little thirsty, but it was time to go.  General impression.  Worst variety and volume for a buffett, any place/any era.  Yelp is telling me I'm out of space.  Good Luck!  Shoulda gone to Eat Rite!If you can get past the fact that their games are inherently rigged so you will generally lose more than you win (like every casino) this place is great!I haven't gone in a while, but its my favorite casino, I almost don't want to go anywhere else. Their comps are good, they have a Burger Bro.s in the back that make the biggest burger and serving of fries for $10. I haven't tried the 1904 steakhouse, I never won big enough (generally lost). But only idiots go to a casino in an attempt to make money, right?The Baccarat table is really fun to play at. Its a low house edge game (something like 1.4% house edge) if you place the minimum bet, you won't burn through your money too fast. They have a $5 craps table that is lively, the staff are professional too.The tables are clean, I found the dealers to be very sociable. I remember going up to one at a blackjack table and saying ""So, do people actually think they can make money at this game?"" And we both had a good laugh, and then he talked about the game and some of his stories from working in casino's for 20 years.Parking is easy to find, but sometimes you have to take a long walk to get to the front door, but everyone could use some exercise so that isn't too big of a deal.I haven't hit up the poker room yet, I want to try that sometime in the future.If you rack up points on your casino card, they will send you plenty of comps in the mail, I couldn't take advantage of any of them though because I am unemployed and making less money than I use to be. I have a problem where if I go in a casino I can't NOT gamble (double negative I know) so I generally stay away until money isn't an issue.Be warned though, you can lose your house if you throw down more money than the minimum bets allowed at the table. I've seen people lose thousands in the blink of an eye, but whats life without risk, right?Visited River City today for the Grand Buffet.  What a smokey place!  We have been several times before but today was over the top smoke filled.  Why they do not put glass up between the casino (where smoking is permitted) and the buffet seating area is beyond me.  The smoke just waffs in from the casino floor to anyone sitting within 50 feet of the casino.  We took our clothes off the minute we got home and put them in the wash.  My hair even smells the smoke was so bad.The food was good.  The made to order omelette was very good.  Which I guess is the reason we continue to go back.   So a 4 on the food. The service on the other hand, not so good, a 1 at best.  The table next to us had 4 refills of champagne while I begged for a refill on iced tea and my DH asked for coffee.  The waitress took a thermal pot that had been sitting at another table and gave it to him for his coffee refill.  It was lukewarm.  He asked for hot coffee and she returned with a new cup and another thermal pot.  The new thermal pot contained 1 &amp; 1/2 cups of coffee.   Maybe there is a shortage of coffee in River City and they have to conserve every drop?When she finally came with a refill on my iced tea it was dark and warm.  She poured it into my glass.  It promptly melted the two ice cubes that were left, leaving me with warm tea.  So much for ""iced"" tea.  The dishes were never cleared from our table.  They just piled up at the corner while the waitress chatted with her friends seated in the corner.  I like the food, hate the smoke and find the service always lacking.This place is like Disneyland. It is very well kept but void of any fun unless you're the cultural equivalent of an 8 year old. I've taken two trips here. One on the weekend. The other on a weekday. The experiences were completely inconsistent mostly due to the service. The casino is what I would often call ""Kmart Casinos"" in Las Vegas. It tries to look classy, but ends up coming off cheap once you look closely. This is definitely a casino designed for busloads of the chain smoking geriatric crowd that play penny slots.Judy's Lounge is NOT a lounge. Imagine a sports bar with Martha Stewart designing the decor. The only bar or table space there is to set down a drink is inbetween the video poker machines. I've heard they have cover bands there, but have yet to see an instrument set-up on the stage or any calendar or promotional listings. The liquor selection is poor for the size of the bar. The first time I was there the women working were great. They noticed the second my drink was low and were there with another in a few moments. I'm a notorious big tipper when I encounter that kind of service. The second time I was there I ordered the same drink twice and received two completely different responses. The first time I ordered my Screwdriver with a splash of Amaretto. Quick service and a good drink. A few minutes later the shift changed. I ordered the same drink. The man behind the bar walked past me twice. When he did acknowledge me he pushed me off to another bartender who proceeded to tell me he would have to charge me $4 for the splash of Amaretto because it was  a ""shot"". I know the look on my face must have been interesting. I've managed in the bar business for a short while and I've been around it even longer. This guy's last job was probably Subway. Let's hope he doesn't end up in management. I think there may have been once before that someone managed to do something that caused me not to tip them. This makes it twice.Like the bars there, I've had two different experiences with the food too. The first time I went to check out Burger Brothers. I was looking for a good, cheap burger. This is a faux diner that serves mostly burgers and hot dogs. When I approached to order a burger and fries I was told they couldn't take my order because the computers were down and wouldn't be up for 20 minutes. Huh? How about writing it down on a piece of paper and cooking it while the computer problem gets straightened out? Nope. I finally was able to get a burger on my second trip there. It wasn't worth all the trouble. I could have gotten a better burger AND fries at most bars in Saint Louis for the same price.Being hungry on my first trip and not wanting to walk back out to my car and drive somewhere else, I decided to try the 1904 Beerhouse next to Burger Brothers. I had a salad and a burger with a pint of Guinness. All were good. The service looked a little confused about who should be doing what and where, but most were attentive and took care of everyone.For the price(they're kind of high for a casino) the food here is decent, but it won't be something people will come to experience. With a lot of the culture in South Saint Louis they might have been better off putting in a Taco Bell or an Imo's Pizza - seriously. They actually have a very high end steakhouse in the casino. On my last trip I went to check it out. There wasn't anyone there except for the staff. Put an Imo's there and the place would probably be packed.The casino proper is probably 70% slots. The table games run down the center and there is ""High Limit"" room at one end. The bars and cage are in the center. It is a typical design. The service at the tables is relatively good. This company has two other properties in Saint Louis. One is a riverboat casino which is closing soon the other is Lumiere Place which is located downtown on Laclede's Landing. If you're looking for a slightly more upscale experience go to Lumiere Place.Went into River City today, the first day open, not impressed at all. Not a lot to do at all, had to park out in the mud they had shuttles that only held about ten people.Expensive buffet. Rude staff:I went with my two roommates and they BARELY got into the casino. One of them is 21 and the other is 24. If the IDs weren't scanning well I could understand but they worked and they were still giving us shit. They asked my boyfriend to ""make the face"" on his ID. They called backup who called backup. They asked my roommate his address twice, then his birthday and what his ""sign"" was. At this point we were pretty pissed and the staff was pretty rude about it. Finally let us through telling my roommate to keep his ID on it because he will be continually asked for it. We walked straight out as soon as we went in.  I understand people get carded hard all the time, but the staff was rude about it and one of the kids who was IDing was definitely younger than my boyfriend.I was very happy with my first stop at River City! The architecture and design reminded me of a Vegas casino. Definety the coolest looking casino in St. Louis. I am not a big gambler but the tables were really packed which is expected on a Friday night. We hung out at Judy's Velvet Lounge for most of the night and I would honestly go just to hang at this bar!! They had a huge stage for live bands a dance floor and a low bar where you can play video poker. It had seating all around and was a great hang out spot! The 1904 Beer House was packed but I enjoyed my 1am drunk food! I would like to return there for dinner another night. Overall  a great addition to St. Louis nightlife!So I'm not your typical serious gambler, but I definitely appreciate a good casino experience when I'm in the mood, and I've had a decent amount of Vegas experience so I know what I like. Trying not to duplicate others reviews, here are some points: 1.) Its far away.  Once you get off the highway its a decent drive.  Hoping that it would be closer to South County now that I'm located out there, this was quite a ways out.  To give you a frame of reference, its more like Harrah's out in Maryland Heights once you get off the highway.2.) Lack of table space: While this place is laid out more like a common Vegas casino with tables and slots all over the place, the availability of table seats was minimal.  I'm a blackjack guy, and the fact that I had to wait around 20 minutes just to sit really annoys me.  I wasn't even being picky about had amounts.3.) Slow Drink Service:  Off the bat, you don't get free drinks in St. Louis casinos like you would at a Vegas casino unless you're in the right areas, but when I want to pay for a drink, it shouldn't take 15 minutes to get one from a waitress.  I know they are busy, but really?  I'm trying to pay for your overpriced drinks, and you can't even get them too me.  We went on a Saturday night around 10pm, so I understand it's probably busy, but this place did not impress me for a lot of reasons.  I'll stick to Lumiere or even Ameristar.  Hell, the Casino Queen ain't that nice, but at least I can gamble and loose my money when I want to.","The price compared to the offerings don't even compare! It's as if they are giving away 5 star cuisine for nothing.  As you are being served your bucket-o-crab, ask the server if you can get a lobster scampi...you'll thank me later ;o)Great crab legs buffet... I tried some other items off of the buffet. Sushi was good, pizza was great.... But my night there was about the great crab legs. Great service, clean dining area, and clean bathrooms.This casino was had an interesting vibe but what casino doesn't have that. It's location is annoying because it's not really convenient to get to. The service here was good as were my drinks that I ordered. I'm always leery of new casinos because I feel like they are starting out in the hole financially so my odds for winning are slim to none. This is purely speculation but I did not win of course. Actually I didn't even come close to breaking even. Neither did anyone else I was with. I'm fine with that because when I go to a casino it is purely for entertainment value, but I wouldn't plan on winning any money here if you go. Also this place was so smoky I felt like I needed an oxygen tank to breath. I saw it, it was OK but I definitely won't be going back.I had a good experience trying out River City Casino. I went on the second weekend open.  It was still busy, but the bartender said it was nothing compared to their opening week. We had no problem upon entry- I got ID'd but my fiancee did not (he is younger than me, but sports a beard). I was struck by the beautiful atmosphere. The bright red glass chandeliers that are the centerpiece of the space are just beautiful.  We walked around once before stopping to take it in.  The bars and restaurants appear nicely decorated.  The Brewhouse had a very affordable menu and looked appealing.  The center bar looked straight out of ""Mad Men"" with glass chandeliers, bright green accents, and mod shapes.  The velvet lounge looks intriguing- all shiny black, with a low bar (so the bartender is at eye level when guests are seated), and live music.  The drinks we had were affordable.  They have a great selection of penny slots, which we played around for about an hour. Not much luck winning, but it's rare to make big on penny slots, right? There was a pretty diverse crowd when we were there- some partiers from the St. Patrick's Day parade and some locals.  The parking lot is big and well-lit, and the casino is easy to find. We will defnitely be back to check out at least one of the restaurants and to visit with out of town friends.If you read up on the construction (which I did) they installed state of the art smoke filtration systems. It's the only reason I even bothered to try the place. Well let me tell you they should get a refund on those puppies. It was like the London fog of second hand smoke. Then the staff was incredibly rude. I didn't even get carded, which impressed me. But they were congregating in aisles, talking to each other, blocking my way! They could see me, but could care less. I had to say excuse me, and they gave me about an inch to squeeze through. The buffet is incredibly over priced, so we skipped that. Which is the whole draw to a casino for me? I mean sure I like to gamble, but the food is what is suppose to bring you in. Well at $17.99 p/p + tax and tip. They can keep that. Honey old country buffet's staff isn't rude and they charge $6.99 for lunch. There were just as many hoosiers at River City, as there are there. So what's the difference? $11 actually.I'd like to give River City 2 and a half stars, but as we know, Yelp won't allow that... I would actually give River City 4 stars as a destination/tourist attraction -- it's really pretty, the food is surprisingly good, etc. But if you actually want to *gamble* things aren't quite so good. As mentioned, it is smokey, which I don't sense at Harrah's or Ameristar. I'm primarily a video poker player, and although they do have some interesting variations not seen at other local casinos, their pay tables are only so-so (the Casino Queen truly does have the 'loosest' video poker around). They also lack Caribbean Stud and a few other table games. Other negatives: the players club sucks -- I got a VIP card, but I have to earn 150 points before going to the VIP lounge? That's just crap. Also, no parking garage.... why? You've got all that cheap land. So, basically as a gaming destination: 'meh'","['start', 'saying', 'first', 'river', 'city', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughly', 'arrived', 'saint', 'awaiting', 'football', 'game', 'lions', 'friend', 'looking',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/st-louis-union-station-doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-saint-louis,St. Louis Union Station - DoubleTree By Hilton Hotel,4.0,$$$,97,"I was very blessed and lucky to stay here a week. May have been totally out of my price range if not for the amazing Priceline but The amazing staff and hotel make this stay so well worth any price. I did still give this hotel 5 stars even though I did have a few issues with housekeeping but I want you to know I found the rooms here far cleaner then anywhere I stayed. Then the issue I had which was that one day when my room was cleaned a piece of broken glass was left in The middle in the door where you walk I to room. However, when brought to their attention the housekeeping Supervision was very prompt and courteous and went above and beyond as well. Stephanie at the front Desk made me and my Service dog India's stay Stellar making sure we were taking care of and was in tune to how we were and check in on us often the week I was there. She was a kind and genuine nature. The live for her job and people is a parent and reflects highly on the Doubletree Hilton and they should feel very honored to have should an amazing employee. I would come back merely for the experience and care she extended. This Hotel is set in an amazingly beautiful building with endless sights within and breathless just around the grounds. The hotel offers endless amenities, a light show, a mallish ground floor, banquet and meeting rooms, amazing stop for weddings, a light show that is friggin awesome. Ummm it's UNION STATION so yes trains. The metro is a stones throw. Ummm HARD Rock out back. there's so much in one place and I haven't even started to name it all. In the market place for you Starbuck lovers it also is right there for you.A really pretty place, with great service.The only issue is the price.We checked online and the Google result said rooms start at $89.The website said $109 is normal.When we checked in, rooms were $160 before any other add-ins and tax???Heck no.But the manager registrar asked us what we their website quoted, and said they'd honor that quote.However, our card was then charged $300 something for two nights.Hopefully, they'll amend the issue tonight before we leave, because this place is so pretty and pleasant!Hotel is in an absolutely beautiful building. The Grand Hall where the bar is is stunning and a must see. They do an hourly laser light show here that is pretty cool. We were here for the Polar Express dinner and show. The show was fun but the food was just awful. Overcooked salmon and chicken with dry pasta. I don't have high expectations for buffet meals but this one was particularly bad.We stayed in a newly renovated room which was really nicely done with very comfortable beds. The mall attached to it is basically a vacant shell with a couple tacky shops. A shame because it's gorgeous. Hotel itself was very comfortable and staff was friendly and helpful. Would definitely return.One suggestion - offer a nut-free version of those cookies!Chose the Doubletree on my last few visits because it's walking distance from my office, but they also have a shuttle AND... HEY! Free cookies!Service here is great, from the front desk, to room service, to the valet guys. The hotel itself is just a little... odd. The lobby is huge and intimidating. The light show at night is indeed spectacular... once or twice (it does change) but otherwise bring a sweater and be prepared to feel like you're hovering in the dark. I especially take offense (okay, not 'offense', but definitely 'moderate annoyance') at the orchestral renditions of rock songs they play in the lobby between ""shows"". The Muzak version of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" will make you want to slit your wrists. Don't even get me started on how they butchered Lady Gaga's ""Poker Face"".The bright spot in the lobby? The bartenders. Talented men and women, very attentive, happy to make suggestions if something on the menu didn't stand out, and blessed with a sense of humor.Beyond the lobby, Union Station just feels well, deserted... Dead... Left to wither. Nothing was open when I was around. I refuse to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe, and Landry's was just ""meh"", so all that was really around was an Irish bar. Would probably be nicer in warmer weather though.The rooms are, well, rooms. They're clean and to the Doubletree standard. Wish they had USB ports standard in the lamps, but not yet. But as a bonus, I was able to easily use the HDMI adapter from my Surface to watch all the movies and TV shows I'd previously recorded to it, so no need to sort through the agony of network television.Also, a woman's opinion, I appreciate the hair dryers, but there's nowhere outside of the bathroom with a nearby plug AND a mirror, to use them. I hate trying to dry my hair in the rainforest of a humid bathroom, so a plug near that long mirror by the door would be nice.I called down to room service twice. It's pricey, but after 12 hours at the office sometimes the flannel PJ's have to come out and stay out for the night. Kat always delivered my room service orders with a smile, and promised not to judge that I'd requested three bottles of beer and at least one (FREE!) Doubletree cookie with each order.Don't know if I'll stay here in the future, but that's more down to the surroundings and not having many options for dining, but really enjoyed my first visits.This hotel is so neat! It is a restored train station and they did a great job. The rooms are great and have neat train related decorations. The grand lobby is amazing. They have a cool light show every 30 minutes or so. Really cool!!This is not just a double tree by Hilton m, this is a historical Landmark in St Louis Missouri and an exceptional place. It's very special not only for its history but for its amazing friendly staff, that truly delivered a five star hotel service. The rooms are clean and detailed to the finest m, your will think it's a Ritz Carlton instead of a Double Tree!The hotel is set in the center of St. Louis near the original St. Louis Union train station. The hotel is a historic AAA Four-Diamond DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel. It is within walking distance to Union Station MetroLink station, which I took for about 20 minutes from the Lambert International Airport. The hotel features their recently restored impressive ""Grand Hall"" as a lobby lounge area with its sweeping archways, gold leaf detailing, mosaics and art glass windows. Transport back to a time when travel was truly extraordinary. The Grand Hall has a 65-foot tall ceiling. The historic beauty helped achieve a top Railway Themed Hotel rating by Conde Nast.The Union Station railway offers several restaurant options, including Hard Rock Cafe, Landry's and a variety of food court choices and nearby local restaurants.My room was a recently upgraded part of the newer hotel wing #5004 for $159 or $186 with taxes. As a Hilton gold member I had access to their very nice Honors lounge, which included complimentary breakfast and evening snacks. The lounge staff service here was very friendly in the morning and evening.  Check out my other St. Louis reviews and pics.I have to say that this just jumped onto my all time favorite hotels list and I travel a lot!!! As soon as I pulled up I felt like I was going into a castle. Then when the doors open, I felt like a kid and said ""whoa!""  I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. Totally took my breath away. It reminded me of Grand Central Station but a little more elegant which is difficult to beat. There's an hourly light show that changes up and is very entertaining. Staying there is an experience. I can't wait to go back. It's great for business, family or any thing. Darby at check in was great and so was valet. This is a wow experience and the cost is very reasonable. You've got to see it.Best family hotel in St. Louis bar none. The lobby is amazing and has a really cool multimedia show every hour in the evening. The staff is the best staff I have ever encountered at a hotel. They go way beyond to make sure everything is perfect. Hilton should just send their trainees here and let them learn from the best. They truly were spectacular, from the bellmen to the managers. They do everything they can to make it great and their attitudes are always positive, a rarity these days. While the facility is great, the staff is what makes this hotel wonderful. There are actually 2 hotel room areas. We stayed in both as we added a day to our trip and changed rooms. The larger ""new"" hotel appears to be 20-30 years old but is nicely appointed and is what you would expect in a typical doubletree. Not lavish but comfortable, clean, a little dated but exactly what was expected. Full disclosure: we had a run in with bed bugs in a pull out couch for the kids. The staff was immediately responsive and remedied the situation and it was obvious that they did not want that to happen any more than we did. It can happen anywhere and is not reflective of the hotel in general. The ""old"" hotel is the original hotel. It is scheduled to be renovated in a few weeks. The rooms were large with high ceilings and we actually preferred the old rooms to the new. They have an old school charm but were well appointed. Can't wait to see what they do with the remodel. The common areas are really cool. It is a repurposed train station and they really keep with that theme and it's cool even if you are not a train buff (which I am not). Lots of history and charm everywhere. The kids absolutely loved it and the staff were great in helping with the scavenger hunt and making the kids feel welcome. It is not the Four Seasons and don't expect that type of stay but without question the best hotel in St. Louis, and thanks to the overall experience one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in.This is a really unique place. It was the train station built back in the golden age of trains. The people are really friendly. The rooms aren't anything special but the rest of the property is really nice. They even have a light show in the main lobby throughout the night. I ate in the restaurant. It was good. I had the fried ravioli (I was told it is a at. Louis specialty) my friends had burgers... I posted pictures.The St. Louis Union Station DoubleTree is a class act!I was recently in town for a wedding and booked 3 nights here sight unseen online. The pictures looked solid but when I finally arrived in person I was absolutely blown away with this Hotel. The Bar and Reception area is nothing if not gorgeous. The 20's era art deco architecture is simply jaw dropping! The Hotel uses this incredible back drop for nightly light shows on the ceiling every hour on the hour and I would suggest stopping in just for a drink to see the light show, regardless if you are actual staying in the Hotel or not. As for the rooms, they were clean, spacious and offered just about anything you could ask for at this price point. The room service, housekeeping and front desk all keep up their end of the bargain. I am not used to carrying winter clothing and I accidentally left a very expensive  coat in the Bar area during my stay. I called the front desk the following morning and was delighted that they not only had my coat, but they hung it up in their coat check and brought it back to me. That was impressive.I do not get to the greater Saint Louis area often but next time I do, I will be sure to book a room at St. Louis Union Station DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel.Magnificent hotel! We attended a wedding, which included a spectacular and magical media show on the ceiling of the great room. The hotel's accommodation were on point, which included a dog park at the rear of the hotel for our pet.My husband and I ended up here as a fluke. My mother-in-law bought us hockey tickets for what she thought was the Memphis Blues. As she lives on the west coast and couldn't get her money back, we declared a necessary road trip. It was a moral imperative for hockey tickets.A co-worker, originally from STL, said we had to stay here. Boy, was he right. Entering up the grand staircase of what is a historic train station, is the lobby and the bar. The model trains and some original pieces of the station that are still there are incredible. There are two little nooks across the lobby from each other. If two people separate, and one whispers to the wall in their nook, the other can clearly hear it in their nook. That will keep the kiddies occupied for hours while you pull up a bar stool.Upon check-in, of course, you get the signature hot-from-the-warmer chocolate chip cookies. The valet manager was spectacular and pointed out great locations to eat, taught us the local's shortcut to get into the Scottrade Center. He could also provide turn-by-turn directions to most places by foot or by car. He was so much more reliable than the Garmin.Wonderful service and very nice place to dine from morning till dusk. The staff did a very Nice job at both the dinner and breakfast time. Breakfast here are two choices with two separate prices which I found odd. Not out ofLine for pricing but if you are unawares of the breakdown that each location is a separate charge you might be surprised when getting your billLeft side of dining consists of a good assortment of pastries, breads, fresh fruit, granola, fruit dip/yogurt and steel cut oatmeal. He right side is an omelet bar and eggs to order along with an eclectic selection of meats from pancetta to bacon. And you couldGet pancakes as well as make a fresh Belgian waffle. Dinner one evening was a feast of the special - fresh Chilean sea bass cooked to a translucent perfection inside with a nice hard sear on the outside alongWith fingerling roasted potato's, white asparagus with a blueberry reduction smear. It was an overall balanced meal of favors complimenting and accenting each other. Compliments to the chef!Our stay was in July 2015.I was here for a conference and my husband tagged along.  The Grand Hall was breathtaking!  The room was decent but a fairly typical room - comfortable bed, desk, TV, and another chair for sitting.  The Wifi worked well enough.  I ended up charging my laptop and phone on the in-room sink since there weren't enough by the bed, but it worked well enough.  They seemed to be remodeling some areas of the hotel, so I'd be interested in seeing how things look once this is done.We loved the Grand Hall Lounge and the drinks they serve.  It was so convenient to wander down there for a drink in the evenings.  The light shows were also fascinating.  By the third night, we would largely tune them out because we'd gotten used to them, but they were pretty neat.There are somewhat limited dining options in the immediate vicinity, but there are several restaurants down closer to the Arch.  I'd stay here again.LOVE THIS BAR!!! MOST BEAUTIFUL BUILDING IN STL! If you have not been go!! Even if you just take in the space by walking around... Yes the Bar/drinks are too $$$ for STL!!! Wish they were lower but love going here for the architecture!! Come on 21$ a glass for Rombauer when a bottle is average $38?? yikes. Love hanging out here, could do without the gimmicky light show especially at night when the kids are not in the bar... : )This hotel is located in the old Union Station. The lobby is amazingly beautiful with a bar, hourly light shows, marble, and other ornate accents. Our room was in the older part of the building, which origins date back to the late 1890s. The fixtures were a little dated, but I can say that they were still nice. They actually fit the theme of the hotel quite well. The bed was comfortable with nice dark shades.The only part that was kind of a bummer for me was the rest of the old Union Station itself. There was a food court with maybe 3 vendors still open. Only a handful of what seemed to be cheap STL tourist retailers were open as well. The rest of the building was in poor condition. I was just looking for a fun environment outside of the hotel and was disappointed. Anyways, the hotel has an old feel, but they have done a good job keeping the essentials new and clean. We will definitely be returning here for our next trip to STL.One suggestion: If you do end up staying at this hotel, upgrade to an executive room with access to the executive lounge. They offer a very convenient and delicious complimentary breakfast and appetizers most days of the week.Cheers!We had a lovely stay here for one night. We were greeted warmly by all the employees, and even warm cookies upon check in. Despite a room mishap, a manager, Tranease (?) and everyone else involved, including a housekeeping supervisor (I didn't get her name) was beyond accommodating. All kinks were beyond smoothed out and we received 2 drink vouchers at the bar, and the bartender was very knowledgeable and kind! We had a wonderful stay -- their customer service, and facilities are tip top - you should have nothing to worry about while staying here. Not to mention, it's in union station, so the atmosphere is very interesting.This hotel I really liked a lot! The warm freshly baked cookies you get at the front desk are to die for! I stayed here for 2 weeks last year on my trip to St Louis. The rooms were really nice and the hotel in general reminded me of a train station but in modern time. This used to be the old Union train station from years ago. It's completely glassed and secured off from everything below which is the mall. So to get in or out, you have to have your room key with you to access the doors. The mall is not worth going into because it just has basic stores. Although there is a Jamaican/African restaurant in the mall that has the best jerk chicken I've ever tasted! Also, another cool feature of this hotel is that they have a light show in the lobby daily. It's really cool with sound effects and all. The pool can get crowded and is on the lowest level of the hotel which seems to be the older part and where majority of the family's are put! They also have a gym which is nice and kept clean every hour, cold water, clean towels, newspapers  and fruit await you while exercising. They also have a restaurant inside which cooks a yummy breakfast. The only downside to the Double Tree when we were there was they were doing some remodeling, so the noise was a little hard to deal with. We asked to be moved and it got better. Other than that, I'd definitely stay at the Double Tree when visiting again. It's centrally located in downtown St Louis.This hotel was wonderful!  In its earlier life the hotel was a train station, and the building has a ton of charm and ambiance!  The atrium bar was truly a sight to see and a great place for a drink.  The bar had lots of beers on tap, including craft brews.  The rooms were quiet and clearly had been renovated in the past year or so. All the people who worked there was extremely friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again!The hotel also treats Hilton Honors guests very well.  Hilton Honors guests have their own floor of the hotel.  I also received a ""ticket"" that gave me reduced-price drinks at the bar and discounts on meals.","The reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because I have never stayed here. If I had the money and all, then I would in a heartbeat (and I live in the St. Louis area!). I'll save my review for the mall later on, but the hotel is a must-see. Unfortunately in order to get inside you have to have a key if you are trying to access it from the mall. Otherwise, just go around from the outside entrance. Once there, just take a moment and enjoy the nice art and architecture that awaits. I would definitely bring a camera as there are so many photo opportunities. That is, if you're a history buff or if you just like taking pics for fun. The Grand Hall lounge area is awesome at night (not sure about the day?) as there is an hourly light show, 'on the hour' from 5 to 11pm. They got the nice chairs to enjoy them on. Like I said, walk around that part of the building (not in the mall area) and you'll see plenty of cool memorabilia and art. I have not walked past the 'bridge' where you see on one side, the mall and the other, a convention center-like place where part of the mall used to be. Plan on spending an evening.Wonderful place to stay, the most beautiful buildings in St Louis!! Great rooms, super staff. We hope the shops will begin to open, was &amp; can be again a great destination for shopping!! What a breathtaking building!!!! Great hotel!!This is the best hotel in St. Louis...Are you looking for a place with great rooms, great food an OUTSTANDING bar? How about one with loads of history and in a great location? How about one you can walk to the Cardinals games? Look no further. I stay here, and will continue to stay here, as often as possible. My grandfather drove trains into Union Station before, during and after WWII so this place has special meaning to me. Hilton has done an amazing job bringing the station back to its former glory. And, they've staffed it with the most amazing group of professionals. Outstanding.This hotel is beautiful. I would stay here again and highly recommend it. However- the  DIRECTIONS ON WEBSITE ARE INCORRECT.  Unfortunately I found out the hard way at 2:30 am trying to find my way from the airport. This is what the website says: ""Take Interstate 70 East and exit at Memorial Drive East. At the third traffic light turn right onto Market Street. Follow Market Street to 18th Street and the hotel will be on the left."" THERE IS NO MEMORIAL DRIVE EXIT. It is TUCKER EXIT you want to take.Recently stayed at this location and it was super cool! Definitely a must stay if it's your first time to St. Louis. Reason for not giving full stars is parking is a pain in the butt- if you don't want to pay the valet you can park in the union station parking lot which is quite a walk from the actual hotel. Other than that hotel was awesome- and they even upgraded me up to a nicer room!We stayed here over Valentines weekend and the hotel was packed. There was a convention taking place in the hotel that weekend. There was a long line at check in. But we did not wait very long at all. This hotel is quite large, and a little bit hard to navigate around. The staff gave us perfect directions to locate our room. The room itself was large and very clean. The bed felt so good after a long day of traveling, the entire room in general was very comfortable. The windows overlooked the indoor courtyard/convention center. This hotel is a converted train station, and the hotel is themed as such, but not overly done. Just enough to preserve this historic location, very neat. I will definitely stay here again the next time we visit St. Louis.I can't say enough about this beautiful hotel, the light show and the amazing people working within.  The Executive room is a steal as you get treated like a queen for breakfast and evening apps and cocktails.  Thank you Qiana! Probably the most pleasant staff I've ever encountered in a hotel.I'm at the beginning of my stay here at the St. Louis Union Station Hotel.  It's my first time staying here and besides the extreme friendliness of the staff I'm not super impressed.  The room seems a little dirty, there are no Kleenex in the room and although the hotel has a dog run,  it's connected to their inside mall which has a river that has an invisible edge.  As my dog was sniffing around, he fell into the 4ft of freezing water which was at 2am after a long 5 hour drive in the 35 degree weather.  This extended my all ready long night by forcing me to give my wet smelly dog a bath at 3am.  I wasn't happy.  Let's see how the rest of the trip goes, but my 10am meeting tomorrow morning is sounding a little painful.This is a gorgeous, grand hotel with outstanding facilities and attentive, helpful employees.  They've obviously done a good job in a number of areas.  Our large group, including both business travelers and some family members, ate breakfast each morning in the exclusive Presidential 'Link' dining room, a private room at the grill used by every President from Garfield to W.   We had cocktails in the lounge/bar area each night and waitresses were good and the light show was enjoyable.  The valets and bag boys are polite and on the job.However, I found the hotel WIFI to be a disaster, which is a huge problem for business travelers (and increasingly, leisure travels as well).  Signals were weak, connections were sporadic, speeds were either slow or non existent, and my experiences were shared by every business traveler I talked to in our 500 person group.  Staff was polite but had no idea what to do and could not provide an internal or external point of contact for help.  You get better internet options at a Motel 8, and the hotspot/WIFI devices we subsequently purchased to help with connectivity could not work in much of the building due to the stone and steel construction.What a great hotel in a great location. My mom, being the good woman that she is, bought my wife and I hockey tickets as we are huge hockey fans. We are from AZ and loyal to the Coyotes but after this trip, we are also huge Blues fans. The hotel staff was very nice and the room was great. We loved the location as it gave us access by walking to the hockey arena and was very close to a lot of the other things we wanted to do while we were in town including the wonderful City Museum and of course the St. Louis Arch. The valet were very good and rather quick in getting our vehicle for us and we're even pretty sure they didn't speed to get it to us quickly. We plan on staying here again in the near future and as a matter of fact, I need to go make that reservation.I am so pleased we decided to stay here two nights as part of our 4 week cross-country-and-back vacation. The service was consistently amazing. Every single employee was friendly and professional, from the servers in the restaurants, to the bell hops, to management. They must have a great training program. In addition, the food was great! We had a wonderful buffet breakfast in the Grille one morning. The fresh blueberries and watermelon were a welcome treat. We also got a great breakfast in Suite 3000, which is available when you upgrade and well worth the cost. Fresh blackberries, raspberries, blueberries and strawberries were wonderful!The best part about the hotel is the amazing Grand Lobby. Even if you don't stay here, visit at night, get a cocktail and watch the light show which plays to music on the massive ornate ceiling. I preferred this to Disneyland's water/light show and this one is free.Not there at all. It really has gone down hill. Someone needs to get it like the old daysLoved this hotel.  My husband booked the hotel on a whim, and it turned out to be a hit.  Union Station earns it's #3 spot on USA Today's 10 Best Historic Hotels with friendly staff and the awesome Romanesque Arches and light show in the Grand Hall.Our 9 and 13 year old enjoyed the pool and there was a range of dining options for even the pickiest of eaters.  Our boys had fun feeding the Koi fish and even named one ""Fat Face"", as he was one of the biggest fish and had a lot of personality.  He would hold his mouth wide open and just wait to be ""served""!Definitely would recommend this hotel!Beautiful hotel.  Stayed in historic area of hotel.  Historic, humm, just another word for old.  Toilet leaked, air conditioning was non op and window coverings were torn. Our view was overlooking the rooftop of the atrium.  Service people were helpful and available.  Again hotel is beautiful.The staff was exceptional and went over and above.  Our room was gorgeous and extremely clean with so much charm.  The atmosphere was beautiful and a wonderful surprise.Staying here for the polar express with my wife and 3 year old son.  Amazing from start to finish.  Sitting in the lobby now and we're watching a phenomenal light show.  Very impressed and I hope others take the time to experience this venue with your family.Awesome family hotel! Beautiful light show each evening starts at 6 pm daily. The Lobby is beautiful!! Outdoor pool is adequate. If you're on the executive levels your complementary breakfast, happy hour and soda during the day is well worth it. Service is excellent. It is much fancier than any doubletree I've ever been at. It's more like a very upscale Hilton. I would highly recommend!!!This is a former Marriott aspiring to be a Ramada.My recent stay was not a good one:- No heat in the room. Reported at 7:30 am, took two calls to fix, repair didn't show up until 1:30 PM.- Was woken up at 3 am the next night by the air handler conking out. Result: no heat again.- Room wasn't cleaned until 5 PM.We hosted an dinner at the hotel.  The settings and service wer amateurish and inconsistent.  Food was OK for banquet food.Also - avoid the valet parking.   My car came back covered in bird poop.  Valet was apologetic but not empowered.They have good public spaces (nice for a wedding, but I'd stay down the street at the Courtyard.The hotel is abosolute perfection on guest services! The rooms are the usual Doubletree layout and the property is beautiful.Amazing customer service. Qiana in the concierge lounge stood out but everyone was wonderful. Great buffet. Beautiful old school hotel. I chose the older non-renovated side for proximity to the lobby, lounge and general privacy. Nice room, could use more outlets...which I suspect that the renovated rooms have but that's okay. Valet is $27 in and out so be aware of that but that's the cost of staying downtown. The lobby is wonderful too. I love a great hotel lobby!","I'm so in love with this hotel , all of the co workers here are so nice they always say hi to u and ask u how r u doing ..  And we also have our dog In this hotelThis is my favorite hotel in St. Louis. One of my favorite day trips from Chicago, Kansas City or Oklahoma City is to take Amtrak spend a day or two at this hotel and then head out. The hotel is perhaps two blocks away from the St. Loius station and in fact was the original union station when St. Louis was the third largest city in america. It's within walking distance to Soulard's market, the arch, the Schafly tap room, Laclede's Landing, the stadium, and the city museum amongst other things. It also is co located with a shopping mall. So there's plenty to see and do. If you are not inclined to walk all the above are about a 5.00 taxi ride from the hotel. This hotel was originally designed at the turn of the 20th century thus each room is a little different, but very modern. Plenty of electrical outlets, wi fi, excellent plumbing etc.  The lobby is a ridiculous magnificent grand hall with fresco and gold leaf detailing, mosaics and art glass windows. The local light rail system is not quite a block away and runs straight to the airport. There is a restaurant on site which I've never eaten at except for the outstanding full service breakfast bufffet.  The staff have spoiled me so thoroughly that I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in St. Louis.I attended a wedding at this hotel.  I chose to stay here because the couple getting married reserved a block of rooms.  Unfortunately, I missed the deadline to receive the group rate of $149.00 a night.  I asked someone if they could honor the group rate and make an exception.  The person at the front desk did not have the authority to make an exception.  I understand that rules are rules.  I kindly asked to speak to someone who had authority to honor the group rate, but no one was available.    I paid $244.00 (after taxes) for one night here.  I haven't reached out to hotel management again to discuss the rate, but Hilton usually has good customer service.  I'm hopeful they will help me honor the group rate, or give me an even bigger discount.I enjoyed the wedding.  The venue was pretty.  The wait staff was incredibly helpful.  That part of my visit here wasn't bad.However, the room was terrible!  The bed was very comfortable and is the only reason why I can't put this room on the same level of a super 8 or a motel 6.  The sheets were stained.  The shelving was torn in the bathroom in two separate spaces leaving exposed particle board.  The toilet paper holder was broken.  You had to hold the handle down for at least 45 seconds for the toilet to flush.  The wall paper was torn and peeling off in the corners. I think a reasonable room rate for this hotel would be $99.00 a night, but only because of the hotel location.  If this hotel wasn't downtown I wouldn't pay more than $69.00 a night.  It was that bad.    The St. Louis Union Station Double Tree needs to go through a several hundred thousand dollar renovation. It's very dated and in need of a lot of work.   I decided to enjoy my evening at the wedding and try to talk to management for a partial refund later.  If you're looking for a hotel in St. Louis I'd recommend skipping this place and heading a few blocks over to the Westin.  Some of my friends got a Hotwire deal, and they stayed there for $116.00 a night.  That is a beautiful hotel.  The rooms are large, and very updated.  Skip the Double Tree at Union Station and look up the Westin.  It's not worth $244.00 a night here.I absolutely LOVED this hotel.  From the minute we pulled up out front we were welcomed with smiles, friendly banter and overall helpfulness.  We stayed 4 nights, in town for a friend's wedding, and everything went extremely smoothly.  The building is beautiful and has a luxurious feel to it with the high ceilings and lavish decorations.  The room was comfortable to the point that on our last day we just stayed in bed and ordered room service all day and recovered from the weekend.  But I have to say that the staff really made the place for us, they made everyone feel like we were their best guests and were constantly around eager to help with any little thing you might need or even wonder about.  They offered us cold bottles of water after coming back from walking around the city, directions to anywhere we wanted to go or even suggestions if we were undecided.  I was very sad to leave.Lovely hotel great location from the amtrak station.  There's construction going on but it's expected to maintain and upgrade the hotel.The hotel is walkable from the arch and the city museum. Just be smart when you around the hotel!The architecture alone is enough to have me come back to this hotel. The rooms are average, although I did have one of the older rooms rather than the newly renovated ones. The lobby bar is incredible. I loved the light show and the bartender was very nice and served some great mixed drinks. The bar's food is also surprisingly good, it's not your ordinary bar food. You can't beat the location either, there are so many fantastic restaurants around.This is a lovely hotel. Our room was newly remodeled. Very clean and stylish. The bed comfortable, the bathroom and lighting a little less so. The train photography and art was a nice touch. Service was first-rate. Probably the best I've had in a long time. The opulent, Romanesque hotel lobby, aka The Grand Hall, (which includes a bar) is worth the stay in itself. I probably spent more time there than in my room. I couldn't stop taking pictures. My only complaints were parking and the long trek to actually get inside the hotel. The trek includes a long hallway of mostly uninteresting shops and food court-style restaurants. Think of the Saint Louis Union Station as a mini-mall with a four-star hotel in it. Anyway, I would recommend valet, which would cut the irritating footslog out.If I'm in Saint Louis again, and there's a show at say the Peabody Opera House, it would be easy for me to book this hotel - even if it's only to have a drink in The Grand Hall.I would definitely stay here again. I was impressed with the location, it wasn't in the middle of the downtown, nor was it as far as the Ritz-Carlton. Staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful. I wish I could remember everyone's name!! We were warned about the area. Since I am from Chicago and gave ridden the ""El,"" not too much scares me. Near The Scott center.Heading back home from a long road trip and the Double Tree at Union Station was at our half way point. Actually called from the road for the reservation and we checked in at 8:00 pm. Our room was on the historical side of the hotel. The charm and architecture was perfect. They offered us a room on the Atrium remodeled side but I turned it down. It was our first time there so we wanted to get the full historical feel. Had dinner at the restaurant and it was great. Non rushed quite and tasty. Service was impeccable. We ate around 8:45 and were the only ones there on a Tuesday night.We headed over to the lounge for a night cap and watch the 10:00 light show on the Union station ceiling. Awesome!Breakfast buffet had everything you want and filled us up for our journey home.Thought about parking across the street for free but chose the secured self park outdoor lot in back of building for 20 bucks.  Valet was offered at 30 for same lot.Two entrances to the hotel. The original through double doors and up the union steps which lead you into the open architectural station or side entrance which leads you into the terminal side were the atrium rooms are located. That's the door nearest to the outdoor parking lot.What a find!We absolutely love this hotel and would never stay anywhere else when coming to St. Louis. The bell hops are amazing, especially Doug and Randy, who both bring years of experience to this venue. One of the best parts of the hotel is the staying power of the staff, and the fact that they still recognize us, even when we don't get the chance to come down every year. James is an excellent valet who will go out of his way to be pleasant. When we checked in yesterday, there was an unbelievable amount of guests checking in with us. In fact, the line was about 1/2 a block long. This morning under our door was a letter from the general manager explaining the reason for the number of people (a Blues game that brought in almost 20,000 and a motocross race that brought in 65,000 to the city). Even with the crowd, we were treated with the utmost respect, smiles all around, and a true welcoming experience. Beyond the staff, the rooms are clean, the beds comfortable. You should check out the light show when here, and the historic grandiose atmosphere is worth more than my words can express. The fitness room is top notch! We don't come for the mall, which is the only part lacking. Overall, the Doubletree Hilton is my favorite hotel.You would be hard pressed to find a better looking lobby.  The exterior is exceptional, a lot of money went into this location.  Certainly the nicest looking Double Tree I've stayed at.  The pool is average at best, for such a big hotel, an upgrade would be nice.  The room itself was a great temperature; nice and cool (ac works!).  Thick walls, kept noises to minimum.  Parking is pricey, not a fair rate, downtown ST LOUIS is pretty empty/boring, not sure who would take all those spots (20 and 27 valet a day).  The care/call center was my main 'issue'; the pool was out of service for a day; they hung up on me, said it was opening in 15 minutes, nothing like what actually happened.  Also a do not disturb sign was taken off the door, had to call multiple times to get another one; first person at desk basically ignored the simple request.  Not sure I'd return to St Louis again (except for work), best to have a car at this location, downtown blows.This was clearly an old hotel but still a beautiful hotel. When you walk in you go up a massive staircase that opens to the entry way of the rail station ticket center. It's so beautiful with its art work and massive ceiling carvings. The rooms are basic and nothing thrilling. But I will say they are quiet. I didn't hear anyone around me which is normally unusual for a hotel. Most of the rooms have beautiful view of downtown. The hotel has multiple restaurants around it and of course a mall built within. I absolutely loved staying here. The history behind it made it more than worth the while. I would love to stay here again if ever in the area.Decided to have a nice relaxing getaway and spoil the lady a little.  I've stayed in a lot of Hilton/doubletree hotels for work so I figured this would be a safe bet.  First let me say the original building is stunning.  The entry hall is amazing and really blew us away.  You can certainly sit there for hours and just enjoy the art put into the original station.  On that I would have given this place 5 stars.  On the hotel it loses 2.  The place is under renovation and it needs it.  The corridors to the rooms are dim, marked up by use, and feel tired.  Our rooms window as blocked by something, the paint was peeling in the bathroom, the tiles were missing from the bathroom wall, and the bottom of the tub was worn thin and dark.  Not great.  Union station is also a kind of small mall with lots of non-hotel gets wondering about and more than once we were put off by the non-guests.  When we checked in we pointed out to the porter that there were dirty glasses ourside our door.  They were still there when we checked out.  Valet parking was nice but not 24 dollars a night nice.  15 bucks for breakfast is not uncommon.  Just wish it was better food. So minus 2 stars for a beat up hotel with a lack of attention to detail. 5/11/14. Under major renovations.  Wish they would have warned me during booking.Awesome hotel!! Beautiful and lots to see the laser show was amazing! Everyone we spoke to was was so polite and helpful!! The Buffett in the morning was spectacular and very good!!! The staff was very friendly! The room was spotless the bed was very comfortable and it was all and all a great evening!!!This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at.  Clean, polite staff, nice pool and grand entrance.   I can't wait until next year to come back.Hotel staff are proactively very courteous and friendly. It's a gorgeous historic building located right near a Metro link station so you can ditch the car and ride transit which is awesome.  They also have a really beautiful outdoor pool with great lounge seating. You can bring drinks from the bar in there and food if you like. It is crawling with kids the entire time though, which is great for families but not awesome if you are looking for some quiet pool time. I would say this hotel is very family friendly. I wonder if they train their workers to be super friendly or if they have good labor practices because they definitely came across as happy and always gave a cheery hello.  Free WiFi is a plus as well.I can't give it five stars because the hotel is SO huge. Our room was kind of tucked away and not super accessible. It was, however, extremely quiet in our wing. It's connected to a kind of depressing empty mall which was easy to ignore but kind of sad to look at. The services and stores in the mall need vast improvement. Also, prices are really expensive but expected for a downtown hotel that likely caters to convention traffic. Parking is $24 on top of your room fee though they do have free valet which is nice. While our breakfast was good, a pot of coffee cost $8 and pancakes cost $12. We did get room service ($4 delivery fee and 22% gratuity makes it cheaper to order pizza) and everything was arranged beautifully on a tray with a fresh flower.  Overall, I expected the bloated tourist prices and was really satisfied with our stay.Beautiful hotel.  Very historic feel and close to attractions and downtown.  The restaurant and bar are very nice.  I enjoyed sitting in the lobby becuase it was like being in a museum.Beautiful old building. Very friendly staff. This is our second time spending New Year Eve here. Love to be able to explore the hotel, all the history involved with the train station that use to be here. Glorious grand room. Nice firm beds.The hotel looks perfect location is ok, the interesting thing about the building is that they took an old train station which was built is the 1800's and turned it to a hotel with some renovation. The welcoming was excellent, we got walnut cookies on the way in. I was on the executive floor number 3, where we got a launch to eat in from 6;30 to 9:30 and 5 to 10 snacks but filling. I strongly advise the valu parking. I was disappointed they did not have any slippers but no big deal. Thank you kayana for the hospitality in the launch your a sweet heart.A hidden gem for STL natives and tourists.  I thought Union Station was a big abandoned piece of s@#t... I WAS WRONG.   I can't speak for the rest of the venue, but the hotel bar on the market street entrance is a must!  Check it out","I stayed here last week during one of the Cardinals NLDS games for 2 nights.  I lived in St. Louis growing up so I was familiar with Union Station in it's glory days of the 1990s when it was a legitimate shopping mall and place that many tourists went to.  I'll get back to that part later but let me start with the hotel itself.  This hotel has one of the most accommodating staffs I have encountered, even staying in dozens of hotels a year during my travels.  From the bell hop to the valet to the front desk clerk to any staff that you may encounter throughout the hallways.  Everyone seemed legitimately interested in trying to help you and making sure you had a great experience.  The first person you will encounter is the valet.  Self-parking is $20 and valet is $28 a day.  The valet option is unlimited come and go and the self parking is a considerable walk so I paid a few bucks for the added convenience.  I think I waited maybe a maximum of 5 minutes for my car at any given point in time.  The bell hop was courteous and prompt in unloading my traveling companions and my bags from the trunk and taking them directly to our room and even hanging up our clothes in the closet.  When walking in the main entrance you'll walk up a short staircase to what is known as the Grand Hall.  It will take your breath away upon first sight.  I won't go into the in-depth history but this was, almost a century ago, a major train hub for the Mid West and Grand Hall, as it does now, was a place for travelers to relax, enjoy the stunning architecture and have dinner/drinks.  A bar runs almost the full length of the Grand Hall yet there were only two smallish (by modern standards) TVs so this isn't a place you'll want to go to watch the game.  One of the attractions is a 'light show' every hour on the hour from 5-11pm at night.  I stopped by one night to watch and was a bit underwhelmed.  It's certainly interesting to watch but I would not make an extra effort to be there on time.  It's something that I'm sure would have elicited 'ooohs' and 'ahhhhs' maybe 20-25 years ago but not so much now.  Just think of it as an added bonus on the architecture and ambiance that is already there.  Speaking of which, this is definitely not a 'party' hotel.  Even with the playoff games in town the Grand Hall was always very quiet and sparsely populated.  I did not eat there but had a drink at the bar - decent drink and a fair price.As for the room itself, I was also quite impressed.  I would not describe it as luxury beyond your wildest dreams but still a very nice place to stay.  The rooms were recently renovated so they are all quite modern with a touch of the old world with a painting or two from the era in which Union Station was crowned.  The beds were quite soft and comfortable and the bathroom was extremely spacious with a large vanity that separated a large shower from the toilet with plenty of towels.  The Wi-Fi was a little fussy while I was there but at least it was FREE unlike some 5 star hotels I have stayed at that charge for it!The worst part about staying here was remembering what Union Station was like compared to what it is now outside of the hotel.  15 or more years ago, Union Station was a legitimate shopping mall with two thriving restaurants (Hoolihans and Hooters) anchoring the main entrance.  Both are now gone and abandoned.  Unless you're in the mood for imitation hand bags, none of the shops will appeal to you....well, except The Cardinal Clubhouse which sells Cardinals merchandise, mainly to hotel guests I assume.  I may date myself here but in the early 1990s Union Station was one of the only - I believe - places in the city that had a 'Virtual Reality' arcade type center......if you're old enough to remember when that the in thing.  I should note that as a hotel guest you'll always feel safe because the hotel is isolated by several (at least two levels) of always locked doors that can only be accessed with your room key.  I mention the above only because a revitalized mall/restaurant at Union Station would make this place a top 3 pick hotel in the downtown area.I should also mention that I was able to reserve this room via Priceline for approximately half of the usual rate.  Either way, I'd recommend staying here for a bit of charm if you're tired of the cookie cutter Embassy Suites and Holiday Inns!I stayed here for one night in July and when I booked the hotel for about $130 for one night I was pretty happy I got a nice deal for a hotel located close to the Amtrak station and ballpark (which is where I needed to be). When I had originally booked the room, nowhere in the booking did it say that there was an age limit to stay in the room. I'm 19 and was able to the book the room with no problem. Here's where the problem started. I called the hotel to make sure I wouldn't have an issue staying there due to my age. The first girl told me the age limit is 18 and that I would have no problem. I asked her if she could double confirm with me (aka ask someone else as well) and she directed my call to a different person. This person didn't know and assumed it was 18. I called the next day and another person proceeded to tell me that the age limit was 21 and that I would have to cancel my reservation. Keep in mind, this was a week before my staying and I had nowhere else to stay. I told her my situation and she said. I finally was able to speak with an supervisor who was very kind and told me that it was 21 years of age but if I was quiet and respected the rules of the hotel then they would let it slide for one night (this was after she spoke to the general manager of the hotel). She was very helpful about it and she felt bad that no one else could give me a correct answer/were uninformed of the age limit. After all of that was squared away, the actual checking in and hotel experience was fantastic! I got a free cookie by the front desk before I went to my room. My room looked like it had been recently remodeled and has a nice view over the pool. I really like how they restored the train station in a hotel. How awesome is that?-- preserving history and restoring it. I also really like it's proximity to downtown and the character of the hotel. Hopefully I can stay here again if I ever find myself in St. Louis.This place is sick! There's a tiny mall connected to the hotel and there's a really cool pool space. There are certain times of the day when you can go into the lounge area and sit at the bar or a nice group of leather chairs and there will be movies playing on the beautiful ceiling. It's so cool! It is very pretty and looks astonishing from the outside too! The only thing I didn't like about this place is thee was no refrigerator in the rooms.Most places have little refrigerators in the rooms.Lobby was beautiful, rooms were nice and comfortable, access to the rooms a little weird.  We prefer stairs to elevators but couldn't find any to get us to and from the lobby area and our room.  Felt very secure with the Union Station mall attached to the hotel.  Would definitely stay here again.I may have found my new favorite hotel to stay in while visiting St Louis...my usual (favorite) hotel (Embassy) was booked solid because of graduations and the Cardinals having home games against the Cubs.  So I chose another Hilton brand that was available, Doubletree, a great choice.  I type ""may"" because the property is a work in progress, but it is definitely headed in the right direction.  Beautiful property - originally opened in 1894, St Louis' Union Station has been renovated to house an updated hotel.  As you walk through one of the double doors opened by the valet, you walk up the stairs to historic grandeur.  I was awe-inspired by the high ceilings and architecture - splendor of the previous hey days of the city and building.  Beautiful property with character and originality.  NOT a cookie cutter property, but one with history that the management markets.  During my stay, a company rented the main lobby area (with great high ceilings and decor) for a dinner and concert headlined by the DRIFTERS.  Okay, not really a mainliner, but a great band. During the evenings, on the hour, the interior of the hotel lobby turns into an indoor interactive theater with different motifs - free entertainment. More funds are being expended to improve upon the property - it can only get better.Pluses* Unique and one of a kind property* Great gym - Life Cycle equipment, dumb bells from 5-50 lbs in 5 lbs increments, ellipicals, treadmills, recumbent bikes.  * Outstanding and responsive staff - abundance of security due to the open nature of the property, * Great location - off the beaten path a bit, but away from the hustle and bustle of downtown, yet close enough to the stadiums (for Cardinal baseball)* Concierge services at the end of the third floor is open at 0630 for a healthy breakfast of fruits, bread, (Starbucks) coffee, eggs, bacon; and during happy hours, finger food consisting of fresh vegetables and some finger food.* Grand Bar (in the main lobby) recently opened has a great selection of bourbon and scotch (complimented by great draft beer to include the local breweries of AB products as well as Schlaflys)* Hilton quality and expectations met - room, bed and pillows, amenitiesMinuses* A few minor issues - upgrades still are required: shower fixture requires effort to turn on/off; chair for the desk need to be an ergonomic work seat vice a dining room chair* Valet parking is recommended - self parking is available, but for safety and convenience the valet is available* Room(s) and the property remains work in progress - there may be some inconveniences and things may not work (shower handle was tough to turn on/off), but overall great room* A small shopping mall is attached to the property selling ""touristy"" items.  Until an anchor store arrives, do not foresee any improvements in the shopping department.Have to say we were skeptical after reading some of these reviews but thus far we have experienced nothing but friendly smiles from welcoming staff (Anthony greeted us late at night and was very helpful!) to our very clean and spacious double queen room.... I called about the renovations and was told that they would place is away from it although they don't do anything on the weekends and we haven't seem any sign of construction. The hotel is so history rich and just beautiful... I can close my eyes and see all the hustle and bustle of they station from years past.... We have the breakfast buffet this morning and we were very impressed by the gorgeous restaurant, original molding and some historical pieces throughout... And the cinnamon French toast was awesome as well!!!  Def going to be back here and I recommend you ignore some of the bad reviews otherwise you will have missed a gem!By far, the nicest, must exciting hotel my family and I have ever stayed at. The staff is professional and highly accommodating. Our room was comfortable and clean. The kids enjoyed the pool, and the free water, cookies, and fruit throughout our stay was very nice. The kids also enjoyed the scavenger hunt. Definitely somewhere we would return to.Last weekend we had approximately 25 rooms booked by guests attending our son's wedding and we could not have had a better experience. The hotel staff is amazing, caring, friendly and helpful. From the moment we arrived we were greeting with the amazing staff who took care of all of our needs and exceeded our expectations.This is the perfect hotel for multiple guests attending a wedding, or any event. The lobby bar in the beautiful old part of the hotel was a great gathering place for everyone going in and out. So fun since you could see everyone coming and going. Our large room on the 5th floor was big enough to hold our out of town guests for drinks and snacks, and to watch a little football, between the ceremony and the reception.My husband and sons stayed in the old part of the hotel above the lobby, where our rooms were large with vaulted ceilings. This part of the hotel is so charming and where we have always stayed.This is definitely our hotel of choice when visiting  St.  LouisThere is a definite 'cool' factor to this hotel. If you don't know what you're walking into, this location used to be the old train station in St Louis from the 1800's to 1978. It became a mall in the 80's, and a hotel portion was added on. It was definitely interesting walking around in the hotel, and I enjoyed seeing how they transitioned everything over. Here are my hotel review criteria: Cleanliness - Pretty clean. No bed bugs, towels and sheets were all clean, and all of the surfaces had been wiped. Food Option - There is a restaurant at the hotel, and they serve snacks and drinks in the consigner lounge. Room - more than adequate for someone traveling on businessLocation - This place is in the center of the downtown and right next to the Grey Hound location. There was some sketchy behavior going on in areas around the hotel, but if you don't wander around ... I'm sure you will be absolutely safe. This is coming from a single female traveler.A great stay in a great room. The staff is top notch and incredibly friendly. The Concierge lounge was wonderful and the light show got even better in the main room. This is the only place we stay when we come through St. Louis.It truly gets no better than this hotel.  I was in St. Louis for a conference last week and had a chance to stay at the Union Station Hotel and it was amazing.  I had excellent customer service from the moment I stepped out of my taxi and it continued all week. My luggage was taken out of the cab and up the stairs to the front desk for me. I breezed through the checkin process and was in my room within minutes. By the way it was hot and sticky outside when I got there and someone left the AC on so my room was comfortably chilly when I got inside. Thanks guys!The bedding was good quality and very comfortable.I ate dinner at the on site restaurant and the food was fantastic and the service was great too.  I had breakfast there every morning and loved that too! Also, they serve Starbucks coffee which was a nice surprise. The free wifi was also quite good and they had a wired hookup in the room as well.. I got a free newspaper every morning and on check out day I didn't even need to ask about express checkout they had my receipt all set and slid it under the door.I can't say enough good things about this hotel.  Did I mention how majestic the architecture is inside?  This was formerly 1950s train station and they're still finishing up their remodel so there is some construction going on, it's a huge undertaking really.  But the parts that are finished look spectacular.  Please stay here if you are considering a trip to St. Louis anytime soon.Thanks for a great stay everyone. I'm smart enough to know it was a team effort. All it would have taken is one person to drop the ball.  Everyone delivered. Thank you so much.I'm staying here again next chance I get.For now it's 3 Stars. I've just arrived this afternoon. Only the start of a there part review. I'll be back. Everything standard is above average. Haven't really been bothered , I like that. I dislike being annoyed by staff. So far it's perfect. Okay so I see you can't post several reviews. So it's 2am, ending my first day here. To be clear I'm not from here I'm from Chicago so I expect a level of ignorance everywhere. But we visited other friends at their hotel the Renaissance it's not too far from here and when we returned to the hotel we jumped out the car and a bellman said to my fiancee, "" you better leave this one alone she only wants your money."" We were both appalled, I just walked away.  Now I'll keep this in mind when I'm leaving this place. I actually can't get over this. You see I've already traveled all over America and aboard and I guess I'm just used to not hearing someone insult you some level of privacy. I've seen it all, cockroaches bad food, bad service etc but I've never been talked to like that. I think I'm giving it 1 star. I can get this anywhere, why did I drive 5 hours to some other supposed nice city when I can stay downtown back home in Chicago? I'm pretty sure I said I didn't like to bothered. And this was way over the line.This is a beautiful historic hotel. Don't miss the history show in the lounge. It is a great light show.   Now for the negatives. The room was dirty -especially bathtub. They did not honor our reservation for a king bed. Instead giving us 2 queens.  The mall it is in is practically empty and shuts down very early. The area around the hotel is a little sketchy.  More. positive. The lady running the Grand Market was very nice and helpful. And they did give us $50 off our room since it was so dirty.Great! 100% of the staff were engaging and helpful. I prepaid for a King room and the bellman escorted us to a double queen in a new portion of the hotel. I called the desk clerk and he apologized and had the bellman take us to the historic side of the hotel and put us in a top notch fully renovated room that could not have been more nice. The lobby area is spectacular and exudes history. All of the historic side of the hotel was beautiful. Only minor complaint was the cost of a martini at the lobby bar ($12.50).The hotel is in a beautiful building that is currently being renovated. Once it is complete - I'm sure it will look great. Until then, stay away unless you need to be awake before 7am. They post that construction starts at 8:30am - which is reasonable - but it really starts at 7am. When I called to inquire about the noise, the girl who answered confirmed it was construction, that many people had already called to complain, and that she was used to complaints because ""they're always starting early - I wonder why they do that.""  Stay at another hotel unless you need to get up early.Pretty cool Inside.    Old train station.   Hotels clean.  No complaints.   Free lollypops.   Fancy tapas restaurant downstairs.   Most were quite good.    Drinks were delicious (Trans syberia)The only and I mean only reason I am giving this place four stars is because the hotel was doing renovations and it made it a little hard to get from the parking lot to our room. It was a little confusing trying to find our way around with all the construction.  The staff was wonderful!  When we left our room each morning there was not a time when one of the staff members would say good morning or is there anything I can do for you.  Be sure to check in with the four square app.  I did and was given five extra cookies at check in.  There are so delicious.  I loved our room.  The bed was soft and comfy!  The views around the hotel are also so amazing.  If you get a chance I would try the breakfast buffet!  they have everything you can think of and the food is so fresh!  If I come again to St. Louis I will definitely stay here again!Beautiful hotel location and friendly staff... Rooms are dated, though.  Great location.Would actually give this hotel 4.5 stars. We were taken to this hotel through Hotwire and received a great deal. Not knowing much about St Louis, we were very pleasantly surprised at the location and atmosphere of the hotel. With it being in Union Station, the lobby is beautiful. The staff were all extremely friendly. There were several restaurants within walking distance which was a bonus. We stayed here the weekend before Christmas and everything was nicely decorated. The only reason I would not give this hotel 5 stars is due to the rooms being a little outdated and the halls smelled old and musty. Other than that though, our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. I would say I am picky when it comes to hotels, and this one we will definitely be revisiting!This was a pleasant experience, indeed. Usually I stay with family during trips to St. Louis, but this time I was in a wedding party and it was necessary to stay here. That being said, it was a busy and boozy weekend so I didn't get to utilize all that this fine hotel has to offer. What I did experience here was really nice. First off,  how cool to be able to stay in an old Union Station! The rooms were nice, quiet, clean, and the a/c was awesome. The service here is wonderful, I was able to have a mini fridge delivered after 1am at no additional cost. One morning the concierge comped their wonderful breakfast buffet (do not miss this one, it's the beezneez) after I casually mentioned the old man in his underwear knocking on my door the night before...Concierge: Oh, are you on the 5th floor?Me: Um, why, yesConcierge: I am so sorry for your inconvenience, the man is a sleep walker and knocked on a lot of doors last night.He then asked if I would like to partake in a complimentary breakfast for any trouble. So I of course got down on that big time. One night there was a strange smell wafting through the room, and the front desk had a maintenance person come check it out right away, much appreciated. I really wanted to check out the pool in the huge and beautiful atrium, but I literally had no time for it. Maybe next time I find myself in need of a good hotel room while In St. Louis, I will be back and in that pool asap.","This is a gorgeous hotel, even in spite of the renovations under way. The lobby, available by sight only at this point, is stunning. The lower level where I imagine sharply-dressed, hat wearing crowds waited for their trains and loved ones, is a large, expansive space with marble floors and gorgeous side-rooms. The rooms are what you'd expect - nice, but not overwhelming. The beds are comfy, but there are a few odd things. It's always the details that put someplace on top, or in second place. Some missed details: The battered mini-fridge right next to the door (just weird). The armoire oddly angled off the wall to allow for the cords behind it. The lack of plugs by the bed (come on, this is a major problem in so many hotels). The very loud AC/heating unit.  Stocking the bed with synthetic pillows, when down should be around too (yep, I'm a jerk). The lack of a robe, which I know should be in the room from past visits (yeah, I know, I'm the asshole here, too).The executive lounge is nice, with Schlafly available for $5. Food is not very good, although I eat it. Rather, evening food isn't (softish broccoli and carrots=gross); breakfast is really good. Nice oatmeal with fresh berries. Decent coffee (although it would be nice to have coffee mugs rather than only paper). Super duper nice people here. The staff everywhere is awesome. They really go out of their way to make you feel good. And they remember everyone's name, which I am both impressed with and jealous over.Anyway, it's my top choice for Hilton hotels in the city. Great location - short drive from lots of nice neighborhoods. Not super expensive. Nice staff. Clean. BBQ near by. And again, it's gorgeous. Such a wonderful piece of history.Today was a horrific experience with travel and work; and then, I stepped up to Union Station's Doubletree Hotel whereupon Yohannes' welcome and assistance opened the evening to delight and relaxation.  Kirsten made the registration simply enjoyable,  a task that is usually routine but Kirsten made it a simple introductory pleasure.  The room was fresh, impeccably prepared: oh how my evening was shaping up.   I had decided to stay at the hotel for dinner and the two hour presentation melted my day's anxiety totally away.  Daniel was thoroughly aware of my intentions as soon as he asked where I would like to be seated, and I permitted him to make the selection to his advantage.  Daniel knew every detail about each menu item and I was convinced about the evening pasta special and his recommendation of dessert.  Now this is service that is unexpected, yet so appreciated when it is a standard of practice by an individual or establishment. The delivery of pretzel bread and a superb whole grain mustard butter was perfectly selected to my liking.  Then, Nick Jaronovic delivered the entree,  and had an excellent manner and exchange of conversation to my questions. The dessert Daniel selected was like a deconstructed Smors with a vanilla ice cream on a graham cracker crust, marshmallows lightly glazed with an elegant chocolate laced swirl. Then the chocolate cake like covered melted chocolate.  Each bite was a treasure in itself;  served with a poignant Starbucks coffee that ended the meal with a hint of earthiness that handsomely complimented the Smors campfire style dessert.  Another server aided in this course of events, Nick (another Nick) graciously took the time to find out which coffee was served, and Daniel explained the Morning Menu.  I believe breakfast will be the BST Eggs Benedict.  Tonight will pass quickly or possibly languish while I eagerly await this excellent service and cuisine again in the morning.  What a tremendous hotel and landmark.  I recall when it was discussed that it be torned down for a parking lot, a pigeon invested monument.  Well, only the city leaders can keep such treasures going; only reget is that such plans take too long to be realized.   Only knowing treasures such as this have a place in the future, the future should not be so far off.  Tonight, proves proper planning and salvaging historical sites is truly a worthy cause.  Thanks to everyone involved!The hotel is nice and in a decent location. The Station Grille staff was very nice &amp; the breakfast buffet was super good. The front desk staff wasn't the most helpful. My room wasn't ready when I checked in so I was given a lesser room...still waiting for refund of the difference in room costs. When I got to my room the bedspread had stains on it...could've been blood or marinara sauce...either way they were noticable enough that it should have been caught by housekeeping...kinda makes you wonder if they actually changed the sheets. The concierge &amp; bellman staff were wonderful. Double Tree always give you a hot fresh cookie when you check in...they only had cookies w/nuts in them which I'm allergic to...so no cookie for me.The rooms are solid, nothing to write home about, but the property? Amazing! Located inside of an old train station, the lobby is one of the best I have seen., wonderful architecture.... The station grille is lovely and all of the staff are friendly and professional.Great stay!  Wonderful customer service, very comfortable beds and delicious breakfast buffet.  The indoor ""mall"" is great if the weather gets bad.  Many good restaurants in the area also.Service, comfort, quality!!  This place is great. The concierge service is well worth the extra money. Wonderful breakfast and great staff. The historic quality of the building is breathtaking.  This would be five stars if it were not for the location. Union station has a lot of empty shops and parking lot had lots of foot traffic because of the metrolink station.Not a bad hotel overall. The staff was friendly and check in was quick. The room however was ""alright"". It looked clean at first glance but there was an odd smell, almost like wet carpet. The bathroom had a good amount of dust, maybe it hadn't been used in a while and they didn't bother to dust. We arrived late and went straight to bed then checked out the following morning so we overlooked some details due to fatigue. The beds were definitely comfortable and clean. If I had to stop by again I would book it again but definitely ask for a pleasantly smelling room.This is a case where the other ratings are based on the venue's history and not the quality of the accommodations. Without a doubt, the hotel property is amazing - it's a 120 year old train station that was decommissioned in 1978 and eventually converted into a tourist attraction hotel. It is well worth a 10 minute walk/stop but it is presently totally underwhelming beyond that. For starters, the original hotel rooms are seemingly unavailable for even HIlton top tier guests - without explanation. The ""newer"" rooms built in the last 20 years, I suspect are run down late 80's variety rooms. Specifically, the showers are really run down, the A/C units have been fashioned to sound like trains are standing by outside the door, and other than the predictably comfortable Hilton bed, the room is just fine (I was re-assigned twice so this is not an isolated case). Second, the hotel bar, which is the only other on-site attraction looks like it was purchased from Ikea and assembled on site. It's like 20 x 20 in an amazing room the size of a football field and a half. Why would anyone want to spend time there? Third, hotel parking offsite and in the winter its a not so pleasant walk way out of the way of the hotel entrance. They do have valet, but honestly, it should be all the same rate given the circumstances. Hopefully someone will invest in fixing this thing up!this is no longer the Marriott Hotel but the Double Tree Hotel by hilton!!!beware of this hotel!!!!! they just approved a policy of putting a hold on customers for $50 a night for incidentals!!! if you stay for 5 days thats $250 just for incidentals on top of your nightly charge for your stay! are you kidding me!!!! oh yea, if you don't have a credit card  it's double that, yes $100 a night for incidentals!!!!!!! finally, they don't tell you this till you get there at check-in!!!   ps. yes that includes all you cogic people there for the convention!!!We had an absolutely lovely experience during our stay. The elegant historic ambiance went along with the first class service throughout the hotel. Great beds, and delicious breakfast buffet a plus.The place to stay in St Louis!!Beautiful building!  Staff went above and beyond to be helpful and nice. Conveniently located to city museum, arch, etc. Pool was warm and a lot of fun for the kids after a day of sightseeing. Rooms were clean and comfortable. And a special shout out to Randy at valet who helped us find fun restaurants and advice on area attractions!!I just spent the weekend with my 3 sisters at this hotel and can't say enough about it.  The hotel is in the old railway station and has a beautiful lobby with a vaulted mosaic ceiling and stained glass windows.  There was plenty of comfortable seating around a very friendly bar which is adjacent to the equally friendly grille.   The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was particularly nice.  What made the stay was the friendliness of the staff.  I'm from Chicago and used to being treated in a rather faceless manner, but the staff of this hotel couldn't do enough for us.  Everyone we met offered service without being asked and seemed genuinely interested in making sure that we enjoyed our stay.  Would not even think of staying anywhere else in St. Louis!I love this hotel. The architecture is absolutely amazing. Take some time before you check in to relax in the lounge. As for the room itself, the room was clean and had a nice layout. The only negative was the view. My ""view"" was of the indoor mall which occupies the rest of union station. The mall seems to close early, and when it did things got very quiet (well, except for some banging sounds coming from a nighttime remodel of the Pita King, but you can't blame the hotel for that).Parking is at 20th &amp; Market, just across the (brick) street from the hotel. It's outdoor parking, but there's someone at the booth 24/7, so hopefully they keep an eye out.Now a Doubletree by Hilton but I think the Marriott management stayed behind.  I was charged a ""convention fee"" and was told this was a federal tax by the front desk.  When I asked for information on this misleading entry an ""accountant"" brought me what she said was the document authorizing this charge.  What she gave me was a St. Louis information sheet on tax exemptions.  It's only $3 a night so all I wanted was an explanation.  None of the other hotels in the area have ever charged this fee on my bill.  I think it is their way of paying for a dying mall.    Most Doubletree and Hilton hotels have lounges for Honors Diamond members where you can get a free (or very inexpensive) beer or wine.  Not here.  The Concierge Lounge actually charged more than the restaurants.  As for the restaurants, how about $18 for a chicken breast, mashed potatoes and dried out brocolli.  To summarize:  overpriced, outdated and misleadingMy friend and I stayed at this hotel for three nights in May 2013.  The positives: hotel was clean, staff was extremely professional and friendly, the hotel was very charming and unique, the location was great, and the breakfast was amazing - tons of choices!  Now for the negatives, which aren't many, but I should probably mention... First, the original room that we checked in to smelled of cigarette smoke.  The hotel is a non-smoking hotel, but the guest before us clearly violated the rules.  The front desk promptly changed our room and even provided complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience with the change in rooms.  Second, the hotel is very large and extremely difficult to navigate, especially coming from the self-parking lot.  The last thing you want to have to do after traveling all day is wander around a hotel looking for the guest rooms because there's no signage to direct you anywhere.Beautiful lobby, average rooms.  Staff up front are very nice (as mentioned in previous reviews), but they don't have enough staff to keep rooms up.  Not enough space in bathroom to hang up towels and cleaning staff don't get around until 3 or after.I'm guessing that this hotel has a serious problem with crime and homeless people sneaking into the hotel to commit crimes.  I attended a 48-hour computer competition at the hotel and decided to sit on a bench in the convention space with my jacket over my head and take a nap (at approximately 1:30 a.m.)  Shortly thereafter a security officer approached me and immediately began grilling me about whether I had a room (yes), what I was doing (convention).  If I can't sleep on a bench, please simply say that instead of causing a major incident.  The location of this bench (arguably inside the convention area) and nature of convention (all-night computer programming) suggests that it might not be totally insane for a hotel guest to think he or she is able to take a brief nap.  Pros: nice interior and historic.  Cons: see above, unclear security policies, and possible major security problems.  Note that this is opinion only and I don't have actual crime statistics to support this opinion.  Bottom line: I will probably stay at the Chase, Ballpark Hilton, or somewhere else next time.","['blessed', 'lucky', 'week', 'totally', 'price', 'range', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'staff', 'hotel',
