http://www.yelp.com/biz/angel-inn-central-branson,Angel Inn Central,4.5,$,7,"Very nice hotel. Loved the hot tub and the breakfast was just great. I was rung up by an 18yo kid who was really cool. The placed was priced, just right. And it is literally, right off the strip.Only issue I had, was asking more than twice, for someone to bring an extra bed up. Costed an extra ten bucks but with worth it, not sleeping with a guy.Very surprised with how great this hotel was for the price we payed. It does have outdoor rooms, but I never felt unsafe or uncomfortable. The pool seemed like a fun hangout spot, but we never had time to go. It's location is right off the main road. It is an older hotel. The toilet was running when we entered the room, but my husband fixed it in 2 minutes tops. Overall, we had a great experience here and would return if we go to Branson again.I liked the Angel Inn. They used to be a Hampton. They are a very large hotel, with 3 buildings. We had to walk through 2 buildings to get to the breakfast, then had to bring our breakfast all the way back to the room. It is very clean. The room was spacious with a small refrigerator, microwave, ample lighting and the most comfortable pillows I've ever slept on. Sometimes the wifi was nonexistent.When I called to confirm the reservations, they were confused and a bit rude, saying, No, we run your card when you check in. As if they couldn't hear I prepaid. But when I got there, the staff were very kind.There is a small shop selling sugar and spice. I would stay at this hotel again. If you know Branson, it's on Green Mountain drive away from the main drag. Pretty nice place.The rooms were nice and spacious as well as very clean. The staff was friendly and I was very happy with the breakfast in the morning. The pools and hot tub was nice and well maintained as well. Given that Branson is a big tourist area the hotel was packed but it was still a pleasant stay.Really more than we thought the many times we drove by here. Very nice and updated. We will be back soon. Priced right and the staff helped out when needed. Right off the strip and perfectThis is the second time I've stayed here at the Angels Inn and both times have been a wonderful stay! A good price, a comfortable clean room, safe, large TV, great morning breakfast, and staff is very genuinely nice  to boot! So when I'm in Branson visiting this is my favorite convenient location to stay!Very nice hotel!!  It was perfect for a mother/daughter trip.  Situated really well for our shopping and eating!  We really appreciated having the   Included breakfast.  It was very reasonably priced.  Also enjoyed having the pool and hot tub!",,,,,"['nice', 'hotel', 'loved', 'hot', 'tub', 'breakfast', 'great', 'rung', 'kid', 'really', 'cool', 'placed', 'priced', 'right', 'literally', 'right', 'strip', 'issue', 'asking', 'twice', 'someone', 'bring', 'extra', 'bed', 'extra', 'ten', 'bucks', 'worth', 'sleeping', 'guy', 'surprised', 'great', 'hotel', 'price', 'payed', 'outdoor', 'rooms', 'never', 'felt', 'unsafe', 'uncomfortable', 'pool', 'seemed', 'like', 'fun', 'hangout', 'spot', 'never', 'time', 'location', 'right', 'main', 'road', 'older', 'hotel', 'toilet', 'running', 'entered', 'room', 'husband', 'fixed', 'minutes', 'tops', 'overall', 'great', 'experience', 'return', 'liked', 'angel', 'inn', 'used', 'large', 'hotel', 'buildings', 'walk', 'buildings', 'breakfast', 'bring', 'breakfast', 'way', 'back', 'room', 'clean', 'room', 'spacious', 'small', 'refrigerator', 'microwave', 'ample', 'lighting', 'comfortable', 'pillows', 'ever', 'slept', 'sometimes', 'nonexistent', 'called', 'confirm', 'reservations', 'confused', 'bit', 'rude', 'saying', 'run', 'card', 'check', 'hear', 'prepaid', 'staff', 'kind', 'small', 'shop', 'selling', 'sugar', 'spice', 'hotel', 'know', 'green', 'mountain', 'drive', 'away', 'main', 'drag', 'pretty', 'nice', 'place', 'rooms', 'nice', 'spacious', 'well', 'clean', 'staff', 'friendly', 'happy', 'breakfast', 'morning', 'pools', 'hot', 'tub', 'nice', 'well', 'maintained', 'well', 'given', 'big', 'tourist', 'area', 'hotel', 'packed', 'still', 'pleasant', 'really', 'thought', 'many', 'times', 'drove', 'nice', 'updated', 'back', 'soon', 'priced', 'right', 'staff', 'helped', 'needed', 'right', 'strip', 'second', 'time', 'angels', 'inn', 'times', 'wonderful', 'good', 'price', 'comfortable', 'clean', 'room', 'safe', 'large', 'great', 'morning', 'breakfast', 'staff', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'boot', 'visiting', 'favorite', 'convenient', 'location', 'nice', 'hotel', 'perfect', 'mother', 'daughter', 'trip', 'situated', 'really', 'well', 'shopping', 'eating', 'really', 'appreciated', 'included', 'breakfast', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'pool', 'hot', 'tub']",[],[],[],[],"[('hotel', 7), ('nice', 7), ('breakfast', 6), ('right', 5), ('really', 4), ('staff', 4), ('great', 4), ('room', 4), ('well', 4), ('tub', 3), ('priced', 3), ('hot', 3), ('clean', 3), ('bring', 2), ('rooms', 2), ('location', 2), ('main', 2), ('morning', 2), ('large', 2), ('small', 2), ('back', 2), ('never', 2), ('times', 2), ('extra', 2), ('strip', 2), ('pool', 2), ('spacious', 2), ('comfortable', 2), ('inn', 2), ('buildings', 2), ('price', 2), ('time', 2), ('shop', 1), ('saying', 1), ('outdoor', 1), ('soon', 1), ('still', 1), ('enjoyed', 1), ('seemed', 1), ('perfect', 1), ('visiting', 1), ('sugar', 1), ('pretty', 1), ('worth', 1), ('surprised', 1), ('updated', 1), ('someone', 1), ('return', 1), ('tourist', 1), ('ample', 1), ('big', 1), ('safe', 1), ('overall', 1), ('know', 1), ('bit', 1), ('cool', 1), ('like', 1), ('ever', 1), ('reasonably', 1), ('twice', 1), ('good', 1), ('rung', 1), ('guy', 1), ('fixed', 1), ('husband', 1), ('ten', 1), ('second', 1), ('uncomfortable', 1), ('eating', 1), ('mother', 1), ('packed', 1), ('payed', 1), ('confirm', 1), ('literally', 1), ('away', 1), ('microwave', 1), ('asking', 1), ('issue', 1), ('run', 1), ('spot', 1), ('nonexistent', 1), ('pleasant', 1), ('pools', 1), ('card', 1), ('daughter', 1), ('many', 1), ('favorite', 1), ('drag', 1), ('experience', 1), ('situated', 1), ('place', 1), ('road', 1), ('genuinely', 1), ('liked', 1), ('walk', 1), ('maintained', 1), ('drove', 1), ('given', 1), ('area', 1), ('slept', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/seven-gables-inn-branson,Seven Gables Inn,4.5,$,7,"Recently stayed a second time at SGI and will definitely stay there again. Love the location on 165 just south of 76. It's quiet but still close to everything. Fridge and microwave in the room, strong wifi, plus daily breakfast included. Clean, comfortable and well-priced. Owner Grace is a sweetheart - always helpful and always smiling.We love staying here!  This is our third year to stay at Seven Gables Inn and we'll be back again.  Grace makes the breakfast every morning and it is wonderful.  Of course there is also cereal, fruit, etc. for those that want something else.  The rooms are clean and very reasonably priced.  It's right off the main strip and is very quiet.  The mattresses are pillow top so you get a good nights rest.  Grace is the sweetest lady and will bend over backwards to accommodate her customers.Nice location off the main strip so not as much traffic and noise.  Very clean, friendly employees.  In room refrigerator and microwave. Best of all, the beds were perfect!Oh, my. We were bamboozled by Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews and made reservations here by phone. They have a 24-hr cancellation policy. When we arrived, we asked to see the room first. Yikes! It reeked of air freshened, the carpet had dirty spots and the room was very outdated. Guess I've been spoiled by the large hotel chains, but this hotel has been extremely overrated in my opinion. It was too late to cancel, but we decided to go to another hotel anyway.this motel is wonderful, great pillow top mattresses, very clean, free wifi, flat screen tv's,  a fantastic continental breakfast. and a great location. they make you feel welcome from the time you check in, they treat you like family. I will definetly use this motel  again and again.Stayed here while passing through Branson. Very nice management/staff! Better continental breakfast than I've had at other places while traveling. We had biscuits and gravy, and egg, potato, onion, pepper omelette. Clean rooms, nice facilities.Grace and her family will treat you like one of them. Breakfast is head and shoulders above what the chains offer. The facilities are not brand new but it isn't' shopworn either. It is clean, comfortable and the price is right. In a very tough business these are honest, hard working people doing the right thing in the right place at the right time.

Coffee was brutal but the waitress was very friendly. The food was okay for breakfast. Not sure how it is the rest of the time.Probably the worst meal we had this trip. Empty buffet at 6pm, we had the fish plate. No taste. Overcooked. Nothing to write home about. Waitress was friendly but never came back to refill our water.Bad food, bad coffee, ""spartan"" accruetaments.Staff were not mean, but not overly friendly.Other than that, though...  lolI can't really give a review because my family and I left before we were even served. Why is this place still open?! The place is filthy, and we were seated under moldy ceiling tiles. Not to mention, the bathroom was sickening and they have random office supplies stored out in the open. Save yourself time and go somewhere else.It is very difficult to understand how the Baldknobbers have such a great show and a terrible restaurant.  We have been coming to Branson for the past five years and this was the worst dining experience we have had.  The place is filthy and the quality of the food is poor.  My wife and I couldn't wait to get out of there.Can i give less that 1 star ???? We landed here past dinner time but they still offered us the menu...first of all the choice is less...i ordered the chicken noodle soup and my husband a hamburger.....both the items were bad !!!!! please dont go here....my soup looked like some kind of mushy paste....had no taste....hamburger was cold and tasted bad too...the only good thing though was that they were having an icreacream social so we had some icecream and that was good...that was the only item that saved the day !This place was not what we were expecting on our vacation.

Its interesting that the only reviews that are not 5 stars are ones that complained about things not really related to the hotel itself but rather to other guests making noise or that there is not a bar within walking distance (that was a PLUS for us!)Anyways... the hotel is stellar. Its the BEST of the BEST as far as Comfort Inn &amp; Suites go. NONE better. They really pride themselves in having an award winning hotel. Employees care and you can really tell. Super clean with great amenities. Big Gift Shop, Breakfast area (which was really good), Heated Swimming Pool, Game room with Pool Table and some video type games. The room we had was a suite with a 2 person jacuzzi. Everything in the room was BIG and COMFORTABLE. I travel a lot and for the price of this room it was the bargain of bargains! You get a LOT for your money at this hotel. I have stayed at hotels that cost almost double and didn't get as nice a room.I HIGHLY recommend you stay at this place and oh... by the way its the Comfort Inn on Gretna Road I am reviewing. I think they have other hotels in Branson but this is the one we stayed at.Hotel remind me a lot of a Griswold's Christmas! Rooms were older but bathroom was newer and very clean.  Bed was nice plus it's a kid and pet friendly hotel!When you go to a resort town, you don't know what you'll get at your hotel. This hotel advertises that they are award winning and after staying there, I know why they win awards.This place is top notch clean and well managed. We often saw the manager wandering about checking on the condition and service of the facility. All the employees were well trained and were genuinely interested in helping you to have a good experience. The breakfast area was spotless.The hotel is a little distant from the local activities, but in Branson, you need a car to do anything so it was not a problem. We wish all Comfort Inns operated at this level.Very nice hotel but could not sleep because people were very LOUD!!!  It was 1 am and the party was still going.  Maybe 3 hours of sleep:(We have stayed here for years.  Hotel is well maintained and usually wins the Platinum Hospitality Award from Choice Hotels.Yes this hotel is new....yes the walls are sound proof. The room was spacious actually it was way too big!The Jacuzzi tub was really nice. I really don't have any complaints about the room. The bed was comfortable. The room was reasonably priced.super nice comfort inn hotel.it has to be new...bed was comfy, room was clean.breakfast was dope.-1 only because location is so-so. neighboorhood is nice, but there are not restaurants/bars within walking distance, and there is no shuttle to get you anywhere.",,,,,"['super', 'place', 'interesting', 'reviews', 'stars', 'ones', 'complained', 'things', 'really', 'related', 'hotel', 'rather', 'guests', 'making', 'noise', 'bar', 'within', 'walking', 'distance', 'plus', 'anyways', 'hotel', 'stellar', 'best', 'best', 'far', 'comfort', 'inn', 'amp', 'suites', 'none', 'better', 'really', 'pride', 'award', 'winning', 'hotel', 'employees', 'care', 'really', 'tell', 'super', 'clean', 'great', 'amenities', 'big', 'gift', 'shop', 'breakfast', 'area', 'really', 'good', 'heated', 'swimming', 'pool', 'game', 'room', 'pool', 'table', 'video', 'type', 'games', 'room', 'suite', 'person', 'jacuzzi', 'everything', 'room', 'big', 'comfortable', 'travel', 'lot', 'price', 'room', 'bargain', 'bargains', 'lot', 'money', 'hotel', 'hotels', 'cost', 'almost', 'double', 'nice', 'room', 'highly', 'recommend', 'place', 'way', 'comfort', 'inn', 'road', 'reviewing', 'think', 'hotels', 'hotel', 'remind', 'lot', 'rooms', 'older', 'bathroom', 'newer', 'clean', 'bed', 'nice', 'plus', 'kid', 'pet', 'friendly', 'hotel', 'resort', 'town', 'know', 'hotel', 'hotel', 'advertises', 'award', 'winning', 'staying', 'know', 'win', 'awards', 'place', 'top', 'notch', 'clean', 'well', 'managed', 'often', 'saw', 'manager', 'wandering', 'checking', 'condition', 'service', 'facility', 'employees', 'well', 'trained', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'helping', 'good', 'experience', 'breakfast', 'area', 'spotless', 'hotel', 'little', 'distant', 'local', 'activities', 'need', 'car', 'anything', 'problem', 'wish', 'comfort', 'inns', 'operated', 'level', 'nice', 'hotel', 'sleep', 'people', 'loud', 'party', 'still', 'going', 'maybe', 'hours', 'sleep', 'years', 'hotel', 'well', 'maintained', 'usually', 'wins', 'platinum', 'hospitality', 'award', 'choice', 'hotels', 'yes', 'hotel', 'new', 'yes', 'walls', 'sound', 'proof', 'room', 'spacious', 'actually', 'way', 'big', 'jacuzzi', 'tub', 'really', 'nice', 'really', 'complaints', 'room', 'bed', 'comfortable', 'room', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'super', 'nice', 'comfort', 'inn', 'hotel', 'new', 'bed', 'comfy', 'room', 'clean', 'breakfast', 'dope', 'location', 'nice', 'restaurants', 'bars', 'within', 'walking', 'distance', 'shuttle', 'anywhere']",[],[],[],[],"[('hotel', 13), ('room', 9), ('really', 6), ('nice', 6), ('comfort', 4), ('clean', 4), ('big', 3), ('super', 3), ('place', 3), ('hotels', 3), ('award', 3), ('bed', 3), ('inn', 3), ('breakfast', 3), ('lot', 3), ('well', 3), ('walking', 2), ('jacuzzi', 2), ('yes', 2), ('winning', 2), ('good', 2), ('know', 2), ('sleep', 2), ('best', 2), ('new', 2), ('employees', 2), ('within', 2), ('area', 2), ('way', 2), ('distance', 2), ('comfortable', 2), ('plus', 2), ('pool', 2), ('shop', 1), ('advertises', 1), ('managed', 1), ('money', 1), ('years', 1), ('manager', 1), ('distant', 1), ('rooms', 1), ('still', 1), ('interesting', 1), ('better', 1), ('resort', 1), ('going', 1), ('spacious', 1), ('suite', 1), ('pride', 1), ('local', 1), ('friendly', 1), ('activities', 1), ('far', 1), ('dope', 1), ('choice', 1), ('game', 1), ('ones', 1), ('party', 1), ('amp', 1), ('condition', 1), ('bar', 1), ('gift', 1), ('level', 1), ('reasonably', 1), ('remind', 1), ('spotless', 1), ('car', 1), ('restaurants', 1), ('bars', 1), ('inns', 1), ('often', 1), ('people', 1), ('related', 1), ('cost', 1), ('video', 1), ('anyways', 1), ('operated', 1), ('pet', 1), ('everything', 1), ('noise', 1), ('bargains', 1), ('little', 1), ('stellar', 1), ('awards', 1), ('tub', 1), ('care', 1), ('hours', 1), ('great', 1), ('anything', 1), ('experience', 1), ('usually', 1), ('hospitality', 1), ('loud', 1), ('think', 1), ('road', 1), ('swimming', 1), ('facility', 1), ('win', 1), ('highly', 1), ('maintained', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-view-inn-and-suites-branson,Grand View Inn & Suites,4.0,$,6,"Hey I am a complete fan of this hotel!  They aren't kidding when they say it is near Tanger outlet!  I could walk there!!  The rooms were clean with all the bells and whistles.....microwave, refrigerator, and the biggest flat screen tv I have seen in any hotel costing under $150 a night.  The staff was warm and friendly and very helpful.  The breakfast was a typical hotel breakfast with the usual choices.  I will be returning for the holiday shopping season.  True the pool is a dipping pool and not a diving pool but usually most people just want to get wet and a lot of people don't want to risk getting their hair wet ( I am thinking of most of Branson's older set)  The pool did have a handicapped hoist to lower anyone who requires a wheelchair down into the pool.  I have only seen this at the Oasis in Springfield.....which is considerably more expensive.  Good for you Grand View!I highly recommend this hotel. Great price for what you walk into. I'm kind of a freak about hotels, they gross me out.  This one was super clean and really cute. The lobby is adorable and the rooms are all updated, don't have a funky smell, and the beds were comfy and clean.  Staff was amazing.  The woman that helped me at the front desk was more than accommodating.  The only reason I gave 4 stars was the breakfast.  There's options but it wasn't good.  The waffles were super soggy, ect.  But the stay itself makes up for it. Also, a minute from outlet mall, which is cool.Nice hotel for the price, front desk was welcoming, rooms are clean, and appear to be recently updated. Rooms are fairly well sound insulated, and they offer free Internet and wifi. Complimentary breakfast (busicuits and gravy, muffins, toast, eggs, sausage, pancakes, waffles, cereal, juices and coffee), in a nice breakfast room. My only complaint is that at six foot tall, I was doing all sorts of yoga positions to get my head wet in the shower! Not for taller folks! But not any worse than most other older hotels!Its located by the outlet which would be walking distance from the hotel. You feel at home right when you walk in to the lobby! Super nice. love the style of the whole hotel! now for the negs..... our bed was very hard.... and my parents had said the same, The breakfast was ok boiled eggs donuts biscuit &amp; sausage gravy cereal mixed fruit etc. now the pool is a fail lol its only 3ft deep but was nice to sit at lol. they have ever so friendly staff! if you go to branson mo.with kids or not ride the ducks!Good economy hotel. Location was good. It is practically an extension of the outlet mall. In the middle -ish area of the strip. Beds were firm but not unbearable.  Bring your own pillow. the pillows were large and firm also. Outside noise wasn't an issue but the doors inside are sooo thin and most doors have cracks as the doors aren't square on the henge. So you can hear everything in the halls and in the rooms. The water pressure in the shower isn't great but that's not uncommon for this area or hotels in general. Lastly the free breakfast is pretty good. Everything was edible, but definitely nothing fancy. They had eggs, sausage, biscuits with gravy, pancakes, doughnuts, muffins, yogurt, cereal, milk, coffee and juice. It definitely adds some value to the price per night. The only major thing I have negative to say is the guest service agent did announce my room number to me and my friend when we were checking in. There were other guests in the lobby. Definitely not acceptable and is hotel 101 not to do so. End of the day good weekend hotel for a cheap visit.Room was pretty basic but super clean. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and breakfast was a nice selection of eggs, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy along with some fruit and breads.",,,,,"['hey', 'complete', 'fan', 'hotel', 'kidding', 'say', 'near', 'outlet', 'walk', 'rooms', 'clean', 'bells', 'whistles', 'microwave', 'refrigerator', 'biggest', 'flat', 'screen', 'seen', 'hotel', 'costing', '150', 'night', 'staff', 'warm', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'breakfast', 'typical', 'hotel', 'breakfast', 'usual', 'choices', 'returning', 'holiday', 'shopping', 'season', 'true', 'pool', 'dipping', 'pool', 'diving', 'pool', 'usually', 'people', 'wet', 'lot', 'people', 'risk', 'getting', 'hair', 'wet', 'thinking', 'older', 'set', 'pool', 'handicapped', 'hoist', 'lower', 'anyone', 'requires', 'wheelchair', 'pool', 'seen', 'oasis', 'considerably', 'expensive', 'good', 'grand', 'view', 'highly', 'recommend', 'hotel', 'great', 'price', 'walk', 'kind', 'freak', 'hotels', 'gross', 'super', 'clean', 'really', 'cute', 'lobby', 'adorable', 'rooms', 'updated', 'funky', 'smell', 'beds', 'comfy', 'clean', 'staff', 'amazing', 'woman', 'helped', 'front', 'desk', 'accommodating', 'reason', 'gave', 'stars', 'breakfast', 'options', 'good', 'waffles', 'super', 'soggy', 'makes', 'also', 'minute', 'outlet', 'mall', 'cool', 'nice', 'hotel', 'price', 'front', 'desk', 'welcoming', 'rooms', 'clean', 'appear', 'recently', 'updated', 'rooms', 'fairly', 'well', 'sound', 'insulated', 'offer', 'free', 'complimentary', 'breakfast', 'gravy', 'muffins', 'toast', 'eggs', 'sausage', 'pancakes', 'waffles', 'cereal', 'juices', 'coffee', 'nice', 'breakfast', 'room', 'complaint', 'six', 'foot', 'tall', 'sorts', 'yoga', 'positions', 'head', 'wet', 'shower', 'taller', 'folks', 'worse', 'older', 'hotels', 'located', 'outlet', 'walking', 'distance', 'hotel', 'feel', 'home', 'right', 'walk', 'lobby', 'super', 'nice', 'love', 'style', 'whole', 'hotel', 'negs', 'bed', 'hard', 'parents', 'said', 'breakfast', 'boiled', 'eggs', 'donuts', 'biscuit', 'amp', 'sausage', 'gravy', 'cereal', 'mixed', 'fruit', 'etc', 'pool', 'fail', 'deep', 'nice', 'sit', 'ever', 'friendly', 'staff', 'kids', 'ride', 'ducks', 'good', 'economy', 'hotel', 'location', 'good', 'practically', 'extension', 'outlet', 'mall', 'middle', 'area', 'strip', 'beds', 'firm', 'unbearable', 'bring', 'pillow', 'pillows', 'large', 'firm', 'also', 'outside', 'noise', 'issue', 'doors', 'inside', 'thin', 'doors', 'cracks', 'doors', 'square', 'henge', 'hear', 'everything', 'halls', 'rooms', 'water', 'pressure', 'shower', 'great', 'uncommon', 'area', 'hotels', 'general', 'lastly', 'free', 'breakfast', 'pretty', 'good', 'everything', 'edible', 'definitely', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'eggs', 'sausage', 'biscuits', 'gravy', 'pancakes', 'muffins', 'yogurt', 'cereal', 'milk', 'coffee', 'juice', 'definitely', 'adds', 'value', 'price', 'per', 'night', 'major', 'thing', 'negative', 'say', 'guest', 'service', 'agent', 'announce', 'room', 'number', 'friend', 'checking', 'guests', 'lobby', 'definitely', 'acceptable', 'hotel', '101', 'end', 'day', 'good', 'weekend', 'hotel', 'cheap', 'visit', 'room', 'pretty', 'basic', 'super', 'clean', 'staff', 'front', 'desk', 'extremely', 'friendly', 'breakfast', 'nice', 'selection', 'eggs', 'pancakes', 'biscuits', 'gravy', 'along', 'fruit', 'breads']",[],[],[],[],"[('hotel', 10), ('breakfast', 8), ('good', 6), ('pool', 6), ('rooms', 5), ('nice', 5), ('clean', 5), ('staff', 4), ('outlet', 4), ('gravy', 4), ('eggs', 4), ('super', 4), ('wet', 3), ('friendly', 3), ('desk', 3), ('front', 3), ('sausage', 3), ('pancakes', 3), ('walk', 3), ('hotels', 3), ('cereal', 3), ('room', 3), ('doors', 3), ('price', 3), ('lobby', 3), ('definitely', 3), ('pretty', 2), ('updated', 2), ('night', 2), ('biscuits', 2), ('shower', 2), ('people', 2), ('mall', 2), ('everything', 2), ('free', 2), ('great', 2), ('fruit', 2), ('area', 2), ('firm', 2), ('coffee', 2), ('say', 2), ('muffins', 2), ('seen', 2), ('waffles', 2), ('also', 2), ('older', 2), ('beds', 2), ('cute', 1), ('taller', 1), ('selection', 1), ('soggy', 1), ('per', 1), ('negs', 1), ('cheap', 1), ('walking', 1), ('foot', 1), ('ever', 1), ('milk', 1), ('costing', 1), ('toast', 1), ('style', 1), ('located', 1), ('thinking', 1), ('parents', 1), ('location', 1), ('folks', 1), ('announce', 1), ('holiday', 1), ('gave', 1), ('woman', 1), ('risk', 1), ('returning', 1), ('checking', 1), ('fan', 1), ('amp', 1), ('highly', 1), ('day', 1), ('minute', 1), ('cool', 1), ('helpful', 1), ('bring', 1), ('positions', 1), ('edible', 1), ('dipping', 1), ('large', 1), ('extremely', 1), ('inside', 1), ('view', 1), ('set', 1), ('hard', 1), ('hair', 1), ('value', 1), ('fail', 1), ('diving', 1), ('pillows', 1), ('thing', 1), ('really', 1), ('gross', 1), ('said', 1), ('adds', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-country-inn-branson-3,Grand Country Inn,4.0,$$,7,"Only reason this place is getting a four and not a five is because the indoor water park had way to much chlorine.  So much it burned my eyes.  Everything else was great.  Are room had a king size bed with bunk beds for the kids inside a little club house.  It was pretty cool.  The room was really clean and the water out of the shower could probably pill the paint off your car. A lot of pressure coming out of the shower head. Went to two shows at the hotels show room.  Saw a comedy show and amazing pets show.  Both were really great and interactive for the kids.  We had lunch at the pizza buffet.  It was pretty good.  Reminds me of cc pizza. They have a game room that's a mini version of Dave and Busters.  Two indoor mini golf courses.  Ones under black light and they have two mini golf courses outside. This places has everything on the lot of the hotel.  We had a great time and will be back for sure.This place is in no way whatsoever a ""resort"". It is a SKETCHY MOTEL with what appears to be laden with habitual drug addicts. The games in the arcade area are $2 each play, the kids had more fun just playing games on their phones. I would in no way recommend this place unless you are specifically looking to relive a National Lampoons movie personally.441$ for friday to Monday got us a room with a king bed and a bunk bed. The bunk bed had a club house built around it with a tv in the clubhouse. Kept the kids busy during down times. We also had access to the water park. Kids gave the Waterpark high marks but there were a tons of people and no tables. Yiu had to wait to find a <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchair.to&amp;s=aec16baace090ebc3bf397acbb2eca174ee1db4a641ba4a6ebf7ce087346307f"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">chair.to</a> put your things. There was no pool just a short lazy river and a fun fort to climb on. 2 hot tubs and a basketball area.  Public pools gross me out but this one was ok. Kids had a lot of fun running around and working all the gadgets. The room was small, batroom outdated but acceptable.  Ac unit was noisy.  It's basicly a standard room.  The fun center has games which award tickets and the staff does a good job keeping things rolling. The kids loved the party at 10 pm. 2 shows were included in the package. We saw the amazing pet show. Kids loved it. Breakfast buffet was expensive and not very good.If yiu have kids and can get a deal this is an ok place but watch the cost. It can get expensive quick. Ps - the staff here works very hard to help in any way. That goes far in my book.  Don't forget to pre purchase go kart passes for the track. Much cheaper that way.We are here for July 4, 2015 this is the ideal place for kids. Everything is here no need to leave. Very happy will be bring grandkids back again. Clean rooms and all workers very nice.Great price AAA discount and includes water park. You have to pay for the buffet but well worth it. Rooms are nice but paper thin walls. Was awakened five times during the night by a crying baby in the next room. Must have been a newborn-he was not happy!Tour bus destination. Be prepared for that.Ate there twice for breakfast the same lady waited on us both time forget her  name a young Mexican lady her service was awesome kept our glasses full and stocked with plates this lady deserves a raiseWe are probably one of the noisy families most complain about, but having a 2 and a 3 year old makes that a little more difficult to be so very quiet. Regardless, my boys and I really enjoyed our time together. plus they slept in because there was so much to do and it totally wore them out! So fun and a great experience for our first road trip with my kids :) they absolutely loved the fun clubhouse in the room with bunk beds and a tv just for them!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/branson-towers-hotel-branson-2,Branson Towers Hotel,3.0,$$,5,"We enjoyed the nostalgic feel. Late night ice cream was cool. Only complaint was the noise by the pool way past 9pm. If this is a problem don't get a room near the pool. Other than that it was a great valueThe hotel is glance from outside. The room is absolutely smelly. We had to changed our room. The second one was better. Very pour service at the front desk. There are lots of better hotel in same price range in Branson. Don't waist your money.Not a very good hotel at all. This was defiantly not our first choice. We were forced to stay here for a meeting in the conference room. There was a stain on the carpet that looked like blood to me. The tv's were terrible. The bathroom was old and the room was dated and old. The new beds were nice though. Laundry room is junk. The carpet throughout the whole building is trashed. The pool was in very bad shape when we came. Very dirty. The only thing I liked was the kitchen/breakfast area. It was also in a good location. Defiantly staying somewhere else next time. Overall bad hotel to stay at.Really one of the loveliest places you'd never expect to find! There were two things about this place bugged me: the elevators smell funky &amp; the rooms smell musty. However, all we had to do was turn on the air in the room for an hour or so when we first got there &amp; we were good to go. The rooms and bathrooms and the whole place in general is very clean, the lobby is adorable, and although it's easy to find off the strip, it's still out of the way of the majority of the shows' traffic. The best part of this little place is, at night, there is a little older man that plays gorgeous songs on the piano and there is an ice cream sundae bar. It is just so pleasant. All the guests come down and visit and hang out. The place is older and has a certain look to it, but it really is just adorable. Everything is comfortable, clean, and the prices are great! I highly suggest Branson Towers.At check in, I found the hotel lobby to be very beautiful and luxurious.  However the person working at the reception desk could not answer any basic questions about Branson.The decor of the hotel appears to be strongly rooted in the early 90s and could use a facelift.  Many spots on the carpet have blood stains, including in the room we stayed at.  The pool area is on the small sided and was too crowded to be enjoyed by our family.Our room was lacking the basic toiletry items you would expect to find, although the room had an incredible mini fridge.  The mini fridge was spacious and kept our drinks amazingly cold.  The TV should be upgraded into the 21st century.The bathroom door lock did not work...unless you were on the inside trying to get out.  Warning to all single travelers...do not close the door when you use the bathroom because there will be nobody else I. The room to let you out.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-lane-resort-and-marina-branson,Rock Lane Resort and Marina,3.5,$$,5,"This place is Beautiful! The view of Table Rock Lake is amazing!! The staff are so friendly and helpful. I was blown away with their genuine kindness. The resort has its own Marina and offers a variety of water activities. The rooms are very nice and spacious. Love the Jacuzzi tub ;) Everyone seemed to really be enjoying themselves. This is a great place to bring your family.For the last three years we have been renting a slip at the marina and my family love it. Between the tiki bar using the pool and the other amenities I would not change marinas for anything.I'm not sure how many stars to give to Rock Lane Marina. Friday June 5th we stopped at the marina to inquire about a new tube.  They said a new tube would be $229 but we could buy a slightly used tube for $150.  We thought that was a good deal so we bought a slightly used one. This was about 8pm Friday night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. That night we deflated the tube and stored it in our covered boat.  On Saturday we arrived at the lake at around 2:00 pm. It was cloudy and stormy. We inflated the tube and went out on the water. We used the tube for a couple of hours. We noticed it getting low on air so we headed to Rock Lane Marina. We bought  $118 work of gas and had the staff fill up our tube. When we got back out on the water we noticed a huge bubble on the top and bottom of the tube. The marina was closed so we took it back the next day and they refused to swap it out. They said it was our fault for leaving it out in the sun too long. They would not give us a refund. They said we could buy a new inner tube for $85.  I feel very much that we were taken advantage of. The place is beautiful and restaurant was yummy. I just don't think I could go back to a place that stole my money.Tiki Bar: not good. Hot wings came without any sauce. Chicken sandwich was horrible and service was worst we've had in years making for an unpleasant fathers day.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-plaza-hotel-branson,Grand Plaza Hotel,4.0,$$,9,"Very accommodating and cordial staff.  Room and view was nice.  Did not have to spend big to feel like a VIP here.  Will come back again.Over all great hotel, but needs a little improvement. The room was very clean, very nice. This place offers a over standard breakfast. The housekeeping staff was nice but had to be asked to clean the room.Another down fall, was walking around the outside of the pool barefoot, and stepped on a deck screw. I needed medical attention and was not offered any. The front desk staff didn't seem to care.The Grand Plaza Hotel was a great choice! From my research in the Branson area, this was definitely one of the 'nicer' hotels to stay in (i.e. updated rooms &amp; decor). Branson is such an old town that it was surprisingly hard to find updated hotel for a reasonable price. The front desk staff was awesome ... they upgraded us for free to a King Jacuzzi suite without even asking simply because they extra availability! That RARELY happens to anyone, especially without asking or implying that it's some anniversary/special occasion. The room was great ... the Jacuzzi tub was by far the biggest one I've seen in a hotel room before! Price was extremely reasonable for the area, especially considering its location. The hotel offered free hot breakfast (the eggs are powdered, however. YUCK) with some delicious MTO waffles. It also has an indoor pool and a hot tub! The hotel is located right in the prime area of 'The Strip' ... you could walk to some shows and restaurants if you wanted. It's also one block away from the Premium Outlets Mall. Overall, I'd recommend and would probably stay again if in the area!Very nice hotel great value for the money. Is very nice spacious and comfortable. We ended up with a great view overlooking the valley. From our 7th floor. Would highly recommend this hotel for other visitors to Branson Missouri.Decent hotel. Nothing fancy, but good for the money. They have a free hot breakfast every morning, which is a nice added bonus.Everything is great BUT don't eat at their restaurant not only are the prices high but I get better food out of a gas station. If you do decide to go and waste your money don't get the buffalo chicken wrap, the roast beef swiss and mushroom sandwich, or the burgers. We got ranch as dipping sauce and it tasted sour/spoiled. We all got this and it was TERRIBLE. The waitress seemed to not even care that we were displeased. Our bill for 3 people was $36 and I would have rather went to McDonalds which says a lot since I hate that place. We all left still hungry and completely dissatisfied. Luckily the hot breakfast in the morning was actually good for being what it was. I do like the hotel don't get me wrong just don't waste your money on its restaurant.Pros: jacuzzi tub in my room, nice size pool downstairs (and hot tub) open until midnight, 24 hour fitness center that isn't large but does have a couple treadmills, continental breakfast, great location very close to the strip, and close to the Tanger outlet mall, free cable and internet.Cons: wifi wasn't very reliable in evening hours, awkward parking (majority of parking on a hill, so if there is a chance of snow this could be dangerous!).We got the King Jacuzzi room (8th floor) through a Groupon deal, and were very pleased with both the hotel and the price of the hotel. They have a concierge service by the front desk, and also have a menu that you can order from, from the restaurant that is in the hotel.Also will add that Elaine checked us in - took about 30 seconds - and she gave us all the little information you need (where is the elevator, how to use the card key, check in/check out info, hours of everything like breakfast and pool, and directions directly to our room), and gave us a map as well. Always a plus for friendly customer service. Go Elaine!Loved the Hotel and service!! We checked in very late,but I called ahead of time to inform the hotel and it was no problem at all. Arrived about 3:00am we were so tired from a 10 hour drive. When we walked in we were immediately greeted with our names and quickly checked in. Made us feel like VIPGreat Breakfast buffet had a huge selection to choose from and the views from this hotel were gorgeous.Hotel was nice and clean.   Its on a hill so parking in a good spot so you don't have to trek uphill is a consideration.  The lobby is clean and nice but not grand; it is a bit dated but not too old.   The pool is nice but not heated even though it's indoors.   There is a fitness center with 3x treadmills.  There is a game room with 5 older video arcade games.  They are $.50 per play and one ripped off my daughter.   The breakfast buffet was good with self-service Belgian waffle station, scrambled eggs, biscuits, white gravy and sausage links.   The usual contintental fare was provided beyond that.  The wait staff was friendly and considerate.   Our room was the family suite which was basically two rooms linked by a door.  The master had a jacuzzi rub.  Both rooms had their own 32"" TV and a king sized bed.  The beds were well appointed with plenty of pillows but were too hard for my taste.  The suite had a microwave and a refrigerator.  There were two air cond units that worked very well.  The dispensers in the shower were out of soap and conditioner.   Overall room quality was good and the value was high.  This was an off season stay so the halls were expectedly quiet which was nice.   Views from the rooms were above average given the location.  This hotel is very close to Tanger Outlets and convenient to other attractions but also nestled just off the strip so it is quiet.   I would stay here again.",,,,,"['accommodating', 'cordial', 'staff', 'room', 'view', 'nice', 'spend', 'big', 'feel', 'like', 'come', 'back', 'great', 'hotel', 'needs', 'little', 'improvement', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/palace-view-by-spinnaker-branson,Palace View by Spinnaker,4.0,$$,8,"The room we got is great but the people above us you can hear them walk and they must have liked to walk all day because we heard it all day. Overall we had a great week for labor day week. They didn't bother me trying to buy a RCI time share. I would come again but would request the top floor.Negative: we stayed on the 3rd floor in building 6. We could hear every move the people above us made. Very thin walls and creeky floors. We could not sleep on our schedule because we were woken up by the sounds from above and couldn't fall asleep until they stopped moving around. Very irritating. The couch in A was not very comfy. The room could use some updating. Positives: kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. The layout was very large. The jacuzzi was nice.Much nicer than I expected. Self-catering condo units with all the amenities and very clean. Lots of swimming pools. Super nice staff. Military-friendly. A very pleasant surprise. Get your groceries at the Price Chopper and you are set.This company cold calls you &amp; tells you you won a vacation. In reality, though, you haven't won anything but a huge pain in the butt. It also costs you just $99 to get your ""free vacation"", but wait! If you'd like to upgrade to a one bedroom condo, it'll be just a few dollars more. Etc etc. I paid $189.99 for a one bedroom 4 day/3 night stay with the caveat that my husband and I would have to attend a 90 minute seminar on timeshare ownership. Ok. I went with it because, hey that's not a bad deal on 3 nights for a one bedroom. We arrived to find our room not ready until after the final time given of 4 pm. We checked in at 10 am &amp; were assured it would be probably an hour or so. 6 long hours later, we get our room. A tiny ""studio"" with one queen bed. Lumpy mattress. Outdated furnishings all squished together in about 300 sq ft. The dining table is generously named as its cut in half &amp; shoved against the wall just to make enough room to walk into the space. NOT what I paid for. Called the front desk. Got hung up on 3 times. They were unable to get us anything else as the resort was full. I checked online &amp; there were one bedrooms available. Liars! All around lied so far. Ugh. We still have the hard sell to attend. Which they scheduled for 12:00 pm, so your day is effectively ruined. You cannot do much beforehand or after. I heard their 90 min tour can take up to 3 1/2 hours. If you don't attend, they charge you $300. Plus one nights rental. Even though you've paid for the rental. It's all a big scam &amp; if we weren't subject to lose $300+ we would skip the presentation. We already moved out of the room &amp; into a nice motel that is cleaner, friendlier, has more amenities &amp; free hot breakfast. We will technically ""check out"" of that hellhole room in 3 days, but we aren't going to be miserable &amp; actually stay there.Make sure you stay in building 9 which has a wooded view.  The other building have views of parking lots and other buildings.  Stay away from the time share presentations.  If you go...check for audio taping without your permission.  We had this happen to us in Hilton Head, SC by using his iphone.  Please google Spinnaker cola into in regards to timeshares,,then decide if you want to purchase with them.Staff did a great job accommodating my daughter's wedding party by combining my two timeshare reservations into one two bedroom suite.  It's clean and well equipped. Even though there a 1000 things to do in Branson, the resort runs cheap/free activities throughout the day.I'm not a country/western/retiree kind of guy so most of the shows aren't appealing, but there's other activities for the younger set if you look around.  Embrace the tackiness and look for the good time to be found.Stayed here for a week as guests using up friend's time share time. Nice and clean and friendly. TV's could be bigger and not very strong water pressure in shower but not a huge issue. Of course they want you to sit through a time share seminar but you don't have to if you don't want to (though they will pay you). Can be a little hard to find.Very clean resort.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/victorian-inn-branson-2,Victorian Inn,2.0,$,4,"The staff was extremely nice, they were friendly and approachable. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived (4:00pm) but they worked to get us in as fast as they could. The hotel is located directly across the street from a huge water park and close to other Branson attractions. The hotel is older and can use some updates and remodeling. The bathroom was poorly lit and had wall paper patches that were torn. There was also some black spots around the tub. The TV was an old bubble screen. The bed comfort was ok, and the beds were well made. The room had a musty smell to it with a scent that someone had been smoking in it. The air condition worked well and kept the room cold. Rooms come with a small fridge and microwave as well. I didn't see any bugs during our stay. The free breakfast was good and had a lot of variety. All in all its your basic budget hotel that needs some remodeling as it is an older building with old furniture and decor.I helped book this hotel for a family member.  The first night's stay was fine.  Not great, but... well... it's a budget hotel... low expectations and all.The second night, she found a bed bug.  Knowing how pernicious bedbugs can be, she requested a refund.  For merely reporting it, the owner (at 2am) not only refused a refund and called the cops to report them as ""trespassing"".When contacted later to try to work out something reasonable (because, c'mon, you put some people on the street in an unfamiliar town for $50), he was hostile and irate.  While I could question his opinion that asking for a refund ""is extortion"", I don't think that's even necessary.  Whether he was right or wrong about the presence of bugs or his refund policy, the entire experience was a prime example of abysmal customer service.  If his position was to firmly refuse a refund, that's fine.  Such a position, however, does not require threats and name dropping of lawyers.  Definitely a class act, here.Perhaps the most surreal moment was, when confronted with actual evidence in the form of a captured bug, he confirmed that there were previously bedbugs, but they had somehow miraculously been eradicated.  Having known more than a few people who've had professional exterminations of these little guys... one application of anything rarely works.  They're widely regarded as one of the most difficult pests to get rid of.Pros:  InexpensiveCons:  Owner provides product that is a potential health hazard, refuses refunds, calls police, and reports guests as ""trespassing"" at the drop of the hat.There are better places to spend your money.(Also, if you didn't find this out until too late and you're about to leave a review yourself... the Missouri Department of Health can be reached to file a complaint at 573-751-6095.)The room was clean and the staff was friendly. With that said, the bed was not great, the bottom sheet was not fitted so it was always wrinkled and getting unmade. The air conditioner cover was off and the room had a slight order. The breakfast does say continental but don't expect juice. There is only coffee so if you have kids with you find a McDs.Granted, we were coming to branson mainly to do some shopping at the outlet malls because they were all having sales and we didn't want to spend alot of money on a hotel, but this was overpriced for what we got.  Room is small, peeling wallpaper, exposed wall sockets, a bathroom door that does not work, and wifi that asks for too much info to connect. Having said that, it has been recently bought by a new owner who said at check in that he is in the process of remodling the rooms, so maybe in a year or so, this will be better. Will I stay here again? Not in 2011 or 2012, )but maybe in 2013 (sooner if new owner has rooms remodled.",,,,,"['staff', 'extremely', 'nice', 'friendly', 'approachable', 'room', 'ready', 'arrived', 'worked', 'fast', 'hotel', 'located', 'directly', 'across', 'street', 'huge', 'water', 'park', 'close', 'attractions', 'hotel', 'older', 'use', 'updates', 'remodeling', 'bathroom', 'poorly', 'lit', 'wall', 'paper', 'patches', 'torn', 'also', 'black', 'spots', 'around', 'tub', 'old', 'bubble', 'screen', 'bed', 'comfort', 'beds', 'well', 'made', 'room', 'musty', 'smell', 'scent', 'someone', 'smoking', 'air', 'condition', 'worked', 'well', 'kept', 'room', 'cold', 'rooms', 'come', 'small', 'fridge', 'microwave', 'well', 'see', 'bugs', 'free', 'breakfast', 'good', 'lot', 'variety', 'basic', 'budget', 'hotel', 'needs', 'remodeling', 'older', 'building', 'old', 'furniture', 'decor', 'helped', 'book', 'hotel', 'family', 'member', 'first', 'night', 'fine', 'great', 'well', 'budget', 'hotel', 'low', 'expectations', 'second', 'night', 'found', 'bed', 'bug', 'knowing', 'pernicious', 'bedbugs', 'requested', 'refund', 'merely', 'reporting', 'owner', 'refused', 'refund', 'called', 'cops', 'report', 'trespassing', 'contacted', 'later', 'try', 'work', 'something', 'reasonable', 'put', 'people', 'street', 'unfamiliar', 'town', 'hostile', 'irate', 'question', 'opinion', 'asking', 'refund', 'extortion', 'think', 'necessary', 'whether', 'right', 'wrong', 'presence', 'bugs', 'refund', 'policy', 'entire', 'experience', 'prime', 'example', 'abysmal', 'customer', 'service', 'position', 'firmly', 'refuse', 'refund', 'fine', 'position', 'however', 'require', 'threats', 'name', 'dropping', 'lawyers', 'definitely', 'class', 'act', 'perhaps', 'surreal', 'moment', 'confronted', 'actual', 'evidence', 'form', 'captured', 'bug', 'confirmed', 'previously', 'bedbugs', 'somehow', 'miraculously', 'eradicated', 'known', 'people', 'professional', 'exterminations', 'little', 'guys', 'application', 'anything', 'rarely', 'works', 'widely', 'regarded', 'difficult', 'pests', 'rid', 'pros', 'owner', 'provides', 'product', 'potential', 'health', 'hazard', 'refuses', 'refunds', 'calls', 'police', 'reports', 'guests', 'trespassing', 'drop', 'hat', 'better', 'places', 'spend', 'money', 'also', 'find', 'late', 'leave', 'review', 'department', 'health', 'reached', 'file', 'complaint', '573', '751', '6095', 'room', 'clean', 'staff', 'friendly', 'said', 'bed', 'great', 'bottom', 'sheet', 'fitted', 'always', 'wrinkled', 'getting', 'unmade', 'air', 'conditioner', 'cover', 'room', 'slight', 'order', 'breakfast', 'say', 'continental', 'expect', 'juice', 'coffee', 'kids', 'find', 'granted', 'coming', 'mainly', 'shopping', 'outlet', 'malls', 'sales', 'spend', 'money', 'hotel', 'overpriced', 'room', 'small', 'peeling', 'wallpaper', 'exposed', 'wall', 'sockets', 'bathroom', 'door', 'work', 'asks', 'much', 'info', 'connect', 'said', 'recently', 'bought', 'new', 'owner', 'said', 'check', 'process', 'rooms', 'maybe', 'year', 'better', '2011', '2012', 'maybe', '2013', 'sooner', 'new', 'owner', 'rooms']",[],[],[],[],"[('hotel', 6), ('room', 6), ('refund', 5), ('owner', 4), ('well', 4), ('rooms', 3), ('said', 3), ('bed', 3), ('money', 2), ('fine', 2), ('find', 2), ('staff', 2), ('better', 2), ('friendly', 2), ('night', 2), ('small', 2), ('old', 2), ('people', 2), ('street', 2), ('health', 2), ('new', 2), ('remodeling', 2), ('bathroom', 2), ('bedbugs', 2), ('great', 2), ('wall', 2), ('worked', 2), ('bug', 2), ('work', 2), ('budget', 2), ('air', 2), ('breakfast', 2), ('also', 2), ('trespassing', 2), ('older', 2), ('maybe', 2), ('bugs', 2), ('position', 2), ('spend', 2), ('overpriced', 1), ('contacted', 1), ('eradicated', 1), ('connect', 1), ('paper', 1), ('cold', 1), ('captured', 1), ('member', 1), ('police', 1), ('patches', 1), ('pests', 1), ('located', 1), ('much', 1), ('regarded', 1), ('torn', 1), ('expectations', 1), ('confirmed', 1), ('previously', 1), ('potential', 1), ('black', 1), ('policy', 1), ('hat', 1), ('2013', 1), ('2012', 1), ('customer', 1), ('complaint', 1), ('someone', 1), ('around', 1), ('mainly', 1), ('fridge', 1), ('unfamiliar', 1), ('updates', 1), ('report', 1), ('little', 1), ('6095', 1), ('service', 1), ('condition', 1), ('furniture', 1), ('prime', 1), ('entire', 1), ('necessary', 1), ('name', 1), ('always', 1), ('drop', 1), ('try', 1), ('reasonable', 1), ('found', 1), ('works', 1), ('guests', 1), ('application', 1), ('right', 1), ('door', 1), ('somehow', 1), ('see', 1), ('exterminations', 1), ('irate', 1), ('year', 1), ('close', 1), ('leave', 1), ('threats', 1), ('bottom', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/quality-inn-and-suites-branson,Quality Inn & Suites,3.0,$$,5,"This was a decent hotel. We stayed in a king room with the jacuzzi tub. The room was clean and I loved having the jacuzzi tub in the room. We didn't use the pool because it was closed by the time we returned from a dinner show. Breakfast was good. We were in the back building and had to walk up a pretty steep hill to get to the main building for breakfast. Wasn't an issue for us however for someone older or with trouble walking I could see it being an issue especially since there was no empty parking spots up front to drive up to breakfast. The room could have used more outlets. I had to unplug a lamp to have a space to charge my phone and had to unplug their hair dryer to charge my camera. Shower temperature and pressure was great however the shower head was really low. I'm only 5'4"" and I felt like a giant having to lean way back to get my head under the shower head. Location was okay depending on where you're going. We weren't within what we would consider walking distance to the places we visited but we didn't have to drive too long to get to them which was good considering how horrible traffic gets on the main road.Small room with a weird stepup into the bathroom.  It was 8 or 10 inches high and I just about tripped every single time.The decor was outdated and they needed more outlets.  On the left side of the bed was a lamp mounted on the wall.  It had an extension cord that plugged it into an outlet on the right side of the bed.  There was an identical light on the right side of the bed that should have been plugged into the same outlet.  The problem was that the clock was plugged into that outlet so you either had to unplug the other light or the clock.  Bad design.By the way, I was quoted $80 for the room but my bill was $112.  That's a lot of taxes or surcharges.This hotel was just ok. The room appeared to be clean, it was just outdated. The bathroom had a weird, random step up so it was lit up with a light that was very distracting while we slept. We had our laptop, iPad and cell phones and we could only find one outlet that was next to the sink. That was a pain in this technological world where we need to plug in to charge our devices. We enjoyed the free wifi. We enjoyed the breakfast. We were sure to tip the ladies in the kitchen bc they truly showed a sense of pride. There was a large selection and it was tasty. The indoor pool was just so/so. You should know that it is in a separate building. We didn't like bundling up to run across the parking lot to the pool. There were unruly, unsupervised kids in there and that was annoying. The pool water was cold and I did not enjoy swimming at all. There were no towels.  I actually don't think I'd ever stay here again considering there are other choices. I hope this review is helpful to others.Simply a nice plain hotel. Very clean. The beds were very comfy and there were four pillows per bed. The pool and hot tub were very nice. Shower works very well. I recommend this to people who are on vacation but dont need anything TOO fancy! Stay here!Overall it was a decent place to stay, very clean and comfortable. The only issue was the shower water going from cold to scalding throughout the entire shower, not a good thing if a kid or someone who can't move FAST is in there. I did advise management so hopefully they take care of it (room 110). The complimentary breakfast was GREAT! Very nice selection of eggs, pancakes, cereal, yogurt, donuts etc. Very reasonable rates. The free Wi-Fi was pretty useless, never got it to connect.",,,,,"['decent', 'hotel', 'king', 'room', 'jacuzzi', 'tub', 'room', 'clean', 'loved', 'jacuzzi', 'tub', 'room', 'use', 'pool', 'closed', 'time', 'returned', 'dinner', 'show', 'breakfast', 'good', 'back', 'building', 'walk', 'pretty', 'steep', 'hill', 'main', 'building', 'breakfast', 'issue', 'however', 'someone', 'older', 'trouble', 'walking', 'see', 'issue', 'especially', 'since', 'empty', 'parking', 'spots', 'front', 'drive', 'breakfast', 'room', 'used', 'outlets', 'unplug', 'lamp', 'space', 'charge', 'phone', 'unplug', 'hair', 'dryer', 'charge', 'camera', 'shower', 'temperature', 'pressure', 'great', 'however', 'shower', 'head', 'really', 'low', 'felt', 'like', 'giant', 'lean', 'way', 'back', 'head', 'shower', 'head', 'location', 'okay', 'depending', 'going', 'within', 'consider', 'walking', 'distance', 'places', 'visited', 'drive', 'long', 'good', 'considering', 'horrible', 'traffic', 'gets', 'main', 'road', 'small', 'room', 'weird', 'bathroom', 'inches', 'high', 'tripped', 'every', 'single', 'time', 'decor', 'outdated', 'needed', 'outlets', 'left', 'side', 'bed', 'lamp', 'mounted', 'wall', 'extension', 'cord', 'plugged', 'outlet', 'right', 'side', 'bed', 'identical', 'light', 'right', 'side', 'bed', 'plugged', 'outlet', 'problem', 'clock', 'plugged', 'outlet', 'either', 'unplug', 'light', 'clock', 'bad', 'design', 'way', 'quoted', 'room', 'bill', '112', 'lot', 'taxes', 'surcharges', 'hotel', 'room', 'appeared', 'clean', 'outdated', 'bathroom', 'weird', 'random', 'step', 'lit', 'light', 'distracting', 'slept', 'laptop', 'cell', 'phones', 'find', 'outlet', 'next', 'sink', 'pain', 'technological', 'world', 'need', 'plug', 'charge', 'devices', 'enjoyed', 'free', 'enjoyed', 'breakfast', 'sure', 'tip', 'ladies', 'kitchen', 'truly', 'showed', 'sense', 'pride', 'large', 'selection', 'tasty', 'indoor', 'pool', 'know', 'separate', 'building', 'like', 'bundling', 'run', 'across', 'parking', 'lot', 'pool', 'unruly', 'unsupervised', 'kids', 'annoying', 'pool', 'water', 'cold', 'enjoy', 'swimming', 'towels', 'actually', 'think', 'ever', 'considering', 'choices', 'hope', 'review', 'helpful', 'others', 'simply', 'nice', 'plain', 'hotel', 'clean', 'beds', 'comfy', 'four', 'pillows', 'per', 'bed', 'pool', 'hot', 'tub', 'nice', 'shower', 'works', 'well', 'recommend', 'people', 'vacation', 'need', 'anything', 'fancy', 'overall', 'decent', 'place', 'clean', 'comfortable', 'issue', 'shower', 'water', 'going', 'cold', 'scalding', 'throughout', 'entire', 'shower', 'good', 'thing', 'kid', 'someone', 'move', 'fast', 'advise', 'management', 'hopefully', 'take', 'care', 'room', '110', 'complimentary', 'breakfast', 'great', 'nice', 'selection', 'eggs', 'pancakes', 'cereal', 'yogurt', 'donuts', 'etc', 'reasonable', 'rates', 'free', 'pretty', 'useless', 'never', 'connect']",[],[],[],[],"[('room', 8), ('shower', 6), ('breakfast', 5), ('pool', 5), ('outlet', 4), ('bed', 4), ('clean', 4), ('charge', 3), ('side', 3), ('issue', 3), ('tub', 3), ('head', 3), ('hotel', 3), ('unplug', 3), ('good', 3), ('plugged', 3), ('nice', 3), ('building', 3), ('light', 3), ('walking', 2), ('selection', 2), ('jacuzzi', 2), ('cold', 2), ('going', 2), ('pretty', 2), ('main', 2), ('someone', 2), ('like', 2), ('right', 2), ('back', 2), ('parking', 2), ('enjoyed', 2), ('however', 2), ('free', 2), ('water', 2), ('great', 2), ('weird', 2), ('considering', 2), ('decent', 2), ('bathroom', 2), ('way', 2), ('lot', 2), ('outdated', 2), ('need', 2), ('lamp', 2), ('outlets', 2), ('clock', 2), ('drive', 2), ('time', 2), ('consider', 1), ('quoted', 1), ('show', 1), ('laptop', 1), ('random', 1), ('four', 1), ('distracting', 1), ('showed', 1), ('find', 1), ('move', 1), ('giant', 1), ('hot', 1), ('actually', 1), ('appeared', 1), ('location', 1), ('technological', 1), ('hope', 1), ('take', 1), ('identical', 1), ('returned', 1), ('king', 1), ('hopefully', 1), ('overall', 1), ('truly', 1), ('dryer', 1), ('every', 1), ('front', 1), ('world', 1), ('trouble', 1), ('helpful', 1), ('entire', 1), ('gets', 1), ('ever', 1), ('taxes', 1), ('large', 1), ('bad', 1), ('either', 1), ('reasonable', 1), ('small', 1), ('works', 1), ('enjoy', 1), ('recommend', 1), ('people', 1), ('phones', 1), ('hair', 1), ('see', 1), ('sure', 1), ('design', 1), ('devices', 1), ('pain', 1), ('really', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-branson-green-mountain-drive-branson-3,Holiday Inn Express Branson-Green Mountain Drive,2.5,$$,4,"Finally a newer and clean inn at a decent price in Branson.We travel to Branson several times a year for a quick getaway and to enjoy Silver Dollar City, shopping, and family. We had yet to find a newer, clean and quiet motel/hotel at a decent price for one or two night stays (on longer stays we typically book at one of the many timeshare condos available in Branson).I'm happy to say that this Holiday Inn has what we've been looking for all of these years! In addition to the clean and quiet rooms the inn offers a free hot breakfast that was very good. If you have ever traveled to Branson before, you have probably experienced some very bad ""free"" hot breakfasts other hotel/motels offer. What a nice surprise to have one that was so fresh and offered such a good variety of food.This holiday inn provided the basics needed for a comfortable overnight stay.  Clean restroom and sleeping area, in addition to the desk space.  The cable channels were also to my liking, which is not always the case in some hotels.It was rather difficult to find a parking space here.  That is understandable since I was staying near the holidays.  Would not have been much of an issue, but I could not find an alternate door to enter the hotel from the outside with a key, so parking and then having to walk to front door in the cold was not fun.I was surprised there was no items available for purchase outside of the gift store.  I arrived after hours and wanted some milk and could not get any.  I was told there was a Wal Mart up the street, but did not want to go back out again.  So, I tried the vending machines, and unfortunately, the drinks were all sold out--are you freaking kidding me??!!!Definitely disappointed with the lack of food details, but reminded myself that Holiday Inn, after all, is not the Hyatt.  The breakfast bar offered an assortment of breads and pastries, in addition to eggs, meats, and other items.  I just opted for eggs, but I'm sure everyone could find something decent for breakfast.Not bad. A little dirty/worn, shower was clogged, bed skirt was stained, and my ceiling has a gigantic crack. But the pool is nice and so was the free breakfast. Staff is friendly and hotel was fairly quiet.I would give no stars if that was an option. Checked in this evening. We found fleas in our room, food and a condom wrapper on the carpet so it isn't well cleaned. When we asked to be moved they downgraded us to a lesser room and never apologized. Holiday Inn Express should be ashamed of having this crap with their name on it.",,,,,"['finally', 'newer', 'clean', 'inn', 'decent', 'price', 'travel', 'several', 'times', 'year', 'quick', 'getaway', 'enjoy', 'silver', 'dollar', 'city', 'shopping', 'family', 'yet', 'find', 'newer', 'clean', 'quiet', 'motel', 'hotel', 'decent', 'price', 'night', 'stays', 'longer', 'stays', 'typically', 'book', 'many', 'timeshare', 'condos', 'available', 'happy', 'say', 'holiday', 'inn', 'looking', 'years', 'addition', 'clean', 'quiet', 'rooms', 'inn', 'offers', 'free', 'hot', 'breakfast', 'good', 'ever', 'traveled', 'probably', 'experienced', 'bad', 'free', 'hot', 'breakfasts', 'hotel', 'motels', 'offer', 'nice', 'surprise', 'fresh', 'offered', 'good', 'variety', 'food', 'holiday', 'inn', 'provided', 'basics', 'needed', 'comfortable', 'overnight', 'clean', 'restroom', 'sleeping', 'area', 'addition', 'desk', 'space', 'cable', 'channels', 'also', 'liking', 'always', 'case', 'hotels', 'rather', 'difficult', 'find', 'parking', 'space', 'understandable', 'since', 'staying', 'near', 'holidays', 'much', 'issue', 'find', 'alternate', 'door', 'enter', 'hotel', 'outside', 'key', 'parking', 'walk', 'front', 'door', 'cold', 'fun', 'surprised', 'items', 'available', 'purchase', 'outside', 'gift', 'store', 'arrived', 'hours', 'wanted', 'milk', 'told', 'mart', 'street', 'back', 'tried', 'vending', 'machines', 'unfortunately', 'drinks', 'sold', 'freaking', 'kidding', 'definitely', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'food', 'details', 'reminded', 'holiday', 'inn', 'breakfast', 'bar', 'offered', 'assortment', 'breads', 'pastries', 'addition', 'eggs', 'meats', 'items', 'opted', 'eggs', 'sure', 'everyone', 'find', 'something', 'decent', 'breakfast', 'bad', 'little', 'dirty', 'worn', 'shower', 'clogged', 'bed', 'skirt', 'stained', 'ceiling', 'gigantic', 'crack', 'pool', 'nice', 'free', 'breakfast', 'staff', 'friendly', 'hotel', 'fairly', 'quiet', 'give', 'stars', 'option', 'checked', 'evening', 'found', 'fleas', 'room', 'food', 'condom', 'wrapper', 'carpet', 'well', 'cleaned', 'asked', 'moved', 'downgraded', 'lesser', 'room', 'never', 'apologized', 'holiday', 'inn', 'express', 'ashamed', 'crap', 'name']",[],[],[],[],"[('inn', 6), ('find', 4), ('holiday', 4), ('hotel', 4), ('breakfast', 4), ('clean', 4), ('food', 3), ('free', 3), ('quiet', 3), ('addition', 3), ('decent', 3), ('stays', 2), ('good', 2), ('bad', 2), ('nice', 2), ('space', 2), ('outside', 2), ('eggs', 2), ('available', 2), ('offered', 2), ('newer', 2), ('items', 2), ('parking', 2), ('door', 2), ('hot', 2), ('price', 2), ('room', 2), ('ashamed', 1), ('reminded', 1), ('dollar', 1), ('years', 1), ('ever', 1), ('rooms', 1), ('cold', 1), ('staff', 1), ('condos', 1), ('alternate', 1), ('finally', 1), ('offers', 1), ('condom', 1), ('crack', 1), ('friendly', 1), ('surprised', 1), ('express', 1), ('lesser', 1), ('desk', 1), ('front', 1), ('bar', 1), ('walk', 1), ('disappointed', 1), ('silver', 1), ('freaking', 1), ('fleas', 1), ('basics', 1), ('vending', 1), ('gift', 1), ('cable', 1), ('always', 1), ('night', 1), ('quick', 1), ('found', 1), ('enjoy', 1), ('everyone', 1), ('back', 1), ('street', 1), ('bed', 1), ('year', 1), ('liking', 1), ('machines', 1), ('drinks', 1), ('provided', 1), ('lack', 1), ('motel', 1), ('since', 1), ('yet', 1), ('looking', 1), ('apologized', 1), ('probably', 1), ('carpet', 1), ('issue', 1), ('told', 1), ('sold', 1), ('never', 1), ('hours', 1), ('key', 1), ('crap', 1), ('wanted', 1), ('downgraded', 1), ('many', 1), ('restroom', 1), ('clogged', 1), ('asked', 1), ('pastries', 1), ('breakfasts', 1), ('stained', 1), ('family', 1), ('traveled', 1), ('channels', 1), ('meats', 1), ('hotels', 1)]","[(('holiday', 'inn'), 4)]",[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-grand-oaks-hotel-branson,The Grand Oaks Hotel,4.0,$$,5,"We stayed at the Grand Oaks Hotel during our visit to Branson.There's nothing fancy about this place, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious, clean, and ready for us when we checked in.The location was great, too. It's about half a block from the center of the strip, minutes away from the Andy Williams Moon River Theater, restaurants, and Silver Dollar City.They offer free breakfast and have a heated pool.Definitely not a luxury hotel but clean and comfortable. Stayed in building two, no one there to assist during our stay. Phone and lamp in the room didn't work, tried calling front desk from my cell. Got busy signal a few times, finally when someone answered the call got disconnected.We decided to stay at the Grand Oaks because they offered a discount ticket package.  It was a good choice and about as we expected.  The hotel is located just off the strip but very close to several entertainment venues.The rooms are standard with somewhat outdated decor.  I also noticed a disturbing trend... Another remote control with a missing battery compartment cover!!!  Who steals these things?  What are the chances that someone with the same remote control at home is missing theirs AND is staying at that hotel?  Anyway, I digress...Things I liked: WIFI was free and easily to connect.  There were extra pillows and a blanket in the drawers under the TV.  The bathroom was clean and lots of towels were available.  Things I didn't like: If you wanted toiletries, you had to buy them at the front desk.  The beds were made with just the sheet and bedspread.The lobby was basic with the requisite tour pamphlets.  The lounge area is the active hub of the hotel.  A free continental breakfast is available.  One day its biscuits and gravy and the next day will be eggs and sausage.  Available everyday is coffee, OJ, apple juice, cereal, milk, waffles, toast, english muffins, bananas, canned pineapple, canned peaches and oatmeal.  It wasn't the greatest but it is nice to have the free breakfast if you are on a budget.The service was just OK.  Although everyone was friendly, you hardly saw anyone around if you needed help.Grand Oaks is OK.  Some good, some not so good but if I had to, I would stay there again.BRAND NEW ROOMS!!! there was even a fridge and microwave in our room (which is a little rare in Branson with these other types of hotels/motels) . the beds were very comfortable and the staff was accommodating. I stayed in the second building which looks like it was just completely renovated. Definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. There are a lot of hotels i would not want to stay at in Branson, but this one is definitely one to grab if you can, and ask for the second building !My husband and I stay at the Grand Oaks because it was offered with a package discount. I was happy with how it look from the outside. There are a lot of hotels that look run down on the strip. Its nothing fancy, but it was clean. The customer service is great. They offer breakfast but we didn't take advantage of it because we were not ready in time. They do have an indoor pool and hot tub. The first night the pool was cold, second night it was warm, but the third night not so warm. Hot tubs were not has hot has hot tubs should be, and the jets were not working. Other than that if your looking for a decent place to stay, The Grand Oaks Hotel is a good place to choose from.",,,,,"['grand', 'oaks', 'hotel', 'visit', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'place', 'staff', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'rooms', 'spacious', 'clean', 'ready', 'checked', 'location', 'great', 'half', 'block', 'center', 'strip', 'minutes', 'away', 'moon', 'river', 'theater', 'restaurants', 'silver', 'dollar', 'city', 'offer', 'free', 'breakfast', 'heated', 'pool', 'definitely', 'luxury', 'hotel', 'clean', 'comfortable', 'building', 'assist', 'phone', 'lamp', 'room', 'work', 'tried', 'calling', 'front', 'desk', 'cell', 'busy', 'signal', 'times', 'finally', 'someone', 'answered', 'call', 'disconnected', 'decided', 'grand', 'oaks', 'offered', 'discount', 'ticket', 'package', 'good', 'choice', 'expected', 'hotel', 'located', 'strip', 'close', 'several', 'entertainment', 'venues', 'rooms', 'standard', 'somewhat', 'outdated', 'decor', 'also', 'noticed', 'disturbing', 'trend', 'another', 'remote', 'control', 'missing', 'battery', 'compartment', 'cover', 'steals', 'things', 'chances', 'someone', 'remote', 'control', 'home', 'missing', 'staying', 'hotel', 'anyway', 'digress', 'things', 'liked', 'free', 'easily', 'connect', 'extra', 'pillows', 'blanket', 'drawers', 'bathroom', 'clean', 'lots', 'towels', 'available', 'things', 'like', 'wanted', 'toiletries', 'buy', 'front', 'desk', 'beds', 'made', 'sheet', 'bedspread', 'lobby', 'basic', 'requisite', 'tour', 'pamphlets', 'lounge', 'area', 'active', 'hub', 'hotel', 'free', 'continental', 'breakfast', 'available', 'day', 'biscuits', 'gravy', 'next', 'day', 'eggs', 'sausage', 'available', 'everyday', 'coffee', 'apple', 'juice', 'cereal', 'milk', 'waffles', 'toast', 'muffins', 'bananas', 'canned', 'pineapple', 'canned', 'peaches', 'oatmeal', 'greatest', 'nice', 'free', 'breakfast', 'budget', 'service', 'although', 'everyone', 'friendly', 'hardly', 'saw', 'anyone', 'around', 'needed', 'help', 'grand', 'oaks', 'good', 'good', 'brand', 'new', 'rooms', 'fridge', 'microwave', 'room', 'little', 'rare', 'types', 'hotels', 'motels', 'beds', 'comfortable', 'staff', 'accommodating', 'second', 'building', 'looks', 'like', 'completely', 'renovated', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'hotel', 'anyone', 'lot', 'hotels', 'definitely', 'grab', 'ask', 'second', 'building', 'husband', 'grand', 'oaks', 'offered', 'package', 'discount', 'happy', 'look', 'outside', 'lot', 'hotels', 'look', 'run', 'strip', 'nothing', 'fancy', 'clean', 'customer', 'service', 'great', 'offer', 'breakfast', 'take', 'advantage', 'ready', 'time', 'indoor', 'pool', 'hot', 'tub', 'first', 'night', 'pool', 'cold', 'second', 'night', 'warm', 'third', 'night', 'warm', 'hot', 'tubs', 'hot', 'hot', 'tubs', 'jets', 'working', 'looking', 'decent', 'place', 'grand', 'oaks', 'hotel', 'good', 'place', 'choose']",[],[],[],[],"[('hotel', 7), ('oaks', 5), ('grand', 5), ('hot', 4), ('free', 4), ('good', 4), ('breakfast', 4), ('clean', 4), ('rooms', 3), ('night', 3), ('strip', 3), ('second', 3), ('available', 3), ('place', 3), ('hotels', 3), ('things', 3), ('pool', 3), ('building', 3), ('definitely', 3), ('staff', 2), ('day', 2), ('friendly', 2), ('someone', 2), ('desk', 2), ('front', 2), ('room', 2), ('tubs', 2), ('missing', 2), ('discount', 2), ('great', 2), ('package', 2), ('fancy', 2), ('service', 2), ('lot', 2), ('offer', 2), ('offered', 2), ('warm', 2), ('control', 2), ('look', 2), ('comfortable', 2), ('ready', 2), ('beds', 2), ('nothing', 2), ('canned', 2), ('remote', 2), ('like', 2), ('anyone', 2), ('cereal', 1), ('chances', 1), ('half', 1), ('dollar', 1), ('anyway', 1), ('peaches', 1), ('types', 1), ('cold', 1), ('milk', 1), ('toast', 1), ('looking', 1), ('busy', 1), ('also', 1), ('help', 1), ('answered', 1), ('finally', 1), ('location', 1), ('take', 1), ('coffee', 1), ('around', 1), ('advantage', 1), ('blanket', 1), ('looks', 1), ('fridge', 1), ('choice', 1), ('venues', 1), ('ticket', 1), ('silver', 1), ('easily', 1), ('helpful', 1), ('signal', 1), ('calling', 1), ('grab', 1), ('river', 1), ('biscuits', 1), ('husband', 1), ('restaurants', 1), ('recommend', 1), ('everyone', 1), ('towels', 1), ('trend', 1), ('gravy', 1), ('decided', 1), ('connect', 1), ('disturbing', 1), ('pillows', 1), ('sausage', 1), ('entertainment', 1), ('lots', 1), ('away', 1), ('microwave', 1), ('moon', 1), ('cell', 1)]","[(('grand', 'oaks'), 5)]",[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/castle-rock-resort-and-waterpark-branson,Castle Rock Resort and Waterpark,3.5,$$$,15,"I can't say it's the best. I can't say that it's maintained to the finest standards. I can't say anything really shocked us other than that the pools were really warm and that was completely necessary because you don't have any hot tubs. Best part was it was much warmer than our visit to Great Wolf Lodge. We enjoyed our stay. The pools were lots of fun for our adventurous 2 year old. Yes there's some rust, yes there is area for improvement. But for a family that isn't spending a ton of money this was just right for us. Lazy river was shallow enough that our little guy could kind of bounce off the bottom and run with the water. I would say that's the best part. The room was in good enough shape.Review Update Coming Soon!!I arrive this week and I am looking forward to a wonder time with my daughter.Brought the family here for an overnight stay. The kids had a blast and so did we. We stayed in a room for 6 which was perfect for us. Wish they had a room with bunks that had queen beds too, but it worked out fine with the double beds. The water park area was great!  We all had fun swimming and riding the slides. I would highly recommend this place for anyone wanting to have a fun getaway with the kiddos.There are better options in Branson for pools and accommodations.  Two out of the six pools were closed.  The facility needs maintenance.  There is significant rust in the waterpark area.  Be sure to have a tetanus shot if you are cut.  I switched rooms due to a strong musty odor in room 219.  Security lockers are $6 in the water park area.  Be sure to leave valuables in your vehicle and don't waste the $6.  The atrium rooms leave a cheap, unclean, sleazy impression.  I'm close to leaving but my son is having fun.  The facility is not crowded.  I don't plan to EVER return.  Learn from my experience and look elsewhere.I will not be commenting in the restaurant I did not eat there . The hotel lobby is nice . Had a small shop for snacks and touristy things . The desk person was friendly and personable . She was the only one working so she was a bit overwhelmed ( but kept it together) ,  since there was 20 or so people  waiting .  The room. Was your typical room . The beds were awful . So springy that you bounced when not trying to bounce . The room was clean . That is all I can really say about that . The inside water park . Two slides . They were a ton of fun . Wish there was more. Nice lazy river . A decent lap pool , but it is hard to swim laps when kids are jumping in and out . Outside water area and pool . Good small kiddie area . Water volley ball area. My kids tell me the water was cold cold cold . I can say that the indoor pool area water was warm .  In summery was the hotel fair the water park okay. I can say that the water park area in side needs painted and some repairs done . I probably wound not stay here again .I have to say we really liked our stay here.  We got the family suite with the bunk beds for the kids.  Room was very spacious and clean.   Staff was very friendly and super helpful.  Didn't try the restaurant.  The place is pretty plain and not that fancy, but I didn't care, everything else outweighed that factor.  I do wish they had microwaves in the room.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the water park .  It is a very nice water park designed for all ages BUT,  it really needs some tlc.   The need to shut it down for a month and clean and reprint all the metal parts.  Most of the slide supports, steps and all the guard rails had a LOT of rust in them.   I don't want to see that much rust on structural parts of the parks.  Please fix that.So far so good. Pluses: check in fast and very friendly. Arcade room. single King with jacuzzi,  roomy and clean. Air works great. Coffee in the morning. Plenty of towels. Lots of channels on TV. Kids loved the two water slides, lazy river fun, outdoor pool areas will accommodate kids 10 and under in most cases. No diving areas. Possibly more geared for 8 and below. Lots of towels in water area. Life guards alert and competent. Minuses: no wifi in rooms, lobby only....big negative for me. Said they were working on it. Gift shop very small, minimal necessities for items forgotten. Headed to dinner here but other guests said it was great, something for everyone.We visited for the first time this weekend for one night July 27! We loved it so much our boys 7 and 8 had a blast!!! The rooms were very clean. The staff was very friendly!!! Overall the best minivacation we have ever taken!!!This hotel has been remodeled with a new indoor water park. I give the waterpark 4 stars. Great tube slides and lazy river. Temp of water and inside was nice. Towels provided. Good hours-open till 10pm Could of been 5 stars had they had the restrooms accessible from inside the water park-we had to walk out in a cold hall to the bathrooms and showers. Also, where was the hot tub? missing this as well. The hotel gets 3 stars. Kudos to the roomy room and bunk beds cutout with kids getting their own flat screen tv. The beds were horrible though. Doubles? Really? This is not much more than a twin. For two adults? And hard as a rock. The halls smelled a little musty but the room was fine. The hotel restaurant gets 1 star. Cheap food and tastes so. The service was not great either. After that first experience, we ordered pizza from Dominoes versus ordering it there. We stayed at the Grand Country Inn Waterpark before. Its a fine waterpark too (with hot tub) but the hotel park is much older. This was a more pleasant experience especially since we stayed in the ""Tower"" and did not have to walk outside in the freezing cold to walk to the waterpark.Overall a nice place to stay. Water park was great, something for kids of all ages. Room was mostly good. Could have used a fridge in the room and upon closer inspection the room wasn't as clean as it appears on the surface. Located just off the strip which makes finding dinner and attractions easy and quick.This place was less than I thought it would be for the price. Rooms and amenities are much better in the area and the cost is less. The water park was just OK and if your only watching your grandchildren the place is like a sauna.If you want a water park go to white water. You'll be happier. The AC didn't work  very well.Great hotel and waterpark. Everything was nice and clean. Some rooms have a kiddie cove area with bunk beds and a separate TV. Rooms were a good size, the bed could have been better. I think the water park could use a hot tub area. There is on site restaurant right at the water park so you don't have to stop playing when you get hungry.Kids loved it (7 and 12) We stayed in the main hotel where the water park is. Rooms very spacious. Kina noisy with kids running down the halls but what do you expect its a great place for kids to have fun and adults too. If i had to complain about anything it would be the pillows they suck. Bring your own or go to Walmart down the street and buy yourself one. If you are expecting the Hilton you will be dissappointed. But if you like a friendly family oriented hotel with a really fun water park this is your place.First time here. We went across town last time. This water park is newer. So a little cleaner feeling. Slides are cool . Although we missed the huge water barrel dumping!!Nice water park. If you have children, stay in the tower with the bunk bed and separate tv for kids.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-suites-at-fall-creek-branson,The Suites at Fall Creek,3.0,$$,13,"Love it, always a great time. Housekeeping is lax though.We are on a vacation with our family in Branson at Diamond Falls Creek.Horrible!!!       Reason WHY all should avoid Diamond!!I have owned Worldmark, HGVC, Marriott, and stayed at Westgate and many others over the years; but this place it the worst.  Some of the reasons.1.  Resort is empty - and they put us in the farthest building on the third floor  (.8 Miles from check-in) when we arrived at midnight with little kids.2.  Reservation process a nightmare - took numerous calls, and emails to straighten out3.  Building has been recently updated, but they didn't change the tubs (30+ years old, yellow and gross) or the other features from the 80's4.  BUG BUGS AND MORE BUGS  I means many spider webs crossing the hallways and stairs.  Have not been cleaned all summer.  Of course the building that they show across the parking lot has no spiders)  Bugs in the units5.  We came as guests of the owners,  with the intentions of buying.  The buying experience was terrible.  They ignored our questions, and stormed off.  Dennis the director was rude and disrespectful to my wife.6.   DO NOT BUY HERE!!   You will regret it.  A quick google search finds many unhappy owners, and deeds and points for sale for $1.   (<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fredweek.com&amp;s=8e0dfe02f563f9548f3203b83ad0369b6dc5dd5de7dbe4fd1496e2a20c8ef3aa"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">redweek.com</a>)We came here because my parents regrettably bought a timeshare with Diamond Resorts years ago and have been trying to make the most of the decision. Overall the resort is not that bad. They have various amenities such as a pool, activity center, and mini golf; all typically included in a Timeshare resort. The rooms are fairly spacious and have was able to fit our family of four in a 1 bedroom suite with a sizable living room. It's located a few miles from Branson's downtown area and main show avenue route 76 which provides some nice peace and quiet from the hussle and bussle of the tiny town during high season.Unfortunately like with most timeshares it left me feeling a little dissatisfied. We signed up for a 3 session lunch which included a free show and a decent amount of food. The experience was average but at the end they always heckle you at what's supposed to be a 45min sales pitch but becomes 3 hours of frustrating threats and scare tactics that inevitably work on much of the older population. Overall if you don't yet have a timeshare AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS, however if you've already made that mistake of a lifetime consider coming here once to see all the town has to offer.Place is ok if your luck enough or pay enough to get one of the good rooms. DONT LET THEM CON YOU INTO BUYING! They are greasy lying dirty sales people. We got suckered in and have been owners for almost two years. We have been lied to so many times. Every time we go we get crappy rooms and are told we must keep buying into more points to get a good room. Terrible! Ok place to stay but don't buy!!!!! They will have you for life! Don't trust them!!!!!!Amazing amenities and beautiful rooms. We didn't feel we needed to travel around town at all. Everything we needed to relax was here!We've stayed here with out of town family and on mini family vacations. It is worth every penny.Our stay here went far beyond our expectations! The room was what you'd expect. Nothing really fancy, but it was clean and nice. But the amenities! We played mini golf, went swimming, watched Rio 2 in the Activities Center, played shuffleboard, horseshoes, checkers, air hockey, basketball, and more! Our three-year-old LOVED the playground, too! It was hard to leave! Would definitely recommend! One of the best places we've ever stayed... anywhere!We are Diamond owners and recently stayed at the Suites at Fall Creek in Branson. ( March 29-April 3 ) It's SOOOOO peaceful and so nice!!! We LOVE it!!!! I'm SO ready to go back!!!! It's just awesome!!!! Check out the Mixer that they have on Tuesday's at 4:15. It does get a little boring....but, it's ok. I think they should pull more people from the audience or interact more with the audience. But, for the most part it was ok. The jacuzzis are very nice. The indoor pool is nice. The game room?? Nice but air hockey would be a HUGE hit. And maybe an outdoor basketball court. I know a lot of Diamond owners are older and retired so they don't have the basketball court outside or the air hockey in the activity room. But, we are owners and we are in our mid 30's with young kids so not ALL owners are older and retired. I highly recommend this resort. You DON'T have to be an owner to stay here. It's very nice!!!! Oh and there's a great restaurant down the road Dana's BBQ check it out!Just checked in as VIP owners. Staff nice but the resort is pretty shabby and run down. I had to request a mattress topper to make the pullout sleepable. There was dirt in the drawers, stained carpet, mildew in the shower. We do have a nice view of the river. Overall, disappointing.We spent April 30-May 4 in unit 2044A at The Suites at Fall Creek.  Our check in was efficiently handled at the front desk.  We had requested a one bedroom unit near the indoor swimming pool and were accommodated although there was not a confirmation ahead of time that the communication had been received.As Diamond owners we have stayed here at various times and two new things we noticed in the unit were the flat screen TV's and the new furniture which included chests of drawers in the living room and bed room.  The bed was very comfortable as we have found in other Diamond properties.  The slated blinds do not provide good ""black out"" of the windows in any room.ATT wifi was provided and it was horrible.  The only time it was reasonably reliable was  when I was on about 2:00AM.  I don't know if it was capacity or just the system.  Wifi was just fine in the Activities Center.  There are two nice computers for guests to use in the Activities Center.The resort has a daily listing of activities.  My wife participated one morning in the water aerobics session and found it very good with a very good leader.  It seems the activities calendar has been improved in the quality of events this time.The Concierge desk is multi-purpose: solicitation for time share presentations, parking permits and actual discounted ticket sales to a variety of shows and attractions in Branson.  We found the prices good and the information by the persons staffing that area to be quite helpful in planning our visit.Our unit had a screened in porch looking over the grounds.  Since it snowed while we were there, we didn't make use of the outdoor facilities.  Most units are very comfortable but there may be some that haven't been completely renovated.  I would not hesitate to recommend staying here.There were some very positive points and very negative points for our stay here.  Staff:  Checked in and talked to Rhonda.  She was very friendly and after a long drive in, she made me smile and laugh during probably one of the best check in experiences I've ever had.  The Concierge desk (to get a free gift) tries to get you to listen to their pitch on buying a unit...let's just say I said no thanks.Amenities of hotel:  I didn't get to see a lot of the things inside, but they had MANY lists of activities to keep you busy.  There's a mini golf course, pool, and a very small lake area to fish/rent boats.  There were a couple groups of men out on the lake fishing, I was very surprised how fast the current moved them.Room:  We had a studio room, (little surprised they hold $250 for possible room charges) which would be fine for just two people.  We walked in and I was surprised how outdated it was on the inside with how it looked on the out.  Loved the screened in porch.  The lamps had the 70's gold hanging chain, the tiny ceiling fan was the loudest thing I've ever heard and actually turned it off thinking it was going to fall on me.  It was great having a room with a microwave, small fridge, and 2 small burners, but we only used the fridge.  Came completely stocked with iron, toaster, pots, pans, glasses, plates, silverware, etc.  The bathtub had the finish coming off and the toilet res were something less to be desired (unless you want to smell like musk and wash your hair twice to even feel clean).  The TV was new and large, bed was a small, uncomfortable queen.  The noise from being on the first floor was unbelievable.  I would've bet a lot of money the people above us were crazy children, every move them or the neighbors made next door (even conversations) could be heard clearly.  Let's say...we didn't sleep good for the entire two nights we were there.  Parking:  Once you actually find your building (don't mind the trailer court in the middle of the resort...literally), it was the worst parking of any hotel/""resort"" I've ever seen.All in all...one of the worst experiences I've had at a hotel...no way I could say this was a resort.  We will definitely chose a different hotel when we visit BransonThis is a super nice resort!! Had a 1 bedroom suite. Fully stocked kitchen with pots &amp; pans, king bed, sleeper sofa, jacuzzi tub and screened porch. Lots of things to do onsite including pools, mini golf, movie rentals(think you get 1-2 per day free) &amp; scheduled activities. Check in &amp; out was very quick.The are really only 2 reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. The first is probably more of a personal thing -the decor. It was very floral! The curtains were floral, pictures were of flowers and the wallpaper border at the top of the walls was also floral.The second reason was the Parking! Our first night we had to park a building away. The spots are kinda small anyways but some people were on the line, so even though I guess technically the was a spot in front of my building I couldn't fit there unless I was riding a bike. (I have a compact car)My husband and I enjoyed our stay here. Yes, it's outdated but most of Branson is. There are great amenities for families. We enjoyed free movie rentals and mini golf.The studio we had was tiny and dated. The noise from upper floors/ was atrocious, but they were booked and we could not be moved. The only compliments I can give are for a friendly staff and for awesome LCD television.",,,,,"['love', 'always', 'great', 'time', 'housekeeping', 'lax', 'though', 'vacation', 'family', 'diamond',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-branson-branson,Fairfield Inn & Suites Branson,4.0,$$,15,"The check-in was a breeze. It's in a great location right off the main Branson strip. The staff was friendly and helpful. The free breakfast had a good selection. The rooms are comfortable. And the price is affordable! Everything you need for a great visit. NOTE: We only stayed here for one night.Decent room and easy checkin/checkout. No issues and the breakfast was perfect! I would have liked to have directions that took me on the faster routes than on the Strip. I was using google maps instead.Nice clean hotel for the most part.  My only issues were the giant pillows that account for the crick in my neck today, and the fact that they do have a pantry, but for some reason, no beer.  I'd pay 8 bucks for a cold beer when I get in late.My wife pointed out clumps of hair in two of our three bathrooms that we had.  Also, the Hallway and two of the rooms smelled a little musty/moldy.  Staff was extremely friendly and helpfulVery nice stay. I was really impressed as we made reservations online and there was a small text box where you can make a comment or special request, so I entered early check-in because we were going to be arriving after having driven all night. Well, when we arrived I made a comment to the front desk person, Kimberly, and she said ""yes, I read that and we took care of it for you"". Cool. The rooms are nice. The hotel looks as though it was updated recently. The breakfast area was great and the woman working there did an amazing job of keeping it clean and stocked.Best Value in Branson!!!!Very friendly, close to everything, Walgreen's next door.  Remodeled and super clean everywhere.  Free nice big breakfast.  Sausage, eggs, belgium waffles, bread, pastries, yougart, cereal, milk, juice, fruit.  Linda, hostess in breakfast remembered everyone and was helping people make waffles and kept breakfast well stocked!We could not believe all this for only $69.00 a night!  Room size was nice with microwave and frig!  Would stay here again and recommend it for anyone!Yep, we loved staying here. Right off the strip and right in the middle of Branson.  The rooms are all brand new.The renovation of this property was well done. Everything looked new, modern, and fresh. Staff still very friendly and outgoing. Good breakfast except for the throngs of people who must never have stayed at a hotel before or eaten at a buffet for that matter - they lacked a little buffet ettiquite. My only complaint was the room itself. I believe it was 315. It was immediately next to the ice machine and the elevator. Noise from the ice machine kept us awake well into the late night hours.I'm platinum elite at Marriott and was surprised to get that room. Seems like when I travel for business they're a little more careful about where they assign my room - or maybe I've just been lucky until now. Anyhow, the front desk clerk threw a few points my way as an apology but quite frankly I think offering a free night at some point in the future would have been a more appropriate consolation to try and earn my repeat business. I guess they assume that if I'm a Marriott rewards guy I'll come back nomatter what.Hotel is basic. The rooms are a little small, but okay just to sleep there. Beds were comfy but pillows were not! Convenient location. The pool was too small. Breakfast was good. Got $83 a night during 4th of July weekend which was great. Not sure if you can even get that price anywhere there during that time. I made my reservation in February is why I got such a good rate! Reserve early if you are going on a holiday weekend!Can't believe this has 3 stars. Hotel was so clean and nice! Extremely nice staff and rooms were comfortable. No, this isn't a fancy place and the pool is dinky and indoors, but for what it IS, an economical average hotel. Excellent I'm that category.Also I have to say the breakfast buffet was GOOD. Most hotels that offer breakfast are not worth mentioning. This one was good, moist muffins, and drinkable coffee. The ladies operating and filling buffet were falling over themselves to help. So pleasant!I work in the industry thus am fussier than most...point taken when I walked in and promptly out of the residence inn in branson, which thankfully brought me here. The front desk was more than friendly and helpful, the entire hotel is clean, breakfast was great, attendant authentically enthusiastic and kind, the pool is warm and salt water! :) and the renovation is gorgeous. Even with all the competition, we will be back here for sure!Previous reviews for Fairfield Inn are not nice, so I was worried about staying here.  I did not need to worry.  This hotel is great and we enjoyed our stay.Check in was very friendly and we noticed right away that the lobby and surrounding area looked recently updated.  Same thing with our room.  It was really great.  The first think I noticed was outlets everywhere.  Cute, fresh room layout and design.  Especially great layout if you are here for business.  And everything here is new.  I like new.  Even the pool area and workout area are super clean.  We stayed here two nights and really enjoyed our stay.Another great thing about this hotel is the free breakfast bar.  Lots of choices.  There is cereal, (cold and hot) fruit, yogurt, fresh cooked eggs, sausage and hash browns.  You can toast up your own English muffins, toast or bagels.  Probably the biggest hit is the waffle maker.  Everyone was lining up both mornings we were there waiting for their turn to make hot fresh waffles.  For beverages, they have juices, milk and coffee.All the employees here are super friendly and helpful.  Very comfortable stay!The staff is extremely  nice, the WiFi is easy, the beds are comfy, and they showers have power.At this writing they were remodeling the 2nd floor and the breakfast room. We stayed in an updated room and the furnishings are nice. They did not have some convenience items like a luggage rack to set your suitcase. And there was only one chair in the room (desk chair).I've been to quite a few Marriott properties (see the list of which this review is a member) but this is my first review for a Fairfield Inn. I have to say that I am not impressed. While I was the last guest to arrive for the night, I do have Platinum status with Marriott and I would have hoped to not have the room that is right next to the elevator. While I couldn't hear the ""bing"" of it, I could feel some of the vibrations through the floor. There was some noise from the hallway and a good amount of noise through the window. The helicopter tour place isn't far away so I could hear that go past every so often.The parking lot was completely filled, which wasn't helped by the two people who parked their trailers sideways to take up five spaces each. Fortunately, they have a thing worked out with the neighboring Walgreens.The room was on the sparse side with a small table, a workdesk and chair and the two nightstands. The double bed was less than completely comfortable. Coffee maker of course, and shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom, but the towels were small to medium sized.On the plus side, the rate was okay ($99) and there was unlimited free wifi for two laptops and two iPhones (mine and my wife's).Would I stay here again? Probably not.Reading the other reviews I disagree.  Is is a Fairfeld.  Not a top of the line chain in their ownership.We have two queen beds with five pillows each which I requested when making my reservation on the road by phone.  Access was good and there was plenty of parking in the rear for us.  Maybe the two trailers were a bit much on a smaller property like this.  However, in all my travels when you are in a big city with limited parking these problems always exist.  I recently stayed at Marriott Key West and had to pay 17.50 plus tax.  I am gold too.  But, because I was gold I got bumped to a suite.A great place to park is in the rear next to Walmart.  They have a rear door.  Just walk to the front and check in get your key and then take baggage in through rear door.They have a small indoor pool with spa that is ample for a property this size.The front desk clerk, Nick, was very cordial and helpful.  Typical of a Marriott employee.  I had trouble connecting with the Internet and he came up to our room and connected both of our computers as soon as he could get away.  He answered all my questions that I had about the gold status.   Very pleasant and helpful young man that needs to be recognized.We had a great breakfast.  All the coffee you could drink.  Jimmy dean breakfast sandwiches, boiled eggs, four types of juice, biscuits and gravy, fruit, belgium waffles and so much more.  There is a desk with ample plugs beneath to plug computers and other items.  Who would ever think we would have so many electronic devices.  My friend who is with me has as many as I have and we are making out just fine.  Just buy a plug with multiple plugs attached and put it in a brief case.  It is needed today.I did not have to pull the desk away from the wall.  Just bend over and plug the cord in.99.00 for two queens, a desk that sits two people, a coffee maker, ice buckets, plasma TV, large closet, ironing board, bureau and comfortable beds and pillows.  Stay at Red Roof Inn and see what you get.Please remember that this review is based on a comparison of other hotels in the same category.  Not against a higher category Marriott, Gaylord etc.Nowadays, almost all hotel rooms actually have a thermostat.  But this Fairfield Inn location still has the 1970's style setup where you have an AC/heating unit next to the window, with a panel under which are the on/off, hot/cold switches.  You turn on the AC and after 30 min you get up to adjust it because it's too cold.  30 min later you get up to adjust it because now it's too warm.  After trying this for about a couple of hours, you can finally reach a tolerable level.And the rooms are not set up for business in the 21st century.  Yes, there is free wifi, but there aren't readily accessible outlets for your laptop and other equipment.  You have to pull the desk or nightstand back from the wall to find a place to plug in.Still, I give two stars because the front desk service was decent and the location is excellent, just a 1/2 block off the main strip in Branson.",,,,,"['check', 'breeze', 'great', 'location', 'right', 'main', 'strip', 'staff', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'free', 'breakfast', 'good', 'selection', 'rooms',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/stormy-point-village-by-summerwinds-branson,Stormy Point Village by Summerwinds,4.5,$$$,7,"This place is great! Very nice place to stay with extremely well-kept facilities. It has 2 different pool areas, workout facilities, on-site Starbucks, nice restaurant, etc. My whole group loved the cottages you stay in and really enjoyed our time there. The only downside is having to pay an extra $25 for Wifi, but since it covers a full week it's not so bad!There are some awesome qualities about this resort, but some letdowns. Pros: Great barGreat pool area for the kidsClean, beautiful roomsExcellent customer serviceCons:Not actually a sauna as advertised (it's been out if commission for ""quite a while"")Game room=three arcade gamesQuality of food was inconsistent in restaurants (service was great)Surprisingly difficult to access the lake. There are beautiful views of it as you come into the resort (minus the construction), but there weren't any open beaches nearby. If it weren't advertised as being a lakeside resort with a sauna, I'd be far less disappointed.This place is amazing! The pool and water park was great for the kids. Cannot wait to go back next year.My parents' traded in a week of their timeshare to come here.  At first, I thought why the heck go to Branson.  But after going, it was very interesting and a nice escape from my usual southern California bubble.  Their style here is Cape Cod in Missouri.  There are little cottages which is a big difference from the hotel style timeshare we usually have at home.  Each cottage has a small kitchen and a washer and dryer.  Our cottage was a two bedroom (a bedroom located upstairs) and two bathrooms.  This was very spacious for the four of us.This is gated so you have some feeling of security when you stay here.  I know if says free wifi, but its only for 5 minutes, if you're in the cottage.  And also at night, be careful because there are no street lights and on mountain roads it's very dark.  There isn't many grocery stores near by opened late at night, with the exception of Wal-mart but it not a Super Wal-mart and the grocery section is somewhat limited and very pricey.  Probably because it's the only thing around.  Depending on where your cottage is located you can have a very scenic view.  We were lucky enough to be there right when many of the leaves were changing colors for the autumn season.Beautiful, quiet clean mini houses. Came last year also. This time we reserved a 4 bedroom. What a nice place large place. They think of everything I even had a makeup mirror to tweeze my over grown eyebrows ! Cute decor. My daughter who is 3, we picked the pirate bedroom which was decorated in a pirate theme. Located on the bottom floor (three level) we call it the ""girl cave"". Complete with our own bathroom, big screen tv, sectional and washer and dryer. Also comes with a blu ray and and Xbox. We went to the pool today and tomorrow we will visit the butterfly palace. A must for the ozarks. This is a time share so exchange it.This place is awesome! It really is the ""Nantucket of Branson"". The place we stayed in was beautiful. Very well furnished, granite countertops, flat screens, very modern. Nautical theme decor was very fitting to the locale. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone heading to Branson.Silver Dollar City and all of the shows are only a few minutes drive. Everything is pretty close.We purchased a timeshare here a couple of years ago and have stayed one full week and several times for 3 nights.  We LOVE It.  Well worth the money if you are going to use it.  You can rent boats or a slip if you have a boat.  There is a dock for swimming in the lake, a pool with a poolside bar/restaurant.  The restaurant menu is somewhat limited and pricey but it's not bad if you do not want to venture out.  The cottages are clean and comfortable, master bathrooms have a jet tub and large shower.  Kitchen has granite countertops and stainless steel appliances.  Beats a Hotel for sure.  Usually quite a few kids in the pool which for us is a bit of a downside but they are supposed to be building an adult only pool section in the future.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-barrington-hotel-branson,The Barrington Hotel,4.0,$$,8,"I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I've never been to Branson so it was difficult to know where to stay. Most of the places seemed quite old and run down. That's what I expected by the outside of this hotel. As soon as you walk in you can tell they have done major renovations. We were upgraded to the honeymoon suite with an in-room jacuzzi. The room was so nice! Big and very updated. The free continental breakfast was ok, similar to many others I've had. Nothing fresh or very healthy but it was fine. This hotel is not right on the strip but i was grateful for that since it's a two lane road that gets so backed up it's utterly ridiculous.I would definitely stay here again,  although I can't say I'll ever be back to branson.Front desk girl took my mother's credit card information and used it for a dating website!!!!! Also they were supposed to ship some items that were left behind in the room and never did.We came here after an awful night at lodge of the ozarks. Rooms were very clean. The beds were very comfortable. The staff was nice even the maids were kind. Breakfast was AWESOME it's on the third flood which is very convenient. It's like you're in a dining hall. The first night we were there they called to make sure we were okay and asked if we needed anything. My only complaint is that the front doors. at the entrance to the lobby are not automatic doors. So it makes it kind of difficult to get your bags in on a kart. Over all very nice hotel.Great service, good management, bed was nice and comfy, pool is clean, fitness area has great equipment. Great prices. Just overall outstandingVery pleased with this hotel and the staff.  Service was impeccable from the front desk, to the housekeeping, to the breakfast staff.  All were so friendly and knowledgeable about the area.  I felt like I was coming home, not to a hotel.  The breakfast was fantastic.  Lots of choices and lots of room to sit, plus it was open until 9:30 a.m., which is a big plus.  My only disappointment was the pool area.  Hot tub tub was not working and the pool itself was too cold, but that's okay considering we weren't here to relax in the pool.Clean, quiet, family friendly, wonderful breakfast included, indoor pool and hot tub.The staff was friendly and helpful. Andy gave us a great suggestion for a Mexican restaurant: Casa Fuentes <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/casa-fuentes-mexican-restaurant-branson"">yelp.com/biz/casa-fuente...</a>The Barrington is a basic hotel, nothing fancy, but seriously, who cares? It works well. I agree with Jeff B's review. We'll definitely stay here next time we're in Branson.Hotels in Branson are an odd thing.  Most have been there for years and years, so none of the ones I've stayed in have that ""new"" feel.  I've stayed at the Barrington about five times, so that should tell you something.The staff has always made me feel at home.  The rooms are reasonably clean and it's nearby everything.  Just a good solid hotel.  Nothing special, but nothing wrong with it either.I was pleased with our stay at the Barrington Hotel.  The hotel offered continental breakfast, workout room, and indoor pool and hot tub.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-branson-convention-center-branson,Hilton Branson Convention Center,4.0,$$$,20,"Hotel was clean and room was very nice. Dessert was amazing and the breakfast buffets was delicious.Convention center stay not very convention goer friendly. I stayed at this hotel for a convention recently and was amazed I wasn't allowed to use a cart to move some stuff from my room to the convention center, where I was paying to set up a booth.  When I first arrived to the hotel I wanted to load up a cart with a few items to bring to my room, I was amazed when the bell-hop told me I wasn't allowed to take the cart without having to have him come along. I had several burly men staying with me who were more than capable of helping, but I was strong armed by the pushy bell-boy who demanded to walk along aside me with his precious cart for a $3 tip. When I needed the cart the following day I was told the reason I had to have a bell-boy follow me around with the cart for a $4 tip was because ""they're a full service hotel."" So when they say full service they must mean they're trying to nickel-dime me every chance they get like I'm a tourist staying at a resort in a third world nation where the only source of income they have is the tips they get from patrons. The room AC worked fine but sounded like it was powered by several rusty hamster wheels and would wake me at night when it turned on. This is a very expensive hotel and they have the audacity to charge $10 A DAY for Wi-fi on top of what the nightly rate was, seriously!?!?! For such a big multi-million dollar convention center I'm dumbfounded they'd strong arm me from using a cart for a $4 tip. Many of my fellow convention center patrons felt the same as well. Its not rocket science, if you have a giant convention center attached to your hotel, you know people staying at the hotel are going to be using the convention center you should have carts readily available without the requirement that bell-boys have to follow them around like its their personal carts from home. Additionally when I was checking out they way over-charged me for one day of room-service (I ordered the same thing twice so I knew what the price was), when I asked for the receipt they wouldn't provide it. Once again over charging and/or nickel and dimeing. Here's a tip worth more than $4 for you Branson hilton hotel; change your understanding of what ""full service"" means and stop nickel/diming people. In the future when deciding where to go for trade shows I'll do my upmost to push for somewhere beside here.1/10/15As we were taken up to our room we were told the hotel has had to recently lay off staff because it's been so slow. I really don't think the manager would want this information being told to new patrons but after a bit I learned it only goes downhill from there.Wanted to have a drink with my husband in the bar/lounge &amp; there were 8-12 young kids running around, yelling &amp; jumping on the furniture. Soooo, no drinks.We decided to watch a movie in our room instead.  Nope, can't do that either because the kids were screaming &amp; laughing throughout the halls as well. The rooms had GREAT windows but the way the room was design we kept running into each other inside the room. Would have been nice to have a tub &amp; fan in the restroom. Seriously,  who doesn't have tubs or fans?!Day 2 : We out out the DND sign, left for lunch and when we came back the maid had done our room! (We had work documents out) My husband called &amp; was told I went down &amp; requested maid service (not true-wasnt even here) so I went down &amp; was told our DND sign wasn't on the door (it is STILL on the door)Blatant liars. The nearby Raddison looked beautiful &amp; something tells me we might have better luck there for our next trip.quiet, comfortable bedfriendly staffexcellent in room burgersmall TV and small showerparking across streetOur stay here, thus far, has been nice. The drain in our room malfunctioned and maintenance was up quickly to fix the problem. The front desk service is nice, the valet is chipper, and our room is clean. There are very few patrons, so we're getting some very individualized attention. The location is convenient and the indoor decor is nice.There was a mix up with our reservation, but Nicole very nicely fixed it for us. We needed 2 adjoining rooms for all of our family. I felt like she went above and beyond and we were very grateful. Good location, nice and clean room, good price. We will be back!!  Thanks Nicole!!Great location - and super strong service.   We were very pleased with the whole experience - and walked over to the Landing almost every night to shop or eat.    The breakfast at the hotel was delicious and the wait staff was top notch.   Our waitress was Ukrainian and very sweet.    (I believe her name was Nadia)    I will definitely stay here the next time I'm in Branson.   Fantastic!I'll start off with the service has been great here. However,  I've never stayed in a hotel room that didn't have a bath before. Weekend getaway (or attending a conference) without a bath seems...  pointless. Also, I was told they had wifi as an amenity, but find out after we get here that wifi is an extra charge. Never had to pay for Internet at a hotel before. And the room is a little cramped. The place was clean,  but I want to be able to work and rest at a hotel without issue. I couldn't do either here. Probably won't stay here again.Very nice hotel - clean facilities, great location. The front desk staff are not great. Very slow and inattentive. My daughter ran down to the desk to ask for another towel and they said they would send one up and it never happened. All in all, though, this is a fancy hotel at a reasonable price. Lots of bars.I have stayed in Branson multiple times, and this is the best hotel in the area. Just to clarify for HHonors people, there are TWO full-service Hiltons right next to each other.  The Hilton Promenade is older (but not old, it's circa 2007) and doubles as a time-share.  You can get suites there fairly easily.  But out of the two, I'd pick this property.  It is a super nice Hilton, with modern furnishings and it is connected to the convention center.The restaurant, Level 2, is also what you would expect for a higher end hotel.Don't expect your room to be correct or ready.  Telling me your cleaning staff is working hard is no excuse.  To think they might have some idea as to how many people would be showing up on a given night. If only a system for taking, I don't know, RESERVATIONS existed so they would have that info... Oh wait.  Oh and now two grown men and a toddler are sharing a one bed room. Yippy! Gonna make for a great nights sleep.Check in early for a 4 night stay with reservations that were made months in advance and being an honors member. Room selection they gave to me is next to the elevator and ice machine. No chances of moving they are sold out. Poor room management!Just got back. Absolutely loved this Hitlon and I was very impressed. Our room was on the 8th floor with a view of Branson Landing. Very spacious with a desk and an extra table that rolls out from under for extra use, a mini fridge and a couch that folded out.  The bathroom did not have a tub but a walk in shower. The bathroom amenities were high end and there was a make-up mirror hooked to the wall that i used every day. The outdoor pool was really nice, and there was a hot tub and some VERY nice outdoor lounges in a couch style. Very comfy. The indoor pool was nice but surprisingly cold. There is also a hot tub at the indoor pool.  We used the fitness center every day and it was great. We did the valet parking and it was great. It is so easy to just call down there and your car is ready for you when you get downstairs. A lot of people complained about paying for wi-fi and parking but this IS a convention center and most business would just charge these to their company. Both are standard for a conference facility.We had the breakfast in Level2. I did the continental for $13 and My Husband did the upgraded buffet. There is a menu and if you are not a big eater you are better off eating off the menu. I only did not give this hotel 5 stars because of the parking and the internet.Just returned from a 2-night getaway and would likely stay here again. Located across the street from the Branson Landing shopping area and downtown area made this a convenient location. The only downer were the nightly trains that woke me up. With the trains aside, I found the king bed with sofa unit perfect for my family of 3. The 20 feet high ceilings floor to ceiling windows allowed us to see the sunset each night...spectacular! The only drawback is Starbucks is across the street and the eating facilities were a bit too upscale for my nightly palate...I'm a pub and beer sort of level of spender. With that being said, this is the place to stay, away from the congestion of the Branson strip.This Hilton hotel is a fantastic hotel. The staff were very kind and friendly, and We were welcomed as A hilton honors member.  I had a king condo room, and it was a spectacular room. It was updated and spacious. It had a full bath with a big tub and a separate shower, the room also had a half bath. The room also contained a nice kitchenette. I would highly recommend this hotel.This is the best place in Branson to stay -especially if you don't want to drive.  Great rooms, wonderful staff and close to all the great things that go on in downtown!Stayed here about a week ago.  Very modern in an earthy way but overall a beautiful hotel.  Rooms are very high ceiling, which I didn't mind and thought was a different touch.  I was really impressed with the floor-to-ceiling windows in the room as well.  Service was great.  The restaurant was also really nice.  If you're staying in Branson, give this hotel a thought.I stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights. I was in town for a convention. The hotel double charged my credit card and it took an act of congress to correct it. During their attempt to correct the charge they added an additional 100 dollar charge to my card which I had to spend time getting off my card. One of the elevators did not work, which caused major delays in elevator traffic. The escalator in the convention only worked going down, the up side was out of order. Guests have to pay for wi-fi, which is ridiculous considering the cost of a room. Guests must also pay to park unless they want to park about a block away from the main entrance of the hotel. The staff was friendly. Rooms are comfortable but it is very difficult to regulate the temperature in the room. The meals provided at the convention were edible for the most part but not what I would eat if I had a choice. My steak was so red when it arrived I had to send it back. The lighting in the convention center was poor.what can i say other than outstanding this place was everything you can expect from a high class restaurant. great service im pretty sure our amazing waitor was what won me over food was expected to be awesome and it was i had the sirloin medium rare which was cooked to perfection with the steamed asparugus which was also awesome but for dessert the 7 layer chocolate cake was the best cake i have ever had and if the manager had not strongly suggested it i doubt i would have tried it but due to his strong enthusiasm i tried and fell in love with the cake and the restaurant i plan on coming back for the four times to get my signature steak knife for meMy family and I are there right now! It is SO clean and nice, there is a BIG Christmas tree in the lobby, there is also a pool! ( BRING A SWIMSUIT) You have to go! They have one inside and outside! They also have a gift shop, that's SO tiny, they have chips and that's really it! If your looking for a hotel, go to this one!",,,,,"['hotel', 'clean', 'room', 'nice', 'dessert', 'amazing', 'breakfast', 'buffets', 'delicious', 'convention', 'center', 'convention', 'goer',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/carriage-house-inn-branson,Carriage House Inn,4.5,$,8,"I loved this hotel. It's just outside the strip, by Mount Pleasant Winery...(Not a favorite place of mine). We arrived at 2:00, and even though check in is at 3, our room was ready.I requested a room on the ground, and we were delighted when there wasn't much walking from the room to the front area. There is a covered pool, but we didn't swim in it. The rooms are large, comfortable and very clean. The front staff were kind and helpful. The room had a microwave, refrigerator, 2 queen sized beds and a smallish bathroom with a tub and shower. There was a table and 2 chairs. Wifi was fast and just what I needed with my Ipad. A wall t.v., phone, etc. breakfast was between 6:30-9:30 I considered going to Billygails for breakfast, but chose to stay at the hotel instead. Breakfast was basic. Donuts, bagels, cereal, coffee/tea/juice, biscuits, gravy. I didn't eat the gravy...I don't eat much breakfast, so I don't base a hotel on breakfast. I didn't find the hotel old at all, it looked fresh, and I like the hotels off of the strip. I find them friendlier and cleaner. The hotel was lit up at night and looked like a gingerbread house. It was decorated for Christmas in Branson and I loved it. I'd stay here again.Stayed here for a weekend trip to Branson.  Rooms were clean and the staff was prompt and friends.This is a basic motel, it is located off of the strip so if you know the back roads this is great because you can avoid the strip traffic.  Within walking distance to the Stone Hill winery.The covered/indoor pool was nice since it rained much of our time in Branson.The breakfast is basic, but not bad.The only down point is the lack of channels for the TV.  They had nick and cartoon network, but no Disney, Food Network, or ESPN.Overall not bad, we would stay her again.We enjoyed our stay at the carriage house inn! The rooms were very clean, service very friendly and the price was great! We have a large family and needed two rooms. The staff was wonderful and got us adjoining rooms. The kids loved the pool. Our only complaint would be the amount of chlorine they use and that it's incredibly warm in the pool house with no real air flow, which is really no big deal though. The pool hours were also very nice and accommodating to most family itineraries. We would definitely stay here again!This place is fine. It's an old motel type place that's clean and taken care of. The reviews made me think it was the Taj Mahal or something. That it's not. We just needed a place to stay for the night that was cheap $60 not too bad with breakfast that's was just ehhhWe stayed here twice in July and it's a wonderful place. They take really good care of customers and we're planning another trip this monthVery nice for the price!  Nothing spectacular but if you're looking for an average motel room that is very clean (inside &amp; out), has comfortable beds, Wi-Fi, in- room microwave, refrigerator, coffee maker, table &amp; chairs &amp; serves breakfast, this is your place!  We did not eat breakfast here because I'm a meat &amp; eggs girl &amp; they didn't have that (but think they have the usual fare of everything else though) but we we're offered 2 coupons for a $4.99 breakfast buffet of everything at a nearby cafe' which was great!    Only cons: only about 20 TV channels and no in-room ESPN ( apparently they have ESPN on a 55"" TV in the lobby, but I don't think they would have appreciated my husband watching it at night in his underwear, so no ESPN for him) and I have hip problems so making it up the steps to the lobby was difficult, but they were very willing to work with us on room location to accommodate our needs for my medical equipment.  Very nice ppl &amp; easy to work with!  5 star for the price!My only complaint about the Carriage House Inn was that I had to leave. My trip ended and I didn't want to go home. This place is amazing.First of all this place is as clean as you can get. Our room was so nice and clean and spacious. We had a fridge and microwave in our room which was very helpful. The cleaning staff took care of our room on our time, whenever it was convenient for us. The owner of the motel runs the breakfast room. He makes sure everyone knows where everything is, and really makes an effort to get to know all of his guests. By the time we left I felt like we'd been friends with him for a long time. Get ready to have a good time with him...he's one of the friendliest men there is!There are I Love Lucy videos playing in the breakfast room in the afternoon in case you want a break from your room and would like to watch something on TV. He also has movies he'll put in for you.Breakfast was good...he's got a lady that makes the donuts for him, but don't ask for anything specific. She makes what she wants to make and that's that. (I'm sure you'll hear that story) :) He's also got Tropical Fruit, biscuits and gravy, breads of all assortments for toast, juices, coffee, milk...I think I'm missing something, but it was all really good.They also have trays at the breakfast room to make it easier to take coffee back to your room or whatever you want. My dad would go up every morning and get coffee for everyone and there would be Bob meeting him with a tray and a smile at the door. The trays are always washed when they are brought back to the breakfast room. I watched as he made sure everything was clean as it was put back out for the next person.The pool was nice and warm...the only thing is you have to walk outside to get there and we were there in April when it was pretty chilly...so it was a cold walk back to our room. But that's no big deal. Pool is open nice and late so you can go after a show if you want to. 11:30 I think it was. But there is no clock in the pool room...so you better take a watch or something to keep track of time. There were a few pool toys there when we were there if the kids want to play with a ball or something.They were also nice enough to let me print my tickets for the Wax Museum at the desk because it's cheaper when you buy online than when you purchase at the door. They had trouble with their printer, but they got it fixed and were as helpful as could be at getting those tickets printed for me.The whole inn is so well taken care of and landscaped so beautifully. Flowers hanging on the nice white porch. Sitting areas outside. Beautiful. I felt so comfortable there. It really was like a home away from home. I will go back as often as possible.Great job Bob and Linda!! Can't wait to come back and see you again soon!!Comfy beds, clean rooms, friendly service, fast wifi service, and convenient location for a lot less expense than the chain properties. I'd definitely stay there again. This was my first trip to Branson and I booked based the other review and was not at all sorry.  Sam was very helpful in making my reservation and recommending events and getting tickets for those events. I didn't endulge in the pool, but it certainly was inviting. The free breakfast was nothing special, but FRESH.",,,,,"['loved', 'hotel', 'outside', 'strip', 'mount', 'pleasant', 'winery', 'favorite', 'place', 'mine', 'arrived', 'though', 'check', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/welk-resort-branson-branson,Welk Resort Branson,3.5,$$,20,"For those that follow me may remember my review of this property several years ago.  Since then, it seems, the ownership has invested in this property and gave it a much needed face lift.  The lobby is more modern than it was,  and the rooms are not so Super 8ish as they once were.  They now have a fridge, flat tv, and pretty decent wifi (when it actually worked -- more on that later).  Checking in, I learned how Expedia works in regards to your reservation.  I had assumed, as I'm sure most of you do, that once you place your reservation, you are in the system and good to go.  Not quite.  Upon making your reservation, the property gets an email with all the details as well as where you are paying (Expedia or the property itself).  The front desk (or whoever else) has to input the reservation manually into the system.  I speak of this because this caused the only issue of my stay.  Arriving around 1, I waited in the check in line for a good 10 minutes behind a lady who seemed to have an endless line of questions that had she read the literature provided by the front desk clerk could have had 99% of them answered i'm sure, but I digress.  I finally get to the check in desk and my reservation was not in the system.  We spent a good 5 minutes going around and around about how I was sure I booked the correct dates, etc.  I finally went back out the the car and got my reservation print out (my phone was in the car too) and got back in the check in line.  10 more minutes or so goes by and I'm finally at the desk again.  This time, the clerk realizes what had happened and runs back to the back and sure enough, my reservation is still in the inbox -- someone on the overnight shift didn't input the reservations.After check in, we got to our room which was a lot better than I remembered.  Like I said above, it no longer has the Super8 feel to it and more of a modern business hotel.  Unlike last time, we decided to visit the splashitorium as the kids have been begging to swim for months now.  So I suit up and walk over to the complex (it's across the parking lot from the lobby) and was surprised at what it was.  The website and most tourist sites sell this as some water park.  Yes, there is a water slide and that's about it.  The pool is an indoor - outdoor setup which is pretty neat the way they have it laid out.  There are two hot tubs (one in and one out) and a splash area with sprinklers and waterfalls for the super small.  There are staff on site who coordinate activities and on the night we were there, they were showing a movie outside while people swam.  I let the kids swim for a few hours before rounding them up for dinner.  Of course, after dinner, we returned for a few more hours of water play.Finally the kids are worn out and we return to the room.  The beds are comfortable enough -- not too hard, not too soft and the only issue with the room we had was the AC would not heat up.  It was perpetually on 71.  The next day, I took the kids out to the playground, but the path was blocked by a scale replica of the Vietnam Vet Memorial in DC, so we had to detour a bit -- no big deal.  The mini golf is more like old-school putt putt than the courses you see around town, so if you are a mini golf fan, go play off-site.We skipped breakfast this time around because the last time we were here the $8 price tag for frozen and reconstituted food was a little much for the taste.  Check out at the Welk is at 10 am -- pretty early, but being as the pool and everything opens at 10, it makes sense.  Both of my kids like this property -- mainly because of the splashitorium -- so we will stay here again..  The rooms are ok, but while now better than a super 8, there isn't much to separate this place from the Ramada or Fairfield Inn down the road -- that is unless you like the water park feature or the on-site theater.The Welk Resort in Branson, MO took $3000 dollars out of our account after we canceled getting a time share and promised to give it back but its been over a month and they will not answer our calls or emails and we are still out the money for nothing....very upset I believe they should be put under investigation.  Has anyone else dealt with a similar experience with them?  Advice on what to do next would be helpful.After out tour with Welks in Branson I wonder why anyone would want to pay $41,000 plus $1,200 per year HOA fees??!! They pressure you and run over their tour time.. We walked out after requesting our 'free' cruise.. Oh yea they forgot to say you will pay approx. $400 in fees and taxes. We stayed in their hotel which was old, horrible bed and the electrical plugs were so loose I couldn't use them. Totally not worth it!Staff were nice. Clean rooms but just not worth the money. I could tell the building was older and they tried to renovate it. Rooms were small, wifi was HORRIBLE, and the resort isn't a ""nice"" resort. The all you eat breakfast buffet wasn't great. The mini golf was dirty. Just an okay place to stay.A great place to stay with kids! The indoor water park isn't big, but it's impeccably clean and has lots for little ones. We visited in the winter, and will be back in summer when the outdoor water doo-dads can be explored. Friendliest staff in Branson, with huge, clean, fresh rooms.A great place for a family trip to Branson. Just dr enough off the main jog (about 5 miles) to be peaceful and close enough the kids don't get antsy driving in to town. Hotel is newly renovated in June 2013 and is gorgeous. Splashatorium is great for kids of all ages and the stuff t the hotel is wonderful and friendly. Only draw back is them wanting to take you on time share tours. Just say no and they back off.WONDERFUL TRIP WITH KIDS. Mine are 7,5,2 1/2.This is a nice looking resort with very attractive units. DO NOT MISTAKE the resort for the hotel that is also on property (which is currently under major renovation).  We came here to view a time share presentation and really like this property. The Welks family is the same as the legendary singer Lawrence Welk.. .who believed high quality affordable family vacations should not be just for the super rich.I've stated this in other reviews, but it's worthy of repeating. If you are a person who sees the value of couponing or saving money in any way... you should consider attending a time share meeting during your vacation. It can save you a great deal of money AND show you other resort options for your next trip.This vacation, we attended two different resort presentations (one here @ Welk Resort) and here's what we got: *4 tickets to The Price is Right Live ($35 value for adult tickets)*$50 gift certificates to the famous Lambert's Cafe restaurant (see review) and *$120 off 4 tickets to Silver Dollar City theme park.  That's a savings of $240 for about 4 hours of our time. We also received pool passes for their resort pool, even though we are not guests at this resort.  WHY SHOULD YOU ATTEND?Companies spend billions of dollars in advertising to get you in the door. The more popular the advertising media, the more astronomical the advertising cost. Why? Because their product is likely to be seen by more viewers. Time share presentations just take that advertising money and give it to you directly because you are more likely to buy this type of product in person than through some TV ad. They know the chances of most people who will buy during a presentation are around 1 in 8, but those are better odds than other advertising would bring... and YOU get the benefits! I'm trying to open your eyes here that it's not a waste of time to attend, especially if you can say this easy word - ""NO!"" or ""Yes"" if you see the value. Not all time shares are equal, but Welk Resort is definitely one of the best values we've seen. Our time share (with a different resort) has worked very well for us and we love it! We often use RCI to take advantage of last minute getaways for as low as $199 for the week! Our vacation to Branson was an extra getaway week for $249. That's less than $36 a night for 2 bedrooms, 2 baths w/ full kitchen/dining, huge balcony and 3 tv's. You can't get a room @ Red Roof Inn for that price.--------------- - - - -I'm not in any way employed with this or ANY resort. My niche on yelp is being a father who likes to share how our family does adventures. It's my desire to show families how to save money and still have a FABULOUS vacation... and I won't steer you wrong!We stayed here 4 nights with the kids.  The kids thought it was a 5 star resort, with a great pool area, mini golf, fishing on property.  It's not upscaled at all, but it has everything you would need.  Our room smelled kind of funky, but no big deal.  The concierge is a joke.  We spent over $1000 on shows while we were there, and they refused to help us book anything unless we took the time share tour.  That was frustrating, so we had to book everything on our own, but the other staff were great!  I might stay here again, or we might try somewhere else.  It's one of those places.  Good, not great.The lodges are wonderful:+ Jacuzzi in the bedroom. + Super huge showers with rain shower head. + Tons of storage space+ Great patio with rocking chairs and outdoor dining area+ Double fireplacesExtra Perks:+ Small mini golf course for a quick (and free) round of fun.+ Great pool play area for the kids+ Awesome line-up of family activities everyday of the week+ Can purchase Silver Dollar City tickets for a special rate (2 days for the price of 1)Our family of four stayed 2 nights over New Year's Eve. We stayed in a 3rd floor room with two queen beds. Pros: The staff was very friendly. The room was very CLEAN! Beds are comfy. Shower was hot with great water pressure. The Splashatorium was very nice. The kids loved the slide and water play area. It was very cold outside while we were there but nice and warm inside. Hot tub was large and hot. Nice large locker room. Fitness center was decent. You can get a full workout done there. Yummy free coffee in the lobby in the morning. Nice secluded location. Cons: I'm not sure if the beds are true queens, felt more like fulls. The rooms are small, with our 3 small carry on type suitcases there was no room to put anything except on the table and chair. Fridge was on high and never got cold. Beware, the walls are paper thin here. If you sleep light at all, stay somewhere else. We had a fan on for noise and could still hear ever conversation in the hallway, every footstep and every door open and slam shut. Since we were on the 3rd floor the noise from the people above was unbelievable. I'm sure they were just waking but you hear every single step. Some of it shook our room. Needless to say I got no sleep!The breakfast is so-so. We eat very healthy and so there were no options for us. Some pineapple and that's it. No oatmeal, yogurt, wheat bread, egg whites, skim milk, 1%, or fruit choices. Lots of white bread, bagels, bacon, biscuits, waffles, pancakes, gravy, etc. I guess that's the norm around here. So we wasted the $28 on breakfast here. Lesson learned. Although we loved the location, the pool, and the cleanliness and the excellent price of $79 a night, we won't return to this hotel due to room size and paper thin walls.Just did a 4 night stay at the Lodges.  We loved it.  We stayed in a one bedroom villa with my wife and two kids.  The kids slept on the pull out couch and we had the master bedroom.  The fire places were wonderful, the view was great and we loved the decor.  We all really enjoyed the Splashatorium.  Some of the mini golf holes are impossibly difficult, though.The market at the front desk doesn't have much.  We did our shopping at Country Mart and Wal-Mart.  We needed some cookie oil to make blueberry muffins, and forgot to grab it at the store.  Turns out, that pantry store at the shell where Champagne Blvd meets the highway sells it, and a lot more.We bought with Welk at their Escondido property in California, and can't wait to visit Branson again.A note to parents about the Splashatorium:  If you child wears diapers, they do not allow Little Swimmers.  They require Swimsters (if you can find them.)  If you can't find them, no worries, they sell them right there at the concessions stand inside the splashatorium.  They do not sell them at the market at the front desk.Fun times till be had by all.  We didn't actually stay at the resort we went to the Price is Right Live show.  It was really a neat show.  For sure a must see.They give away real prizes and the audience is encourage to play along like they do on TV. It is a little bit different than the one on TV but you actually play Plinko and the mountain man and hole in one.So on your next trip to Branson make this a to do list for the whole family.This review is for the resort lodge, not the main hotel.  I'm not an ""owner,"" but a free-rider : -) who was invited to share the other side of a lock out with a timeshare owner in our family.Log cabin styled in the three story units, the decor was classic Branson lodge (similar to the condos at Big Cedar and Thousand Hills).  It was a serene, pretty setting back in the hills amongst the trees containing still just a hint of red this time of year (Veteran's Day weekend). Terrific walkout balconies with adirondack chairs. Wished we'd spent more time out there, if weren't so tired from rocking out to Daniel O'Donnell.  Rooms were well-designed, central bathroom, pull out sofas, kitchenette containing all the essentials.  Bathroom on the ""master"" side of the lockout was impressive with a fireplace overlooking a bathtub (separate monster shower with 3 sprayers include rainforest).  Cannot speak to price, but we were very comfortable.  Resort side is nice.Older resort but has been remodeled.  Very cozy, comfy room!  Everyone was so nice, we will be back:)The place seems ok, I stayed in the hotel part and have two complaints. One is the pool is detached from everything else so if it's cold out have fun walking back wet. And second check out is at check in at 4:00 and check out at 10:00 a.m. So hurry up and get out! Can't even get up, workout,shower eat and leave?Update to 12/11/2013 review.  Spoke with the ""Quality Assurance Manager early in January about the $175 overcharge for our stay in Destin, he said he would check for us and get right back.  It's February 8 now.....still no word.  We did complete the sale of our unit prior to Jan. 1, so did not have to pay maintenance fee of $819.00.  Sale price was, indeed, $1.00.We came to Welk on a trade through Interval.  Beware all time share owners the photos of the room on the interval site is only available if you PAY ADDITIONAL $ 40.00 per night......very deceptive !  They assume you won't bring your conformation and when you do they tell you it was a mistake by interval...  When you complain the management tells you to call interval to ask to be moved to another time share.   Restaurant was dead empty when we were there and the gift shop is only open when there is a show.  Wanted to use spa tub but that too was closed.    Front desk has no clue how to get around town.  We asked about food and all the front desk could offer was pizza....  There are lots of options but they hire teenagers and they only know about teenager likes and dislikes.Welk Management is a problem......all Welk resorts.My family and I travel to Brandon once a year and try to make sure we get a good hotel since we stay 3 to 5 nights. When booking a hotel we look for a large in door pool area that is very kid friendly. We also want to make sure we have access to the Internet and good TV service for our down time. Customer service was great and everyone we came across was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Rooms are kept very clean. My family really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend this resort to anyone, especially with kids.We just checked into the room. Unlike the other reviewer we received a fridge in our room but only at request for medicine and baby milk. The staff was very friendly and accommodated us quickly. The room was clean and had ample space. Free wifi was nice and a flat screen tv with all needed inputs. The food was just ok. There's was no microwave in the room.We saw the stage show of The Price is Right in it's first show back for the 2013 season. We were fairly impressed with the authenticity of the show. If you haven't seen the traveling show before, be sure to know that there are some changes from the regular show. Their goal is to get as many people playing as possible, so the four players on contestant's row only get to bid on one item. The winner gets to play the main game; the three losers get a t-shirt. Then, they call up four new players for the next round. They also get three new players to spin the wheel and two new players for the showcase showdown (only bidding on one showcase). Prizes are cheaper than the TV show; however, the one showcase we saw did include a car and a trip, so that's good. As far as the show itself, prices were much lower than what you'd expect, so hardly anyone won anything...i.e., just about everyone overbid. After the show, you can go up on stage and spin the big wheel, which we did, and get pics with the guest host and others. For anyone who has grown up with the show, it was a neat thing to see, but it's important to go in with realistic expectations of what you're going to see.",,,,,"['follow', 'remember', 'review',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/grand-victorian-branson,Grand Victorian,2.0,$$,6,"This hotel for us was ""free"" because of points accumulated on a card of ours. The entrance and driving up to it was pretty neat. Nice big signs.. cool old school 1800's era type building. But once you go inside, you feel the effort to keep a somewhat ""victorian"" vibe was barely even there.It's dated, and not even in a purposeful way. Morning staff was ok, afternoon staff seemed decent, so no real experience with rudeness. The breakfast was pretty terrible. Watery eggs, and then just really nothing else... Rooms were clean, but musty smelling. Every room had a little porch which was cool. But besides that, nothing to great to tell about.Pros:Rooms were clean, cool. Indoor swimming pool was actually pretty decent. Cons:Dated, haphazard breakfast and overall feel. In the end, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone staying in Branson. I mean, there's worse hotels, but this isn't worth it if you can afford another place.The rooms are big and clean and extremely gorgeous .The other reviews are insane . Yes the Internet doesn't work but the hotel is lovely .The price isn't the cheapest but you get a nice room and a porch to sit and look out . The bathroom is oddly shaped and the toilet is really loud . The staff is very friendly and polite .In my opinion I think you could get the same quality room at a super 8 or somewhere like that for a lot less .I'm giving Hotel Grand Victorian two stars for decor, location &amp; size of the room. The building on the outside is like you're staying at a grand plantation house. It is absolutely gorgeous. The inside is just as grand. There's  a seating area in the lobby with a grand piano. Then a curved staircase that leads you upstairs to the commons area. In the commons area there is a self serve coffee spot. A perfect place to catch up with new found friends or family. The hotel offers two pools; one inside and then another outside, same with hot tubsSadly,their hospitality is lacking the victorian charm. The complementary breakfast was awful. We found ants in our room. We told the front desk they acted more put out that they had to send someone to spray our room. They did not offer us a new room. By the end of our stay those ants were in our bed. Never again!There is nothing GRAND about the Hotel Grand Victorian. The front desk staff are RUDE, the free breakfast is disgusting, and the parking lot is built on the side of a hill. If I hadn't prepaid for 3 nights in this hotel I would have left as soon as I stepped inside of it. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. And to top it all off, the wifi didn't work the entire time we stayed there.We just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel.  We chose it based on price, location (though we had never been to Branson and weren't entirely sure what was a ""good"" location), and positive reviews on a well-known travel website.  We were specifically looking for a hotel with breakfast, WiFi, and a fitness room.  When we arrived late in the afternoon, the front desk person was decent, though not overly friendly.  Our room was a double queen on the 5th floor- it was nice enough, but somewhat worn and outdated.  The bathroom is VERY small and awkwardly laid out- it worked ok for us, but anyone with a larger build or mobility issues would really have a hard time.  Most hotels have a binder/book in the rooms containing information such as hours and rules for the pool and fitness center, breakfast times, how to connect to WiFi, etc.  There was nothing like this in the room, which was slightly annoying.  Right when we arrived my fiance went down to use the fitness room and I was planning to go online and figure out a place to go for dinner.  This was a terrible plan because, as a previous reviewer noted, the WiFi does not actually work.  In fact, it did not work for the entire time we were there.  And within a few minutes, my fiance was back in the room, unable to work out because the treadmill in the fitness room was broken (and to clarify, the ""fitness room"" is really just a small room with 3 old broken down machines and a really old tv).  So within 30 minutes of getting there, we were already pretty disappointed.  The next morning we went down to breakfast- we found it to be ok for a free breakfast, but nothing special.  The coffee was especially horrible, and there were no bagels, yogurt, or fruit (other than canned).  When we got back to the room to get ready for the day, we discovered that the hair dryer in the room was completely useless.  It puts out warm air, but no power, so it does nothing to actually dry your hair.  So I had to go three days with damp, air dried hair.  Luckily it was not colder outside or this would have been a bigger problem.  Other issues we encountered were that the TV in the room was poor quality and the top of the picture was cut off (not a huge deal since we weren't there to watch TV, but a minor annoyance), the sheets on the beds are poor quality, and the beds themselves are not very comfortable.Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel.  It's ok if you are looking for just a really basic place to sleep, but if you want actual amenities, you would want to stay somewhere else.Some of the front desk staff were rude.  No follow-through on requesting a room to be cleaned.  Several areas within the hotel need updated / maintenance.  The breakfast was not very impressive.  Bathroom was a bit too small.  I don't recommend this hotel.",,,,,"['hotel', 'free', 'points', 'accumulated', 'card', 'entrance', 'driving', 'pretty', 'neat', 'nice', 'big', 'signs', 'cool', 'old', 'school', '1800', 'era', 'type',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/wyndham-branson-at-the-meadows-branson,Wyndham Branson at The Meadows,3.0,$$$,7,"My husband and I are members of RCI and decided to take advantage of RCI's extra vacation program. The program allows you to buy a week at an RCI affiliated resort for a huge discount (sometimes as low as half the original price) without trading in the weeks you own. The only caveat is that the extra vacations consist of weeks in places that aren't typically in high demand (because they're in low demand locations and/or because of the time of year). Given that we live within a 6 hour radius, we decided to try a week at Wyndham Branson at The Meadows. I'm really glad we did.First, I found the staff to be really friendly and helpful. They made us aware of discounted attraction tickets they have for guests. They also provided me with a free toothbrush once I realized I forgot mine. In terms of the quality of the room, I was really surprised with what I found. We stayed in a one bedroom deluxe suite with a jacuzzi tub. The tub was probably one of the biggest tubs I've seen in a vacation rental. The suite itself was pretty up-to-date. There were marble countertops and silver fixtures throughout the rental. The place itself was also really clean and pretty spacious (about 1000 square feet). I also agree with a previous reviewer that the bed was comfortable yet firm....which made it hard to get up in the morning :). In addition to a great bed, the unit had a pretty big kitchen, a pull-out couch, a washer and dryer, two televisions, a blu-ray player, and free wifi. In terms of location, I think this place is perfect. The location is secluded enough that you're away from a lot of the craziness that is Branson. At the same time, It is only 5-10 minutes from most attractions. Finally, there seemed to be a lot to do on site. They have free activities each day (e.g., movies, games, makeovers, etc.), swimming pools, and a gym. They also invite performers to the site about 4-5 times each week. The performances include a buffet (with beer and wine) and are only $15 a person. We took advantage of this one evening and saw a group of illusionists. I thought the illusionists were pretty good, and we were able to drink wine and eat as many tacos as we wanted. Not bad for $15 in my opinion.  In sum, definitely a place I would return to in the future.Just finished staying here for a week when our grandmother slipped and fell in the ladies changing room at the pool. The floor was wet and she fell and broke her hip on her 72nd birthday. Michael the night manager was nice the day of the accident but when we asked to stay longer while our grandmother was in the hospital they wouldn't comp our rooms or give us the option to stay. They refused to accept any responsibility when she fell and broke her hip on there property. I would never recommend staying here. The management is a shame.Con - You hear everything that goes on in the rooms above, below, and next to you.  If they get up real early, so do you.  We stayed for two weeks, but my wife had to call three times to get our room cleaned and get fresh towels.  The pools are not heated, so unless it is really hot outside, they are very cold.  Pro - Friendly staff and they keep the grounds very clean.I would rate them higher but the resort is too cheap to provide decent wifi.  If you have any business to do and need wifi, this is not the place.Spacious rooms,  cable, poor to fair WiFi,  say no to the high pressure sales  tactics, don't fall for the free breakfast. "" I'll make my own breakfast,  thank you"". Thin  walls,  wash your own towels.  All soaps provided for shower, washing clothes, dishes  ect...will be back!We are Owners  we had a 3 bedroom 2 bath it was easy check in and staff very accommodating but hate every time we or our family stays we get high pressure sales people. However, we always find our rooms awesomeNice resort.  I liked the location, it was out a couple miles from the main strip so quiet but easy to get to and from.  The room was really nice we just had a one bedroom.  The layout was a little strange with the giant jetted tub the the bedroom and a sink with no door, yet connected to the regular bathroom with a shower by a door?  The bed was a really amazing King size and so perfect in firmness and the bedding was nice.  The pull out sofa had a really thick nice mattress.  I really liked the textures flooring in the bathroom.  The kitchen was nice, we didn't really use it but It was nice to have.  Didn't get a chance to do laundry but  nice to have available.  At night we had to park a little further away but the gold cart shuttles were readily available.  It's a fairly small resort so not sure how terribly far you could get from your room.  We didn't have a chance to take advantage of the pools or activities maybe next time.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/stone-castle-hotel-and-conference-center-branson,Stone Castle Hotel & Conference Center,3.0,$$,13,"It's got everything you need with a few extras (indoor pool, free breakfast). We had our family Christmas party here. We rented several rooms and a conference hall. I can't imagine a better value for you money in Branson. The staff was incredibly accommodating...especially after several changes. Thank you Stone Castle for a Christmas to remember.This place was fine for the price. Our room was comfortable enough for my husband and I to get a good nights sleep. Bed seemed fine, bedding and room seemed clean and so was the bathroom. We did not partake in the breakfast because it ended at 9:30 (a bit early in my opinion, especially if I'm on vacation). My only complaint is that the shower had very poor water pressure. Not a very satisfying shower.We got the aloha room pretty excited to stay we don't get to travel often it was our first time staying there  our sheets where dirty  our room had mold on the cealing and the patio faced rooks than we found a lovely note Goin over charges if guest steal like I payed over$  100 to stay in the hotel and they left a.  notes on what everything   cost smh im not a  thef just a honeymooner lmao I will never stay here again not to mention the bathroom door didn't even close all the way more or less lockSorry but rooms are really small.  And shower seems like your going to fall through the floor.  I guess you get what you paid for.  Rooms just need upgrading.  We got this room through Branson Tourism and we will never do that again.  Go with yelp reviews next time.It's cheap so that's a plus, however, I would pay more for higher quality and comfort. The bed is rock hard and a queen size which is strange when most hotels with single beds have king size. The floors are thin so you here everything going on upstairs. Our heater is so loud we couldn't even sleep with it on. The free breakfast is decent but it feels like a high school cafeteria or mess hall and is so loud and smells a little rank. We also asked the man up front what there was to do in Branson for fun and he replied, ""go home."" That was super helpful, not.Overall, I'll pick somewhere else next time.The breakfast was decent...eggs, sausage, biscuits &amp; gravy along with the rest of the continental foods.  The rooms though. The beds suck. The pillows are lumpy. The bathroom is super tiny with low shower water pressure. So small you gotta step into the bath tub to close the door. There is so much moisture in the air in the rooms. The tv stand &amp; night stands are sticky on top because of it. Smells like mold. The carpet feel moist. The papers in the room have that flimsy moist feel. Moist &amp; moldy smelling, Not my kind of sleeping atmosphere. The pools chlorine is out of control strong- burns your eyes when you step into the pool room. The location was perfect, close to everything in town. Short walk to late night yogurt.Also hotel hasn't been updated in ages! If you get here before actual check in time, they will not hold your bags. Says it's not their responsibility. No fun dragging around heavy suitcases on a walk to grab lunch. Not ideal. Wi-fi is super slow.Stone Castle is the only place in Branson I recommend to friends and family when coming to Branson. Great breakfast buffet included and very close to everything so my relatives are always pleased. They recently updated the rooms with new pillows, bedding and fridges in every room and the price is really hard to beat.We booked a room at Stone Castle for a softball tournament. Stone Castle is not a costumer service hotel! We called several days ahead to reserve a refrigerator and was told one was reserved, also informed them we would be a late check in. Arrived no refrigerator, was told first come first serve. It would have been nice to know they do not honor their reservations before we brought food. 6 ball games one washer one dryer for three buildings! Out of order second day!!!!! Three floors of rooms 1 antique ice maker unable to keep up. Price was reasonable but it's apparent the hotel owner is not using the money to keep the hotel up. Outdated, dirty, and poor costumer service. Overpriced for for "" breakfast, laundry facilities, and room""! Do yourself a favor find somewhere else to stay!You get what you pay for. Great for a family trying to save money. Very small rooms, bed uncomfortable, dust on bed head board, hear neighbors' noise, children running up and down the hall, etc.This is a great place to stay given the price and the competitive surrounding places prices. It does have a swimming pool, gift shop, and they serve a hot breakfast in the morning buffet style. The only thing that was off was our air conditioner. It would stay on lol It would turn off and on. I know that this only happened in our room specifically though because my friend, who was next door, hers worked just fine. It is only one room, no biggy! If I go to Branson I want to stay here again for sure. It is also out of the way from the city so to say. You get at least a feeling of slight privacy, but close enough to take a small walk to the strip.We stayed here last weekend.  Not bad.  A nice breakfast buffet.  Room was clean &amp; seemed well maintained.  Didn't hear anything from the next rooms, but there was some noise from the halls.  Very nice area between two of the buildings with a little gazebo &amp; a waterfall.  WiFi seemed a bit slow.This hotel wasn't the worst. Clean rooms. Freshly painted pool area. Friendly staff. Only issue was a faulty plug by the sink. And a very dirty breakfast area.Great hotel for the money. Everything is very clean and the beds are comfortable. There is a decent breakfast in the morning although a little fruit would be nice. The rooms are small but nicely decorated and we didn't mind because we're out most of the time anyway.",,,,,"['everything', 'need', 'extras', 'indoor', 'pool', 'free', 'breakfast', 'family', 'party',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/wyndham-branson-at-the-falls-branson,Wyndham Branson at The Falls,4.0,$$$,8,"We stayed here last week in an upstairs unit. Wow were we impressed with everything! Lots of space and convenience. WE ARE ORDERING THEIR EXACT PILLOWS AND BEDS!!! I have never slept so good. I just had back surgery last August of 2014 and I thought I could never get comfortable in bed... Well, after sleeping on their beds with the luxurious pillows from heaven, I know I can sleep better. We found the place online to order them.We want to go back.Even with the construction of the other units across and below us it was still quiet and we got good sleep.Had WiFi... Was a bit lag at times but mostly pretty quick. Have to keep re-entering password but overall good.They have a nice pool below us, nothing extravagant but it was quiet and peaceful.Jacuzzi tubs were awesome.We are going to contact Wyndham and tell them how amazing everyone treated us too. They kept asking us if everything was okay. If we needed anything. To help with luggage. More shampoos, towels etc. Just loved it! Kinda felt like royalty!GO STAY HERE! You won't regret it. Try and get an upstairs unit.The units and grounds are showing thier age. All of the personnel were friendly and helpful. The business center has 3 computers, but only one capable of printing? Come on, I could get one of the 15 year old kids to network this better.Stayed here for a week.   Great resort amenities, large rooms and better room service all situated close to the strip.  Recommended and will stay again.Peaceful location , bed is comfortable . The kitchen needs to be updated, and it's small , but that's okay . Nice big tvs and great staff.  We are owners and love knowing we will almost always get a great condo thanks to Wyndham .Nice and quiet , close to most everything, spacious, very clean although all they have for amenities are an outdoor pool and ice maker, if you want anything else you have to go the Meadows location, over all good experience.Today my family and I went to Wyndham Resorts to be pitched on the benefits of owning points with this resort and purchasing vacations for the future.  I must say having not been to a time share presentation in over 10 years I thought I could handle it.  Amber our sales agent was new to this business and quite honestly did NOT know how to sell to me.  Granted I wasn't going to purchase the product anyway I thought I should post on Yelp so my fellow Yelpers know what to be aware of before going:1)  She did not listen to me-She asked questions, did not hear my answers and then tried to find other ways to ask the SAME question2)  When I finally got tired of answering the same question several times.  I told her that I didn't want to continue to answer that particular question and she said I was ""being rude"".  Mind you this was in front of my 3, 6 and 9 year old and wife.  If I was being rude, she should have taken me aside and spoken to me a little bit more professionally.3)  After the ""rude"" comment I took off my name tag, told her the presentation was over and her exact comment was, ""well you're not Wyndham material anyway"".  My kids and wife were upset and so was I.  They told me that I should apologize to Amber, which I did and we left.  BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU CAN'T ADJUST YOUR SALES PITCH TO FIT YOUR CUSTOMERS, DON'T INSULT THEM OR CALL THEM RUDE, ESPECIALLY NOT IN FRONT OF THEIR FAMILY.  Good luck Amber-Perfection in a vacation condo. No complaints - none. A friend of a friend has a time share and sub-lets it out for her cost (which is less than a night in a hotel). Each condo has absolutely everything you need to play house for a few days or a week. Staff is extremely caring. While writing this, the door bell rang and a staff member was delivering cookies! This morning, they brought me a newspaper (Sunday edition) without me asking. Upgraded us for no extra charge when we asked for a 1 bedroom and all they had was two. Clean, nicely decorated, and within easy driving distance of most of Branson. I can't say enough good things about this place. Check it out!Very pretty place to stay.  Rooms are exceptionally clean.  Grounds are pretty and well kept.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-branson-on-the-strip-branson,La Quinta Inn Branson on the Strip,3.5,$$,14,"Had a wonderful stay! Staff were very friendly and pleasant. My 2 huge dogs were welcomed without any question. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was better than most I have had. Will definitely stay here again.Rates worst out of our LaQuinta stays.They called to ask if the room was acceptable, we said yes. Then we noticed...  Cereal all over floor from previous guest.Springs in pull out was basically WIRE, and cut one of my kids. (After I bulked it up with anything and everything we could find)Sheets that looked wrinkled from someone sleeping were folded in pullout couch ( not fold wrinkles)And that was all the extra bedding in the room.Water spots on ceiling, cracked floor tiles, rusty shells in bathroom, towels with the seams frayed.  Family room with exterior entrance was convenient. View of pool, nice Pool smelled like bleach (clean) lolAnd larger than many hotel pool areasBreakfast wasn't too bad for free hotel food.Desk clerks nice, friendly, informative, knowledgeable of local shows, Parking ""lots and lots"" Price to sleep 8 was nice (family room) had the foldout mattress been replaced. Owner needs to budget some money for remodelingLiterally BY FAR..one of the best la quintas I've ever stayed at...and I'm a 10 year elite member!! I mean the pool...AMAZING ...highly sanitary (take shower as soon you you get out) and beautiful,indoor,a whirlpool to DIE FOR! Extremely clean!! the people at the front desk were beyond exceptional. Friendly,and unlike the horror at Manhattan la Quinta ...accommodating to my status that I have paid so much for.ELITE MEMBERS Rejoice! The rooms are newly remodeled although a few things need updating...who cares when you are in a safe environment,plenty of parking ....all non smoking. I felt safe with my children.and they even gave us ideas on the best attractions...you can purchase tickets to anything at the front desk instead of running around trying to find tickets..thank you la Quinta for this locationRecycled property. Exterior appearance different. Caution local traffic is slow. Friendly staff. Great greeting. Pricing &amp; value comparable with locals. King good size. Updated interior. Ok. WiFi works. Give it a try. First time to BransonThis is our second stay at the Branson LQI. We have stayed at several other LQI's as well. This one is not as nice or inexpensive as those properties, but it is often fully booked, as it was this weekend.We stay here because it meets the needs of our whole family better than any one hotel we have found so far in Branson. Believe me, we have been here many times and stayed in many other hotels. I might not like chain restaurants, but I do like chain hotels because I want to know exactly what I'm getting each and every time.The room we chose this time overlooked the pool, which my son and his friend greatly enjoyed. The pool and hot tub were nice to relax in on our little getaway, and the 3-story waterfall is a lovely feature. The sound is relaxing, too, and can even be heard in the rooms. They turn it off and dim the lights in that area when the pool closes at 11:00 p.m.The #1 reason we choose to stay here is because of the pet-friendly policy of the LQI company. I can take my dog anywhere on property (except the pool or breakfast room, of course) and keep her at no extra charge. If I want to bring her in the lobby and enjoy a cup of coffee, or walk her down the hallway, that is my guest privilege. I enjoy having her with me and feeling welcome. Since our last stay they have added little ""stands"" of doggie doo pick-up bags in the sodded areas to make it easy for people to pick up after their dogs. A welcome addition! Not long after we arrived, one of the front desk attendants asked my permission to take her photo for FB. If you don't like dogs or the idea of them staying in the rooms, LQI may not be the right choice for you.Our room was clean, comfortable, and in good repair. We enjoyed the free WIFI on our phones and laptop and my son enjoyed the computer in the lobby.The grade of room we chose was listed to have a microwave and mini-fridge on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flq.com&amp;s=ae994a2f4c58843ed4bc47c03af1ee63935b689b4c59ab421d7481cd4300c62e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">lq.com</a> . Neither of the rooms we booked had the microwave. When I asked about it at the front desk (I have food sensitivities and bring some of my own foods), they sent up a complimentary one in about 5 minutes. When I tried to tip the guy, he just looked at it and said, ""you don't have to do that."" I really think he felt he was just doing his job. (Gave it to him anyway, of course!)The continental breakfast did not disappoint; most people will be very satisfied for many mornings with the wide variety of selections: Belgian waffles, bagels, toast, doughnuts, biscuits and gravy, sausage, scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, coffee, hot tea, juices, cereals, apples, bananas, and oatmeal. Even I was able to find a couple of things to supplement my morning smoothie I packed. Next time I probably won't need to pack anything. My morning coffee was really good, and they had several types of creamers available. Incidentally, the coffee shop next door is no longer a Starbucks, so don't get your hopes up. Also, just to make sure you know you are still in Branson, someone is sure come around to interrupt your meal, hawking their show and pushing their brochure at you. (This happens at every hotel continental breakfast. Learn to adapt.)Within walking distance are several dining establishments if you aren't up for getting back into the car to face the horrific Branson traffic again. Those restaurants/bars are: The Rowdy Beaver, Fuddruckers, Thai Thai, Cold Stone Creamery, Taco Bell, Outback Restaurant, Outback Pub (NOT Outback Steakhouse), Mitsu Neko (sushi), and The Rib Crib. There are even more, depending on how far you want to walk.Now, having bragged on what I like about the place, the hotel isn't new, some of the hallway carpet is stained, and the pool surround needs repainted; but if, for under $100 bucks, you need a place to stay where your kids are happy and worn out from swimming, the beds are comfy, and even your insomniac husband can get a good night's sleep, this might be the place for you. Because who wants to go on a vacation where you spend the whole time worrying if your dog is ok at home or listening to your husband growl all the way home because he didn't sleep a wink?Wonderful hotel! Brought both of our German Shepards. They made us feel so comfortable and welcomed.This place is very misleading from the pictures you see online to how it really is. My husband and I booked a king suite and as soon as we stepped in were highly disappointed since we were hoping to get the indoor suite next to pool area considering it was very cold outside. Once we saw the toilet in our original room had dried pee on it my husband requested they switch us to the indoor suite. It was nicer although they gave us a room with two queen beds, the only bad thing about it is that you can hear all the noise from the pool area and the pillows are terrible! But the pool area is great the hot tub is hooooot! The breakfast was not that great for me since I am a health freak. Other than that great location! In the center of everything!!Ants Ants Ants! Ended our vacation early. No other rooms available because it was Memorial Day weekend. And all other hotels were full.It was the best deal I could find and they allowed my dog so I took a chance, and I'm so glad I did!The rooms are newly renovated and clean.  The free continental breakfast was great, and the Starbucks next door was a welcome surprise.  Our room opened up to the pool area, which was kind of neat.  We soaked in the hot tub after our long drive in the cold rain and met some nice fellow travelers.We were pleased to find out that we were in a great location off the main strip as well.  Branson is much larger than I expected and I didn't have nearly enough time do experience everything so I will definitely plan on returning and staying at La Quinta when I do. I also decided to try a few other La Quintas on my way across the country and was generally very pleased with this dog-friendly chain.We booked our hotel stay on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flq.com&amp;s=ae994a2f4c58843ed4bc47c03af1ee63935b689b4c59ab421d7481cd4300c62e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">lq.com</a> with ease. The hotel staff was knowledgeable of the area since it was our first time in this city. From the internet pictures it didn't look great. The hotel looks better in person. The rooms are clean, roomy and affordable for family of 4 during Christmas vacation. We requested adjoining rooms.and they accomodated ua with no complaints but with a smile. The complimentary was satisfactory if you have small children.  So you don't have to get dressed up to go out...just go down to the lobby. They  even have hard boiled eggs! However the only complaint I had was the noisy heater...but for the price and location it is good.Not bad.  AC/heater unit was NOISY!  Hardwood floors made the noise even worse.  Bed was just OK.  Breakfast was good with waffle makers, hard-boiled eggs, biscuits n' gravy, and sausages.  Continental breakfast on steroids.  Good water pressure, and our hot tub worked great.  Good value if you book on Priceline or Hotwire, but expect that you will probably get double queen beds and you may have to pay for a king upgrade, or king with hot tub.I love La Quinta, so can't rate too low. I have a rewards card too.  I'm just disappointed in my experience at this location due to plumbing issues on a pool side room.  Three days in a row I had to request a plunger for toilet problems, in which the first two times I handled myself. The third day I had issues, I asked if they could do something that might fix the problem.  The maintenance guy said there was nothing he could do, other than plunge because problems with water pressure, due to a fix of the water main. He said a ""snake"" wouldn't fix it and that it was a 90 degree angle in the connection of the drain.  I had him come up there to help and he plunged urine only, with a little toilet paper with a lot of effort.  Splashed toilet water all over the floor.  I asked him for something to clean it with and some cleaner.  He stated that we must have put something in the toilet because it was really clogged. I stated, no... we haven't put anything in the toilet other than toilet waste and what you use to wipe with.  He said, ""someone must have put soap or something, because it was really clogged!""  I told him that we had plunged the toilet due to clogging, 2x on the last two prior days by ourselves and that it had to be a problem with the pulmbing. I spoke to the front desk, who was really friendly, and not at fault.   The front desk woman was really nice and allowed my family to relocate to another room to finish our stay.  Due to being bother by our situation, I decided to shorten our stay.as for the price it was very good. my room could have been a little cleaner. after i went down to the front desk to tell them about it. i asked for a refrigerator ( $5 a day charge) which i was OK with, but they didn't have one. they did find one &amp; brought it up which was nice. the next day when we got back from silver dollar city my room key wasn't working. so i go down to the front desk to tell them about it so i could get in my room. they turned off my room keys till i paid for the fridge. i thought was kind of a big inconvenience. lady said she tried to call, but we didn't answer. which i told her the night before the phone wasn't working. to me i think there might have been a better way to handle this. not sure what the deal is with the cleaning person on leaving be a tip envelope in the room to tip her like i was @ a resort or something. all in all it is on the strip &amp; in the middle of everything. I'm not sure i would stay here again unless it was a super deal.For the money the value is tremendous!  We were traveling back from New Mexico- ain't never going back to Ruidoso again.....when we decided to head for Branson to have a GOOD time.  Only problem was that we had our 45 pound Candy with us.  And we know that most places that will take a dog are less than wonderful. Well, we blindly selected a place out of one of the helpful travel guides that are free along the stops on the highway and booked a reservation. Wrong move. Got onto the main drag heading south to Branson and stopped at one of those travel places that will sell you tickets and offer you free deals IF you will be bored to death listening to a timeshare pitch.  But- Good Golly  Miss Molly! - this place actually knew what they were talking about when they got us a room for two nights at the LaQuinta (minus the timeshare presentation).  CLEAN, newly refurbished with 2 queen beds, hardwood (or great imitation) floor, free breakfast and they take dogs. And a great location right on 76 near everything we were going to do.  So, we had a great ending to our previous vacation to New Mexico- in Branson, helped greatly by this La Quinta Inn.",,,,,"['wonderful', 'staff', 'friendly', 'pleasant', 'huge', 'dogs', 'welcomed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/marriotts-willow-ridge-lodge-branson,Marriott's Willow Ridge Lodge,4.5,$$$,12,"Staying here this week and having a great time.    Suites are great, staff is wonderful and lots to do for our family.     Best indoor pool ever!  S'mores in the evenings over the fire pit, shuffleboard and such during the day.    Location is great as well.  Very impressed with yet another Marriott Vacation Club property.  We've been owners for about 10 years now and haven't regretted a minute of our decision to buy a timeshare with Marriott.    GOOD TIMES.This review is a bit complex as it focuses on the hotel stay and the demographics of the guests.My husband and I have never been to Branson but made the decision to make the trip for our third wedding anniversary/second babymoon. Seeing as I'm five weeks away from delivering, we needed something nearby. When I first began my search for accommodation, I didn't want anything that was too family-focused as we do enjoy a bit of quiet. I stumbled across Marriott's Willow Ridge Lodge and fell in love with the photos and price. We booked our three night/four day trip.Upon arrival, the lodge is right off the main road of the area, but still secluded from daily traffic and tourists. The front desk staff was extremely warm and friendly. The overall landscape and decor was very lodge-forward and well manicured. We stayed in the standard king size room that was very cute and efficient when it came to design. We had everything we needed and more.One of the things I enjoyed about the Lodge was the diversity in activities. We had a ball on the Copper Run moonshine tour and tasting (I obviously didn't drink) and finger painting for our son. I can only imagine the fun families and individuals (couples too) have during a summer stay. For us visiting in late April, there was still a ton planned which was nice. The downstairs area of the main lodge was extremely entertaining. There was a pool table, fuse ball, arcade room, board games and other tables with checkers and Connect Four. The indoor pool was also really nice...and big too!The only negative I have about the accommodations was the housekeeping. You would think staying somewhere for three days would dictate a turn down service more than once, but that's all we got. Considering there were two adults and a 15 month old in the room, it would've been nice to get fresh towels and a little sprucing. My husband swears one of his breakfast sandwiches ""mysteriously disappeared"" but I highly doubt a maid would pop one in the microwave and enjoy a breakfast on random guests lol.Now that the review of the lodge is over, here's a review of the other guests--that I think is important for those looking to travel here, especially minorities.My husband and I (both Black) are well aware that we might be one of few or the only minorities when we travel. We like nice things and have no problem paying to get them. While I had a feeling this would be the case when we got to the lodge, I was a little surprised to see how many guests were members of the 65+ crew. We ended up leaving the wine and cheese event after two minutes because there was no one else remotely in our age group (early 30's) there. We were approached by one guest who took to our son. While this is nothing new (he is a cutie), we were taken back at how much he thought it was appropriate to emphasize he has bi-racial children...as if that is the only talking point or area of commonality one can have with a person of color.I don't want to group everyone together as southern hospitality was still king, but we unfortunately did have to deal with ""those looks"" from many of the guests. I'm not sure if things are different during the peak season when people travel with their families, but we know not to visit during this time again.Great place to come with the family. There are activities on the resort as well as all around Branson that will keep you busy for days! Make sure you talk to the concierge if you plan on seeing local shows as she can advise you on the best shows &amp; get you the best deals. If you have any issues with Marriott during your stay, Rand is the manager on staff &amp; will make sure to take care of you. He is beyond helpful &amp; is very professional.Excellent Vacation Club Hotel.  Enjoyed the large swimming pool and smores activity in the evening.  The 2 bedroom suite is perfect for larger parties.  Great activities scheduled for kids.A great resort for a vacation. The grounds are excellent and the staffAwesome little resort.  Very kid friendly,  very nice pool areas.  Lots to do with kids while here.  Clean rooms are nice.  Definitely would stay again.Loved it here! Very nice staff! Room was huge and clean. VERY comfortable beds and bedding! Clean pools and hot tubs! The elevators are steamy hot but that's to be expected in July. The ONLY complaint I had was the karaoke next to the pool. It was obnoxious and made it hard to relax. Great place and will return!This is really a 5 star resort. Everyone was helpfull and freindly. Loved it.JohnAbsolutely loved our stay here. It's right off the main strip, yet tucked away &amp; surrounded by trees...so you still get that lodge feel. Best part: the pool &amp; hot tub areas. Could use some work: the fitness area is a bit lacking and small, but its a hotel fitness center, so I didn't expect too much. It was still very clean. Service: excellent. Additional perks: they handed out Bomb pops to everyone at the pool (free of charge) one afternoon. They have lots of activities planned daily. Movie nights, s'mores, crafts, lunch specials at the pool, ice cream socials. We loved every minute of it!!The room was huge! Well, it was actually a suite, so it was basically an apartment. Like, we had a kitchen,two bathrooms, two bedrooms, and a living room. Also, we got a great deal on the room because of the AAA discount! So, if you have AAA I would definitely look into getting the discount on the room!Also, the lodge has a lot of things to do both indoors and outdoors! They have an indoor pool, outdoor pool, games (I can't remember all of them, I think they had Foosball, maybe ping pong, they did have a wii hooked up to a projector so the screen was huge), and a fitness center. Also, they have different activities that are put on by the place such as a wine and cheese tasting.5 stars for this place! Don't hesitate to make a reservation!This was a beautiful resort. They had everything you could imagine or would want to entertain young kids or a group of people traveling Missouri. It was close to all the shows, yet you still felt like you were in the Ozarks..hee hee! The hot tub was great (my favorite part!)! Very relaxing! My only complaint about my experience would have to be the shower situation. It felt very geriatric....a seat, handheld shower head and no real tub to stand in. It made for a very wet bathroom floor.",,,,,"['staying', 'week', 'great', 'time', 'suites', 'great', 'staff', 'wonderful', 'lots', 'family', 'best', 'indoor', 'pool', 'ever', 'mores', 'evenings',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/baymont-inn-and-suites-branson-branson,Baymont Inn And Suites Branson,3.5,$$,4,"Pretty good price for it being a very busy weekend in Branson.  Staff is friendly.  Front desk very cheerful and a breeze to check in.  Beds comfortable and room, for most part, was clean.  There was a cracker on the floor and a juji fruit as well.  Easy access to all entertainment in Branson.  Could use a larger TV in the room but made due with the 29"".  Nice to have a dorm room size fridge and a microwave for those leftovers from all the eating you'll do while in town.  Would stay here again.  If someone else should stay in room 316 and post here see if the juji fruit is still behind the night stand near the bed on the right.Check in was a breeze and some what helpful. Room 2 queen size beds fridge/microwave and flat screen TV, Hotel could use a little extra cleaning, beds were comfortable, table with 2 chairs, restroom has a jet tub but wouldn't suggest you use it , unless you dying for a staph infection, room could use more outlets to charge phones/tablets etc.. Pool was a little small and filled with chlorine you could smell it in the parking lot. Hot coffee/tea available all day in lobby and cookies Mon/Thurs. Breakfast was quaint  biscuits/gravy and waffles and boiled eggs with a variety of bread items nothing special only fruit is apples . We asked if there were any bananas available the lady said yes down the street at Walmart. Stayed at hotel 5 nights they changed bed once by request, our final night was filled with a noisy baseball team running/jumping/screaming all night no supervision. Finally got to sleep around 1/2 next morning informed front desk, lady stated sorry you  didn't sleep well but you can on plane .Hotel is located in the middle of everything such as downtown/some attractions .Rating it on the price for what ya get.  Price very good. Staff friendly and cheery.  Room clean and bed comfortable.  Location good tooWe used Wyndham Reward points for our room in Branson at the Baymont Inn and Suites on the Strip and were more that happy with everything.  It was easy to get to, right off of the Highway on the Strip.  Plenty of well lit parking.  Checking in was a breeze, David at the front desk was great, freshly baked cookies and coffee were available every time we were in the lobby.  I am guessing that the hotel has been pretty recently upgraded.  The room was very clean, nicely appointed and the beds were comfortable.  My grand daughter was very happy about the whirlpool bathtub!  The pool had just been drained and filled so it was cool, but that didn't stop the kids.  The hot tub was not available during our stay.  There was an exercise room but I was told that some of that equipment was also not functioning. Breakfast was fine, waffles, french toast, muffins, fruit, yogurt, cereal, milk, juice, etc... The set of f the breakfast room was awkward but it was pretty busy when we were there and there was still plenty of places to sit and staff kept busy keeping everything fill and cleaned up.  I checked the room rates and they were extremely reasonable. We will definitively be staying here again!!",,,,,"['pretty', 'good', 'price', 'busy', 'weekend', 'staff', 'friendly', 'front', 'desk', 'cheerful', 'breeze', 'check', 'beds', 'comfortable', 'room', 'part', 'clean', 'cracker', 'floor', 'fruit', 'well', 'easy', 'access', 'entertainment', 'use', 'larger', 'room', 'made', 'due', 'nice', 'dorm', 'room', 'size', 'fridge', 'microwave', 'leftovers', 'eating', 'town', 'someone', 'else', 'room', '316', 'post', 'see', 'fruit', 'still', 'behind', 'night', 'stand', 'near', 'bed', 'right', 'check', 'breeze', 'helpful', 'room', 'queen', 'size', 'beds', 'fridge', 'microwave', 'flat', 'screen', 'hotel', 'use', 'little', 'extra', 'cleaning', 'beds', 'comfortable', 'table', 'chairs', 'restroom', 'jet', 'tub', 'suggest', 'use', 'unless', 'dying', 'staph', 'infection', 'room', 'use', 'outlets', 'charge', 'phones', 'tablets', 'etc', 'pool', 'little', 'small', 'filled', 'chlorine', 'smell', 'parking', 'lot', 'hot', 'coffee', 'tea', 'available', 'day', 'lobby', 'cookies', 'breakfast', 'quaint', 'biscuits', 'gravy', 'waffles', 'boiled', 'eggs', 'variety', 'bread', 'items', 'nothing', 'special', 'fruit', 'apples', 'asked', 'bananas', 'available', 'lady', 'said', 'yes', 'street', 'hotel', 'nights', 'changed', 'bed', 'request', 'final', 'night', 'filled', 'noisy', 'baseball', 'team', 'running', 'jumping', 'screaming', 'night', 'supervision', 'finally', 'sleep', 'around', 'next', 'morning', 'informed', 'front', 'desk', 'lady', 'stated', 'sorry', 'sleep', 'well', 'plane', 'hotel', 'located', 'middle', 'everything', 'downtown', 'attractions', 'rating', 'price', 'price', 'good', 'staff', 'friendly', 'cheery', 'room', 'clean', 'bed', 'comfortable', 'location', 'good', 'used', 'reward', 'points', 'room', 'inn', 'suites', 'strip', 'happy', 'everything', 'easy', 'right', 'highway', 'strip', 'plenty', 'well', 'lit', 'parking', 'checking', 'breeze', 'front', 'desk', 'great', 'freshly', 'baked', 'cookies', 'coffee', 'available', 'every', 'time', 'lobby', 'guessing', 'hotel', 'pretty', 'recently', 'upgraded', 'room', 'clean', 'nicely', 'appointed', 'beds', 'comfortable', 'grand', 'daughter', 'happy', 'whirlpool', 'bathtub', 'pool', 'drained', 'filled', 'cool', 'stop', 'kids', 'hot', 'tub', 'available', 'exercise', 'room', 'told', 'equipment', 'also', 'functioning', 'breakfast', 'fine', 'waffles', 'toast', 'muffins', 'fruit', 'yogurt', 'cereal', 'milk', 'juice', 'etc', 'set', 'breakfast', 'room', 'awkward', 'pretty', 'busy', 'still', 'plenty', 'places', 'sit', 'staff', 'kept', 'busy', 'keeping', 'everything', 'fill', 'cleaned', 'checked', 'room', 'rates', 'extremely', 'reasonable', 'definitively', 'staying']",[],[],[],[],"[('room', 12), ('available', 4), ('use', 4), ('hotel', 4), ('comfortable', 4), ('fruit', 4), ('beds', 4), ('staff', 3), ('busy', 3), ('desk', 3), ('front', 3), ('night', 3), ('everything', 3), ('filled', 3), ('pretty', 3), ('bed', 3), ('good', 3), ('breakfast', 3), ('price', 3), ('well', 3), ('breeze', 3), ('clean', 3), ('still', 2), ('easy', 2), ('friendly', 2), ('coffee', 2), ('fridge', 2), ('lady', 2), ('sleep', 2), ('cookies', 2), ('right', 2), ('parking', 2), ('microwave', 2), ('little', 2), ('etc', 2), ('strip', 2), ('tub', 2), ('size', 2), ('happy', 2), ('check', 2), ('waffles', 2), ('hot', 2), ('plenty', 2), ('lobby', 2), ('pool', 2), ('rating', 1), ('bananas', 1), ('awkward', 1), ('queen', 1), ('cheerful', 1), ('tablets', 1), ('yes', 1), ('fine', 1), ('milk', 1), ('toast', 1), ('equipment', 1), ('quaint', 1), ('screaming', 1), ('charge', 1), ('location', 1), ('sorry', 1), ('cool', 1), ('whirlpool', 1), ('someone', 1), ('around', 1), ('checking', 1), ('stop', 1), ('every', 1), ('day', 1), ('bread', 1), ('helpful', 1), ('chairs', 1), ('plane', 1), ('morning', 1), ('nicely', 1), ('highway', 1), ('reasonable', 1), ('small', 1), ('biscuits', 1), ('guessing', 1), ('phones', 1), ('316', 1), ('used', 1), ('see', 1), ('street', 1), ('recently', 1), ('functioning', 1), ('special', 1), ('said', 1), ('entertainment', 1), ('access', 1), ('behind', 1), ('yogurt', 1), ('eggs', 1), ('told', 1), ('eating', 1), ('leftovers', 1), ('screen', 1), ('team', 1), ('baseball', 1)]",[],[]

Free wifi. Very kind staff.  They have a small outdoor pool and some grills and picnic tables. Nothing fancy, but perfect price and location.This place is clean and close to SDC. Beyond that I probably wouldn't stay here again. 1970s era motor lodge. Few updates outside of LCD television. Fly swatted hanging next to sink. Mediocre breakfast offerings. Small grocery within walking distance. Bus service to the park runs about 4 times each day. No shaded area to wait for bus on the SDC side. Dog in the office is named ""Indiana Jones"". Cool dog! Friendly staff.Somebody that opens a new Holiday Inn Express on Indian Point will make a killing. There are just no decent hotels close to SDC.We stayed there 4 nights. This is a family owned and operated motel. The breakfast was great! Free and homemade. Just what you need on vacation. We stayed here because our regular place was sold out on 2 of the nights we were in Branson. THIS is our new regular motel though.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/1st-inn-branson-branson-2,1st Inn Branson,3.5,$,4,"What a great find!My boyfriend and I were staying in Branson for a night after spending a long day at Silver Dollar City. We wanted a nice hotel to relax in (we had both been traveling and working like crazy!), and 1st Inn Branson delivered. When we arrived around 7pm, check-in was easy and fast, and the front desk staff was very friendly. We were told about breakfast (hot breakfast, 7-9am), the pool (which we didn't use, but it looked very nice), and the mini-golf ($3). The hotel itself is near a ton of attractions, including the Tanger Outlets and lots of restaurants. When we got to our room, we found an amazing room - modern, clean, large tub with a curved shower rod to make it even bigger, good lighting, nice flat screen tv with lots of channels, fridge AND microwave, and incredibly comfortable bed (and chairs, with a little table). The pictures on their website are totally accurate, and the room was just the right size for two people. My one complaint is that we definitely had a room for two adults, and we got a total of two towels. Probably just a housekeeping mixup, and we were fine sharing, but a couple more would have been nice. We had quite a few neighbors but with the air on (which kept it nice and cool), there was enough ambient noise to drown out anything outside. Best part? For all this, with tax, my total was $58. Definitely check this place out!Found this place on Expedia. We decided to stay INEXPENSIVE so we had more money for food and fun. Besides, we only show up to sleep! We were in the back building and it was nice and secluded. Staff was very polite, the rooms were clean and well organized. Slightly outdated but again just to sleep and secure our stuff. Beds are clean but the mattresses and pillows are not that comfortable. Should have brought my own pillows like I usually do. We would definatly stay here again! Breakfast was Okay. seating was packed, and the waffles were good. Maybe spread out the 2 waffle irons to reduce line for other stuff?Rooms were clean! Air conditioner didn't work well, made for a rough night of in and out of sleep. Breakfast that was included in stay was not good. It was decent overall for a one night stay last minute.Front desk clerk was rude, rooms were musty, old, mold in bathroom, would not recommend this at all,",,,,,"['great', 'find', 'boyfriend', 'staying', 'night', 'spending', 'long', 'day', 'silver', 'dollar', 'city', 'wanted', 'nice', 'hotel', 'relax', 'traveling', 'working', 'like', 'crazy', '1st', 'inn', 'delivered', 'arrived', 'around', 'check', 'easy', 'fast', 'front', 'desk', 'staff', 'friendly', 'told', 'breakfast', 'hot', 'breakfast', 'pool', 'use', 'looked', 'nice', 'mini', 'golf', 'hotel', 'near', 'ton', 'attractions', 'including', 'outlets', 'lots', 'restaurants', 'room', 'found', 'amazing', 'room', 'modern', 'clean', 'large', 'tub', 'curved', 'shower', 'rod', 'make', 'bigger', 'good', 'lighting', 'nice', 'flat', 'screen', 'lots', 'channels', 'fridge', 'microwave', 'incredibly', 'comfortable', 'bed', 'chairs', 'little', 'table', 'pictures', 'website', 'totally', 'accurate', 'room', 'right', 'size', 'people', 'complaint', 'definitely', 'room', 'adults', 'total', 'towels', 'probably', 'housekeeping', 'fine', 'sharing', 'couple', 'nice', 'quite', 'neighbors', 'air', 'kept', 'nice', 'cool', 'enough', 'ambient', 'noise', 'drown', 'anything', 'outside', 'best', 'part', 'tax', 'total', 'definitely', 'check', 'place', 'found', 'place', 'decided', 'inexpensive', 'money', 'food', 'fun', 'besides', 'show', 'sleep', 'back', 'building', 'nice', 'secluded', 'staff', 'polite', 'rooms', 'clean', 'well', 'organized', 'slightly', 'outdated', 'sleep', 'secure', 'stuff', 'beds', 'clean', 'mattresses', 'pillows', 'comfortable', 'brought', 'pillows', 'like', 'usually', 'breakfast', 'okay', 'seating', 'packed', 'waffles', 'good', 'maybe', 'spread', 'waffle', 'irons', 'reduce', 'line', 'stuff', 'rooms', 'clean', 'air', 'conditioner', 'work', 'well', 'made', 'rough', 'night', 'sleep', 'breakfast', 'included', 'good', 'decent', 'overall', 'night', 'last', 'minute', 'front', 'desk', 'clerk', 'rude', 'rooms', 'musty', 'old', 'mold', 'bathroom', 'recommend']",[],[],[],[],"[('nice', 6), ('room', 4), ('breakfast', 4), ('clean', 4), ('rooms', 3), ('good', 3), ('night', 3), ('sleep', 3), ('staff', 2), ('desk', 2), ('front', 2), ('like', 2), ('stuff', 2), ('found', 2), ('lots', 2), ('place', 2), ('total', 2), ('hotel', 2), ('air', 2), ('comfortable', 2), ('check', 2), ('pillows', 2), ('well', 2), ('definitely', 2), ('neighbors', 1), ('golf', 1), ('show', 1), ('money', 1), ('accurate', 1), ('dollar', 1), ('including', 1), ('rough', 1), ('fine', 1), ('find', 1), ('conditioner', 1), ('hot', 1), ('day', 1), ('spread', 1), ('minute', 1), ('easy', 1), ('friendly', 1), ('complaint', 1), ('around', 1), ('outside', 1), ('food', 1), ('rod', 1), ('couple', 1), ('overall', 1), ('fridge', 1), ('part', 1), ('silver', 1), ('bigger', 1), ('cool', 1), ('brought', 1), ('chairs', 1), ('large', 1), ('restaurants', 1), ('seating', 1), ('right', 1), ('old', 1), ('people', 1), ('mattresses', 1), ('reduce', 1), ('back', 1), ('waffle', 1), ('decided', 1), ('traveling', 1), ('best', 1), ('irons', 1), ('delivered', 1), ('pictures', 1), ('musty', 1), ('microwave', 1), ('enough', 1), ('probably', 1), ('clerk', 1), ('told', 1), ('noise', 1), ('screen', 1), ('little', 1), ('quite', 1), ('besides', 1), ('tub', 1), ('wanted', 1), ('great', 1), ('last', 1), ('housekeeping', 1), ('anything', 1), ('inexpensive', 1), ('usually', 1), ('lighting', 1), ('slightly', 1), ('secure', 1), ('secluded', 1), ('attractions', 1), ('channels', 1), ('long', 1), ('towels', 1), ('1st', 1), ('table', 1)]",[],[]

This is very risky business doing any type of business with this company.   This business is the worst of the worst in ethical business practices.  Don't believe a word they say.   Don't even trust the contract.  Just google Westgate Timeshare Reviews or read the reviews here in Yelp.   Yuk.   Yuk.  Yuk.

Married and divorced multiple times... Sexual harassment law suits... And the list goes on.  You have been warned. Stay far away from this character.At $177 a night we were extremely disappointed with this ""resort"". I should have checked yelp before my hubby booked. After driving through dinner, check in was a long aggravating process made worse by our low blood sugar. Anywho - after check in we were directed to pick up our ""welcome package"" which was actually a thinly veiled sleazy sales job for a time share. Not a great first impression. The room was terrible. Long black hairs in the tub, short curly hairs in the sink and spots on the mirror. They do not change the sheets nightly. The second night we didn't get full sets of towels replenished. We will never return to a westgate property. We would have been better off in a crappy motel room. Don't bother responding to this westgate - apologies now are worthless. Clean up your rooms instead.Avoid this ""resort"" at all costs. Horrible pushy timeshare ""corporate "" staff, who will insult you if you kindly say No, to their sales pitch. (The guy who owns the resorts recently this participated in celebrity  wife swap.) Condos were too small.Brandy W was right. I wished that I would have read her review first. The no obligations response from Westgate, yeah, after many lies and insults. Now I would not stay if there, and not a chance of ever purchasing a timeshare from them. Insincere staff who insult you  and then send another person over to say, ""sorry not to have met your expectations.""  Not good people.As an owner here it amazes me that every time we come here we told that we have to upgrade. This time I told them that I not going to keep this any longer. The list was long on how they would sue me my family my children So I checked with our layer and the worst they could do is take the property back and give me a bad report on credit. Or I could donate the property to a non-profit group and let them get what they can for it.Bottom line is its not s great deal to be sucked in for life and constantly harassed by sales peopleBook through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBransonVacationCabins.com&amp;s=db8a0289313b206a83343c19e0576b9dee98d0b8c4ff5b576feefedaa4cc5642"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">BransonVacationCabins.com</a> and go for the private cabin. I see a lot of bad reviews about time-share sales pitches. With this company, there is none of that. I absolutely loved my private luxury 2brm 2bath cabin. We built a fire every night. The cabin has 2 master suites! The property managers keep the place up and did a great job with communication. The Community has a lot to offer with on-site local market, restaurant, basketball courts, indoor heated pool and more. My family couldn't of been happier with our choice.This place deserves ZERO stars because it was horrendous! They try to grab your attention at the Branson Landing by offering you a free 3 days and 2 nights stay if you listen to their timeshare presentation. You attend the presentation to see what their package includes and when you tell them you won't be buying today because you need some time to process all the information to make a decision, they begin to turn on you. They insult you and tell you that if you decline the sale, they will email your information to surrounding timeshare companies so you can't attend their presentations and they label you as a moocher. Westgate definitely employed the infamous 80s timeshare sales tactics. Take your worst timeshare experience and multiply it by tenfold.I made a reservation for the labor day weekend to stay 3 days.I went to the front desk to check in, after they handed me the key and a small Map, they directed me to another person for more information about the resort (what I thought, or what they made it seems like) only to find out that the man have nothing to do with checking me in and that he is a scammer who tries to get my personal information, and try to get me to buy The famous scam Time share, and started to offer me free breakfast or cheap tickets to local shows or even free cash money $80 if I agree to sign his papers and agree to go to a tour.I hated the fact that the hotel pushed me into this Ponzi scam, instead of focusing on welcoming me and showing me the facility and what they have to offer.I refused the timeshare thing and went to my room, only to discover that it is nothing like what they advertise, it looks just like a cheap 2 star Motel, probably similar to a Motel 6 or Cheaper than that.the first day, I had access to the internet through wifi, but the second day, they locked it, and it says that I have to pay $9.99 a day to get access, I was outraged, never hurd of a hotel without free Wifi specially a high end hotel, even Motel 6 will give you free wifi included with your room reservation.I called the front desk, the man answered and was rude about it, he asked me: "" sir do you realize that there is a daily charge for the internet, then hangs up the phone, well my friend out of the 100's hotels I stayed at, none of them charged me for wifi access????the room was dirty, the microwave was dirty, the AC is outdated and barely cools the room, the curtain jacked up, it flies when the AC blows on it, so basically you don't feel the air. they don't give you a laundry bag for your dirty clothes???the room stinks, smells like someone cooked a meal with heavy spices, combined with stinky feet.they don't know how to make their room smells good with febreez or some air freshner or plugins. I went shopping the second day, and came back around 10pm , I found my room the way I left it, the bed wasn't done, they did not clean the room, did not pick up the towels and replaced them, nothing.I called the rude front desk, and he tried to tell me that they are not suppose to fix the bed, they only replace the towels, and pick up the trash, well they did not do neither, and yes sir they suppose to fix the bed and clean the room, and it is called housekeeping.what a rip off place, I will never go back to this sorry resort ever, and do not recommend you staying there, I will worry about my personal information and credit card info to be messed with, since they are into the business of scam and rip off, I watched the tv show American greed, and this resort sure have all the clues that the owners are into something similar.poor service, bad customer service, they cheat in the price you pay, and don't offer the minimum other hotels offer as standards.not only that, I discovered that there is other hotels that are much closer to where all the action and the shopping is, close and within a walking distance to the theaters and the wax Museum, and they don't charge as much, for only $40 you can have a nice room with free wifi, yes free wifi (not $9.99 a day)guys just drive there don't worry about making reservation, there is plenty of vacancy and the price is very reasonable and much cheaper than what these resorts charge.My wife and I stay here when we need a mini vacation/break from work and the kids. We have probably stayed here 4 or 5 times now. We usually stay in the motel area because it is the best cost for what you get. Although we have rented a suite here before as well. Not sure about all of the bad reviews about this place, but we continue to stay here because its, cheap, clean, quite, and they have all the amenities we need. We like the fact that it is in its own fenced off  area, but very close to all the shows and attractions. They do have a small Starbucks and general store on site as well which is handy. The last time we were there, after we checked in, they did try to get us to come to a time-share presentation, (offering us all sorts of free stuff) but a simple and firm ""No, thank you"" is all it took. In my younger days I used to sell Hilton time-shares, so I know what to expect. The salesman was not pushy at all.Sometimes we will come to Branson and splurge on a nice suite at one of the Hiltons. For every other time we want a cheap, clean, safe, and quite place to stay we will come here. The cabins look very nice so we may be trying them soon as well.Room very humid and everything seemed moist and wetTile floor is very from the humidityTile floor was not clean at allOne day requested coffee and bath soap and it finally was brought to us two hours later.Property needs more than one ice machineSince house keeping does not come during the stay, trash bags should be provided in rooms when trashcan is full.Both flying and crawling bugs in the roomMy husband is a runner and ran every morning....his running clothes never dried due to the humidity in the room.I've never seen so much dust in a hotel room before.Pillow cases and bedspread had BLOOD stains on them.Not a great property to rent.  Barney fife rent a cop just ran my daughter and I off from playing ping pong at 11;05pm.  The rooms are ratchet.  Bugs, bad smell, poorly cleaned.  Don't stay at this place.The housekeeping was horrible. Went into Room after check in and they weren't cleaned from previous guests. Had to ask for towels.False advertising!!! Had my familys hopes up for the beautiful room they posted on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> and after checking in we received a 1star motel room. I complained to both the resort and <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> to only get no where. To put it mildly I wore shoes to go to the bathroom thats how bad the carpet looked.we arrived late Saturday night, for a 2 night stay in a King Suite ($100 per night). The security guard waved us in without any. confirmation that we were staying there... but I stopped, to ask where we went to check in, and THEN he said: oh, up a quarter-mile to the high rise on the left. We checked in, expecting to be in the big luxurious 6 story building with a lovely landscaped view, and the receptionist said we would be staying in a different building, just down the street. She gave us a map, and showed us to the door.    We got into our ""King Suite"" and I immediately knew something wasn't right. The suite was in a roadside motor-in building, that hqd been last renovated sometime in the 80's... our kitchenette was divided up, coffee pot in the bathroom, mini fridge and microwave were neatly stacked in the dark, dirty corner of the closet... on the floor.      ON THE FLOOR!   Having hardwood (laminate) flooring, and no carpeting, or entry, everywhere we walked, we tracked in snow and mud (cause it's winter) into our luxurious bedroom (sans luxurious). The wallpaper was peeling, The ceramic floor tiles in the bathroom were coming up, the bathroom drawers had rot marks in them, the door didn't seal (requiring the heater to run all night to compensate for the breeze blowing in (winter!). The heater was strategically placed below the curtains, causing them to continuously blow up and open, giving all of the passersby an unforgettable showing of middle-aged nude antics (sorry neighbors)...... They did provide us with a wonderful classic alarm clock (classic 1970's), that I decided to use to prop the curtains closed (you're welcome neighbors).The king bed was lumpy and short-sheeted, and seemingly falling apart on one side of the bed, as it had a lean to it.The maintenance crew had been in previous to our visit, and had used a coat hangar to fix the mini blind on the small window, which kept it from being opened properly, and they generously fixed (or tried to) the un-framed 5'x3' bathroom mirror that was falling off the wall, by shoving a wad of chewing gum wrapped in paper behind it (I have the picture!).also, if you want any amenities,  of course, you have to drive to them, cause you ain't in the main building y'all!    NO  tv guide or channel listing, unheated pool, hot tub was locked (but the front desk guy said it was ok to just go around the closed sign and use it anyway..... yeah right, security!).$10 per night for wifi, nothing free here buddy! I kinda feel lucky I got clean-ish towels (just a few noticeable stains), anda 3/4 used roll of toilet paper! (ew)My kids and I stayed in one of the condos in the 3000 building for Spring Break. What a great time we had. The front desk personnel were so very friendly and accommodating.  Just an all around beautiful resort with clean rooms and so much to do.Saw your video on facebook, titled, ""Latino family humiliated when manager in Branson, MO refuses to do business with people who don't speak English"" Disgraceful. Your resort sucks! The whole property smells like cow dung.We arrived on a Wednesday at 3 .pm. The guard informed us to the large tower building. DONT let that fool you....  We were put up in a different building that was nothing short of a motel 6. The rooms were clean and the towels /beds were changed each night. I will say that for the $64 a night it's not bad. NOW to move on to the wifi..... RIP OFF!!!! $10 /day for wifi..... This is a ""resort""? No free wifi not even in the clubhouse/pool areas! Come on. That's a HUGE deal breaker for me I will never stay again cause of no free wifi. They had two above ground outdoor hot tubs  one stayed hot the other was not for the first day we were there. About 7 people in one above ground hot tub was not comfortable.  For the amount of money it takes to run the two above grounds they could invest in a large in ground. I stayed at WELK resort last time and they were way better. I will go to welk next time and forget this place ever exists.This was a terrible experience. We wanted to go to a show and get tickets half priced. The guy asked us if we wanted to get an awesome breakfast for free while going threw a 90 minute presentation. We would also only pay half price for our tickets. After the 90 minute presentation we should have gotten the tickets for free. They try and guilt you into buying a timeshare with lies. The guy said he lost his wife and child in a DUI accident and that if he could go back, he would of vacationed more. As he was telling us he couldn't look us in our eyes. He looked everywhere else but our face. I guess they hire the guys that couldn't quite make it as car salesman. Then he goes in to say "" hey he went threw this presentation showing you this for an hour and half the least you could do is buy this"". It was 9600 timeshare and payments would be 174 for 36 months. I don't think an hour and a half justified being paid that, and lying to people that make their money HONESTLY. Just warning people that do go to this to be prepared because they pull out everything, mostly lies.I highly recommend NOT staying at this place!!! It started upon arrival when we had booked two rooms and requested them to be close together and when we arrived one room was ready while the other was not. So the room that was not ready got an ""upgrade"" and we were placed halfway across the property from our friends we traveled with. The so called upgraded king suite was far from a suite. The room was outdated, the heater was turned up so high we had to open the windows and doors to cool it down mind you the outside temp was in the mid 40's. For what we paid we could have had a much nicer place and much cleaner and up to date room!!!No here is where it goes even further south for me... I had purchased a new pair of Under Armour shorts at the Branson Landing. When we checked out of the room Sunday we thought we had everything and when we got home and started unpacking I realized I had left my shorts hanging on the back of the bathroom door before showering. I hung them there because the bathroom was far from what I consider clean. I called first thing Monday morning after double checking all of our bags and my vehicle for the shorts. After being told nobody had been in the room except cleaning personnel my shorts were no where to be found. I spoke with many different people and passed around more than you can imagine all anybody could tell me was ""I'm sorry sir your shorts are not here. We will do some more checking and let you know what we find."" I spoke to security, house cleaning, and even the director of operations and after more than a month of dealing with them I still got nothing other than ""Were sorry sir..."". I know without a doubt I left the shorts there and if someone would be dishonest over a pair of shorts I would hate to know what would happen with something more expensive!!!Stayed for two nights in April 2013. Just needed a room. Did not use the facilities.Pros: 1. Cheap, $692. Fairly clean3. Mattress pretty good4. QuietCons:1. Run down room overlooking the maintenance facility. We were given a room in a building that housed maintenance, Activity staff?2. Curtain falling off and did not close all the way3. Dark. No lamp beside the bed. One lamp shorting out4. Refundable, $50 damage deposit required at check-inAfter you check in they send you to another person to get your Welcome to Branson packets. Smelling a sales pitch we skipped it.","Nostalgic for the roadside motel of 1987? Do check into the Westgate Resort. Room had chain lock, a tv that was state-of-the-art 20 years ago, and no hairdryer. This place is also time share resort and so when you check in at 10 p.m. after a long drive, be prepared to be pressured into taking a tour. Bargain hunters are better off paying a few more dollars to stay on the strip.Everything was great besides the fact that we went through a intense pressured meeting with people trying to sell us a time share.. they wouldnt take no for an answer and then started to insult us.. by saying we were wasting their time and this is how they put food in the table for their families. . Blah blah.. everytime we said no the price went down... then we explain to them we had a family member with a time share through them and we could always use theirs and he said oh so ur getting ur family memebers sloppy seconds.. very insulting.. all I can say is do not get suckered into one of these no matter what they offer u! We did get some free stuff for going to this meeting but not worth the insults and time spent saying no.. over all room was good.. floor kinda lifting at the doorway.. pull out couch was awful.. and walk ways outside the rooms needed the landscaping trimmed back to make it easier to walk..they say they offer free wifi but they make u pay for it..-000000 Worst ""resort"" ever!After traveling all day, I arrived at the Westgate hotel around 5:30 PM - it took me 2 1/2 hours to get a room.  This was after:1.   They told me they had no rooms that would accommodate my reservation ( I had two disabled senior citizens in my group)2. I was sent to a room that was already occupied3. Finally placed in another room and THEN received call from front desk stating I was in the wrong room4. Conversations with numerous staff members (none that were communicating with each other).  After complaining to the ""manager"" my compensation was that I could receive complimentary Wi-Fi (which I had been told was free).  Funny thing is - no Wi-Fi, even after calling the front desk AGAIN (where they told me they would charge me...hmmm Free??)...Ultimately never received Wi-Fi connection.  I would recommend that no one ever stay at this resort as their customer service is a negative 0!  PS:  The room was not as pictured online, very old &amp; musty with a cover up of bleach smelling.I had already booked my room on Orbitz for$66 per night for 2 Queen beds for the family of four, when I saw the previous Yelp review. Scared me but I decided to check the place out and play tough if the room was bad. To my surprise it was great!  Clean and convenient!Review for the wine and cheese tasting.  Forget about it.  One type of cheese, and about 6 different bottles of wine served in little plastic cups.  Not much to write home about for sure.  Expecting more from a First class resort.Condos are a lot better than the hotel style rooms we stayed in.  Pool area is nice.  This is a must, do not agree to the timeshare presentation.  It is a waste of two hours.  Tried to guilt me into buying a time share for a good 45 minutes.  Check reviews on trip advisor.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/lilleys-landing-resort-and-marina-branson-3,Lilleys' Landing Resort & Marina,4.0,$$,4,"nice helpful peoplewebsite helpfulnice fishing optionsDock easy to usevery limited soda and food in storebathroomBe very careful when booking.  They don't tell you that half the rooms are really really nice and recently built or recently redone and the other half are run down and gross. My parents have a room with a disgusting filthy couch, while my brother's room is a 5 bedroom modern condo type accommodation. I was supposed to stay with my parents but I chose to spend $60 a night to have a room of my own somewhere else  because it was so dirty. I imagine the fishing is great and the location is wonderful if you're fishing and it is beautiful here but I'm sitting in the car because there's no place to sit in the room.We stayed at Lilleys three nights and it was a wonderful experience. The fishing is great (or so my husband tells me) and they have so many amenities that it makes things very comfortable. We stayed in a cabin with a loft that had a small kitchenette. Everything was CLEAN and tidy, inside and out. I've been to several fishing resorts with my husband and this is the best by far. Their children's play area was great, my 3-year-old loved the slides and played out there for a long time. Everything is close to the water, so even our off-water cabin still felt very close.  And the location is great too, we were close to Branson Landing, all the shops on the strip and just 10-15 minutes from Silver Dollar City.The staff was friendly, everything was great. We plan on making this our go-to place in Branson.Awesome place to stay. It's very clean and staff is very friendly. Close to the strip. Eric out on the dock was very friendly and helpful. He went above and beyond to make sure the family was having a good time. He even helped clean our fish. Can't wait for our next stay.",,,,,"['nice', 'helpful', 'fishing', 'easy', 'limited', 'soda', 'food', 'careful', 'booking', 'tell', 'half', 'rooms', 'really', 'really', 'nice', 'recently', 'built', 'recently', 'redone', 'half', 'run', 'gross', 'parents', 'room', 'disgusting', 'filthy', 'couch', 'brother', 'room', 'bedroom', 'modern', 'condo', 'type', 'accommodation', 'supposed', 'parents', 'chose', 'spend', 'night', 'room', 'somewhere', 'else', 'dirty', 'imagine', 'fishing', 'great', 'location', 'wonderful', 'fishing', 'beautiful', 'sitting', 'car', 'place', 'sit', 'room', 'three', 'nights', 'wonderful', 'experience', 'fishing', 'great', 'husband', 'tells', 'many', 'amenities', 'makes', 'things', 'comfortable', 'cabin', 'loft', 'small', 'kitchenette', 'everything', 'clean', 'tidy', 'inside', 'several', 'fishing', 'resorts', 'husband', 'best', 'far', 'children', 'play', 'area', 'great', 'year', 'old', 'loved', 'slides', 'played', 'long', 'time', 'everything', 'close', 'water', 'water', 'cabin', 'still', 'felt', 'close', 'location', 'great', 'close', 'landing', 'shops', 'strip', 'minutes', 'silver', 'dollar', 'city', 'staff', 'friendly', 'everything', 'great', 'plan', 'making', 'place', 'awesome', 'place', 'clean', 'staff', 'friendly', 'close', 'strip', 'dock', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'went', 'beyond', 'make', 'sure', 'family', 'good', 'time', 'helped', 'clean', 'fish', 'wait', 'next']",[],[],[],[],"[('fishing', 5), ('great', 5), ('close', 4), ('room', 4), ('friendly', 3), ('everything', 3), ('place', 3), ('clean', 3), ('staff', 2), ('parents', 2), ('location', 2), ('half', 2), ('helpful', 2), ('husband', 2), ('really', 2), ('recently', 2), ('water', 2), ('strip', 2), ('wonderful', 2), ('cabin', 2), ('nice', 2), ('time', 2), ('limited', 1), ('dollar', 1), ('resorts', 1), ('rooms', 1), ('bedroom', 1), ('still', 1), ('children', 1), ('somewhere', 1), ('disgusting', 1), ('easy', 1), ('good', 1), ('sitting', 1), ('far', 1), ('dock', 1), ('silver', 1), ('brother', 1), ('night', 1), ('small', 1), ('went', 1), ('old', 1), ('fish', 1), ('redone', 1), ('year', 1), ('beyond', 1), ('best', 1), ('gross', 1), ('booking', 1), ('supposed', 1), ('run', 1), ('chose', 1), ('imagine', 1), ('condo', 1), ('accommodation', 1), ('wait', 1), ('many', 1), ('experience', 1), ('soda', 1), ('makes', 1), ('family', 1), ('city', 1), ('area', 1), ('three', 1), ('long', 1), ('next', 1), ('amenities', 1), ('type', 1), ('tell', 1), ('loft', 1), ('landing', 1), ('else', 1), ('slides', 1), ('careful', 1), ('loved', 1), ('car', 1), ('inside', 1), ('dirty', 1), ('kitchenette', 1), ('making', 1), ('shops', 1), ('minutes', 1), ('beautiful', 1), ('played', 1), ('awesome', 1), ('modern', 1), ('tidy', 1), ('comfortable', 1), ('helped', 1), ('tells', 1), ('nights', 1), ('built', 1), ('sit', 1), ('things', 1), ('make', 1), ('couch', 1), ('food', 1), ('several', 1), ('play', 1), ('sure', 1)]",[],[]

The beds are old and springs are hitting your back at night. We went to pool no towels, so we had to use the ones from our room. I called the front desk and asked for more towels and they told me I would have to come to front desk and pick them up myself. The continental breakfast was really bad. The gravy they had for the hard old biscuits was like white water.  We had to ask for milk for our cereal.  So Customer No service was par for this place. Needs new management and a remodel would be great. P.S.  WiFI is very poorBad service, incompetent staff, awful mattress and lame free breakfast.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/radisson-hotel-branson-branson,Radisson Hotel Branson,3.0,$$,32,"This stay left such a great feeling on us. The room were good, normal. But the front desk staff just made the difference. We even had a few annoying requests to break $100 into $5s, use the printers, late check out. They were so helpful and kind. Esp after another hotel didn't have our rooms ready and we stayed at the Radisson because of the other hotels mistake. Thanks guys for the 5 star treatment.I decided to stay here on my way back to Chicago. The service was mediocre. Upon checking into my room, I was comfortable with my stay. The room smelled musty and stale. The pillows were not comfy and sunken in. The mattress itself was hard and sheets felt like cardboard. I am giving this hotel a two star based on my experience. I'm sure if I spent more money, instead of a last minute reservation, I would have gotten a room with a more rested night.After being on the road and staying in quaint places where the minuscule rooms have names, it was a relief to stay at the Radisson. The accommodations were what we anticipated, and the service was good. It was quiet while we were here, but big tour busses were rolling in for the weekend when we left.It is an OK hotel. The overal service is fine, but some of the staff seem to be not quite professional and friendly. I think their targets are big groups. If I come here next time I would rather pay some more and go to Mariotte or Hilton.We enjoyed our stay here very much. The staff was nice, rooms were clean and it was very comfortable. Location was greatAsk for a room withOUT a Sleep Number bed. Holy cow, that was a painful experience. They are not doing Sleep Number any favors. The most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in. Including a camping air mattress! Otherwise the hotel is fairly nice. It is older so nothing too fancy but the people are very nice and helpful. The pool is small but indoor/outdoor which is nice for a rainy day. The free coffee ends early...8:00am was too late. It seems like this would be the type of place with a free breakfast considering the age an every place around it had it. Would not stay at again simply because of the beds but others said their rooms did not have the Sleep Number so perhaps it could be OK.Being paired up and a representation of Bass Pro Shop we thought this would be a nice hotel, however it was a tremendous let down. We were suppose to get 2 queen beds and surprised to see doubles, both of which were very uncomfortable and broken down. The fridge hardly worked, the exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work, the wardrobe closet smelled like stale vinegar and the pool area.... Let's just say no swimming this time. The only upside was the staff was very nice and pleasant. We would not stay at this hotel again.Just don't. Go ahead and go to the Hilton or the Marriott. This hotel is so below par, they should never call it a full service hotel. Front desk staff, including the manager, have no reason to be in the business. The rooms are very small and the bathroom you could barely turn around in, even if the door was open. They say that they replaced the sleep number beds recently....boy did they get ripped off on the ones they purchased...awful. The hallways and elevators were so hot, that you were better off taking the stairs....even 8 floors up, you would sweat less! Don't even try to talk to a manager. I asked to speak to one for 3 days, including when I checked out and got nothing!  If I wouldn't have had 2 rooms with my handicapped mother in law, we would have checked out on the first day.Came with a Tour Group!  This was a great hotel!  Think there were eighteen rooms on First Floor, twelve them are Handicap Rooms!  I was in Room 112!  There one day I thought me be late or last one to get to the tour bus, the Group Leader says I am first!  Something elevators were having problems that day!  How will I know, I am on first floor!I liked the breakfasts!  Was hot all you want to eat!  I liked the swimming pool, was playing Olympic athletes with children (Daddy was watching) from Kansas City, KANSAS!  Half the pool indoors, half outdoors, hence the children and I pretending be Olympic athletes!  Teh one day had five free hours, walked to Titanic Museum!  There also several theaters walking distance of the hotel!  I high to recommend this hotel!  Was good I never had worry about elevators, that gets confusing at times!We requested a sleep number room. When we got to our room on the 7th floor it was not a sleep number room. The front desk switched us to a room on the 3rd floor. A week later I have a $150 charge on my credit card. They kept my card on file for the original room and the next people tore up the room and I was charged for it! The manager is saying he has no proof we were switched rooms. My husband has been dealing with this all day. I would never recommend this hotel, the pool area is disgusting, there were flying bugs in our room, dishes from room service in the hallways for two days, rude front desk, and the beds are horrible. What a hassle!!Place was great, had a great view, every staff member were extremely nice.The hotel restaurant has a decent selection, the bad part is thw bar mixed drinks were extremely water down.Would stay there again and if i go to the bar i just stay with the bottled beerI stayed at the hotel over the July 4th weekend with my wife and toddler. I can understand that the hotels can be busy over the long weekend but the fact that the only room they could give us a room directly across from the ice dispenser was a downer. Needless to say our child would wake up on multiple occasions through the night due to the noise. Not only that, their internet connection was slower than the 3G connection on my phone. The hotel was clean and staff (esp. the concierge were quite friendly). The rooms were on the smaller side though.They provided free parking and the location was a nice one.I truly had hoped for better from the hotel but was disappointed.I'm sure there are different amenities for certain rooms, but a microwave &amp; refrigerator should be standard. Even the $30/night motels/hotels have those appliances for free. Don't try to change clothes in the tiny closet of a bathroom. Not impressed with this hotel. Was disappointed as I've stayed in Raddison hotels before with a lot better rooms. Was expecting the same quality from this one. Doubt I'll stay again. But, the staff was great &amp; friendly and always said hello when near.I agree with everything ""M S"" says except the quality of the room. Our double room was comfortable. Clean and well laid out with a coffee maker and a regular (not flat screen) television. As rooms go, I think it was a good value and ""A-OK"".The sleep number bed was a nice feature, though it seemed to ""leak"" a bit of firmness through the night.We didn't visit the on site restaurant or use the room service. Parking was okay, though the lot was on a pretty solid slope.I really enjoyed my stay here this weekend.  Our room was clean, the staff was friendly, and the bartender at their lounge went above and beyond with excellent service.  The bartender actually reopened to get us a couple drinks because we missed closing just by a few minutes.  And this is kind of silly, but I really liked the scent of the handsoap they provided in our room...it was like a spicy citrus or something.  Also, the pool and hot tub were great.  Only complaint would be that I think our bed wasn't working properly...it's a sleep number but even after trying to adjust it, it felt super hard.  Also...parking was kind of a bummer...always hard to find something up front.The morning after my poor review, the manager posted a response.  The response was measured and positive.  I was still staying at the hotel and visited him at the front desk.  He moved my family to another room on the 9th floor.  The suite was sweet.  2 rooms, king sized bed in 1 with a pullout sofa in the other.  Toilet and shower behind a door with access from both rooms.  A large dual vanity and hot tub.  Both rooms opened to a balcony with outside access.Had we had this room to begin with, we would have been 100% happy from the getgo.  As it stands, we are very happy with the manager of this hotel who bent over backwards to make sure we are happy.Staff is incredibly helpful and accommodating!  Room was very comfortable and relaxing.  My needs were taken care of very quickly and efficiently.  The entire staff made me feel at home.  I wouldn't stay anywhere else!It's a nice hotel. But the reason I'm giving it 2 stars. Is because the customer service at the front desk. I felt that either because i am a different color or i do not look rich she was not that friendly. Customer service is big with me.Good Hotel! The rooms were well kept and the staff is very nice!POOR MANAGEMENT!  ignored repeated requests!  The overall stay, was OK, room was clean, fridge (only available on request) was extremely small (RV size).  The main reason for my poor review is lack of management cooperation:I had booked a 3 night stay (Wed, Thu, Fri) at this hotel through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>. On Wed night, local weather was predicting 4-8 inches of snow Thursday and Friday. I called <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>, and they said you must cancel your night through us, and it is up to the Raddison if they wanted to refund your money. I called and asked to speak with the manager. He was not available, so the night clerk asked if she could help. I explained I wanted to cancel my Thursday night reservation through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> due to the approaching storm and receive a refund, or move my extra night to May 8th, whichever was easiest for them. I explained my wife and children were traveling in a seperate van that was very top heavy, and did not think it was safe for them to drive In the snow. The clerk said ""Oh, our weather people are always wrong!  if I does snow, it won't affect the roads.""  I told her I appreciate that input, but I still would like to either cancel Or move my reservation to may 8th. Clerk said ""well, that's not my decision, I will call the manager at home since there isn't one here, and I will see. I will ring your room and let you know what he says.""  No ring in the room, and no message on voicemail. I stopped by again that night and asked if I had any messages regarding the issue. Clerk said ""I'm sorry sir, he didn't answer or call back, so if you would ask for him after 8am tomorrow morning, his name is Ryan, and he would be happy to help you.""  That night it snowed and iced 5 inches on one of the mountainous areas in the Midwest, making traffic And road conditions CRAZY SCARY!  I awoke in my room at about 8:15am with no call or message from Ryan the manager. I got dressed and went down to the lobby for the third time (time was 8:35am), and asked for Ryan the manager. The clerks on duty said ""sorry he hasn't made it in yet. Check back in an hour or so"". Not ""is there something I can help you with?"" Or ""Can I get his number for you?""  Needless to say, we received NO response from anyone else, other than the bill on Friday morning. Even if they would have said ""I am very sorry sir, but our policy is not to change any reservations from 3rd party vendors"" it would have been acceptable.  However IGNORING ME MULTIPLE TIMES IS VERY VERY UNACCEPTABLE!  I travel overnight with my work at least 2 nights per week. I am gold level with Priority Club, Hilton, Marriott and Choice privileges. Club Carlson will not be a selection due to the serious lack of attention by management for the Radission Hotel in Branson, MO.","I stayed for 1 night(Saturday August 2). Everything was fine except we booked this hotel because it advertised that there was a bar on site....however after we checked in we were informed that the bar was no longer open due to new management. It would have been nice to know that when we booked the room. Normally this wouldn't be an issue but we paid more for the room because it had a bar.I was very disappointed in this hotel and would NOT recommend it to anyone.  I will start with the beds.. The sleep number beds are NOT meant for two. Every time my husband moved I was bounced and tossed and not just a little. My kids laughed I bounced so high (think bouncy houses). We had to have it set on the highest firmness to avoid this. That did not make for a good nights sleep.  Not to mention it did not hold its firmness nor did the remote work every time.Breakfast... There was none. I don't remember the last hotel I was at that did not have a continental breakfast. They had nothing. The Restaurant on the premises was a bit pricey 30 dollars for 3 of us to eat and I ate ale'cart.  The website showed a second restaurant in the hotel but that was removed.  The cable was VERY basic and did not always work and the internet was very slow and you could not always connect.The AC/heater did not seem too work either. I thought it might be me but my husband could not get it to do much either.I will say the kids LOVED the pool. It was small but they could swim inside or outside by swimming under the wall.The staff was polite but that is about it. The Maids were very friendly singing while they worked. The rooms were very clean.We were only there for a couple days thankfully.Michelle T.Excellent location. Super clean room. Very comfortable food. All interaction with hotel staff has been pleasant. Stayed 4 nights August '13My experience remains the same, but I was contacted by a service respresentative and it left a much better taste in my mouth. Thank you Ryan.Nice motel,they gave us a corner room that they thought our kids would like since it had lots of windows.Nice staff,free Wi-Fi,and plenty of parking.However I wished they had a complimentary breakfast like a lot of motels do.We stayed overnight here in February and, overall, were very impressed! Admittedly, I was not expecting much in this area, but the room was very clean &amp; the decor is fairly contemporary and uncluttered. We were excited to try the sleep number beds for the first time as well, and found them to be quite comfortable. The hotel staff was very accommodating and provided a small refrigerator for our room by request. The only negative for us was the thermostat - the fan came on several times in the night, which woke us up a bit and the room never quite reached a good temperature.Main level looks nicer than the floor we stayed on. Our room was not the cleanest. Bathroom layout is very small and the way the door opens in it is a little strange. If you come back to the hotel late and they are full you might not find a parking space.It wasn't quite as nice as I thought it would be, but it wasn't horrible either. The room was clean, the breakfast we had with room service was great, and the staff was pleasant. It was fun trying out a sleep number bed for a couple of nights. A movie channel or two, or maybe some pay movies, and a mini-fridge in the room would have made the stay even better.Very nice hotel. Check-in staff was exceptional. Room was clean and spacious. Had all the amenities expected at a hotel in this price range. Was very quite. Only negative was the beds. The Sleep Number bed was so uncomfortable and difficult to find 'my number'. Would prefer a pillow top.Parking is horrendous, lot is on a slope probably worst hotel layout ever, one way in one way out of lobby ,no alternate entrances or exits. Rooms were clean few amenities, sleep number bed doesn't function properly neither does thermostat for a/c kept cutting on and off all night. Cable kept messing up during NBA finals . Wifi is slow . Funny story ate at restaurant on site , wanted to reheat food later on was told no microwave in entire hotel unless I upgrade to suite at $215 a night which had microwave. Also make sure room is close to elevator or you will have long hike for ice or elevator.Our family stayed here for two nights.  It was fine, but not great.  The room was clean and the people were polite.  There was nothing special though.  We did not eat at the restaurant on site, so I can't comment about that.it was while back and the hotel was ok but there was actually one of those little kid beauty pageants going on here when we stayed and that was SUPER DUPER CREEEEEEPEEEEY.",,,,"['left', 'great', 'feeling', 'room', 'good', 'normal', 'front', 'desk', 'staff', 'made', 'difference', 'annoying', 'requests', 'break', '100',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/still-waters-resort-branson,Still Waters Resort,3.5,$$,24,"We stayed here over Thanksgiving break and it was a great experience.  We were able to walk down by the water and look around.  The room was well kept &amp; had everything we needed.  It was a great fit for the four of us.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars was for the non operating hot tub that we'd been told so much about.We purchased a Groupon to try this place out. We loved it! It is perfect for families, anyone with small kids or older folks. The boat rental is well worth it! There are 3x pools, one with a water slide (Zume The Flume) and one with a waterfall. The hot tubs are very large! The room had a amazing view of Table Rock Lake. We loved the space of the room and the room was very nice &amp; updated. There are free bicycles to ride, paddle boats, and Kayaks. It's really nice they have fishing poles to fish off the dock, you can even swim off the docks. I would highly recommend this place for families, young couples, toddlers, teenagers,  or large family groups. We will be back!This place was not what I expected. The brochures and website make it sound fantastic. I mean it's nice and quiet and close to Silver Dollar City but the amenities are not the greatest. The pools closed early on a holiday weekend. You have to bring ur own towels to the not so convenant ""laundry place"" they are only open 8-2 like who is there that early while they are on vacation. Also they make u clean ur own room for the price you you should've have to clean ur own room while on vacation. Also bathrooms are small they are so so rooms unless you get a condo. (Which costs more). Also they Should have more lighting on the dark winding roads to get to their place. The should just be a hotel not so much of a ""resort"" not sure if I would return to here or not.We've stayed at several different resorts on Tablerock.Still Waters is our favorite with a large group or with the family. There are lots of activities for the kids.Condos are very nice and modern.The only reason I can't give it a five star is because as many times as we've stayed they've never allowed a late check out. Sometimes 10am is a rough get out or pay by the hour. We enjoy our time at the resort because we stay on the water for most of our trips. If you plan to leave the resort beware of the traffic nightmare Silver Dollar City can cause entering or leaving.Loved it! Used a groupon and got this huge room with a fireplace and full kitchen with an amazing view. The pools are great and  free kayak and paddle boats for the kids. Our room had a two minute walk so a good swimming area on the lake. We rented a pontoon boat and the staff gave us a discount and were very friendly.Our family of 16 rented two three bedroom units. We had plenty of room. Each bedroom had its own bathroom and were very large. Units were modern and very clean. Would suggest bringing your own frying pan if you plan on cooking. Only negative. Pools were great, marina offered everything, and the grounds were nice. Another marina a block away is nice when Stillwater is out of jet ski or boats and a little cheaper. We will be back! Everyone enjoyed our stay and the distance to the strip is perfect.Oh, where to begin...I killed a brown recluse spider in my room just after moving all our stuff in. The front desk had me come pick up new keys after asking to be moved...otherwise they were going to do nothing but spray chemical pesticides in a room they expected my family to sleep in. We apparently got the smallest and cheapest room offered. Bigger nicer rooms were attached to ours. We had an old school tube TV that only had fuzzy cable. Our refrigerator and a/c were not that cold, even in mid September. There is no coffee to go in the coffee pot in your room.  There are no tissues in the rooms. Our shower drain was slow to drain...not quite clogged, but up to ankles after a shower. And the walls are PAPER THIN. You WILL hear everything your neighbors do, even if they aren't that loud. If you get roomed by someone who sleeps anything different than your own schedule, get ready for a sleepless vacation. The pools were very nice. The free use of paddle boats and bicycles were nice. It is very family oriented. The buildings lack the quality to make this place  4 or 5-stars on my list. And, if you let them, they will try to sell you a time share. It would have been easy for me to say no anyway, but their $100 comps aren't enough to waste 2 hours of my time.This review is for the more mature (40+) folks looking for the following getaway - quiet, peaceful, romantic...The short form review - DO NOT come here unless it's the EXTREME off season!  Read on for brutal honesty if you'd like to know more.  :-)The good - rooms are set up condo style, so you've got a pretty spacious living room, small kitchenette, and a balcony out back with a very beautiful view of the lake.  Our room had a gas fireplace (more on that below).  The property at the Stillwater seems well manicured, lots of green grass, has a couple pools, and parking is plentiful.  The resort is well out away from the madness of the Branson strip, and getting to and from is a no-traffic snap as long as you time it to not be going the same way as Silver Dollar City traffic when they're opening or closing.  The bad - first, noise!  I'd say the walls are paper thin, but they'd have to get several times thicker to make it up to paper thin.  If you've got people in the rooms beside you, you'll be able to hear their conversations clearly when they're speaking in a normal tone of voice.  If you have people in the room above you, it sounds like a herd of elephants when they're walking normally.  Which brings me to...Second bad, crowds.  We were unfortunate enough this trip to be in the same building as TWO BUSLOADS of high school students.  At a resort.  Which means they were running around the place losing their minds as teenagers do.  We were woken up at 11pm one night when said buses came back and the girls got off the bus screaming like they were in a Friday The 13th movie for a good half hour.  And if normal footfalls in the room above you sound like elephants, imagine what the midnight tackle football game up there was like.  Can't blame teenagers for being teenagers (that's what they do jack!) but stuff like that is NOT why we come here.  The ugly - place is starting to show it's age a bit.  Went to the bathroom after the long drive to get to Stillwater and first flush - TA DA!  Toilets broken!  Staff came immediately to fix it.  Shortly thereafter, tried to start the fireplace - fireplace is broken too.  Called the front desk again, but they apparently never took care of the problem the entire length of our 3 day, 2 night stay because it never worked.  How, I ask you intrepid reader, am I supposed to get my Billy Dee Williams on when the fireplace is a no-go?  :-)All of this combined to make our quiet, relaxing, romantic resort getaway pretty much the opposite of everything we went down there for.  Given the noise and the not up to snuff amenities, there are about four dozen hotels in Branson we could have stayed at instead to get what we ended up with here, and at a much lower nightly rate.  We had a great getaway here the first time we came (it was November time frame - as I said above, extreme offseason) which made coming back a no brainer.  The crowd and noise this trip taught us that timing is everything for a quiet getaway here.  The amenities and managements apparent ""oh well, sucks to be you"" attitude about taking care of them now has us wondering if coming back is worth it.On my wife's suggestion we tried Still Waters again over Memorial Day weekend. Stayed in unit 231 this time which is a recently refurbished 1br, lake view condo, with jacuzzi tub. This room (in stark contrast to the other) was beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. Upon entry there was a dining room and kitchen, the living room had a fold out couch and a flat screen TV. Bedroom had another flat screen, and bathroom with jacuzzi tub. Pillow top mattress had premium bedding. Since it was warmer this trip we had the opportunity to try out the new north pool which was just fantastic in every way. Outdoor beds, hammocks under a willow tree, and a zero depth entry pool. Outstanding!! We also tried cane pole fishing, but nobody could help us. $3.50 in bait and not even a nibble. I may just be the worst fisherman in history!What an amazing contrast to our last visit. We will definitely visit again - with the caveat that we will definitely request a recently renovated room. Glad we gave them another shot.My family and I have come here for many, many years and unfortunately this will be the last. We called much too late to get a reservation and when we were told they had no rooms available. This wasn't the issue. We have always done the boat rentals with them in the past and had no issue. The staff we spoke with told us the rental would be no problem and booked it for us. Meanwhile we found another place to stay since Still Waters didn't have any vacancy. The problem came when we showed up to get our boat rental and were told, for the first time, that they can't rent to people not staying on their resort. Our issue doesn't lie with that problem, I'm sure it's an insurance policy or something,  however my family (as well as another family we travel with) made the 4+ hour drive down with the sole purpose to rent a boat for two days out on the water. The staff never offered an apology, they seemed very uninformed and shooed us off to another marina with the possibility of renting there. Thankfully, that other Marina actually had one last availability for us so that our trip wasn't a complete waste! But can you imagine driving all that way under the impression you had two full days reserved to boat and then told it wasn't available? I'm glad we found the other marina! Communication is key and I hope the staff is better trained so this doesn't happen to someone else!Family trip we had a variety of  condos. One two story, lake view with sunroom, one two bedroom with small living room kitchen combo and hotel style with two queens small kitchen. The vanity in motel style also out in room.  You have to put a deposit on half the total cost! All the rooms are overpriced and outdated!! Bedspreads loved like from 1990s! No maid service. You must exchange towels before 2 or ot of luck. The swimming pools look MUCH larger on website. All very small and for children! There are some new resorts that you want to consider. We loved Big Cedar too if you're going to pay a lot.It was our first time to Branson and we were going to stay at a hotel until we got a Groupon offer for this resort.  So we thought we treat ourselves to an upgrade.  Boy did we, it was very nice and more than we expected.  It was a quite, clean, and spacious condo.  It felt like a home away from home.  Plus we were not expecting a washer and dryer and it came in handy.  What a view we had of the lake which we thoroughly enjoy since we don't see water all the time.  The staff was friendly and very informative.  It was nice that it was away from the busy Branson area that it felt like we were somewhere else when we settled down for the evening.  Well worth the stay.  We will have to come back someday and take advantage of all the free amenities that they offer.This was a beautiful resort located very close to Silver Dollar City. We were in a 3 bedroom condo which was very spacious. The master bedroom and bathroom were huge! There was an enclosed sunroom but there were so many bugs in that room. It looked like no one had cleaned that area for a long time. Needless to say, we all avoided that room but it wasn't a deal breaker. It was so hot outside, nobody wanted to sit in the sunroom anyways. The resort was very big. They had several pools to choose from. One of the pools we went to had a waterfall, shallow wading area, and lots of slides. There was also a hot tub that seated 20 people. The lake was nearby so we got some paddle boats which were free of charge. I would recommend this resort to anyone. It's a nice place to stay while in Branson especially if you have multiple families on the tirp. You can split the cost since there are several bedrooms in each condo.This was a pretty nice change of scenery, situated on a big lake with all kinds of water rentals to help you take advantage.  There are also great pools of course.The rooms are pretty spacious and include kitchens so you can cook whatever you want on your stay.   The ability to cook is always great when you have been traveling for a while.My family and I stay here in the spring and fall when they have their discount rates. We all love it here! We usually stay in a 2 bedroom condo. So much room and so peaceful. This place always makes you feel like you are on the relaxing vacation you have been dreaming of. The kids love to put crackers on the patio and watch the squirrels eat them. This place is the reason we buy season passes to Silver Dollar City every year!! So convenient! This fall we have a 3 bedroom condo on the lake (family is growing) and we can't wait for vacation time!!!Took a 3 day weekend and stayed here at a friend's suggestion for our visit to Silver Dollar City.  Great location in that respect!!  Also a great location to get to various places with nice lake views off Indian Point.  We enjoyed the amenities of our room in Building D (kitchenette, jacuzzi) and also liked having a very nice hot tub a short walk away (at the Oasis Pool).  Will stay here again... however as some other reviewers mentioned you hear and smell everything going on with your neighbors (ours opted for grilled onions with their dinner one night).  Also after a long day of coaster riding we chilled on the couch watching tv, but had to do so through very poor reception.Not at all what I expected- Stayed in a lake front one bedroom condo.   Paying $200+ a night I had fairly high expectations. After researching online and getting a recommendation from a friend my husband and I decided to come here to celebrate and enjoy a weekend away from home. However, I was surprised when we arrived. The rooms were very outdated, bathrooms extremely small and the bedding was disgusting with pilly sheets. To make matters worse we were on the bottom floor on the corner of the complex so we had the pleasure of hearing every door shut, kid scream, and patron walk by. Not only that put the honor of having multiple people use our patio as a resting spot on there way down to the docks. Another thing I found off was the resorts procedures of checking out. You are required to clean your room. If they find it to be dirty your card will be charged a minimum of $250. This means you must vacuum, sweep, and take out the trash... All the things I don't want to do on a vacation. Over all our experience was poor. I would  not recommend this resort for the price you are paying. If your looking for a relaxing getaway this is not the place for you. However, if your looking for a great place to take the kids this is the place for you! For everyone else- your better off staying at the Hilton.This place is wonderful for kids all ages! We have a 13, 10, and 5 year old and all of them liked it! Where can you find a place like that? We stayed in building K room 250 and it was lovely. Two bedroom, two bath, jacuzzi tub, shower, living room, kitchen, and washer and dryer! With all kids being boys and my hubby hardcore Into Crossfit, I was thrilled to see a washer and dryer in the place! I love washing the clothes so I don't have to do it when we get back...not to mention not having that nasty disgusting smell of sweat for days! No room service to tidy the place but no biggie. Lake view, although a tree is right in front but that provides great shade on our patio. Every morning we would feed the geese below our room. Kiddos loved it. Free paddle boats, kayaks, and you can rent boats or jet skis for a price. Totally worth it. Really nice pools that have a waterfall and another which have a small slide.  Great place if you want something close to Silver Dollar City. Literally right down the street only 2-3 minute drive! Would recommend and have. Great time.Completely overpriced!  We've been going to Stillwater's resort for the last 10 years, and this was definitely our last.   From the now outdated and run down rooms to the staff that has no clue what is going on, this was a very disappointing stay.  The pillows we had we're not only stained but horrible to sleep on!  The furniture is old, dirty and outdated.  The sleeper sofas aren't really a sleeping option like they like to tell you.  The floor would be a better option than sleeping on the pull out.  The staff had not only messed up my reservation, but messed up my sisters as well and even double booked a room during our stay.  The boat slip reservation was again botched..... All of which the front desk repeatedly never owned up to their own mistakes. C'mon Stillwaters, spend some of that money you gouged people for and do some updating and hire some guest service that are competent.  The check out procedure is just as ridiculous.  Who wants to vacuum and do the dishes while on vacation?? About the only thing this place has going for it is theproximity to Table rock lake.  For the amout per night at this place..... Go to Cabo or Maui,  your chances of having a relaxing stay will be greater!We have stayed here once before and are now here over the Christmas week. Both times had a 2 bedroom condo. Very comfortable and spacious. Great price, especially off season. Large king room with jet tub. Great view of lake. Large second room with two queens. Really close to our favorite park - Silver Dollar City!  Would highly recommend and would stay here again!","Stayed in one of their condos for a week on our family vacation this past spring break. It location was great right on the lake I would wake up and look at the beautiful lake. The place is nice and quiet and the staff is extremely friendly. They have boat rental and paddle boats for rent. Their boat rental staff was really nice and really helpful. We took a boat out for 4 hours and it was about $230 after everything. They have a little store that has just about everything you could need or forgot and they are really nice.Went to Still Waters over my birthday weekend May 2012.  Used a Groupon for the 2 bedroom condo.  The room was nice, had a master suite with a two person jacuzzi tub and king bed.  The shower was very small in the master and the bed was a little firm.  The second room had two queen beds and a full bathroom.  The Groupon said there was a $50 credit for the marina.  We had read previous reviews that said they didn't allow previous guest to use them on the waverunners but we called and asked in advance.  Front desk said no problem but the marina gave us a hard time before taking the credit.  Not sure why they give people a hard time about that when there weren't any waverunners rented out at the time we were there.  Marina closes at 5 which seems early to me.  Very family oriented place, there were lots of kids but for the most part they were good.  One of the verticle blinds fell off the sliding glass door and the charlie bar for the door was broken.  There wasn't bars of soap anywhere, showers or bathrooms which seemed odd to me.  But the place was nice, we got it at a very reasonable cost and had a very nice weekend away from the city.  I would go back but not during their busy season, I think there would be way too many kids running around.You pass Silver Dollar City to get to this resort so it is a good spot if you plan on visiting SDC and want to stay out of the traffic nightmares in Branson. This resort had great amenities-right on the lake, free kayaks, paddleboats, tubes, and bikes. Our two bedroom covered back porch faced one of the three pools. That was very handy, especially with kids. The other two pools were very nice-one had a long waterslide for all ages, the other, the Oasis-a zero entry pool set up like a beach with a 15 ft waterfall and 20 person hot tub. I enjoyed the pool beds outside to lounge. Our weather was not great while there so we did not get to enjoy the lake but the marina was nice and lots of boat and waverunner rentals. The small store/cafe on grounds was nice. We had some good biscuits and gravy every morning for breakfast. We stayed in building E so we had the playground in the front of us, a pool to the back. The store and other two pools were just a short walk. My only complaint is the walls of the condo were not very soundproof so when our neighbors upstairs would walk around or use water (shower, toilet) we heard it. I also did not like no daily maid service. You had to go exchange your dirty towels each day and they were only available from 9-2 so if you are out and about in town all day as we were, you would miss your window of opportunity. The kitchen had everything we needed although we needed nothing-who cooks on vacation?  All in all I give it 3 stars. When it comes to hotels in Branson, there is not much that is just spectacular. So given the 3 cool pools, the freebies to use and the location away from it all, being on the lake with nice access, I will be staying here again. Just have to ask for better weather next time!!!We stayed here a couple years ago. We enjoyed a large condo with a 2 person whirlpool and a fireplace on the lake. we didn't really get to enjoy the amenities of the resort because it was later in the fall, but very relaxing place away from the busy ness of Branson. I am not sure the yelp location on the map is correct though, because this resort is actually on Indian point.",,,,"['thanksgiving', 'break', 'great', 'experience', 'able', 'walk', 'water', 'look',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-promenade-at-branson-landing-branson,Hilton Promenade at Branson Landing,4.0,$$$,31,"We thought this hotel was great.  Our room was up to date, clean and had plenty of room.  It has a huge bathroom and shower.  Our balcony looked out on the shopping area.  We spent some time out on the balcony that evening and watched as the shops closed up and the restaurant &amp; bar traffic picked up. It is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for at this hotel.  Highly recommend.Great location next to Branson landing. Starbucks is right across the street. Valet parking staff is extremely nice. Room was quite. A train track is very close by but I only heard the train go by one time early evening. I don't know if the rooms are similar but mine was more like a one bedroom condo with full kitchen, huge bathroom with large shower and spa tub. Lovely living room and balcony with outside table and chairs. I would stay here again.From the moment we walked in we felt taken care of! We spilled our sons milk from the car and the reservation person said, here have another! So kind! That is a true act of delighting a customer. She gets it! Rooms were very clean! Everything seemed new. The valet and bellman were quick and personable. The pool was clean. Location couldn't be better! We would stay there again!I should start by saying that I did not stay here, I only attended an afternoon meeting. The meeting rooms was very nice as was the lobby. Ample parking at the garage next door. Food was also good. Good looking lobby and nice area.This room was detached from the main facility so you'll have to walk back to the restaurant and Lobby.It had a great view of the fountains and there are a lot of businesses within easy walking distance.I was given a condo with a full kitchen, bar and Jacuzzi....what's not to like? Everything was really fresh and contemporary.Not what you'd expect from rural MO...well it's Branson.stayed here for two nights with our dog. the actual unit was very nice. full kitchen, large bathroom, spacious bedroom, balcony, and washer/dryer. they had a little ""gift bag"" for our pup which included doggy bags, treats, deodorizer and such. it was a nice touch. location was also really nice. right in the middle of branson landing which is a strip of stores and restaurants. downside of this hotel is that they have no free wifi. it's 2014 and i was expecting some free wifi. they charge $10 per day per device which is absurd... maybe because we come from large cities. i also called the concierge and asked to get our room serviced since our dog was occupying the space in the morning and the response I got was a rude ""what exactly do you need?""we also paid extra to have valet service during our stay but they're never in plain sight. they're in their staff office. the concierge also told us to get them in their office... there's nothing more awkward than having to go behind desks to someone's workspace to look for them... esp when the concierge could have got them or even called them for us. you can park for free at belk store, at the end of the promenade. also check-out it at 11am, not 12 like it says on their guest services book (clearly not up to date).I have been to many hotels and nothing upsets me more than charging for wifi. Seriously. It is nothing more than an avenue for making money. I own a hotel and create the value by giving free wifi among other amenities. I will never stay here again.  Sure it's a basic new construction hotel but where is the value? There isn't. I should have stayed at The Chateau on The Lake. It's nicer same price when booked through travel site.2 stars due to greed.Wow what a great location for a hotel! This place rocks! All the staff are super friendly and the breakfast is really good. This hotel is attached to Branson Landing, so you're only a few steps away from all the shops and restaurants. There's also a Starbuck's right across the street and the Branson Scenic Railroad boards across the street as well. This hotel is also a short uphill walk to Walgreens, the old down town shops and my new favorite place to eat, the Farmhouse Restaurant.This hotel looks really new, it's clean, well kept and super quite at night. The bed and pillows are ultra comfortable, and there's a nice sized bathroom with a big walk-in glass shower and full-size tub. The closet has plenty of hanging space and features a good size digital safe. The LG flatscreen TV has Directv and there's plenty of nice furniture and a mini fridge too. We have really enjoyed the 5 days and 4 nights we've spent here. On our next visit, we WILL stay here again!After a mix up with an online booking company, the staff was quick to make things right. I have to say ""Ed at the front desk is the man!"" He went above and beyond any expectations of customer service. The room and the rest of the staff was great. We can't wait to come back again.Very nice hotel. Seems to be on the newer side of things. All rooms come pretty equipped. For example our room had a mini fridge, lots and lots of towels, a bath and separate shower, etc. They are spacious rooms too. As others have said, this is one of those hotels where you pay for everything from parking, to wi-fi, to breakfast. This is not surprising, as I have learned that the fancier and more expensive the hotel, the less amenities you get. I'm tempted to knock off a star for that BS, but it seems to be the industry standard. It is a nice place with a great location if you're wanting to be in The Landing area, but be prepared to pay a pretty penny for your room ($200) and for any other services too.I highly recommend this place when visiting the Branson area. The Condo Suites are so spacious, especially when traveling with the Family. The suites remind me of our Hilton Grand Vacation Club Resort property! So many top notch restaurants in walking distance. The historic downtown Branson is just a hop and skip away!I originally planned and prepaid for a seven night stay at the Branson Hilton Promenade. When I checked in I went to a room on the fifth floor that smelled musty and smoky. I asked for a new room and was promptly given another room. The new room, also in the fifth floor was immaculately cleaned, spacious and well appointed. There was an abundance of plush towels and quality amenities available. The valet staff were lightning quick, respectful and extremely helpful without being pushy. Bob was a earful of cheer and seemed to really love his job. Thanks, Bob. Unfortunately there are detail problems with this hotel, and as we all know it is the details that will make or break any business. The carpet in the room and in the hall on the fifth floor has a huge roll in it causing a potential trip hazard, Since Branson was built on the newlywed and the nearly dead, I think it is time to straighten out the carpet before the Hilton ends up buying some unsuspecting poor senior citizen a new hip.The signage in the elevator and on the walls that direct what to do in an emergency is chipped, peeled and in many places illegible. This is a major violation. The public areas need a thorough dusting (mirrors, furniture, tables). At 0745 I was jarred awake by the sounds of a jackhammer as repairs were being made to the promenade near the fountain. The hotel needs someone who is going to oversee the details. Great staff, great location, the price point doesn't leave anyone feeling like they got a deal but they got  what they paid for.Very nice, newish, modern hotel on the Landing.  Our room had modern fixtures and comfortable beds.  My only major complaint is that the water pressure in the bathroom was weak and the water never got anywhere near hot enough.  We saw a plaque in the lobby that said this a ""green hotel"", so maybe that's it?  I had the chance to visit one of the condo rooms, and wow!  It was a gorgeous suite with a kitchen stocked with pots/pans/dishes/small appliances, a huge bathroom, and a balcony.  If you had a family and wanted to cook instead of eating at crappy restaurants the whole time you're in Branson, this would be a great option.Overall a comfortable place to stay in Branson.One of the biggest thing this has going for it, is that it's attached to Branson Landing.The room was above average, but the constant loud fan on the AC/furnace was a little off putting at first. No, you cannot turn it off...trust me. Our room overlooked the lower roof, as well as train tracks. I'd advise asking for a room with a different view if possible.  The windows were almost floor to ceiling in our double-queen room.  The beds were comfortable; a small fridge and water were provided.  The bathroom had a decent sized tub (no 'Holiday Inn' tub) and a good size walk in shower separate.  It was a bit confusing to find our room, as the arrows did point us in two different directions, as someone else also mentioned.Self parking and valet parking are available, both at a fee.  We didn't interact much with the staff, but those that we did, were polite.The stores at Branson Landing are mostly chains, but there were a few that were new to me; the restaurants have a bit of variety.  If you want a place that you don't really have to go more than 6 blocks for shopping, snacks or dining (chains), this is convenient, and easy to get to from the highway.Best spot in Branson which sets the bar low, but we found the staff friendly and helpful. We were ready to head home until the front desk set us up with an upgrade. Our room had a balcony which overlooked the Landing shops. We enjoyed our stay and will be back.Not a good experience. We have stayed here before and it was better. We arrived early, check in is at 4, but we had a sick baby so we thought we would try to get into a room. We asked at 1:30 how long it would be and we were told 1 hour. So we waited in the lobby. After an hour and a half we were told it still wasn't ready. Several others were checking in early though. We didn't get in our room until 4:10. Pool water was frigid. Mini fridge not cold. Dust on desk. Dirty lampshades. Bell hops were kind. Air conditioner not great. Not worth the money.Really nice hotel. Best location if you want to be around the Landing. I mean, the hotel is directly in the middle of the strip next to the fountain. My bf and I booked a king deluxe room but when I checked in they said they were having a problem with their A/C or something (prob a made up excuse but i didn't care) so they had to give us a 2 queen bed deluxe room. For the inconvenience (which really there was none) they gave us 4 breakfast buffet vouchers b/c we stayed there 2 nights. And free vallet parking or garage parking. Parking would have been $10 a day and each breakfast buffet was $18! So I am very happy about their customer service.Bedroom was very clean and they had a big tub and a stand up shower. They told me my room was overlooking the strip but it wasn't. Was overlooking the train station but the trains never woke us up. Just a heads up they'll charge you $100 on your card but will be removed the day after you leave. They didn't tell me the dollar amount but I guess that's a usual amount.We stayed at the Hilton at Branson Landing for its great location!  Everything you want is right there at the Landing....but the review is for the actual hotel.  Parking is $10@day for self park, or $14@day for valet....which is right nxt to self park.  HmmWe were given a ""suite"" in south tower...which is in a separate building...I'm guessing ""suite"" means no tub, shower only, mini fridge, microwave and empty cupboards.  Really? Do some ppl actually travel with utensils, cups, bowls etc?Our room had a great balcony, with the best view of the Landing!!!  Which we enjoyed for the first night.  Our a/c quit wrking, the engineer explained that it would not be fixed that night, and offered to change rooms. He called the front desk, and was instructed to ""send us down"".....excuse me?  It was pouring rain and the front desk was in a separate building!  The engineer did the legwork for us, opened our new room, turned the lights on and offered to carry our bags.  Sadly, our new room faced the parking lot :(The Hilton boasts an upscale steak restaurant, and we came prepared with dresses and heels to treat ourselves.  Didn't happen:  the restaurant is in again a third building across the mains treat and across the train tracks at the convention ctr. It's still pouring rain, and again, to valet out car is that trek over to bldg number one. Like other reviewers, I expected more, certainly for the price. The best part of the hotel is it's location......did this Hilton grow too quickly for its managers to handle with that Hilton finesse we look for and expect? Maybe so.Very disappointed, when we arrived I asked about pool and they said its closed. Which it did not say when I booked it online. I spent over hour choosing and picked this one for pool for my son. They did say they would shuttle us across to other Hilton but who wants to do that and in a swim suit. Our towels were torn and raggy. Our toilet runs unless we fix it. When the air conditioner comes on it sounds like a plane taling off. We have to turn the tv up to hear it over the air.  Also had house keeping come in our room next morning knocking on the bathroom door! Saying housekeeping, while my son was asleep in the bed right there. Felt very weird!  Also was told there is a full working restaurant forn all day all meals, ours was only open for breakfast. The tv was also pretty small considering this is a Hilton. Had bigger tvs at way cheaper hotels.     Which for a over 200$ night room I think we are just paying for high ceiling and granite sink top and the Hilton name.a reluctant midwestern native who fled as soon as humanly possible and tries to NEVER return, i found myself in the unique position of needing to visit branson a couple of weeks ago, for the first time.  though i've been as far as springfield, i tend to try to stay in Kansas City when i have to visit, and venture no farther in any direction until i can board mci and return to the safety and comfort and sanity of california.anyway, the point is, i had to go to branson a couple of weeks ago, for unpleasant reasons, and as such, decided to book a room at what seemed to be one of the nicest hotels in the area - despite having options that cost as much as 75% less - to sort of soothe the agony of being in the ozarks.  (though to be fair, the ozarks aren't bad, as it turned out - it's just everything between there and kc that was excruciating.)okay, clearly i keep digressing here.  this is not intend to be a negative review of missouri, but rather a positive review of this hotel.it was exactly everything i'd hoped for.  the front desk was pleasant and accommodating and allowed me to check in five hours early, giving me a room on the highest floor with a view of the pub next door (this was a good view, for me, allowing me to not have to think too hard about where to dine that evening).  the room itself was lovely - clean and comfortable, and the bed was delicious.  it was a really great room for $150 - i have not a single complaint, other than the lack of free wi-fi, which for that rate in that area should certainly be included.i can't speak for any other services or amenities - i was in and out in less than 18 hours - but the loveliness of the room, the great location, and the friendliness of the staff made what would've otherwise been a soulcrushing visit into something that wasn't at all unpleasant.ergo, i imagine that if one is stopping in to branson for fun and relaxation, this would be a top contender for accommodations, given the quality of the hotel and its proximity to shopping, dining, and local attractions.of note, check in before you park - you'll need the key card to enter.i'm rating this as 'pricey' because for the area, it is, and also, that wi-fi thing irks me.","I love ya, Hilton, but I've only had one other hotel experience worse than the one I had at the Hilton Promenade at Branson Landing.From the parking attendants to the front desk to housekeeping, the staff was neither friendly nor welcoming, nor did they inform us of the cost for self-parking our car. I would have overlooked that had there been signage at the entrance or anywhere within the parking garage.I'm no dummy, and neither is the woman I was traveling with. But gosh did we have the hardest time finding our room! the signage for 412 leads you in two directions and you've gotta pick the right one to get to the room without circling the entire floor.Our room was clean but unremarkable, and hardly worth $179 plus all sorts of additional fees, which I think is crazy high for Branson. The hotel itself contains a lot of trendy furnishings and maybe that's what one pays for here. I can tell you it sure ain't the housekeeping. Does this hotel not believe in having service staff on site 24/7 to pick up after guests who understandably have a tendency to leave trash, gum wrappers and other things on hard surfaces around a hotel?In the room itself, we couldn't get the thermostat to hold at a cool enough temperature, so sleeptime was too warm and very uncomfortable. I always appreciate having a fridge in the room, so there's a positive point in this otherwise negative review.An upside that there was a significant amount of mold around the shower, because there was so little water pressure (I had to rinse the shampoo out of my hair by sticking my head under the tub faucet) and limited hot water, we spent little time using it. With the controls all the way to hot, my shower was lukewarm at best. My friend bypassed hers. Who wants a cold shower on a chilly morning, right?Wanting to grab a quick breakfast, we opted for the restaurant in the hotel. Seemingly most of the staff called in sick. The menu was rather limited for breakfast, but we got by on it.And hey Hilton, wasn't I supposed to get water or a USA Today or something as a result of my Hilton Honors status? Nada.I don't expect to ever visit Branson again. But if I do, I'll stay elsewhere.We stayed here for almost a week.  The rooms were very nice and clean because the hotel was still very new.  Housekeeping was ok. Staff was ok. They did have every utensil that we needed to cook with. It was nice to be able to save money on breakfast and we just ate lunch and dinner out. The pool was so small and it was indoors. The weight room was also very small. The parking was awful. Especially if you have kids and you are toting a lot of luggage.  We stayed in the south tower so it was really far away from parking garage. They charge you for parking but then you have to walk quite a ways. Either stay in the north tower or pay a bell hop to tote your bags unless you don't mind a hike. Other than that it was a really nice location. It was nice to be located just off the strip but still with plenty of restaurants with in walking distance. Over all I would stay here again.Nice Place.  The rooms are very nice.  Everything is extra.  Parking is $8, two coffee packets in your room, etc.  No complimentary anything.Pool and hot is small and crowded withe families.Exercise room is small but nice.  Free weights!I've stayed here 4 times in the last few years.  I've always travelled to Branson alone on business.  I was originally referred to this hotel and have always had a great experience.  I've stayed in both towers and have once stayed in a suite.  The rooms were always consistently comfortable and I've always obtained a great rate.  I know rates are dictated by time of year, occupancy expectations and competitors rates.  I was taken by my local client to the Chateau yesterday for drinks and it was quite an impressive property.  I personally like the location of the Hilton Promenade.  The shops and restaurants are right here.   Unfortunately I have not had enough free time on my trips to Branson to get around beyond the Promenade but I look forward to this experience every time.  I've used the pool, fitness center and hot tub.  It's all very small and have not been in the facilities when there's more than one or two people so I could see where that could become crowded and uncomfortable to use.  The restaurant downstairs has never worked out for me other than a coffee to go.  There isn't an onsite bar that I've ever seen, and I've not done any room service.  This trip it doesn't appear available as I was going to order a small plate last night and a bottle of wine.  Good thing the bars are literally across the sidewalk but weather can for sure be an issue whether rain or snow.  I've been lucky for the most part on my travels and experiences here but I can see with ""travel"" in general some things could nerve someone easily.  Overall.  I would recommend this Hilton.Seriously one of the nicest Hilton's I have ever stayed in.  I stay in hotels for work over 40 nights a year... and this one takes the cake.  Very spacious rooms, several good restaurants w/in the promenade area, and friendly staff.  If you can get upgraded to a condo, take it!  One of the nicest room upgrades I have ever seen.  Great price for Branson... pay the few extra $$ from the other places and treat yourself... It's a great place!Great hotel with spacious rooms which sits on the landing with all the shops so very convenient.  Beautiful view of Lake Taneycomo which is perfect for the dinner cruise.  Staff are great and indoor pool is perfect for kids no matter what the weather outisde,Good Hilton - location cant be beat. Wish it had a concierge lounge. Very comfortable and staff is excellent.Nice, comfortable hotel. I've stayed here here 3 times over the last 5 years and it's always been nice. You're walking distance to lots of modern shopping and restaurants. Always great staff too.The staff at this property was amazing, they were very friendly. The rooms were pretty much impeccable, spacious and bright - and the beds... oh the beds, were EXTREMELY comfortable (as all Hilton beds seem to be!). The property is on the Branson Landing, meaning you are within walking distance to, probably, 100 different stores including restaurants. It is in a very convenient location for tourism and people just there to shop! Right outside the side door of the Hilton you can see a number of shows, including concerts, while I was there they had a water show with lights and, oh my, fire! It was just breathtaking. If you're going to be in Branson... this is where you should be, honestly!I only had breakfast at their restaurant. Breakfast at the Liberty Tavern was great every morning, it's a great place to relax, read the paper and have your cup o' coffee. For the most part it's quiet, of course this is a hotel, so you can expect a family or two at any time and the noise level may go up just a bit.<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.libertytavern.com%2Fbranson%2F&amp;s=216546f7443f7bd8c89fd933743c2048e38a48f524659761fce966005e614c14"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">libertytavern.com/branson</a>The only thing that could make this property better? For me... if it were 100% Non-Smoking. The room I was in was Non-Smoking and I didn't detect smoke during my stay at the hotel, so all was not lost!This is a fantastic place to stay in Branson. This was my third time to stay at the Hilton Promenade and it won't be my last. Check in was incredibly fast and was facilitated by a clerk named Ted who was extremely nice, helpful and accommodating and answered all questions. This property seldom disappoints. Like I said it's my third stay so I am very happy with it. The bell staff is a little pressed when a large group checks out but not too badly. Rooms are quite large and very well decorated. You WILL love these rooms. You will MADLY love the bathrooms. They are huge! Wonderful fluffy towels. Great toiletries. Comfy beds. Spend the extra money and get a suite. The kitchens are terrific too. I really can't say enough good things about this hotel. Great staff, good parking situation to. They have valet and self parking. Lots of good shopping at the Promenade next door, downtown shops and a really fun dinner train and cruises on Lake Tanneycomo. Great indoor pool and exercise facilities. It's a great place to stay, trust me.kind of a dog house. Dogs were everywhere. I didn't realize they allowed dogs. One pooped in the lobby . Gross. They really should rethink the policy. It is a nice property,good location.   But i don't like dog hair in my room, or dog smell:(",,,,"['thought', 'hotel', 'great', 'room', 'date', 'clean', 'plenty', 'room', 'huge', 'bathroom', 'shower', 'balcony', 'looked', 'shopping',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/lodge-of-the-ozarks-branson,Lodge Of The Ozarks,2.0,$$,11,"They have a nice reception area with spacious rooms. However I found the lighting in the room to be insufficient. And the bathroom door gets in your way when get in or out. So you have to maneuver yourself around it. Also I found the bathtub to be a little small though I'm a little person but I still couldn't move freely. I couldn't imagine how a big person would feel in there. Oh! And how can I forget the air conditioning made a roaring noise like a truck engine whenever it started. I don't know how my husband slept through that noise but I had a tough time.The hotel looks promising when you drive up. The lobby looks nice.However, once you step in the rooms you get a shock. The carpet needs major updating, the lighting is horrible and dark. It's hard to see anything. There isn't enough plug-ins for the amount of electronics that people have now these days. The beds are horribly painful and the sheets need updating. The bathroom I had was a jacuzzi tub and it's nice. I didn't try the pool as it looked dirty.  There is no frills or freebies here. You get watered down coffee in the morning. The AC/Heat units don't work like they should. Get units that have a constant fan on option. If you check in here make sure to get a room away from the pool, no joining rooms, and away from main traffic areas. There are plenty of loud kids that will keep you awake.The staff that I dealt with were pleasant.  Except when the incompetent rude stupid general manager is around. He's rude to his employees in front of guests. I wish I could have a few choice words to him. But he should learn to treat his employees with care.We checked into this hotel through price line. When we checked in we noticed the front check in employee looked worn down and was wearing an old looking wrinkled shirt. She did not look like she wanted to be there. When we got to the room it was outdated and smelled. The bed spread had at least 25 different stains on it and the pillows stunk and had grease stains on them. We called house keeping and house keeping explained to us that they don't wash the bed spreads that often. Needless to say we checked out within 30 minutes of checking and drove an hour to find another hotel in Springfield. Do yourself a favor and don't even waste your time or money checking into this dirty outdated hotel.We had an extremely large group and they were accommodating to all of us running around, but that's the extent of the pros for this establishment. If you are okay with sleeping on the floor, then you'd be okay with this hotel. The beds are so hard that we all woke up with sore backs. The water pressure isn't too bad like at other hotels, but the water would get really hot or cold randomly. The cleaning staff was slightly sporadic, too. One day, We were out of our hotel room for 6 hours, and when we came back, one room had been cleaned, but not the one next door. We had a lot of trouble with our doors working. The keys would suddenly stop working and we had maintenance look at the door several times. They quoted us $70/night, but when we checked in, the rate went up to $95/night. Very unprofessional to raise a rate, especially by $25/night. They also claim they have free wifi, but it doesn't connect to any device.Full disclosure, this was our first trip to Branson and we grabbed a deal via Groupon because the Lodge was close to White Waters and seemed like a great location, being as it was right on the strip.Everything was pretty bare bones, on par with the cheaper chain hotels but without the national chain accountability. The exterior and lobby look promising but the rooms are definitely no frills. Semi-working shower, no mini fridge, laughable 17"" TV and air-conditioner that needed to be repeatedly rigged to work properly. To be fair, you don't come to Branson to stay in your room but we never looked forward to coming back after a long day of tourist things. Beds were clean but uncomfortable, on-site breakfast was disappointing and pool was dirty. Staff was mostly friendly but didn't go out of their way for us (a request for extra towels was met with skepticism). All together we paid about $40/night thanks to a Groupon deal so no complaints there. I wouldn't pay full price though.How about we get with the times and add another entrance that can be accessed after 11:00 p.m. Kinda sucks when you're hauling in a ton of stuff and your placed at the very end of the hall. Honestly, at least one back entrance should be added for convenience and it certainly would suffice. Another point, you should really make it clear that you only give 2 complimentary breakfast vouchers per night stay. Instead your website only says free complimentary hot breakfast buffet not only 2 per stay and you pay for the rest of your party. Very misleading. People often base their hotel selection on the amenities and if you aren't clear, you tend to disappoint your customers. So how about we be upfront with that from the beginning. We also booked a ""premier room."" The mattresses were in no way ""premier.""  They were in comfortable and were so bouncy it felt like I was on a trampoline. Certainly not premier in my book, just a slightly bit bigger room and slightly nicer furniture. Overall, it was all misleading. I have been more impressed with other hotels in Branson that seemed lower end.Very helpful staff. Great room very clean. Full breakfast little cramped serving line hard to navigate. Over all worth revisit.While the rooms were excellent, the staff hepfull,the buffet was bad. Most of the time the dishes were dirty,hash browns cold, and the coffee was hard to get. I found water caffe had grease or was not cleaned. I think site needs to address cleaning of dishes. Also exercise equipment was in need of repair.This place was probably real nice in the 90s, but it's a dump now.  It badly needs to be updated and shown some tlc.  The bedspread was gross, there are stains everywhere, every piece of equipment in the gym is broken, and nothing looks very clean except for the lobby.  Two stars for the staff being pretty friendly.Old and dirty.  Stains all over the room.  Sheets are stained.  This hotel needs to spend some money and spring for new carpet.  WiFi is crap, its clearly undersized, so no one can use it, because its saturated.  This is just a crap hole hotel.This place, from the outside, looks like it should be one of the better hotels on the strip.  Unfortuntely, looks can be decieving.Best thing about it.  Indoor pool.Last time we stayed there, we had to switch rooms because of a water leak from above that had to been going on for sometime, because the little plastic thing on the door that list the rates and tells you your fire escape was filled with water and mold.So they moved up to a room with a balcony overlooking the pool.  What they didn't tell us was that the thermostats to those rooms don't work.  Mind you this was in May and our room was a toasty 80 degrees all night, which meant we slept with the door propped open.The resteraunt can't seem to decide if it's actual in business or not and the nightclub seems to go out of business every other week.  One of the reasons we picked the place in the first place was it was supposed to be one of the few hotels that actual had a club attached to it, so we could enjoy a cocktail after a day of sightseeing (which is pretty damn hard to find in Branson).  No such luck this time.And by the way, why is it so hard to find a drink in Branson?  I mean, I know it's got that ""family friendly"" thing and every damn show up there has to have at least three gospel songs in it, but really?  Surely I'm not the only one who would enjoy just listening to some music and having a beer.I will relate a neat story about the Lodge.  The night in question, we went down to the club, expecting to grab a drink.  The door to the club was unlocked, so we went on in.  Imagine our suprise to find the room dark, with just some service lights on.  The room had been prepped for a high school prom for the next night.  On the stage was a boombox that the workers had been listening to while working, with a microphone placed in front of the speaker, so it would feed through the PA.Well, the radio was on, very softly and the music gently filled the room.  Right next to it was a foot control for the lighting system.  I clicked a couple of switches, turned on the mirrored ball and my wife and I shared a private prom all our own.  It was pretty special and made up for all the other stuff.",,,,,"['nice', 'reception', 'area', 'spacious', 'rooms', 'however', 'found', 'lighting', 'room', 'insufficient', 'bathroom', 'door', 'gets',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/chateau-on-the-lake-resort-spa-and-convention-center-branson,Chateau On the Lake Resort Spa & Convention Center,4.0,$$$,48,"This review is about the staff at the Chateau on the Lake. I went down for a conference yesterday. The food was great. Clean facility and gorgeous views. However, I'm a new mom and needed to pump throughout the day. I wasn't a guest, so I found the public restroom and set up shop. A staff member, Andrea, came in to use the restroom and noticed me. She was most helpful and sweet in offering me a complimentary guest room for privacy. She excused herself to make the arrangements. Unfortunately, all of the rooms were full, but that didn't stop her for going above and beyond. Andrea with the Spa at the Chateau manager, Brandi, arranged for me to come to the spa to pump at convenience. I wasn't a guest. I was just a conference attendee. Yet, the staff went above and beyond for a new mom. I will definitely recommend this venue for future staycations and conferences.The facility is absolutely beautiful. The food was delicious. The conference accommodations was great. The only thing lacking was the housekeeping. They only did an okay job. The room was great but they did a soso <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjob.cleaning&amp;s=1254e42fb33662678ad46031587056c4b7ec2b58967a7ff7ffee5b677e8fcfd8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">job.cleaning</a>. On the last day they cleaned it they did not even replace the coffee so we had to go downstairs and buy coffee from the coffee shop.Luxury everywhere you look, from the castle on a mountain you see from a distance to the view of Table Rock Lake from your room.  Valet parking, cheerful staff, beautiful furnishing in the rooms; thick, soft towels, comfy bed, lots of pillows, peaceful.  Two pools, several restaurant areas and rooms to relax in as well as a gift shop.We stayed two nights, used the free valet service every time and ate breakfast once.  The blueberry pancakes were awesome with lots of coffee.  The only poor review would be the cheap toilet paper &amp; tissues.  Go figure!  Also, the tub drained slowly, but no major complaints.  Our room didn't have a fridge, which was a surprise.  We never thought to ask about that, but our meds had to stay in our cooler. Overall, great experience!The hotel/resort is very friendly. The staff tends to your every need without being intrusive. There are two pools indoor and outdoor. Children's playground and tennis courts. The restaurants, though few are adequate and serve delicious food. On Friday and Saturday they offer milk and cookies at your bedside (sign up at front desk for this). They also offer s'mores. On Sunday they offer a brunch from 11-2 that is incredible and worth the money! They also have a sweet shop that's open during the day and evening for snacks and ice cream.I wish I could wax poetic about The Chateau. I won't gush but our weekend was perfect even with the foggy fall weather. Food, decor, room, staff, etc., All perfect. Cannot wait to come back and visit the Spa next time.Wonderful place!  Has a resort feel and is reasonably priced for what you get.  Highly recommend.  Great movie theater, smores, milk and cookie delivery on Fridays (but ya gotta fill out a request card).  The pool is just perfect. The staff are very helpful.  The only thing I can think that would make this place a notch better is having shuttle service to shows and attractions.I was here for a two-day work meeting in August, and it really seemed to be a great place. For an out-of-towner, it was a pain to get to, but anything in Branson would have been around an hour-drive from the nearest airport (Springfield). Upon first arrival, Chateau seems almost magical - like a castle amongst the village. It's literally the largest, most grandiose hotel in the area (at least from what I saw!). The second thought upon arrive was, ""Why didn't we book an extra night??"" The view was breathtaking, the pool was beautiful and the area in general was just wonderful. If you want to work out (which I did, as it was work and not a vacation), hopefully you can swim laps or take a walk outside, because the workout room is nothing to write home about. It was the smallest workout room I've seen at a hotel (particularly of this size), and everything was crammed in together. No stationary bike either, which was a bummer. We had a cocktail hour as part of our meeting, and the appetizers were to-die for. I was so impressed that I was really looking forward to ordering room service...only to be horribly disappointed. I ordered a cobb/chopped salad and avocado fries. Best put, other than the presentation, I could have bet money that the incredibly small salad was leftovers from someone else's plate. The lettuce was soggy and soaked in dressing, and all of the ingredients tasted way less than fresh. On the flip side, the avocado fries were neat and clearly fresh and very tasty. If I was using my own money to pay for that salad, I would have had a word with the kitchen.The rooms were huge - I felt like I was in Vegas! All in all, a great place for the location and cost - just not to exercise or eat at!Great view, great wine, great service. Had a blast at this beautiful restaurant on the lake. We were the only non couple there and had a great girls date night. My steak was delish, salad was fresh and wine was fruit forward. Sit on the patio, enjoy the sunset and eat steak.I love this place!The food is very good. The staff is friendly and helpful. The shower in my large room is beautiful with rain head and hand held!wow - what a wonderful stay - the entire staff was amazing. I LOVED our stay - the comfy room, the full service gluten free meals - breakfast, lunch and supper. The fun boat rental! I was disappointed, my reservation for the spa did not work out. I made reservation for Friday and they wrote it down as Saturday. Oh, well. It was all good. Would definitely stay again! Oh, and I left my husband's shirts in the closet - they put them in the mail today!!!!We ate dinner here before seeing one of the shows. The food was great, however, it took 10 minutes for the waiter to show up with the water. We were almost late for the show. My advice is to dine here when you have ample time to relax and enjoy the fine dining and beautiful scenery.Went to the Chateau Grille for lunch at what must have been an off time because we were the only table.  The food was good but a bit slow.  The staff were very friendly.  We were also given a table next to the windows with an excellent view of Table Rock lake.Nice bar with a great view of the lake. The Dirty Martini with Bleu Cheese stuffed Green Olives  was excellent. Great place to get a drink and enjoy the breathtaking view.The food is gorgeous to the eye and spectacular to the palate. Features regionally grown foods. Sunday Brunch is magnificent!This review is for the casual, no -reservations- needed extension of the Chateau Grill: The Atrium Cafe. We went there on Valentines day mainly because you didn't need a reservation. The food is good, albeit a little pricey for casual dining but par for the course when visiting a hotel restaurant. I had the ""crab and lobster BLT."" Different and pretty good - definitely filling when you add in the fries. But the most interesting item we sampled was the avocado fries. Very tasty but definitely needs dipping sauce or lots of sauce (provided) since an unseasoned avocado slice is fairly bland. Maybe I'm behind the times but if this is a new item, I'm going to bet on it as the next food trend - replacing kale and everything Sriracha!We have been coming here for twenty years for Thanksgiving brunch. We always booked months in advance, and pre-paid. This time, it was unfortunate., They were overbooked, so they put us in a tiny side room. No ambiance, no music, as well as being seated at  fold away tables, so we were all uncomfortable hitting the legs with our legs. (We are all tall). I asked to be moved, but was told then the waitress wouldn't have enough tables. Yep, that's our problem. Yeah, wonder why no one else wanted to sit in there? It ruined our thanksgiving tradition. Too bad. Management was unresponsive and uncaring. But, we will go to the Keeter center next year.Ok hotel. The indoor pool is a no no until after 10 pm. Just too many kids not enough space. Room was a nice size and quiet.  I will be back to try the place in the summer.Tonight we ate at the Library Lounge and had one of the most amazing servers Jeanie (not sure on spelling). Extremely polite and attentive.  She was knowledgeable and honest which is a must in my criteria of a server.  If it weren't for the distance (coming from Wisconsin) this would be a regular for me.This place has really fallen from grace. The grounds are gorgeous. The hotel is beautiful; the best in Branson. The trouble is customer service has began to fail here. I have stayed at the Chateau several times. Usually once every 1.5 years or so. Past visits have been 4+ stars, but my latest visit over Mothers Day weekend was straight out of the show candid camera. The fire alarm sounded for 10+ minutes in the middle of the night. The manager did not know how to silence it. In the morning, no apology offered. When I went to the front desk to complain I was told no one else complained and treated very dismissively. Never an apology. Housekeeping entered my room while I was gone. I returned around lunch time to find the $5 tip missing but the room not cleaned. When I called the front desk they sent housekeeping up. They made the bed and replaced towels, shampoo. I was traveling with two small kids. There were crumbs everywhere. They never vacuumed. So apparently I tipped them $5 to make a bed. We did not use housekeeping again on our 3 night stay. We had issues with neighbors smoking and no one ever came to investigate it, so our balcony time was limited. The indoor pool was supposed to be heated but the water was like ice. This property has the ability to be great like it once was. The location is suburb but the management needs a wake up call and needs to do their job much better. Shame on them for running this beautiful place into the ground.We had a very restful and relaxing stay in a king suite overlooking the lake.  For some time we've wanted to stay in this magnificent hotel (something you'd find in a large city) and totally out of place here - but this Oasis in the Ozarks is quite simply.. elegant.  The atrium is breath taking and a delightful place to sit and relax.  The hotel is spotlessly clean and within short distance of any show you'd like to see.  OR - just stay in the hotel for a couple of days, there's really no reason to venture out (well, maybe to enjoy the weather).We saw many families here with children demonstrating either the affordability of the place or the affluence of American society.  Either way, the ambiance is extraordinary and the staff extremely helpful without being in your way.  In fact, they operated in the shadows.  If you needed something they were prompt and courteous, never once did we hear ""no problem"" in response to our thank you's - but always a sincere ""You're welcome.""  What a pleasure!  The food was outstanding and while we didn't sample the brunch on Sunday due to a mis-communication by the wait staff, we enjoyed two delicious meals - one breakfast and one dinner.  Bing - one of the bellmen working the front door was a true gentleman and a joy to interact with.  Great job Steve!","Needed to de-stress after tax season and chose the Ozarks.  Much good has been said about this property, there was a Group On coupon that I started to use for 2 nights but had already done AAA for 4 nights and thought it would be too confusing, good that I did not change things up as the $200 savings could have put a kink in things.Conference center packed, every night when coming back to the property we got the last parking space in the garage.  Prom night was something we had to dodge but it remained quiet and did not echo up the elevator.  Pricey meals but expected it would be that way, food bland but that is just the way it is apparently in Missouri.  Charge for wi-fi, really they could pull themselves into the 21st century as free wi-fi was at other properties, guess it is a typical gotcha.  Sweet shop, gift shop, expensive but nice, wish they would have sprung for some Starbucks and their Kleenex was the cheapest paper product, even third world countries offer quality paper products.  Got a nice case of cedar fever while here and the paper so rough that sneezing was painful, what pennies they pinch on the wi-fi and paper products could result in a bad attitude.Lousy bedding, rooms appeared tired but clean, definitely the late 70's decor and the bed felt it.  We had to wait for the room to be cleaned one day at 5:00 p.m. and for two days food sat outside the door next to our room, that was gross to pass by each day. Sitting on our balcony brought all the smoking up from below which made us give up our balcony time, apparently a smoke-free hotel is an oxymoron.Spa was a plus.The entire staff, from the woman who checked me in to the woman in the sweet shop, were all very friendly, fast and efficient. It's a great venue with plenty of nooks and crannies to relax in and services at every turn. Speak g of turns, the drive in is unique. Beautiful rolling hills but morning fog and evening critters force slow going. Rooms were very nice, clean and laid out well. Great, comfortable stay.We love this place..Excellent food and an excellent view of Table Rock Lake..Highly recommend....Beautiful lobby, loved the birdies and the artificial tree was also a nice touch. Didn't have time to try the spa facilities but the hot tub and pool were nice and like the fact it is open 24/7 with no kiddies allowed after 10pm :) Nice family environment for people travelling with kids and also nice for couples getting away for the weekend like in our case. The chateau grille has a nice patio where we had our breakfast which would be nicer when the summer months kick in too.It's a nice hotel but there's no need for them to be too overpriced as the hotel doesn't offer anything extraordinary. It is good if you want to enjoy an isolated relaxation weekend but if you want to be close to the shops and restaurants I would recommend staying near the Branson Landing which is what we would plan for our next visit as it is more lively in those areas. Overall I was happy with the choice for our one night weekend getaway :)A very nice hotel on the lake, they let us check in 3 hours early ..Great for kids ...it has a very safe playground with a fence around it for little ones,the arcade was small but still nice and they show movies as well..not the seasons but something for everyone ..great breakfast..close to silver dollar city which was the reason for our stayI am writing this the last morning of our trip as my family sleeps in. We've been here since Thursday and have stayed at the hotel almost the entire time so we have checked a lot of it out. We've had a great time hanging out with our kids and it was a nice getaway.Plusses:-Moonshine beach is a minute away and what a great little beach. Clear water, picnic tables and lots of families around so no one cares if your kids are noisy.-The Chateau has lots of places to eat, reasonably priced room service kids meals and a great view of the lake.-The kids activity center has fun stuff and a nice daily schedule.-The pool area has someone bringing around ice water and the towels are kept stocked.-Sweet Shoppe was nice for a coffee or ice cream for the kids. Pricing wasn't bad considering you are at a resort.-The lunchtime deli has pretty good sandwiches.Minuses:-Truly awful internet. Like the worst. You can pay $10 more or $15 more and get a slightly less awful connection, but it is still terrible. My husband and I own an online business and we could literally not check email without devoting a half hour to open 5 messages. Note to hotel: Don't advertise ""free"" internet if it is worse than dial up then charge for sub-par ""premium"" service.-There are flies everywhere. In the buffet food, in the bar, at the pool, everywhere. You will spend all your time eating swatting away flies.-The Lounge is nice, but the service there is extremely slow even when it's empty. If you order a beer that comes in a bottle or can they expect you to pour it yourself.-Service was hit or miss. Poolside service for drinks was nice to have, but there was only one waitress sometimes even when the pool was packed.-The rooms feel a bit dirty/outdated. The carpet needs to be cleaned. Our tub didn't drain. The mini fridge makes a whiney sound. Stuff like that.Wanted to take time to say a big ""Thank you!""  The staff of the Chateau took great care of us over Thanksgiving week.  We were very impressed with the value we got from this tremendous property, well-deserving of it's four-star rating!  We also enjoyed the Thanksgiving Buffet.  The live piano music was lovely and the food (especially the Ambrosia) was great.  Looking forward to our next trip!  Thanks valet guys!!!As a hotel, we were impressed from the minute we pulled up.  I'll start with the two negatives that were glaringly obvious to you -- the sucky, twisty, turny drive in and the lack of free high speed internet.  On to the positives.  It's breathtakingly gorgeous.  From the entrance, to the lobby, to the lake view, to the room, the conference faciltiies, the restaurants, everything.  We were attending a conference, ate brunch, sat in the lobby bar, had a lakeview room, really got to experience the whole she-bang and cannot wait to go back.  I wish it would have been warmer, we could have enjoyed the trip a little more with our little family, but it was a nice, relaxing weekend.The room was exceptionally clean, the bed, IMO was very comfortable, I loved having the full vanity outside of the bathroom to get ready at, we really were happy with our experience there!For the view and the service the place is great and convenient. Fairly priced for BransonReally nice hotelBeautifulClean roomsGreat view of Table Rock Lake, and my condo, and the Branson Belle.I've only had their Brunch on Christmas, but we have been there for Christmas Brunch 5 or 6 times over the years.  It is very good, not Vegas good, but very good for Branson food.  From Fresh Eggs Benedict, Turkey &amp; Dressing, Leg of Lamb, Cold Boiled Shrimp/CrabLegs, to Huge Dessert table/Chocolate fountain, soups, omelets, Prime Rib, raw oysters, waffles to order, Etc etc.  It is all basically average or above.  Leg of lamb and Prime Rib always seem to be too well done for me and my party of 10-16 year in and year out, but to be fair, there is some pink if your lucky enough to get one of the center pieces of the Prime rib.  Seafood is always really good and fresh tasting.  Omelets and Waffles to order are also a huge hit with us.  But there is more than enough choices and its all pretty good to great.Nice location and pretty view but the service was horrible. The rooms were not clean and when addressed they acted like it was no big deal. Maybe it was just a bad time to visit but for the cost you expect great things. Not great.A room that is $300 a night should include high speed internet. This place doesn't and it's web site does not clearly state that internet is $10 extra and then only for a 1Mb download.If you are looking for a nice place to stay to just get away from it all and need high speed internet, DON'T STAY HERE!!Over hyped and underwhelming. This place is what I would call ""Branson Fancy."" The food was mediocre at best, and the opportunity to enjoy a beautiful view is obstructed by decorative window panes and  heavy drapery. The only real upside was that the meal was free because we had a gift card. I wouldn't pay for it otherwise. It was supposed to be the ""coup de gras"" of our anniversary weekend, but it was NOT. At least the weather was nice and we were able to sit outside... Silver linings, right?? :-/I've had many great meals in my life and the one I had here last week ranked in the top five.  The chefs are spectacular.  Our waiter, Jim Carey lookalike, was superb.  Chilean sea bass with Thai chili sauce over coconut rice was amazing.  Well done!Beautiful hotel and great service even though I used a Living Social deal for half off. Sunday brunch was expensive, but very good. Well worth the money.Outstanding hotel outside the hustle and bustle of the strip in Branson. If you prefer a beutiful, quiet place to land when in the Branson area, this is a great choice. Beautiful views and relaxing atmosphere are just a small, but impressive, part of this hotel.We stayed over a weekend before my husband's work conference. The views were lovely. Had several meals in the Chateau Grille that were nice. Overall, their service was substandard.  Several times my husband or another guest asked for something (coffee before the restaurant opened and a glass of water by the pool) only to be put off.  Cleaning of the room occurred late in the day-we walked by our neighbor's room service dishes all day. The hall carpets needed vacuuming, and there really weren't that many guests there.  The spa was nice-if you go for a massage or facial take your swimsuit so you can enjoy the private hot tub there.Excellent hotel.  Great amenities.  Clean, decent price, good restaurants and typical overpriced restaurant prices.  View of the lake, but I don't care about that.Why do people find lakes so fascinating?  I don't know.  The humbling awe of the ocean, you bet, an over sized, dirty, man made ditch -nah.  This hotel is a little bit of a distance from everything, but it's worth it to avoid the insane traffic on the two lane route 76(aka Main Street) which is completely mind numbing and frustrating.We had dinner here at the Chapeau grill and then had cake at the sweet shop.  The food was really good and the service was excellent.  We even got a chance to see the sun setting over the lake.  Very romantic.The hotel rooms are awesome and the general hotel service is fantastic.                                                                                                                                                                      We dined at The Grill which is labeled as ""fine dining"". After ordering dinner, our server never returned to ask for an additional wine or cocktail reorder. We were offered dessert but no mention of coffee or an after dinner cocktail. The entrees were very good.","I visited here on a business trip. I did not stay in the hotel so I am excluding that portion, but I am writing in regards to the restaurant. We had the choice of a steak or mahi-mahi. It seems that everyone who order the steak didn't receive it they way they requested (they were all medium-well). Any restaurant that cannot master cooking a steak needs a new chef. The fish was good, for a place so far away from the ocean.The atmosphere was very high-class, it was decorated for Christmas, and they did not spare any expense for the decorations, very nice. The Staff was great, always on the ball with refills, and taking your plates away after you were through. All in all, this is a beautiful place with a great view of the lake. The food needs more work, and because my meal was comp'ed by my company I'm not sure if it is normally expensive, but, I would not pay over $20 a plate for the food I received. Go check this place out around the Holidays especially, its nice.This was a perfect weekend getaway though PRICEY compared to other Branson resorts. Our room was very big and very comfortable. Flat screen, couch, fluffy king bed, good sized bathroom, lots of towels, extra vanity and a balcony overlooking the lake. It was nice to sit outside on feel the breeze and leave the sliding glass door open at night. We happened to be there during the MO Food and Wine Festival which was great since it was rainy. We didn't have to leave the hotel. I love that they have their own movie theater with family movies in the afternoon and evening as part of your stay. Though it was still too cold yet for the outdoor pool. the indoor pool is open 24hrs and after 10pm is only for adults! We enjoyed midnight swims and soaks in the adjoining hot tub. They have a parking garage with no fee, just hotel key entry. The hotel is a John Q Hammonds so has a very Embassy Suites feel. Center Atrium area was nice with waterfall and birds, a large tree. We enjoyed the Spa Chateau for hot stone massages-great high class facility.The Chateau on the Lake is one of the most amazing hotels we've ever visited.  Our room was absolutely gorgeous and the view of the lake was breathtaking. We would not have been able to share this experience if it hadn't been for Hollie, the wonderful, intuitive reservation clerk who made things happen for us. We do not recommend rooms on the 3rd floor unless you are bringing your four legged family members. Thanks to Hollie, we were upgraded (well worth the upgrade fee) to a king room with a sleeper sofa. The room and view from our walk out balcony was spectacular. We stayed on the 9th floor overlooking the main entrance with a lake view. The stunning hotel lobby and atrium is truly indicative of a 5 star hotel. We cannot wait to visit this lovely hotel again.Pretty good place. The best place to stay in Branson by far.The spa was wonderful!  Also, I really enjoyed our dining experience in the main restaurant.  The room was comfortable and the staff were all very attentive.I stayed at this hotel as a speaker at a conference being held here. I was thoroughly impressed. The Chateau is a beacon of light on top of a hill; impressive as you approach it. Inside, it's quite elegant, with first class service, restaurant and bars. And the price is exceedingly reasonable for this kind of upscale resort and spa. I wish I could have spent a little bit more time here to explore it all!We had a great time at this resort.  We loved the room, they had activities for the kids and a kids club.   The kids really liked the indoor pool.  The outdoor pool was not heated, this should really be changed.  They did have service at the outdoor pool which added to the relaxation.  The view was beautiful.  The lake is wonderful and clean.  The staff was very friendly.  If you plan to go to Branson I recommend you stay at this Hotel.Really nice lobby...conference food OK - breakfast in the restaurant pretty good...rooms pretty comfortable.  but gotta tell you.....my pillows smelled like someone who ran out of shampoo slept on them.  If you are willing to suffer Branson, this is the place to stay.....off the strip!",,,"['review', 'staff', 'lake', 'went', 'conference', 'yesterday', 'food', 'great', 'clean', 'facility', 'gorgeous',
