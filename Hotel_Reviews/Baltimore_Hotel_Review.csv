http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-plus-envy-hotel-baltimore,Best Western Plus Envy Hotel,1.5,$$,20,"lol oh this hotel.  I second a lot of what the other reviewers said.  But I have to comment on the check in experience.  They gave me the wrong room number.  When I walked into the room, it was definitely someone else's room.  I went back downstairs and they were like oh, THIS is your room (the one next door)So okay, that would be ok.  I get mixups happen.  But for the fact that my friend was also staying at the same hotel.  He goes to check in and they did the same thing to him!  He went back downstairs and was like ""you gave me someone else's room""I mean come on.  What if we walked in on ugly people having sex.  I would have been scarred for life.  (Not if they were hot people, maybe they need a third) Okay, this review is taking a turn for the worst.Anyway.  They need to get that straightened out.Upon check out, they said they needed my room key back.  I literally could not find it anywhere.  I had a ton of bags.  I may have even left it in the room.  I didn't even find it when I unpacked when I got home.  The guy at the front desk said ""We need it for security reasons"" at which point I kind of snarkily said ""How secure could it be if you give people the wrong room numbers"" but he did not find this amusing.This is a horrible hotel. The neighborhood is not safe. The bed was pretty bad, and the sheets seemed old. The towels had holes in them. The bathroom etc is also substandard. Outside the hotel, the area seems really sketch.Envy Hotel couldn't produce a clean LOOKING sheet - much less an actually clean bed linen - to save its life. When I checked in, my bed was riddled with black curly hairs. Honestly, if it had been one I would've brushed it away and moved on. There were 4 or 5 hairs in BOTH beds in my room. I was grossed out.I called the front desk, asked for clean sheets, and was informed all the housekeeping staff had gone home for the night. I would have to wait a couple hours until the night laundry person came in. Fine. More than 2 hours after this call its 9:30 and I still have hairy sheets. I call again and am told if I want the sheets I have to put them on myself. Ridiculous, but okay, I guess.The guy at the front desk brings a stack of sheets with MORE HAIR AND STAINS THAN THE ONES I ALREADY HAVE.Out of a bargain hotel, the absolute minimum requirement for me is a bed I can sleep in without my skin crawling. Minimum requirement not met.If you can avoid it at any cost, don't stay here. I know why it's called Envy Hotel now...I'm envious of the people in every other hotel in Baltimore.I have worked in the hospitality business my whole life and what I experienced at The Envy during my stay on Saturday, August 2nd 2015 was embarrassing to the entire hotel industry. I made reservations at your hotel as a social event brought us to the area for the evening. My wife and I checked in, walked into our room, 711, and upon entering the bathroom I was mortified to see a cockroach on the bathroom floor, big and dead.  After flushing it down the toilet I walked out to explore the rest of the room.  What we found was upsetting. There were stains on the bed sheets, the chair and both (two) towels we were given looked like they had black make-up on them. The thermostat was not working. Most hotels have fan coil units as an HVAC system but I was surprised to see window PTAC units in this property.  The PTAC unit itself would have been acceptable, however the design of the installation caused an airflow problem so we had to keep the blinds open or the cold air wouldn't circulate.  The room was filthy and disgusting; there were dust balls on the carpet, water ring marks on the nightstand and the public areas were just poorly maintained from a cleanliness perspective -- I think I know where they cockroaches came from.  The elevator floors were very dirty and sticky and the ice machine area was so nasty I almost threw up.  I took quite a few pictures, like the one attached of the ice machine area representative of the level of filth we endured. I even attempted to charge my phone and none of the electric outlets in the room worked.  I went down to the front desk to inform the associate of status of the room, especially the cockroach, and he said, ""Oh, we haven't had a complaint about roaches in a long time.""  He then continued to offer his apologies and an insulting 10% discount, which I accepted at the time but the more I think if it the more infuriated I get over the condition of this hotel that I paid over $200 for. I have reached out to management and have not yet received any communication back -- a month later.  This place is bad -- B-A-D.I didn't pay much for this hotel room because I booked it in conjunction with my flight.  I wasn't expecting much.  I had stayed in the area before so I knew it was probably best to stay vigilant.  I was only staying there for one night.  It was January and the room was ice cold.  I turned up the thermostat, showered, and left for the night.  When I returned, my room still didn't feel warm, so I played with the thermostat some more and went to bed.  The room never warmed.  It was an awful uncomfortable night.  They don't even have comforters on the bed, so it was me, my body heat, and a blanket.  I probably would have faired better sleeping over a steam grate.I booked on Hotwire (first time trying that out) and I paid a mere $51 per night for a great location. What could go wrong? And what does someone expect for $51? A clean room, right? Not much else.I stayed in room 216 for future reference. The staff were pleasant and the breakfast area was well-stocked with sausage patties and scrambled eggs (from a powder stock.) There were also pastries and cereals, and some fresh fruit. Not so bad for the money. Now for the bad news. My room was in great disrepairs. The bed frame itself was broken (if I had brought my spouse I would have had it fixed or changed rooms.) With one person, it rocked only when I was getting in/out of bed.The bathroom was gross. They installed a type of wood flooring that's very difficult to properly clean -- it had fairly wide cracks. The inside of the shower had a lot of mould along the inside rim that would flake off and run down the drain. The shower door barely worked. Whole thing was weird; it was likely supposed to be trendy. The walls and ceilings in the bathroom were fairly extensively water damaged (photo.)And there was *a chicken bone* on the floor when I came in (photo.) Welcome, here are some animal parts! I actually went out and bought some cleaning supplies, and gave the room a once over before turning in. I thought the room had a weird smell, but I also smelled it outside the room. So the ventilation system had a bad smell, apparently.Would not stay again.you get what you pay for.  My room was clean.  The elevators didnt work though so that sucked being on the 4th floor.  Breakfast was fine.Its not the hilton or marriott but its centrally located and it was safe.  For 90 bucks you couldnt beat it.Ugh... This place...- Window AC, cardboard and duct tape used to ""close"" opening around it!- Toilet seat falling off, took a coin and 10 seconds to maintain for them!- Shower spraying all over.- Elevator skips floors.- Breakfast is half empty with space for things never put out.- Bathroom has very odd smell.- All vending machines empty 3 days.- Shady area out front, harassed for change every time I walked in or out.  If you live in an urban area, it's the usual.- Laundry in hall for days.- Closet storing luggage left wide open in lobby.I've stayed in worse, but this one is pretty close to the bottom.I should have known when I checked in and the guy at the front desk was wearing a skully (winter hat) 70 degrees outside. When we took the elevator up it was making noises and was about 90 degrees same with the hallways. Our room looked ok at first glance. Then we looked around...... Stains on the curtains hair in the beds. (Both of them) sink was dirty, the tub dirty.  Weird metal plate over the threshold of the bathroom every time you walk over it seems like it will cave in and makes a load crunching sound. Water pressure very low, no hot water. Then to make matters worse when we came back to the hotel at 2am after going to power plant live (very fun) we got stuck in the elevator for 40 minutes before the fire department came to save us because the employees there could not.  The phone in the elevator kept ringing the front desk but you couldn't understand what the employee was saying to you. I now have a fear of small places. Never did before... Not once did any of the employees, manager contact me to say sorry you where stuck in the elevator. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. They did offer free breakfast I was told it was in the basement after walking up and down 6 flights of stairs several times I was not interested in try that.  Then when checking out I wanted to voice my troubles to someone I was told by the front desk employee she was the only one working and couldn't make any decisions she was pretty shaken from being yelled at from the people In front of me and wrote down My complaints on the same paper with theirs. The elevator was down still from me and my friend getting stuck In it 5 hours earlier even though I wouldn't have taken it In the morning people where all I the hallways complaining. The stairs are dirty and steep and scary.... Ill stop with this I was told I'd get a call back either sat or Sunday and still haven't heard from management.....I suppose I could be spoiled with staying at great places but the quality of this hotel is shameful. Every area including the breakfast room is 80 degrees, even with the air conditioner on (it's not even that hot outside yet today) the receptionist was VERY nice but she told me to walk down the block in the middle of the night for toothpaste and she had to use her own wallet to give me change for a $5 bill so I could get a bottle water (which they don't provide u a comp one in the room and I had to visit 3 floors to find a vending machine that wasn't soldOut) the threshold to the bathroom was metal that popped in and out EVERYTIME I stepped on it which made a loud noise and would make me jump bc I got scared EVERYTIME bc it's so loud. Hahaha.  The parking garage is also not attached to the hotel and I had to walk a block with my suitcase in the middle of the night to get to the hotel. Kinda scary. The breakfast bar is shameful. Not one healthy thing to eat, they didn't even have peanut butter. Tjere were empty trays saying eggs and sausage which they never filled and weren't in the middle of making another batch bc there was only one other person in there eating. Worst comp breakfast at a hotel I've ever seen. The only positive is the beds are more comfortable than most other hotels. In fact I canceled my second night stay here bc it is not very accommodating.Place is horrible. It's cheap and we're only here for one night so thank God for that. The elevators are disgusting. Sticky mess. Our room is small and there wasn't any toiletries. I went down to the front desk to ask for some and he didn't even look for any. He said ""don't got none."" Later I go to the soda machine and my $5 bill isn't accepted so I go downstairs and ask the guy for change (he was laying down on the sofa and watching television) every time I go to the front desk he huffs and puffs like I'm bothering him to the point where I feel uncomfortable. I ask him for change ""we don't got none"" is his popular answer of the night. I was like ""are you kidding me? I wanna get a soda outta the machine."" ""Don't got none"" he says again like he was happy to inconvenience me. Bottom line is -this place is horrible. I'd actually rather spend time at one of those flea bag hotels on route 40 than this place again. The location is in a good spot. My girlfriend and I waked to fells point and back and it was 4 miles in total. Nice leisurely exercise. As far as this place -spend an extra $40 and stay at the Sheraton hotel. I will never come back to this place again. You shouldn't either. It's disgusting and the hospitality (if you can call it that) is absolutely dreadful.If you're used to staying in suburbs, this place may make you uncomfortable.  It's an old building redone in an edgy, modern way.  It's in the middle of downtown giving you great access lots of interesting restaurants, clubs, and attractions.  Yes, being downtown means the people along the sidewalk will ask you for change and parking is probably an issue (we took a cab).The rooms are small with small windows.  Ventilation in the hallways is lacking a bit, but it wasn't an issue in our room.  Breakfast is in a small room in the basement, but includes all the standards hot free help-yourself hotel breakfast favorites.  This is a good downtown option to the expensive glass towers. The shortcomings are made up for with character.My wife and I stayed here in September 2013 for a long weekend. If you're looking for an inexpensive hotel within walking distance of major Baltimore attractions and/or public transportation, this hotel is a fine value.  We relied upon the area light rail system to get from BWI airport to the hotel. We also walked to Baltimore's harbor area and then used water taxis to visit the Fells Point area and Fort McHenry.Two items I would mention to anyone considering staying here: The rooms are clean, but small. This hotel is also located near the border of downtown and a not-so-great surrounding area.WE WERE LOCKED IN THE ROOM AND THEY HAD TO DRILL OPEN THE DOOR TO GET US OUT!My boyfriend and I booked this hotel online and got an amazing price, since he's from Baltimore I thought we scored a deal. Now I have a lot of patience when it comes to service because I deal with people every day however after the first night I could no longer be patient. I arrived in Baltimore at noon and asked about early check in and they said no without even checking if a room was open, we had to wait in the cold for hours before being able to check in. I didn't complain, I understand things happen, when we were finally able to check in we had no blanket and only one towel. We called down to get a blanket and towel and no one answered, we went downstairs and they said they would send someone up and no one came. We had to call again for them to actually send someone up, while waiting we found underwear in the dressers next to our beds ... We were utterly disgusted. Finally room service came up and the deadbolt on the door got stuck, we were not able to open the door from either side. The man at the desk began to yell at us like it was our fault ... After an hour and a half, a lock smith and a general manager, we finally were able to get out. The next day we went down for breakfast they told us it was from 6:30 to 10am we went down at 9 and there was no more food left and the lady said they weren't going to put out anymore. When I stayed at the marriott they put in fresh food every half hour and continued to put food out until the last half hour. The service here is crappy, the area isn't that great, the hotel is right in font of a local bus stop and there are people standing in front of the hotel constantly, dirty sheets in front of the vending machines, broken elevators, and bathrooms  smell of mold... I will conclude with this ... if you can get a room for 50 bucks that's great, you get what you pay for but don't pay anything more then that when you can stay at another hotel for the same price .... You will be disappointed.Not only was this place gross and sleazy, but they charged several hundred dollars to my card for a ""smoking fee"" fraudulently! While they are close to downtown, I would not think of them as conveniently located unless you consider proximity to boarded up strip clubs ""convenient."" The staff were blatantly rude and unhelpful while I was staying there. I've tried, repeatedly, to get back the money they charged me for ""smoking"" (I did no such thing, btw), but not surprisingly they refuse to return my calls or e-mails. I called Best Western headquarters, who told me that this place is no longer part of their chain so they couldn't help me. Stay away unless you are looking to pick up bed bugs!Abysmal customer service. Upon checking in, the hotel discovered they had overbooked double rooms and the two double rooms we had booked 10 months prior were now NOT available to us. They provided us with 2 single rooms and promised a 10% discount and a lower room rate upon checking out.The room my boyfriend and I stayed in was okay. Typical mediocre hotel room. A/C worked and that was good enough for me. However, our friend's room (and whole floor) lacked A/C which is unacceptable for Baltimore in August. Luckily for him, the weekend's weather was mild but it was still incredibly humid and uncomfortable in his room during the day.Check out day was by far the worst experience I've ever had in a hotel. My boyfriend handed the woman (an employee I hadn't seen the entire stay) our key. She responded with, ""Ok, you're checked out."" We requested a receipt as it had never been clear what we were going to be paying after the initial mess-up. To our INCREDIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT AND ANGER, we were given a receipt totaling our stay around $1100 which is $200 more than what we were expecting to pay with 2 DOUBLE hotel rooms!!!! No discount was applied and no lower room rates were given. We immediately asked what was wrong and the (now frustrated with us) employee got her manager.Who we assume was the manager (he did not introduce himself) came down and a confusing dialogue ensued. He didn't know what the hotel's rates were, made my boyfriend bring up his original reservation e-mail so he could figure out the rates himself on a calculator and provided us with little to no solution. He took around $140 off of our bill, still higher than our original double room reservation and offered no more help. He told us he couldn't take any discounts off (the 10% or the AAA discount my boyfriend has for participating hotels) and sent us on our way.Along with the other small problems that piled up (no A/C on a floor, out of stock soda machine all weekend, elevator doors that slam into you with no motion sensor, room service who walks into your room unprompted, sewage pipe smell in bathrooms) none of us will ever be staying at a Best Western ever again, and especially not this location.I advise anyone who likes a quick, easy check in/out and fair rates to go somewhere else. I come to Baltimore once a year, every year, for Otakon and while that won't be changing anytime soon, my hotel location next year will.this place sucks!!! we booked a room here 6 weeks ago we have a con # and everything. good thing we called to check because they had not record of us booking with them. They said they had room available but wanted to charge us 2x what we had been confirmed for. when i asked to speak to a manager there was not one on staff and is 2:00 pm in the afternoon!!! dont book unless you want to worry about not having somewhere to stay on vacation!!!Nice room in an OK location in Baltimore. It was really difficult to find at first. If your driving down the street there are no signs that scream this is a hotel. I had to park my car and walk up and down the street until i saw a little sign that said Best Western. Check in was easy, rooms were clean, and the bed was comfortable. One big downfall was there was no parking but fortunatley on the weekends there is parking around the courthouse for free. Great location right near the harbor and only a mile walk to federal hill and a short cab ride to fells point. All in all i would stay here again.The location is alright. I had a difficult time finding the hotel and had to drive around it twice to eventually find some decent parking. The entrance is right next to a bus stop so it's really crowded in front of the hotel. I tried calling the front desk as I was driving around to ask for parking, but the line was busy. When I eventually walked into the lobby, I found the front desk guy on a personal call. Figures.The rooms are clean and look recently renovated. No complaints there. One thing that irked me was when I went to the lobby for some toothpaste, they told me they ran out and I had to walk three blocks to the 7-11 at night. I guess you could argue it was my fault for not having any toothpaste on me or for checking in so late. But you have to wonder...what kind of hotel doesn't carry any extra toothpaste on them? What else are they missing in their inventory?My experience overall was okay. I may or may not use their services again. I haven't made up my mind yet.Was charged for 2 additional nights after I checked out.  When I called about the overcharge - absolutely rude customer service - no apology &amp; still have not recieved the credit.  Decent hotel, very old with what seems to have had a very small cosmetic update, and the staff is terrible.  When I checked out, the front desk person was dressed like he was going out to a club, was sitting on the lobby couch, got up and took 10 minutes to print me a receipt.  Which he ultimately could not do.  All in all - I DO NOT RECOMMEND!",,,,,"['hotel', 'second', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'said', 'comment', 'check', 'experience', 'gave', 'wrong', 'room', 'number', 'walked', 'room', 'definitely', 'someone',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-indigo-baltimore-mt-vernon-baltimore,Hotel Indigo Baltimore - Mt Vernon,4.5,$$,26,"Wonderful hotel. Great location and priced rooms.  The front desk staff were very welcoming.  Briana and her co-worker,  I didn't get her name  :(, we very attentive.  We they asked our reason for travel, we said it was our anniversary. They congratulated us and said they wanted to do  something special for us.We went to lunch and  came back to a bottle of Prosecco on ice. That was so thoughtful. The rooms are nice and the bed is super comfy. We will definitely be back.Hotel Indigo was a surprising gem in Mt. Vernon. The decor was pleasing but the showstoppers are the wonderful staff which make your experience friendly and lighthearted.I enjoyed Kim and Briana as soon as we walked in they took care of all our concerns quickly and efficiently. 4/5 stars because while the hotel is pet friendly it's guests are not pet considerate. I walked back up to our room with a ""present"" in the hallway from one of the floors dogs.Also arriving would be a little less stressful IF the hotel provided Valet services. Tone on such a busy street I would think a service like Valet would be a no brainier. It is cumbersome to circle the block for parking. Although the garage is right across the street, sadly it is on the opposite corner and Franklin is a one way. overall I had a great stay and would definitely go back or recommend !Such a wonderful hotel!!! I stayed here for a month.This was my second time coming to Baltimore for work and I thought that the previous hotel I stayed at was amazing but this place shits on them. When we first arrived at the hotel, we walked in and everyone that worked there looked like they actually enjoyed their jobs. A really nice change for once! The check in process was really fast and we actually got to check in about 6 hours before check in time which was greatly appreciated after a long flight from San Francisco.ROOMS:- clean- good size- Aveda shampoo &amp; conditioner (which had a great scent!)- hair dryer- iron- mini fridge (tiny freezer)- complimentary Keurig coffee &amp; tea- cable TV- fast and free wifi- pets allowed - comfortable beds- powerful shower head - room service with delicious food! Try the bean burger.HOTEL/NEIGHBORHOOD: - not too expensive based on the service and rooms you're paying for- fruit water in the lobby which is delicious!- good sized gym with pretty much everything you need (yoga mats, weights, elliptical, etc)-restaurant downstairs with great food and drinks!-lounge type area with plenty of seats - safe neighborhood with a supermarket up the street (mt vernon supermarket) if you need anything such as wine, snacks, etc. 5 minute walk. Or a 7 eleven around the corner.- plenty of great restaurants nearby. (try doobys for something different!)- 5 minute uber ride to inner harbor (about $4) Highly recommend this hotel! Definitely staying here next time I'm in Baltimore for work.This is a newly renovated property. Stayed in an upgraded room on the 8th floor with lovely city views. Nice decor. Two flat screens, sitting area, large comfy bed, modern wardrobe, hidden fridge. Tv near sitting area is poorly placed as the only place to actually see it would be if you sat on edge of couch. Bathroom was nice, however, the porous shower floor was not cleaned well (there was visible dirt)Everything else was so nice it did not ruin my night. We did report the issue to front desk and received comp breakfast. Restaurant had major issues (separate review) so we didn't actually receive breakfast. I would recommend this hotel and am likely to return for a staycation.This hotel is very nice and modern! The lobby is spacious and you will also find the restaurant/bar (Poets) to your right.  The front desk agent was very nice when we arrived and provided us with a free upgrade that was available which was beautiful! We found a great price on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fihg.com&amp;s=d8d4162a855ee9ce1eb7384d8300bbc70f6778b702f1bb4cb1b32eb10ab78f81"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">ihg.com</a> and I was excited to book here! We only stayed one night. We brought our dogs ($25 fee-less than many) and there were some small nearby parks about a block or two away which was nice to walk the dogs. It was also nice to see dog bowls filled with some small dog treats and water outside of the facility. I enjoyed seeing the hard wood floors in the room as well which is not common. I absolutely loved the pillows in the room too, I want to buy them! One thing I didn't care for was the parking.  It was across the street in a parking garage and I was told it was $5 for my stay.  However, I parked and then left (within 30 minutes), and then came back by 11pm and left by 9am the next day and was charged another $10 ($5 per day).  The garage is paid by using the machines and when I asked a worker about the price, it was clear he did not understand me.   So the only way out was to pay. I know the hotel said they can charge you instead on your room bill and provide you a way to get in and out of the garage, which I would do next time if I stayed here to avoid any extra fees.  Personally, the area this hotel is in (Mt. Vernon) is not where I preferably be as I felt it was sort of far from places I may want to see (stadium area, bars and inner harbor). However, it is very pretty and many cathedrals and churches are nearby. They also have a historic map you can view around the block.  In the morning, we got cappuccinos to go at Poets which took longer than they should have but it felt like the employee forgot about our order until someone must have mentioned we were still waiting. He did apologize for the delay too. Overall, we had a fantastic stay and truly enjoyed this hotel and would come back again!What a surprise!! Only got to stay for one night, but this place made me feel right at home* with its quirky, hipster-esque decor (see pics!). Staff was friendly, hotel was quiet on a Tuesday night.Minus one star for no in-room fridge, which I guess it was supposed to have but we looked everywhere for it so it was hidden far too well, or missing. Room 413 was otherwise a delight, comfy sofa, two flat screens, great bed with quality linens, and a roll-in shower.Highly recommend, and will be where I stay if I ever make it back to Baltimore!*Portland, OR. Portlandia is fairly accurate.Quick 12 minute walk to Brewer's Art and fast drive to the inner harbor.  Love the downstairs bar area and lobby! The room was comfortable and the decor was amazing! Love the splash of orange throughout. Parking was only $5 a day in the garage across from the hotel. Looking forward to coming back!Great hotel with friendly service, unique decor, and wonderful Aveda products in the room. The location is close enough to walk to many sights, though if you're going out at night it's probably best to take a cab for safety's sake. Many interesting bars and restaurants within walking distance or a $10 cab ride away.Love this downtown hotel!! Great staff, great location... Brianna and Kim at the front desk are wonderful with customer care and Tom makes a great  cocktail!This place is great! We stay here every time we are in the Baltimore area. It's been awhile and when we came back this time we were quite surprised. The whole place has been remodeled and upgraded. The decor is beautiful, the beds and pillows are fabulous, the shower is great, and the staff continues to be super friendly. Also, free wifi. There are two public parking garages within a block (one almost across the street) and the prices are great (we paid $6 for 24 hours). Definitely recommend staying here on your visit.I was suuuuper skeptical to book this hotel based on the number of reviews and the newness of the hotel. We arrived and it was very chic! The front desk staff was very nice and accommodating. When we go to our room we were very pleased with the modern and sleek layout. Everything in the room is brand new and they even have a Keurig machine for complimentary coffee. There was a cute boutique where I found an amazing dress. On top of everything, the parking across the street is only $11. I was going stay at a hotel that was much expensive and I'm so glad I kept some $$ in my pocket.Booked a room two weeks ago through Expedia at a very affordable price. I wouldn't call it a five star hotel, but certainly great for what you pay for. Showed up five hours before checkin, and was allowed to check in early at no additional cost. Amenities were clean and well kept. Room offered everything you could want - a spacious, clean bathroom, a large, comfortable bed, a decent sized television(which I actually never got a chance to use), plenty of lights and outlets, and a USB charging port on the desk.Wish my stay was longer to utilize the room longer. The staff held my bags free of cost the next day as I watched the Oriole's game. Will be my first choice depending on room availability when I go back.Just left an industry meeting at Hotel Indigo. The food was amazing and the staff was so on point. I love the orange infused water in the lobby, the decor is so chic. The food I couldn't get enough. Many different items to try tonight and I loved them all. Oh the management team answered all my questions perfectly. From the time I walked in and left Robert  at the door was great as well. One minor issue we had a small shortage of forks ..,But overall 5 stars and let's bring Hotel Indigo more businessNot quite 4 stars, more like 3 and 3/4..I must say, when I drove up to this place I was not too thrilled. It is in an ok neighborhoodbut far from the type of area one would want to go out and take a stroll.. The hotel is a newlyrenovated old YMCA.. Self parking is available across the street and  it was cheap. The interior of the hotel was much nicer then you would expect from the looks on the outside. Check in was smooth and the lobby/ bar area was active and had a good vibe. The elevators were fast which is always a plus in my book. My room while not huge was new and fresh. The bathroom was really nice, and the room was spotless. I booked the room on hotwire, and for the price I paidI was happy.The hotel was really nice.  The rooms and bathroom were very clean.  It's a neat converted historic building.  Would definitely stay here again.  The rooms are small, but everything is new and nice.  Check in was great and the lady who served breakfast was awesome!  Only downside, was that whatever they cleaned the bathroom with had a very strong perfume smell.It's taken me a while to think about how I'd like to phrase my review, or for that matter how I'd even write it because it's a doosey. I think the easiest way will be to copy and paste an email I sent the general manager after my rather horrific stay. I will also include the response of the general manager. As of today 8/13/15 the matter has not been settled and the account has yet to be credited.Dear Jason,    First allow me to say that I send this email without looking for any kind of compensation. To be completely honest with you even a comped hotel stay wouldn't do me any good as I only come to Baltimore once a year. I also feel compelled to tell you that I'm going to leave my review with both positives (few that there where) and negatives online.     Now allow me to start with the positives. Check in was handled and quickly and smoothly as any I've ever experienced. Our bellhop, who I must admit I didn't get the name of, was the model of efficiency. Tiffany was friendly and helpful. That was about all the good that came from Thursday. We were told that we'd be the first ones to stay in our room, looking back on it now it was almost a warning.Problem #1 Thursday (5 minutes after check in)- Key cards don't work - time #1Problems #2 -4 Thursday (7 minutes after check in)- No glasses or coffee cups for the room. This one could've easily NOT happened with just a little attention to detail.- No room service menu. Annoying but not the end of the world.- Phone line was full of static and didn't work (hence me having to go back downstairs AGAIN). That's THREE trips in less than ten minutes to the front desk.Problem #5 (20 minutes after check-in) This was dangerous and potentially lethal.- The shower isn't properly sealed. My girlfriend stepped out of the shower to find an absolute lake of water all over the bathroom floor. Problem #6 (Yes, we're STILL on the first night of our stay at the hotel) Key cards don't work again (that's twice)Problem #7 Friday morning 7:20 am- Room service debacle. Where to start on this one? Breakfast was 50 minutes late, the order was wrong, it arrived without bacon or our bread options being toasted, and after three attempts we just gave up on getting ketchup. Now for the quality of the meal. The eggs were inedible due in large part to the repugnant cheese used in the omelette. The hashbrowns tasted like they were coated in salt, they definitely would've been better with some ketchup but well....we see how that request wentProblem #8 Friday evening- Came back to a ""serviced"" room. Still no glasses and this time ONE coffee cup for two people. Improvement??? I mean really how difficult was this one detail to get right? At least the keycards worked right? Well they did up until midnight when I stepped out to grab something from 7-11. Please don't tell me about demagnetizing the cards because it worked when we came in, and when I went out later that night I didn't even take me wallet only a $20 (So that makes FOUR, count em four times our cards stopped working.Problem #9 Saturday evening. - This one could've ended in criminal charges or someone getting seriously hurt. This is the one bit of single incompetence that not only made me furious but had me calling the police. 6 guests,COUNT THEM 6, were locked out of the hotel at 2 am for approximately twenty minutes!!!! The front door just refused to open for ALL of our keycards, and there was NO ONE on duty at the front desk or answering the phones (I have the call logs to prove it) for TWENTY MINUTES!!!! That's inexcusable and borderline criminal. What would've happened if someone needed to get inside for medical reason or if the homeless guy bothering us outside would've turned violent? What if it were my girlfriend that was trapped outside and not me??? Oh and who finally let us in? The person from the front desk? No, it was another guest who'd come downstairs to buy something but couldn't because THERE WAS NO ONE AT THE FRONT DESK FOR TWENTY MINUTES! So when I finally get upstairs I have to come right back down again because you guessed it my keycard doesn't work again. After looking around I FINALLY find someone who tells me ""Oh that door doesn't work at night."" If that's the case maybe, just maybe you mention it to your guests or I don't know make sure someone is staffing the door. Inexcusable, unforgivable negligence. Problem #10 Sunday morning around 2:30 am- Room hadn't been serviced. Trash hadn't been taken out, we're back to ZERO clean coffee cups as we used one that morning, still no glasses for water. At this point I'm still furious from being trapped outside and then I walk into this. Seriously how hard is it to pay attention to the details? Oh and before you ask, no we didn't put a do not disturb sign on our door because we didn't have one, I guess it went the same place as our glasses and room service menu!Problem #11 Sunday eveningI'm at my character limit, I will try to continueBrand new hotel still having teething problems. Breakfast on a Sunday took over an hour with 15-minute waits between visits from the one waiter on duty. Other tables gave up and left. No room cleaning service for first 48 hours there. Rooms are fine though.What an amazing hotel!  The space recently was renovated and every part of it is impeccable.  The rooms are spacious with cathedral ceilings and the windows are huge with incredible views of the city.  It's also in the most ideal location to conveniently explore downtown Baltimore.  The staff is extremely friendly and the food is great!  Try the Lexington Market Salad...it's delicious!Fabulous restaurant and bar! Very stylish decor, original cocktails and tasty food. Quite the local hotspot! Reminiscent of the days when hotel bars were chicest watering holes in town.Stayed for a few nights at the Indigo in September 2015.  If not for a terrible ""service"" experience in the dining area, I would've said its a great place to stay.The Good:- beautifully renovated lobby- nice rooms- reasonably pricedThe Bad- I called the hotel ahead of my stay inquiring how late can I park my car in the garage across the street. The girl on the phone responded it's 24/7. When I tried parking my car at 12:30am, I was annoyed to find the garage closed. I expect the hotel to provide accurate info here, last thing I want to do is search for parking at 1am...- While getting breakfast in the hotel restaurant I came across perhaps the worst waitress in my memory.  She never said a word to me or my girlfriend, and simply handed us the menus. When she couldn't make out my girlfriend's order, she simply said ""Huh?"", and gave her a dirty look. Half way through our meal, I was getting the waitress's attention that she never got us our napkins. My ""excuse me"" was met with ""whatchaneed?"" response.  If I wanted to get ghetto service, I'd stay at a motel 6, but I certainly expected more from Indigo. I work close to the hotel, but would not be staying there again. It's a shame, since people like that waitress give Baltimore a bad name.","Absolutely amazing! So amazing in fact I considered writing a bad review so no one else would come here to keep the rates down lol. I lived in Baltimore for 30 years I know this city like the back of my hand. I now live in Florida but this will be my go to hotel when I come back to visit! Perfectly located, and honestly hands down the best staff I've ever encountered. I can't say enough about this place. I vote for a sixth star.This hotel is great. Everything top notch, first class. The interior designer and team did an outstanding job. Management should be recognised for a great job and forward thinking vision. Go for a larger room its worth it.What a complete overhaul!!!!! The place looks awsome and very upscale. Went to a private party in the Library space. Appatizers were good and the crab dip was delicious. Will visit  again for cocktails.Absolutely beautiful! Staff is super friendly and I have never stayed in a cleaner hotel! my husband and I stay in hotels frequently and this is by far the #1. We will be sure to recommend and return. Thank you to much everyone at hotel indigo for making this such an enjoyable experience for us.My husband and I were very skeptical about booking a room at Hotel Indigo based on old reviews on various websites. Having lived in the Baltimore area for over 2 years, I knew the hotel was in a great area of the city (historic Mount Vernon). So going off more recent pictures and reviews, we decided to book. And we are so glad we did! I'm assuming they are now under new ownership, based on the updates and previous reviews. The design of the hotel is modern beautiful and we could not be happier with our stay. We were even able to bring our pup along with us. I would definitely recommend this hotel!Excellent! Newly opened, clean, nice amenities, friendly staff, great location. Parking across the street was $11. Overall, I was extremely happy with this hotel and will definitely stay again.",,,,"['wonderful', 'hotel', 'great', 'location', 'priced', 'rooms', 'front', 'desk', 'staff', 'welcoming', 'worker',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/rodeway-inn-mid-town-baltimore,Rodeway Inn Mid Town,1.5,$,22,"Kinda embarassing because I'm better then this. No offense. But I honestly just needed somewhere to put makeup on really fast and take a fast shower and I didn't wanna book a expensive room downtown Baltimore. So I went here. They say ""non smoking"" in the rooms but it's smells like hella smoke. I paid 40$ for an hour just to get ready. Grosssss. Maybe I'm overreacting idkA cheap motel in downtown Baltimore with a friendly staff. Not far from the Harbor and about a 10 min drive from the nightlife area. If you have a vehicle, you'll need to park it street side but be aware of the time limit. The staff was friendly enough to give us their business parking spot to park longer than the time allotted.This motel is a good place just to crash if you need something last minute. The bed was uncomfortable, but overall an alright place.I got a great deal on a 3 night stay at this hotel via a popular mystery hotel discount site two months in advance. Called a few days before check-in to confirm my reservation, and was told that for the dates I'd be staying, the hotel was overbooked by 5 reservations. Good thing I called ahead; would have been awful to travel 200+ miles, check in, &amp; be told that there's no vacancy. Managed to get my reservation cancelled, and found a much nicer hotel for my trip.There are countless reviews on several sites regarding how awful this place is, and it's obvious the owners aren't taking any of them into consideration. The biggest red flags- lots of reviews state that there's no air conditioning, and that the water pressure in the showers is very, very low. Those two things are inexcusable during the summer. Stay here at your own risk.""You get what you pay for"" is a fair assessment of this place. It's the cheapest in the city, but also incredibly run down and exudes an incredible ""we don't care"" atmosphere. The check-in and reservation went surprisingly smoothly. No problems here. Our room was on the first floor, and wasn't as small as other reviewers have reported. Pretty clean actually, no signs of bugs or rodents. But the general look/decor looked like something from a 70s porno. We both took a shower together on the first night but didn't receive replacement towels or have the stall cleaned until several days later. Admittedly, the two of us don't shower that often so it didn't bother us, but hey that'd be a BIG deal to other people.The shower itself actually was a pleasant surprise. Good pressure and hot water. The bathroom in general sucked though on account of how loud the vent fan was. Like, loud as in if you were in the bathroom and someone yelled to you from the room, you couldn't hear them.The wifi network 'Rodeway 1' listed in their welcome brochure doesn't exist. We had to ask them later on about it, and they revealed that we should use 'Rodeway 2' if 1 wasn't appearing, despite it needing a password. Fortunately they told us the password, and internet worked fine rest of the trip.Originally we only had four channels available, all staticky. Randomly on the second night, a satellite box appeared in our room while we were out, so that's cool. Unfortunately, it was DISH Network, trollolol. After this, most things went pretty smoothly.The biggest specific complaint we had was the lack of water/drinkable fluids. We drink a lot of water. Yet there were no water fountains, and just the one ice machine. They had a small pitcher of ice water in the semi-kitchen breakfast area at the front, but it was left out all day and we felt bad drinking all of it. I mean theoretically we could've tried drinking the tap water from the bathroom, but Iiiiiii doubt anyone would trust that stuff. There was only one fridge in the entire hotel, a mini-fridge in the aforementioned breakfast area, though it was communal and anyone can go in there. So basically, unless you brought a ton of your own drinks, you're gonna die of thirst. (Especially considering their heat was forced-air, and thus the entire building was dry as hell, wreaking havoc on your skin/chapped lips)Lastly, the bed wasn't terrible, but the comforter was made of some odd, semi-fabric semi-plasticky material that made you feel like you were being asphyxiated while under it. We've no idea what it was, could've contained frigging asbestos for all we know.In conclusion: If you're poor and want to spend as little as possible on a trip to Baltimore, this place  DOES get the job done and will save you a lot of money. But absolutely expect the worst hotel imaginable when you do so.BONUS: The 'continental breakfast' was cereal and some wonderbread. Bravo.This was the worst hotel stay I have ever experienced. It's located in a great part of town and looks good from the pictures online. Lessons were learned on this stay.It was cheap at 69.00 per night. We stayed for two nights visiting Baltimore with my family who came in from Michigan. Upon arrival we were greeted with very hospitable staff. When we got to the rooms, everything went downhill. My husband and I walked into our room and got smacked with a stale odor. The carpet looked dirty enough that I was not going barefoot. Ceiling light had one light bulb. The bathroom smelled of mold. The shower head was broken with the sprinkler head on the floor. The water shot out like a laser jet the size of a pencil. It made for an unsatisfying shower after the 95+ degree days sight seeing . The towels were thin torn rags.Next to the only chair in the room was a mouse trap and extension cord with too many plugs for the ref rig that rattled, the TV on DISH with 3 channels, and room space heater. The breakfast was an added let down. Cereal and bagels were available, but stale. And the milk was outdated by 4 days. The coffee was the only thing worth pouring.Look for someplace else to stay. The mantra of ""you buy cheap, you get cheap"" clearly fits here.worst hotel experience of my life. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!i booked a room here 2 years ago with a friend. the booking was pretty vague so we didn't know what the bed setup was going to be. turns out it was just one bed. my friend opted to stay on the floor all weekend. they gave us a room on the top floor and we had to go up some weird narrow stairways to get up to it and it was really hot up there. we called the front desk and they said they had central air so we asked them to turn the temperature down in our room but it never happened (we called 2 or 3 times). they claim they have sattelite tv but only maybe one channel came in. also, the shower was a joke, it was just a trickle of water coming out of the showerhead, seems pretty unsanitary, i don't know how they are allowed to operate like this, it should be fixed or this place should be shut down. i had another set of friends get a room there the same weekend. well i should say a few rooms because they had issues and kept requesting to be moved. the first room had the same shower issue as ours and then they got moved to the basement and had a working shower but there were a few other issues with the room that i can't remember. oh, and i should mention that we were placed on the top floor and then my friends who got there a day later were placed on the first floor before moving to the basement. the area this place is located is pretty nice, right next to the washington monument (and yes, i'm talking about baltimore, not DC!) but the owners just don't seem to care about this place. i know it's cheap but it's worth it to spend more and stay somewhere else.Horrible!  That's what you get when you try to save money. If you have a car...good luck finding decent parking to stay at this hotel.  Given that they don't have their own parking lot, you would think that the guys at the front desk would know a little bit about local parking lots.  Information like distance from hotel, (cost..which is BS..how about some parking validation???) and addresses of nearby parking lots.   The people at the front desk don't really seem to care to help make your stay more hospitable.  Some people have had a long day traveling and the last thing we want to do is to figure out where and how much we need to pay to park. I was so frustrated that I didn't even stay there.  It was not worth it.  Horrible service and hospitality, I completely concur with the low ratings that this hotel has.This place is simply awful, my room was hot and had a window that looked into a hallway.  I knew that I was going to be in for a bad time when I had to sign something that said that you couldn't get a refund after checking in (clearly enough people were trying to do that that that became necessary) I get that this place is cheap, but spring for a little more and get towels that don't have huge holes in them.Excellent location in an historic neighborhood, close to monuments and shops. Absolutely horrible room. I paid $40 (Priceline), and got a room (after a four-floor walkup) that measured approximately 8' x 12' (see photo). There was no window in the room. I could barely squeeze inside with my luggage because the door hit the bed. The sheets and towels were worn threadbare, every electrical appliance (fire alarm, light, shower fan) was missing its cover, there were holes in the ceiling, the shower took a small eternity to heat up and never got above a trickle. And I'm pretty sure it hadn't been cleaned in a week, if not a month.I would never, ever stay here again, but if you are absolutely destitute, it beats a bench in the park.I guess you get what u pay for for $80 bucks a night you get semi clean,luke warm water, heat if you know where the magic switch is in the middle of the wall ..one REALLY thin blanket. the freezer turns your ice cream into soup i forgot a bottle of wine in the fridge came back and hour later it was gone. lets not forget the 3 grainy channels on the t.v! the electrical outlets were so dangerous i thought we were going to burst into flames rodeway to hellAttention to anyone reading this review, this property isn't even worth one star. By far the worst hospitality property I've ever stayed in. Wifi Internet is slow. Their ""continental"" free breakfast is pathetic. For instance, they offer bagel, but with no cream cheese in sight. Oh, lets not forget the cold showers I had everyday of the week. I even tried for a hot shower late at night, and still cold. Bath towels look dirtier than the towels I use to wipe my car after a wash. Housekeeping forgot to give me new towels after I personally asked the front desk three times in one day. Hardly any basic or cable tv channels available -  5 channels in total!If you do plan to bring a car, then you better be prepared to wake up at 7 am to move your vehicle. Baltimore has horrible street parking, but this location has one of the worst parking situations. Also, their telephones don't work, and neither do their elevators. Luckily, I keep myself in decent shape so I could go up and down their stairs with ease. Although, it is four stories of stairs. So if you have any large bags like I did, it won't be a pleasant experience. I took a six hour flight and thought it would be nice to get some sleep as soon as I arrived for a 2 pm check in. Their reservation and computer system was down and I couldn't get a room until 5 pm. The one and only bright spot of this establishment is their front desk person Keith. But, even as great of a person he may be, it still doesn't give this place a one star rating. I sincerely hopes he is able to find another job and leave this dump.All in all, if I could stay at this place for free, i still would considered it to be over priced. I try not to write harsh reviews; but if I can save a person from staying at an establishment like this, then this review was worth the time and effort put in.It's a cheap hotel in a part of town that may or may not be shady (I had no problems walking around late at night). It's definitely cheaper than some of the Inner Harbor hotels and the Charm City Circulator (free when I went) is right across the street. Basically, when I travel, my hotel/motel is basically where I sleep and shower, one of the main reasons why I mostly look for a cheap hotel/motel which is close to the attractions I want to see. I don't really care about anything more than that, unlike others who need to be in absolute luxury when they travel. Here, though, you get what you pay for, in my case, a place to sleep and a shower. Surprisingly enough, I was able to sleep, I was afraid that the street noise and noise from the neighboring rooms would keep me up but that was not the case.Onto the breakfast- it sucks in a nutshell. Go elsewhere and pay for the breakfast, trust me, your stomach will thank you later.I do want to commend the front desk person when I checked out. He was extremely helpful in telling me how to get to where I wanted to go, (Fort McHenry) but ultimately, I ended up not going. Would I stay here again if I went to Baltimore? Um, I'm not sure yet. But if you're like me, you only need a place to crash and shower, then this place gets the job done.Cheapest hotel in Mt. Vernon (and probably any of the nicer neighborhoods in Baltimore).The front desk staff could not possibly be nicer, they really try hard. I had a last-minute late-night emergency and needed a room, and I got one for under $100 (in advance, it's more like $80 and that includes taxes). Positives: it is cheap! nice staff. clean rooms. spacious rooms. free hi-speed wifi.Negatives: those cheap and awful motel towelsPossible negatives: two words here: Bare Bones. This place doesn't have much that isn't necessary. Examples: Shampoo is provided, but not conditioner; there was no closet in my room, just a clothes rack (and luggage rack) without a door or anything. You won't find an iron or hair dryer in your room (though I didn't ask at the desk if one could be provided, maybe so).  Everything is basic basic basic, although there is the wifi, and my room had a very comfy chair, along with the desk, bed, and TV.If you're picky at all, or like luxury, forget this place. But if you're like me, and you want a clean, cheap place to stay in the heart of the cultural district: give this place a try!The free breakfast is a nice idea, but the cereal tends to the stale side. They did have a waffle machine, though! And having coffee or OJ in the morning is always nice.I'll stay here again for sure. But it's not for everybody.I only paid 25/night because of choice employee rewards but Jesus, it was terrible. There was gum on our walls painted over, toilets don't flush all the way , terrible showers. It comes out like a weak hose an takes FOREVER for it to warm up to acceptable heats... Our room (106) was in a basement. We had two terrible neighbors in 3 days the first of which was evicted. There's little to no parking unless you wanna pay or park on the street. Would not stay here again.Cheap but still not worth the cost savings. Don't stay here. No heat, unclean sheets and shower. Good location, bad hotel.I think this is probably the best cheap hotel in the area, especially for business travelers. It's walking distance to both Penn Station and the Inner Harbor/downtown area, i.e. your transit and your convention/meeting site, and close to a number of excellent restaurants. I don't know Baltimore that well, but as an outsider, I felt really safe in this part of town, which is a definite plus.I think they've managed to make their prices so low by drastically paring down on non-essential services, so if you're heading to Baltimore for a decadent getaway, this is not your hotel. The hotel looks like it saw better days, and then much worse days, and then better days again. So it's an odd mixture of fancy and tumbledown, but exquisitely clean.Case in point - the wireless here is amazing. Strong signal and blazingly fast, much better than what I have at home. There's a huge, wide desk - perfect for work, and a great chair. They serve free ""breakfast"", but it's basically your choice of carbs (muffin, cereal, or toast), and plenty of hot, strong, coffee. Again - exactly what I needed, maybe not what you need.The hot water is plenty hot, though the water pressure is low. The bed is extremely firm. There are a number of channels on the television, if you're in to that sort of thing. I found the desk staff to be very friendly and helpful. There are a number of weird stern warnings - you will be charged if you steal the towels! you will be charged $300 if a pet is found in your room! hotel is for registered guests only! - but if you're just looking for a place to get some work done and get a little rest, you should be fine.I did not have a good experience at the Rodeway Inn.  In fact, I did not even get to stay at the Rodeway Inn.  My friends and I planned on staying there because it seemed affordable and it was close proximity to the wedding we were attending.  After booking twp rooms two months in advance, we arrived to find out there was a ""plumbing/flooding problem"" that occurred the night before and they did not have rooms for us.  They offered to put us in rooms in another hotel 4 miles away and ""I have a friend that can drive you there.""  We asked them why they did not tell us this last night when we called to check our reservation or even the morning we were to arrive and they could not answer.  When we asked if the rooms in the other hotel would be the same price, they would not answer.  We ended up canceling the room, and I must say we were better off.  Our friends that had arrived there three days ahead had nothing but complaints of no air-conditioning and no water pressure (possibly to do with their plumbing problem).  When they complained, they were moved to another room and charged more for the bigger room.  Ridiculous.I would not recommend the Rodeway Inn.  It looks very rundown both inside and out.  Their one perk seems to be that they have free and fast internet, which came in handy when searching for another hotel closer than 4 miles away.A dump.  Barely adequate.  No elevator so had to walk up four flights.  Had to change rooms because a window was broken, and there are no screens.  Rooms are small cramped and hot.  Lights flickers.  Yeah, has wi fi but plugged computer in and it got really hot and wouldn't work.  TV fuzzy.  Bed uncomfortable.  Coke machine didn't have an option for diet.  Free breakfast consists of your choice of two generic cereals that you'd have to take back to your room if you want to sit down.  Chairs too big for room and/or desk they put them with.  Wasn't dirty but dingy.  And I could have dealt with all that for one night, but the bathroom door didn't lock and/or stay closed all the way.  Spend a little extra and be comfortable.FAIR WARNING TO EVERYONE: avoid both Rodeway Inns on St. Paul Street and Pulaski Highway in Baltimore, Maryland. They have the same local owner, whose only concern is cash, not customers. They have absolutely no qualms at all about overbooking you in advance, lying to you about it on the day you arrive, and trying to pawn you off on their other dive across town, thereby forcing you to scramble to book another hotel at the last minute (if you can find one). If you value honesty, integrity, and your time, DO NOT BOOK HERE!!!!!I booked at Rodeway Inn on St. Paul about a week prior to my visit to Baltimore by calling the hotel directly. I got a great rate at $99 per room per night. I got a room for myself and another room for my business colleague. I chose this hotel because of semi-decent reviews elsewhere online and decent location close to the train station &amp; where we were conducting a business seminar. I received 2 confirmation numbers over the phone at the time of the booking. The hotel desk clerk refused to email me a receipt, but assured me that I had 2 rooms booked (should have been my first warning sign).The day I was to arrive in Baltimore to check into the Rodeway on St. Paul, I checked my reservations online and they were good. However, I received a phone call at about 1:00 PM from the hotel's desk clerk, explaining that there was a problem with the internet in the rooms I had booked. He asked if I would mind staying at the Rodeway Inn on Pulaski Highway, about 6 1/2 miles away. I said I really didn't care about the internet being down, and that I'd prefer to stay at the on St. Paul location because that was exactly where I needed to be. He ignored my comments and instead offered to shuttle me to and from the Pulaski Hwy location for free. I asked him to call the other hotel to confirm whether a free shuttle would actually be possible, but made it clear that I was not committing to his offer. He said he'd check and promised to call me back.About 3 or 4 hours passed with no phone call from the clerk, so I called the hotel back to find out what was going on. The clerk said he had no problem making arrangements to shuttle me to the other Rodeway on Pulaski Hwy. I again explained that I didn't care about the internet problems and would just rather stay at the Rodeway on St. Paul. Then, he changed his story on me and told me that actually, they were having problems with the toilets in both of the rooms and that it would not be possible for us to stay in them. Obviously, he was a liar. I told him I'd look into some other options and get back to him with my decision. He again offered the rooms at Pulaski Hwy, with free shuttle across town or to refund me for the rooms at on St. Paul with no penalty.I had a few hours left in Philadelphia before I had to leave for Baltimore, so I checked hotels online. There was NOTHING available anywhere near Rodeway Inn on St. Paul that was under $200 a night, except for, strangely, the Rodeway St. Paul itself. I called Rodeway corporate (Choice Hotels: reservations dept.) just to see if the St. Paul location actually had any availabilities, and they confirmed that it didn't. I called Rodeway St. Paul back anyway to make it clear that I didn't care what the situation was with the rooms...that I just wanted to stay in the rooms that I had paid for. He again told me that I couldn't stay there because of the toilets, but that I could stay at the Pulaski Hwy. location. I told him that I didn't want to stay at the Pulaski Highway location (by that point, a friend in town had warned me against staying in that area) and that I'd call back with my decision.I called Rodeway corporate again (Choice Hotels: customer service) to complain. The first support person I spoke to was absolutely useless, claiming that each hotel is independently managed and that they couldn't interfere. Thankfully, my cell phone cut out before I could finish with her. I called back and got a different woman, who actually listened to me and cared about my problem. She promised to call Rodeway St. Paul to find out what was going on. She did call me back promptly and confirmed that Rodeway St. Paul had overbooked me, and that the guy who owned Rodeway St. Paul also owned Rodeway Pulaski Hwy (shocker, right?), and that I was welcome to file a complaint with corporate.So avoid any Rodeway Inns in Baltimore, my friends! By the way, I ended up booking rooms at the Country Inn &amp; Suites out by the BWI airport in Linthicum, MD (closest decent place I could find that day). It was fantastic. Huge, clean suites. Free shuttle. Free cookies. Free newspapers. Free huge breakfast. And an absolutely awesome, friendly, and honest staff. GOOD RIDDANCE, RODEWAY INN! NEVER AGAIN!!!Let me make a few qualifications beforehand: I don't come to Baltimore often and I have nothing to compare to. But having said that...the place is seriously undermaintained  at every turn and overall it's pretty dirty . The first room they gave had its bathroom light out so they cheerfully offered to move us. The next room had its smoke detector removed and what looked like spattered puke on the bathroom door.. The third room was okay. And yes, the elevator is broken. The continental ""breakfast""  is extremely meager.  I get the sense the owners are extremely cheap and refuse to pay for anything resembling qualified work. Doors that don't shut right...light switches installed upside down...showers that gurgle when the toilet is flushed...extension cords all over the place...this place needs an inspection in the worst of ways. My advice : spend a few more bucks and get something nicer, or at least safer.","I booked a hotel room at the Rodeway Inn months in advance. When I got to the hotel, the person in charge told me that they didn't have my room available due to plumbing issues, and they wanted to transfer me to a different hotel 3 miles away. I needed to be walking distance from an event, so I told them I had to have a room at this hotel. When I went to the room, the bannister of the stairway was loose and I almost fell over. The stairs were also uneven and shaky. When I looked at the room, there were toenail clippings on the window sill, and the room had a funny smell. Also, on the way up to check into the room, a friend was helping me, and the person in charge started harassing me about how many people were staying there. When I saw the state of the room, I wanted to cancel my stay. I was charged for one night stay, even though I didn't stay there for more than one minute. At the same time I was having problems, a few other people were complaing about the room as well. I don't think this hotel is sanitary, or up to code.",,,,"['kinda', 'better', 'offense', 'honestly', 'needed', 'somewhere', 'put', 'makeup', 'really', 'fast', 'take', 'fast', 'shower', 'wanna',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/inn-at-the-black-olive-baltimore-2,Inn at The Black Olive,4.0,$$$,33,"I honestly can't remember the last time I rated a business five stars.  Black Olive deserves every star of this review. The service, atmosphere, living quarters, owner and staff were all exceptional! I felt at peace when I stayed here and I am truly looking forward to going back. I loved it so much that I'm often recommending it to folks ! If you want an earthy, boutique and peaceful setting this is your place! Oh, and yeh hot tub is pretty dope too.Staying here this evening and it just keeps getting worse. The guy at the front desk is very nice, but without a manager here he can't solve any problems. It's Valentine weekend and we booked a corner spa suite. Well, the jacuzzi tub doesn't work, but even if it did all of the hot water is murky brown. The thermostat also does not work either and to make matters worse the phone in the room doesn't work, so we have to go down to the desk to let them know our concerns. The hotel seems poorly taken care of as well. The walls are dirty and have patches all over them and the room is very strange, we have an open utility closet in room and a curtain in the bathroom that leads to an empty space with water hook ups on the wall. It could be a decent hotel if it were cleaned and/or painted and everything worked. We were told to wait for the manager to get in in the morning and see what she could do about it, so review pending outcome of a discussion with the manager. It's a shame because the hotel is in a great location and the amenities are great on paper. Update: Manager, Tiffany, was never in as promised and we never got a resolution. 0 stars.Decided to take a spontaneous trip to Baltimore last week, and a deal on this hotel so decided to go for it after seeing positive reviews.  Overall, I had a mixed experience. When I arrived to the hotel, we were unable to properly check-in because the system was down.  This wasn't a huge deal because we were able to complete the process the next day.When I walked into the actual room we were staying in, I was a little surprised at first.  The room was very sparse and it really looked like an unfinished apartment with paint peeling on the walls and cold concrete floors. Not necessarily bad, if you're into that style, but just very different from the style of a typical hotel.The good: There was a very convenient and fairly priced parking garage right next door.  There was also a cool area with different bars/restaurants within walking distance.  The bed was super comfortable, and there was a HUGE jacuzzi tub which was pretty fun. We also got a good price on the room, so I can't really complain.The bad: The room was HOT.  I admit, I like to sleep in very cold temperatures; but the room was consistently set at 75 degrees.  I adjusted it down to 65 before leaving to go to dinner, and after returning, the thermostat was still showing 75.  There was a note saying to call down to the desk if you were having trouble adjusting the temperature (which leads me to believe you're unable to actually adjust it) but the person at the front desk said we should be able to adjust it ourselves.  Needless to say, we left the balcony door open to cool down the room.There is also A LOT of outside noise that gets in to the room through the balcony.  Even after the room cooled down and I closed the balcony, I was still woken up multiple times by noise from trucks driving by.  There is also construction going on across the street (I know this is unavoidable) but it is just unfortunate getting woken up to the sound of jackhammers on a getaway.The bottom line is, for one night this hotel was fine.  However, I probably wouldn't choose this it again over some of the other hotels in the area.Came to Baltimore to see a concert and decided not to stay at a big name, branded hotel. Wanted something a bit more ""boutique."" I must say, I couldn't ask for more. The GM, Tiffany, has made us feel so unbelievably welcome that I feel like I'm staying at a friend's home. The room is gorgeous and SPOTLESSLY clean. The service has been top-notch, from the reservation, to the reschedule due to a blizzard, to the check-in. The staff is polite, and the accommodations are beautiful. Also, the rooms are very unique - stained concrete floors, area rugs, beautiful furniture - feels like an artsy, well decorated apartment, not a hotel. And the price was unbeatable! Thank you Tiffany and Staff for a pleasant experience that my wife and I could never have received from one of the big guys. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!Horrible experience! The was one of the worst stays we have ever had anywhere in the world. We had paid a good amount of money ($300+) for what we expected to be a romantic stay for our anniversary. The staff member at arrival really did not seem to want to be there and was very unhelpful while checking in. When we found our room, our first thought was that it had not been cleaned from the prior stay, but soon found out that this is how they thought a room should be presented. The mirror in the bathroom, that should have been on the wall behind the vanity, was lying propped against a wall next to an exposed plumbing pipe. The couch had stains and remnants of food and other items all over it. There was coffee and no coffee machine. Cups but no spoons. Plates but no knives. Dead plants and a general state of disrepair. The towels and carpets were so worn they looked like they should have been trashed. When we spoke another staff member at reception (who had not been told our concerns by his colleague even though we where told he would have) he explained that he knew nothing about the free bottle of wine that was advertised when we booked. Having traveled the world I would have expected more from a $20 a night hostel. Do yourself a favor and stay way clear!I stayed here on new years day for one night. The hotel is very nice and as soon as you  check  in the aroma from the organic establishment inside beside the desk is extraordinary!! Omg it's like wow I just ate but all of a sudden I'm hungry :)..our room was spacious and very cozy. They have a nice size jacuzzi in the bathroom area and they also give you a complimentary bottle of wine.  Be sure to ask for it as we did when we checked in. The only reason i can't give this hotel  5 stars is because i could not get with the fact that they didn't have a microwave in the room. They had a frig but that was it. Maybe it's just me but if i had to stay there more than one night i would have preferred to have one. The organic very very healthy breakfast was super delicious. I enjoyed every bite.. also kudos to the comfortable bed.  Overall it was a great stay :) And definitely nicer for couples..Love it here! Relaxing. Peaceful. Calming. I've stayed several times. I even stayed here during the riots and, not to take anything away from that unfortunate situation, you would have never known that you were even in the same state! Want to disconnect, relax, get away from the ""everydays""....you're here!!I wanted to love this hotel, but after staying here I can only say that I like it.The good: The rooms here are *huge*.  The hotel's website says that its smallest rooms are 800 square feet, and my room definitely looked that big.  For reference's sake, my room was about the same size as the apartment my now-wife was living in when I met her.  The location's also great -- the hotel's in the trendy Fells Point neighborhood, and just a short walk away from Inner Harbor.  The I'm-not-so-sure: The hotel's done in a style reminiscent of a Mediterranean villa, complete with plaster walls and bare concrete floors.  I guess the look works, but it doesn't really feel luxurious in the way you'd expect in a hotel where the rooms start at close to $300 per night.  I only ordered food once, but the ""Baltimore Benedict"" (eggs Benedict, except with crab instead of ham) I got was disappointingly flavorless.  The WiFi is slow but usable.The bad: All of the room lights are controlled by motion sensors, but at least in my room the sensor couldn't see the shower, so halfway through each shower the windowless bathroom would be plunged into complete darkness.  It's not the hotel's fault, but right now there's a million square foot office building being built across the street, which means that at seven o'clock in the morning every weekday, you're awakened by the sound of big trucks rumbling by and beeping as they back up.  This is extra non-awesome if you're still on Mountain Time as I was.  Also, there were some pretty gnarly stains on the walls of the bathroom and living room.  (?!?)The hotel's location is perfect for what I'm looking for, so I may be back, but I have to say that the place isn't awesome for the price.Let me start by saying that I've never met nicer hotel/inn staff than those at the Inn at The Black Olive. Without exception, quality individuals.Having worked in Fells Point for years, and having interacted with the owner of the restaurant and inn, I was excited to finally have an opportunity to stay at the inn. (We were holding a function in the area and needed a place to get dressed after the hard work was done -- and sleep after the even harder work was done.)Not the fault of the inn, but that area of Caroline St. stinks -- like rotten eggs or sewage. I gagged several times while walking back and forth to our event venue.A wall in the living area that should have contained a piece of art was bare -- except for four screws. Also, it appears that there were several areas on the ceiling that had been spackled but not painted -- not very attractive.Unlike another review noted, there was no television in the bedroom.Loved the whirlpool bathtub.I wanted to love my stay there but I was a bit disappointed.Didn't stay here but visited the restaurant upstairs. We had a dinner party of 6 and were well taken care of the entire night. We went on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner and enjoyed our entire meal. Our meal began with a cucumber topped with some avocado cream puree. For our main course we ordered a bunch of family style plates that we passed around the table and shared. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. My steak was so tender and juicy I couldn't help but go for seconds. It is a bit expensive here but the food is worth it. Another great thing was the amazing view of the balcony. You could see all the beautiful city lights of Baltimore.Beautiful inn, spacious, clean, friendly staff. My one complaint is that parking was not included. The parking lot next door was full so we had to park at a different lot further away that cost $30 for less than 24 hrs and was not all that convenient :(Wonderful setting w views of the Harbor only exceeded by the quality of the food. Our server Kevin Calhoun was awesome.The hotel allowed a rooftop party on a Sunday night. Not only is it so loud I can't hear anything but the rap blasting...I've heard the ""N"" word and ""F"" bombs more then my entire life combined! I called the front desk multiple times but it's no better. Horrific experience. Seriously horrific. My kids are here!!!!!!!The staff was extremely friendly. Carrying our bags to or room and delivering ice was just the start. They were kind enough to scatter rose petals around the room, made a heart on the bed, and around the bath tub. They also gave us a supply of bath salts to use in the two person hydro therapy hot tub. The stand in shower is one of the largest iv ever been in. OrderUp delivered breakfast from a local bagel shop in the morning.  A fantastic start to our honeymoon.The staff here is great. Not many places where you can meet and interact with the owner. Dimitri is very friendly and down to earth. The rooms are great, spacious and cozy!My fabulous bridesmaids found the Inn and reserved a suite for my bachelorette party.  There were two king beds and a whole separate bedroom.  The bathroom was massive and gorgeous.  We slept 6 people very comfortably (including an air mattress).  The service of the staff is amazing .... they were so attentive.  PLUS, you get a free bottle of wine with yelp check in!!  Small Mediterranean cafe downstairs open M-Sat.A fantastic place for a weekend retreat! Great customer service in all phases of the place; market, hotel, and restaurant.   The food is exceptional; it's all organic and for the most part Greek.   We will be back the next time we're in Bmore.Lovely hotel. Huge rooms and fantastic food. We were here for a special event (a reception for the hugely talented writer of 'Ghana must Go,' Taiye Selasi) and they treated us beautifully. The space was a teeny bit cramped but that's probs cos most of the guests were larger than life personalities ;)  I was bowled over by the polenta and the pie. The quality of everything was top notch. Would thoroughly recommend!Just lovely place. Situated in a nice area- with a short walk to the Aquarium. The cafe is nice, and delectable. I enjoyed my breakfast sandwich-it was very delicious. The room was a suite, and it was very relaxing and clean. I loved it. The bed was super comfortable and I loved how much space there was for the price.Would def. visit again.Greek Mediterranean seafood.   Amazing selections of wine.  Great service great atmosphere and even better food. The squid salad....omg.  Incredible. This is for a special occasion.  Do not miss it!","We were looking for a place to host a VERY special dinner for 8 complete with atmosphere, location, ambiance and amazing food and we found it all at restaurant at The Black Olive Inn.  We met with Dimitri and Layce to tell them what we were looking for and they went above and beyond our expectations.  They helped us find a little boat for a harbor tour, brought delicious appetizers on the boat for us and then laid a special table for us on the rooftop of the Inn including a personalized menu!  Our guests were thrilled, as were we.  Thank you to all at the Inn, it was a magical evening.There are several up market choices for the waterfront, but this one is just a 5 minute walk from that cluster of 4 Seasons, Marriott, surrounding retail, restaurants, and a Whole Foods.  It's a smart alternative and the stroll along the dock is exceedingly relaxing.  Fell's point is just another 5 minute walk in the opposite direction.The hotel staff is extremely accommodating, the rooms have an industrial, loft conversion feel, and the amenities are modern and truly eco, down to the toiletries.  Each even has its own flat screen google tv, so no need to leave your room for a business center.  There's a mini kitchen, and a washer dryer combo unit for small loads (I repeat, small). Unlike those other places, this place is so clean I had to walk barefoot on the concrete floor, and I didn't hear a thing all week, not even a neighbor.If you're around during the day, sneak up to the rooftop restaurant deck and enjoy the views, the sun, and the complete luxury of it being all to yourself.  Open the doors to both of your balconies and let the fresh breeze in.Don't be fooled by the plain exterior, as usual it's the inside that counts.Awful service. Waited 30 minutes to be seated even though we had reservations. Took the staff two hours to serve us out main course despite us putting in the order at same time as appetizer. Had the braised lamb (just ok), catch of the day (just ok), crab cakes (no flavor), and lamb chops (just ok). The lamb chops came out raw and had to be sent back to finish cooking. Had 3 cocktails off their menu- all of them awful. Usually if I have a bad dining experience I won't take the time to yelp it. This time the restaurant earned the bad review in a big way.Great hotel!  The rooms are suites with lots of natural light and very modern.  I enjoyed  the rooftop restaurant and bar.  It's a short walk to all the great locations and parking in the adjacent garage was only $13 for 24 hours.  A big plus is that the hotel is NON-Smoking so you don't get slapped in the face with the smell like you do in the big chains down the street.Great rooms, eco-friendly design.   I stayed here recently and I really like it. they are the most eco-friendly hotel I've ever been to. TP is from a brand that uses recycled paper, whirlpool tubs, and many other things.  There is also an organic market/cafe next to the lobby that has some great food.  I would definitely stay here again.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that they are still using CFLs in their lighting fixtures instead of the much better LED lights.I'm a bit of a hotel brat, and have stayed in some of the finest hotels around the world. With two kids in college, the hotel budget is smaller, but the bratty expectations are still there, so I am challenged to find high standards at good prices. The Inn at the Black Olive made this hotel brat a very happy person.Upon arrival, I was intrigued by the small check-in area, with the small cafe next to the area, and wasn't entirely sure what to think. My check in was a breeze, and AJ took me to my suite on the fourth floor. The rooms were enormous! I was impressed by the rugs made with vegetable dyes, the hypoallergenic furnishings, the thoughtful (and free!) bottle of Mountain Vally water (my favorite) and a bottle of Greek wine chilling in the small refrigerator, the spacious bedroom and the colorful artwork. AJ gave an interesting explanation of the attributes of the mineral coloring in the walls, the art, and the other characteristics of the rooms. And the bathroom! A huge air jet tub, large enough for two, and the air jets made the spa bubbles ensuring no nasty recycled jacuzzi water was in this tub. And there was a separate shower that was also enormous. Great water pressure, organic bath products including a fabulous bubble bath, and separate WC for privacy. The towels were plentiful and thick.Other pluses:Valet parking is just $25 for the LENGTH OF YOUR STAY! Not per night. And your car is brought around very quickly.No carpet! I loved the oasis of the rugs, and no carpets meant cleaner floors, less allergens, and no stuff that gets trapped in carpets.Comfortable platform beds with lovely but firm mattresses. Great pillows, too.Large closet and plenty of nice wooden hangers.Delicious coffee and a coffee maker that actually worked.First class service! The staff, including AJ, Ahmed, Al, Chris, and Joseph were amazing! If I needed something, they were right there. One night I had to make a CVS run about 11:15 pm. Rather than send me out at night, one of the staff took me in their car and waited for me to make my purchase. You just don't find service like this anymore!One afternoon, the owner, Dimitris was in the lobby, and he inquired about my stay. I was telling him how pleased I was, then I figured out to whom I was speaking. Dimitris was so gracious, asking if I needed anything, and thanking me for selecting his hotel for my stay. You can tell the guests are appreciated at the Inn at the Black Olive.Overall, this is the place I will stay in Baltimore. I already have reservations for move-in weekend and Parents' Weekend at the university. The uniqueness, cleanliness, attention to detail, friendliness of staff and top-notch service have sold me on the Inn at the Black Olive. I used to wrinkle my nose at small boutique hotels, but not this one. When I return to the Inn at the Black Olive, which I am eager to do, I know the staff will make me feel welcome and I'll have another wonderfully comfortable stayWonderful service!  Staff was very attentive and welcoming! The location is great for bumming around the harbor and was right next to our dinner destination.  The views from the restaurant on the roof were spectacular.  As were the cocktails we enjoyed there.  Also loved at the eco-friendly touches.  My only complaint would be wanting better lighting in the bathroom- for make up application.  We will definitely come back.  Thank you for a wonderful weekend.What a great find. We vacationed in town for the weekend and the hotel is right at the juncture of Harbor East and Fells Point - lots of restaurants, shops, etc to walk to. A very Eco-friendly hotel - huge rooms , big bathrooms with a jacuzzi, incredible beds. Beautiful oriental carpets on the floors and very colorful walls and artwork. Met the owner, Dimitri, who is obviously very proud of his inn and was extremely gracious. Very nice bar on the top floor with a great view. A market on the ground floor too for coffee, sandwiches, etc. A very nice change from your standard hotel and such a nice personal feel to the place - would definitely come back. My only suggestion would be some more seating in the living area and perhaps a TV in the bedroom.We came with big expectations to the IatBO due to favorable review on TA. It is well located and the staff really go out of their way to accommodate you. The rooms (at least ours) was HUGE, probably almost 1000 sqft, with a large BR, LR, kitchenette, and bath,There are problems, however. The highly touted geothermal heating, really didn't work that well, with blowing cold air, and the hot water never was that hot or plentiful. The fancy net-based house phone didn't work either, nor did the coffee maker. Although located on a quiet street, it is opposite a construction site that it quite noisy, and the street does get a surprising amount of traffic. The staff, though helpful, are a bit too ""laid back"" for my taste, just seem like some ""slouchers"" hanging around the front desk more than service professionals.For my money, I'll stay next time at a big chain and leave the autoclaved gypsum walls, hypoallergenic concrete floors, organically grown linens, and geothermal heating for someone else to enjoy.Very accommodating! Everyone that works here is at your service and will provide you with whatever you want! Had an amazing experience and will definitely stay again if ever in the area!Stayed one night with my daughter while looking at colleges. First time here and was very impressed. Staff couldn't have been any more friendly and helpful. Room was a suite and very large. Though the property is relatively new it was made to look old which was great. We had dinner outside on the roof and the food and service was great. Couldn't have been any more relaxing. Fells Point area is unique and worth exploring. Highly recommend and look forward to returning.Low key, relaxed, quiet and comfortable.  Plus, it's a great deal!  The two bedroom suite is huge, spare and modern.  The beds are amazingly comfortable, with organic bedding.  There is a large whirlpool bath as well.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The cafe has nice choices and the nearby Greek restaurant associated with the hotel has terrific food.  The hotel is in Fell's Point, close enough to be very convenient to restaurants and the waterfront, but far enough from the center to avoid the noise of the bar scene.Very clean-- welcoming-- original artwork in walls--a great location in Fells Point--a real presence of a family run business-- I felt that we were their first priority! I recommend the Inn highly.",,,,"['honestly', 'remember', 'last', 'time', 'rated', 'business', 'five', 'stars', 'black', 'olive', 'deserves', 'every', 'star', 'review', 'service', 'atmosphere',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/radisson-hotel-at-cross-keys-baltimore-3,Radisson Hotel At Cross Keys,2.5,$$,26,"Not sure why this hotel has such low reviews. I thought they did a great job managing all of us from area TV stations during the blizzard. The food at their restaurant was great and for me the service was wonderful. The only bad thing was the room I was in smelled like cigarette smoke -- but I was too exhausted to care enough to tell someone. Sandra at the front desk is amazing! She saw I was super exhausted and even though they didn't have rooms ready she got me into one ASAP. Also they are dog-friendly. Didn't bring my pup this time, but next time I will!Oh dear. While this hotel seems to be so proud of their renovations, it appears as of Summer 2015 that they neglected quite a few aspects in the reno process. My fiance and I were looking at a wedding venue in the area and this would have been the primary hotel for our guests. After our stay, it was blatantly clear that should we have our wedding nearby the Radisson fell way below our standards and we need to look elsewhere. PROS: The only pros of the place are the staff and newly renovated rooms. The Sleep Number bed is a great touch. Overall the room was very nice aside from the comments below. Parking is great with both outdoors or covered options. That is if you can find it as their driveway isn't exactly the easiest to find. They have a mini convenience store area next to the front desk which is always a plus should you need any amenities or food/drink. CONS: First off the elevators are terrible. Half of the lights don't light up and several times we had to push the ""open"" button for the doors to even open. Room wise, our door wouldn't close (obviously doors aren't their forte) unless physically pushed very firmly...of course by my fiance. So not good for those people who assume the door closes right behind them. Shortly after checking in we got some ice so we could pour some water into the glasses as it was super hot outside and we wanted some nice cold ice water. That idea was quickly ruined as there was ALREADY WATER in one of the glasses. Ewwww! Not the first thing you want to see when you walk into your hotel room. We were also missing the do not disturb sign. Typically we wouldn't care but we wanted to sleep in, especially on the Sleep Number bed! Luckily we got one from the front desk as the hotel staff was a bit noisy outside early the following morning. The fitness room leaves much to be desired while the pool had caution tape along the edges. Definitely not something I'd want my future wedding guests from out of town to see! The trek to the pool was confusing. Once we figured out how to get to the pool the exterior spaces that take you to the pool are incredibly outdated. I felt like I was in a 70's movie! Gross. Wi-Fi might be free but it was on and off. Totally not reliable so don't bet on that.OVERALL: I applaud the Radisson for the upgrades and updates to the rooms. Mad props there as the rooms trump several of the major hotels I routinely stay at in downtown Baltimore. Still, you seriously need to fix literally everything else. My fiance gives you a C- while I'd give a C. More specifically the pool area, common areas, gym, and elevators need major help. I have no idea why you were sold out for 3 weddings the weekend we stayed here. I'd be beyond embarrassed to have my friends and family stay here for my wedding. No offense to the fabulous staff but seriously if you're going to fix something fix the whole package if you're going to charge over $200!We visited this hotel for the first time this past weekend while down for Hopkins Family weekend.  I have to say I was less than impressed.  For perspective, I'm not a super high-end traveller (not that I wouldn't LOVE that) -- but our norm for family trips are Hampton Inn, Hyatt Place  -- clean, comfortable, budget friendly.  I chose this location over the Hampton Inner Harbor -- next time I'll try the Hampton.  From the photos and description of this ""recently renovated"" hotel, I thought it would be in that league, but it fell short:CONS:1.  Housekeeping:  The white duvet/comforter covers that you would think they replaced with each visitor were NOT clean.  On arrival, I checked and saw immediately that both were stained, clearly by previous visitors.  With one call to the front desk it was taken care of -- but still -- this should not happen with those white duvets covers.  Toothpaste splash stains on the wallpaper (from previous guests) also should have been wiped off.2. Beds were not good.  This hotel website advertises ""sleep number"" beds.  I know what that is because we have one, and I love it.  Our room did NOT have a sleep number bed, and the old mattress was not very comfortable.  When I asked about the sleep number beds, the front desk clerk was very honest and said that only SOME rooms have the sleep number beds - their website does NOT say this.  Honestly, the sleep number bed is not why I booked this room -- but I did have an expectation that the beds would be of a certain higher quality comfort --- and they were definitely not.  3. Location of this hotel is off the B'more beaten path, and slightly hard to find b/c signage is poor, in an upscale-ish shopping center (Williams Sonoma, Talbots, Donna's).  The building itself is older, with longggg hallways that make some rooms quite a haul from the elevators.  Despite the renovations (new carpets, wallpaper furnishings), our room -especially the bathroom- had a slightly grungy feel.PLUS: 1. Free parking.I was pretty bummed out by my latest experiences here.1) Touting that they are oriented toward business travelers, this hotel has very poor, spotty wi-fi. They were not able to fix it after multiple complaints.2) Their ""handicap"" rooms range in actual accommodations. I've been in multiple rooms they call ""handicap,"" and they all have a range in door width, accessibility to the shower, etc.3) Their faulty refrigerators (2) not only did not work but ruined expensive prescription medicine. There was not even an apology.4) Management has been overwhelmingly rude lately about changing dates for reservations despite my being a regular customer here and being a Club Carlson member.Ordered a King, got two Queens. The place looks rough, and well lived in, not what I expected from a Radisson. The staff was ok. Didn't ask much and regretted the choice once I walked in the elevator. Rooms were spotless.Worst guest service ever. Rate confirmation of $50/night from company reservation confirmation email was categorically denied by this location.  Several other people in our group had same experience.  Managers said they could not comp a room, which would have brought the quoted rate to the wedding rate we had asked to book under. Some people who complained got half off one night. Orhers got free drink tickets.  No one got the rate quoted in their confirmation letter.Don't ever go to a Radisson unless you are willing to pay more than what they quote.I was surprised to see all the negative reviews of this hotel. The lobby area is beautiful, and the room is spacious and modern. It's also incredibly clean. There's a nice flat screen TV. I am not 100% sure about the Sleep Number bed yet, but I think it will be comfortable and there are lots of pillows on the bed. We would definitely stay here again.EDIT: After sleeping, I'm editing my review. The Sleep Number bed did not seem to work with the remote, and it wasn't comfortable. Kind of like sleeping on a futon. The sheets didn't fit the bed well and were pulled off the mattress by morning. Radisson: ditch the Sleep Number beds!Don't stay here!! I only stayed here one night and didn't have a great experience....First off, five minutes after I walked into my room housekeeping walked right in with a master key to add more towels to the two I already had!! Ummmm excuse me?? Thank God I wasn't getting busy yet....smh Then they charged both my debit card and my credit card for my one night stay!! When I first called to inquire about it, I was told that I wouldn't be charged twice!! Then a week later when I checked both my accounts they were indeed charged!!!! Uhhhhh so annoying!!This hotel is fine--there is really nothing wrong with it. And I have to say, that their sleep number beds created some of the better nights of sleep I have had in a long time! Great advertisement for those beds :-)Were the rooms the most updated? No, but everything was definitely fine. I would have liked an overhead light rather than having to turn on all of the little lamps and such, but really the room was fine overall--decent size, comfy bed, what else do you really need? They have happy hour in their bar downstairs which I found myself hanging out at which was fun, but that was mainly because other than the little boutique shops here, if you don't have a car, staying here means you are pretty much stuck at the hotel, since there isn't really anything within a mile from the hotel. So make sure you have your laptop or ipad to use their free wifi! And definitely eat at the village square cafe next door to this place--you won't regret it!Highly recommended place to stay and dine.  The atmosphere was pleasant, food was outstanding, and the mixologist was a true professional.  There was also a shuttle service that we took advantage of.   The new Horseshoe casino was 15 minutes away and we plan on retuning in May for the preakness Horserace, which, by the way is only 10 minutes away.  The rooms are newly renovated and had a modern sleek look.  Room service was exceptional.Great room! Very spacious, with a comfy bed, nice lounge chair, clean bathroom, stylish desk/chair and plenty of power outlets :)The location is kind of strange, inside a small mall/office complex, but it was easy to find and had available underground parking.  I was staying here for an interview at Sinai Hospital, and had been told there was a free shuttle service, but it turns out the shuttle only ran once early in the morning...  The service was nice and they had available late check-out for no extra charge :)Overall, it was a comfy room.  No minifridge/microwave combo, but there was a hair dryer available.  Currently undergoing some renovations on the 4th floor, so some paint smell.I enjoyed my stay here.  I stayed in the junior suite for about $140/night which is very reasonable considering the other hotels more intown in Baltimore.  The decor was updated and there  was a mini fridge and microwave.  Also there were a couple of water bottles waiting for me in the room which was a nice touch. The older African American lady in the front desk was very nice with a calming demeanor.  Only thing I did not like was being disturbed twice within 2 hours of entering my room.  The first time, the lady knocked, did not wait for me to answer door and just walked in. I was very annoyed and she did not even apologize and instead told me I should have used the door stop. Also, the restaurant is very pricey but the food was good.  I liked their bar and lobby sitting area as well.  Parking is also easy.  The hotel is a little hard to find when you fist arrive as it is in a complex.If I ever had to chance to stay here again... I WOULDN'T &amp; wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  The beds were uncomfortable even though they were advertised as sleep number beds, the bathroom was so tiny that it barely fits 2 people to get ready, and the remote for the bed was disgusting. The interior in the lobby isn't bad, but that's about it. The checkin guy was ok, but kept having conversations with the other worker and it wasn't professional. After leaving, a few days later we noticed a $100+ charge on our credit card statement. When we called to inquire about this  mysterious charge, as we booked and payed in advance through Expedia, they had no record of us checking us and couldn't even find our credit card on file to look up this charge.  They had no idea what we were talking about cause they were INCOMPETENT. I'll never stay at any Radisson again.My husband and I stayed here for a quick night during travel. The staff is very pleasant, and they have definitely done some work here and there to modernize the place. I also enjoyed the shops at Cross Keys. All in all, a decent hotel in a nice location. Everything was clean, nothing special, but very clean.My main complaint would be the bed in our room. It was so firm that it was uncomfortable. The bedding itself was fine, but the mattress was hard as a rock. A pillow top or more cushioned mattress pad would help a lot.One of the nicest features of this hotel is the restaurant, Scoozi. We stopped in for a quick dinner, and I went again for breakfast while my husband was at a work meeting. Both meals were very good, and I would definitely go back.Came to this hotel for a one-day seminar.  The hotel was undergoing some much needed renovation (looks very dated).  The room that my seminar was held in was on the mezzanine level, which only had one restroom for men and women to share.  The room was okay, nothing fancy, but the tablecloths that were provided to us had rips / holes in them.  I ate at the restaurant downstairs.  Ordered the grilled chicken casesar salad, where the chicken was extremely dry and tasteless and drenched in dressing, but the rest of the salad was okay.  Also ordered a french onion soup, which I think they forgot about because I had to ask for it after they took my salad away.  It was extremely hot and I burned my tongue :(  Taste-wise it was good though.The room was beautiful and huge-somehow, we got a suite. We stayed for one night, we got in late. It's pretty confusing to find the front desk-maybe we were just super tired. The room was comfortable, and most importantly really clean. We were there for graduation weekend-so we didn't spend very much time in the hotel.By pet ""friendly"", this hotel means your pet can stay here. If anyone complains or if there is audible noise/barking etc. you will be harassed by staff multiple times a day until you check out, adding a lot of stress to your trip.  On the flip side, if you require silence and don't like dogs...you can be guaranteed your complaints will be heard. The housekeeping staff is stellar creating a clean environment but the beds were uncomfortable and the pet friendly status is in name only.Needs updating. The sleep number beds are nice, but some of them don't function properly or fully. The bathrooms definitely need renovated. The TV gets something like 18 channels, and everything else is pay-per-view. Wi-fi is not free.It wasn't a luxury resort, but it was far from a dump. The little ""village"" it is located in is nice for out-of-towners. We ate lunch at the cafe next door, and there were a number of shops surrounding a little quad area. The housekeeping staff were incredibly nice, and the front desk was helpful in providing us with directions to an event we were attending.I would probably try somewhere else if I was in the area again, but it wasn't an unpleasant stay.I check-in Mothers Day and while it wasn't the nicest looking place it was in a quiet setting.  The inside smelled a little musty, but looked clean.  My room was large and late that night I went to shower only to discover a dirty washcloth in my shower.  I continued on!Off to work the next day to return and find a note stating we apologize but we had a water pipe failure and are working to repair it, we will keep you informed.  I went out to eat, returned and around 9 pm that evening called to see what the status was with the water.The front desk said it would be on at NOON the following day, I said excuse me did you say tomorrow.  Yes NOON tomorrow, so I asked what I should do about showering.  He said that they could give me a couple of gallons of water for my room.  (Not sure how that helps)  I said that would not be acceptable, he said well you can go to a hotel where we made arrangements.I asked when they decided to let me know and he said we left a message on your room phone, I stated I had no message and he said we left one for all guest.  Now is he saying I lied?  I guess he thought I would sit around until 9:30 just to give him a hard time.  I said I was going to the other hotel and would be down.The other hotel was Best Western an $89 dollar a night hotel and my room was costing $179, not a fair trade.  Plus the hotel was miles away from where I needed to be.  What I couldn't figure out is how the water goes out before noon Monday and it takes until NOON Tuesday to fix. Baltimore has plumbers.  Just doesn't seem the customer is that important to them.  So today I checked out a day early and moved to another hotel.  The funny thing is no one asked way I was leaving early.I stayed here for a business tip.  The location was pretty strange, it was part of what looked like a gated mall.  The staff were extremely friendly.  The room itself was big, but the furniture was all pretty old, it looked like it had not been updated in a long time.  I was not impressed by the sleep number bed, it felt like there was a board running down the middle of it.For business purposes, it seemed like the shuttle ran somewhat randomly, the setup seemed to be to accommodate people who were in town to visit the hospitals.  I was told they could not make it available for one of my trips, I shared a cab with another person and after the cab ride saw the shuttle roll up behind me at the destination.But hey, cab fare wasn't much, staff was great on the check in and check out, would have liked a bit more modern comfort for getting my work done.  I would probably stay there again if I needed to be in this particular area of the city.","Just like their logoSad and dated and real old.Sleep number's a joke.I'm going with only two stars for this hotel and there's several reasons for it. First of all the location is weird and not easy to find. The entrance to the hotel is located inside a shopping plaza within a gated complex. Looking for it at night you're most likely to drive by the first time then turn around and look for it again. Once you're past the gate it's not over yet. Good luck finding the signs for the actual hotel entrance. Someone made sure they are vague and few! My tip: look for it where you would least expect it, inside a parking garage! My second gripe: this hotel must have the thinnest walls ever. I was able to hear every single word and every action of guests staying in two adjacent rooms. This can be irrelevant if you're a loud person yourself or very annoying if you're trying to catch some sleep and your neighbors are not...Third issue: room service hours are odd. They start at 11:30am and end at 10:30pm. I don't get it. Aren't these exactly the hours most people wouldn't be in their hotel room?!? What good is a room service if you never get to use it? I have to say their menu looked quite inviting, which was even more annoying because I didn't get to try anything! ;)Not end the review with just complaints the cleanness of the room was impeccable. Beautifully maintained, fully equipped bathroom, good beds (although i can see how the firmness control feature will be seen as more of a nuisance than a good feature by some).I stayed here on a trip for work.  It was okay, not the best but by no means the worst.  It was situated in a sort of outdoor mall setting.  From the outside the hotel kind of looked like a retirement community.  It smelled like on on the inside.  The staff was quite friendly.  Although, they weren't overwhelmingly concerned with running the shuttles on time.  However, they were exceedingly sweet and stopped by a drug store so I could pick up a few things that got left behind.The room was nice and clean, the bed was perfect.The location is weird and the restaurant is limited and has very poor service. This hotel is basically in a mall, and the area is pretty dead. There is only one other restaurant in the mall, and it's hard to find if you don't know what you're doing. The hotel had no gift shop, and we didn't have a car, so getting the mile down the road to a drug store was not easy.I would stay here again, if I had a car, and needed to be in the area. Otherwise, I would recommend staying downtown instead. The hotels by the inner harbor are more expensive, and there's a good reason why -- they're by a lot more neat stuff, in a more fun area.I visited this Radisson from our east coast office - our offices are based right next door to the hotel.  We had several colleagues from our west coast come to the hotel where we had a conference room and all the amenities for 3 days. I called in room service on 12/15/10 at 645pm.  After ringing several times, I was transferred to the front desk, where they just continued transferring me back to room service. Sheniqua was the person who kept transferring me.  I went through literally 25 minutes of this.  Never did she take ownership to find out why no one was picking up.  She just continued transferring me back, never inquiring or never doing anything really.  Finally, I called the restaurant myself and was told someone would come to my room to take my order.  No one.  35 minutes later I walked down to the restaurant where I waited another 10 minutes for someone to even talk to me.  Finally I was able to give my order 45 minutes after I placed my initial call.During this time I was expected to work to get out work assignments that evening - what business travelers do and why I wanted room service in the first place (and now I am taking time to write a complaint when I should be working).Rest assured, I nor anyone at my company will ever stay at any Raddison hotel anywhere and anytime.  Not only have they lost a major corporate client in the area, but also a very young professional who has a lifetime of stays ahead of him.Simple as that - one employee's negligence coupled with a system wide failure of hotel staff and management (are you guys understaffed?).  How absurd it is that someone can call room service for 25 minutes and not only have anyone pickup, but then employees refuse to take ownership and figure out what's going on (and follow up to make sure the issue was resolved).  The entire hotel staff and management should be wiped out - surely if I was in charge of this operation, the failure to deliver such an elementary service as room service would warrant such a drastic change.I chose to stay at the Radisson Hotel at Cross Keys because it is just a few minutes away from my friend's home. I wasn't overly impressed with the hotel, but it's your typical Radisson at an average price ($139/night). The rooms aren't anything spectacular, but they are pretty large. The people who work at the hotel are nice and friendly, but they don't go out of their way for you like they do at some nicer hotels. I did notice that it's next to some nice restaurants and the red door spa, which I would have checked out if I was staying in the area longer.  My stay at this hotel was very convenient, but if I was staying in Baltimore for a longer period of time I would probably choose another hotel.",,,,"['sure', 'hotel', 'low', 'reviews', 'thought',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-baltimore-at-the-stadiums-baltimore,Holiday Inn Express Baltimore At The Stadiums,2.0,$$$,25,"Better than I expected. The complimentary breakfast included hot food. Not great quality, but OK. Location is an easy walk to the stadium. The rooms were OK. Air conditioning was effective, but a bit loud. Everything was clean.I stayed at the Holiday Inn express in Baltimore for the weekend of 10/16-10/19. I booked 2 rooms with 2 month advance notice. on 10/15, I called to change one of the rooms to be a 3 night stay instead of 4. When I arrived, things went smoothly, until Friday when the check in for the second room took place. Holiday Inn originally quoted me $1192.00 for the entire stay of both rooms and suddenly I had a total of 2600 charges pending on my card. Concerned, I asked multiple times to speak to a manager and the staff said they would have someone call me. I called after not hearing back and the front desk lady hung up on me. I called again and no results. I went to the front desk multiple times throughout the day and no manager was on site. I was told Sunday, the manager Jim would be there by 8AM. I waited till 8:30AM and then was told Erica, the other manager would come at 11AM. No one showed up. The staff had no idea what was going on and they were just incompetent and rude. I called your corporate office on Sunday 10/18 and again I was told a manager would call me back.. I didn't hold my breath. I am yet to hear back. This organization needs serious training on customer service.Good Riddance!I have chosen Holiday Inn Expresses as my go to (go to sleep too tired to drive).  Upon arrival with reservation, clerk needed my reservation number to find me, odd.  I have road warrior written all over me, glazed eyes, coffee stains, disheveled, exhausted.  She look annoyed to have to put down her phone.  I gave her everything she needed and she started rattling everything pertinent to rush me off. I was EXTREMELY incensed that it's $20 a night to park!  She said my hotel key will open the gate to the lot.  So I drive around to lot in back of hotel- the ""gate"" is a bar that even if down could be ducked under/over.  Didn't matter, it was UP, WTH?  This is the middle of crap town, junkie, hookers, get the picture?  I'm told to display the card they give you in window.  I notice there are tons of cars w/o one.  This lot is really false security, no cameras and dark, with a short fence keeping ""the hood"" out.  I'd feel safer parking at the lighted gas station and pay the clerk $20 to watch it.There are no valet carts in sight, I had to schlep everything in one trip.  Awful, because the hotel is relatively empty off season, mid week.  Pass hotel clerk, doesn't look up from her phone.  This level of service can certainly be automated.The room itself is nice enough, but totally NOT worth the $$$ ($145 with parking for one night).  No restaurants around unless you go in the casino- which wasn't interested or Subway.This hotel did everything we wanted for our stay. Good location where we could walk to the stadium and Inner Harbor. And it was a clean and decent hotel for us to sleep.  Some of the reviews on here are negative and I can understand that. There were some sketchy characters hanging around outside during our stay. We didn't pay them any mind and they didn't bother us. You are going to get that at most hotels around this area. But it is a short walk to the stadiums from here.This hotel has some things going for it and some very frustrating things about it.     If you are going to be spending a considerable amount of your stay at the casino as my friend and I were for poker, then it is the closest option. Although I wouldn't recommend it for almost anything else as it is sort of hood down here and not much of a discount to reflect that reality, likely due to the increase demand coming from casino.  Also, the walls in this hotel must be made of paper mache' or something.    I am currently in my room writing this review because the front desk called our room threatening to have us removed by police because of a noise complaint by our ""neighbor""    My friend and I were having a normal conversation at very normal levels of speaking. Nothing that one would even consider possible to be getting a call from the front desk. Not only that but they tell us that they called us the previous night due to a noise complaint from same said neighbor.First off, no one called our room the previous evening. period. end of story. Either the person who spoke to us is making it up or the person who reported to them that we were called was making it up. . So either we are staying next to the crankiest old man who happens to also be the lightest sleeper ever, these are the thinnest walls ever, or some combination of both, which I believe to be the case.    Either way it is extremely frustrating being someone that tends to be awake ""non-traditional"" hours, that any form of normal conversation or standard volume television options are eliminated because of the lack of the walls ability to keep even the smallest of sounds out.      The other thing that has been frustrating about the room is the heat/cooling system. It basically will make it in the room so that you will wake up 1-3 times a night guaranteed just to adjust the settings because it is either a sauna or an igloo. Very tough to maintain any sort of normal an acceptable temperatures.   Also, it is $20 a night to park. And yes I am sure buried in their fine print it says this somewhere but the fact is most people assume when booking a rate of $100+ per night that this might be all inclusive enough as to let your park there without a 20% increase in payment.   The staff has actually been very polite for the most part it is just annoying having to be called and threatened with removal over something that should be a total non issue. I should never have to remain silent in the room I am paying three figures to stay in, but with these walls apparently that has what it has come to. So instead I got on here and am trying to silently type and reflect the absurdity of this situation to my fellow yelpers before they send Baltimore's finest in to bust us for having a normal human conversation in a room absent of drugs, alcohol, outsiders, or anything of the sort.So overall, just make the drive from some nicer area like hanover 15 minutes away  or stay closer to the actual harbor/downtown. This location wouldnt be worth it to almost anyone who has other options.Was having a dr visit at the University of Maryland medical center and needed a place to stay. We have always used HIE in the past and were very pleased with our stay. We arrived a lot earlier than we had planned and our room was ready and we were allowed to check in. The hotel staff was very friendly and had all the amenities we love about HIE. We will be back in may when my husband  has surgery. Close to the hospital and in a nice part of town. Room was clean beds were comfy. Thanks for a great night! See you soon!Ps... Will the shuttle be able to take me to and from the University of Maryland medical center?This was one of the worst hotel stays I have had in years.  I wrote a review on Holiday Inn's website and it was rejected due to being inappropriate.  I did not mention anything that wasn't true.  I feel they just don't want to accept poor reviews and that is why it looks good on their site.  Poor service from front desk and cleanliness of hotel where my main reasons for my review.Stayed here on a weekend for an O's game and to check out the casino next door to the hotel. First time in Baltimore, so I wasn't too sure what to expect, but I had a pretty good time overall at the hotel. Front desk held our bags so we could explore the city a little bit. Parking is $20 a day, but I didn't find that to be outrageous or anything. The room was nice, definitely in line with what we paid for our stay. They offered free pancakes from 8pm to midnight, which was a nice touch. Free hot breakfast in the morning as well. Our room faced the casino so it could get kinda loud, but again, nothing we couldn't sleep through. If you're planning on going to an Orioles or Ravens game, you really can't beat staying here as you can walk to both relatively easily.The water took forever to warm up, I literally stood in the shower for 5min waiting for the water to warm up. It is also right next to a major road, so it is really loud and noisy around that area (barely got any sleep). Only good side is that it is right next to the city so it is somewhat of a walking distance to everything, and the horseshoe casino is literally right next door so for the gamblers that's good.One of the worst hotels we've stayed at. $220 per night for a run down, worn out room! Stay Away'I picked this hotel due to proximity to Carroll Park but the price was high for what they gave you.  I stayed two nights and they did not replenish my in room coffee.  I don't like being tentatively charged for parking when I said at check in I did not have a car.  The system should be able to handle it.  The room was clean so that was a plus!  If you are attending something at M&amp;T or Camden Yards  the location is great.At least those that wish to stay at this hotel will know they have to pay for ""their"" room and the ""parking-room"" for their vehicle. Bring a pillow! I still will not be staying at this or any other hotel in that area if they charge for vehicle parking. I realize it's a ""tourist"" area and probably why the hotels want to suck more money from the person on their short vacation stay. :)I found a much better choice at another HIE on Rt 40 with access to everything I needed,  including my trips downtown.Had a wionderful experience at this hotel.  WO\ould recommend it especially for cruise parking.Look, if you're coming to Baltimore and don't realize in advance that some of the city isn't up to par with your white picket fence, Disney World standards.....then this hotel or even the city for that matter, aren't for you.  The hotel itself has gone through some significant upgrades over the years, including a fenced in, key only parking area.  The slightly shady Greyhound bus station is right behind the hotel and yes, there are abandoned lots surrounding the HIE, but it's not the fault of the hotel for this.....blame the taxpayers and local officials for having an eyesore so close to the city itself.  I've been staying here the past two weeks for business and it has certainly grown on me.  My rates have ranged from $108 to $124 a night. The staff is one of the friendliest I have ever encountered and it takes awhile for a Northerner to grow accustomed to the ""how are you doing?"" from random strangers who pass by.  My rooms have been very nice in general and what makes me the most happy is that they not only have 40"" flatscreens in the rooms, they ALSO come with actual HD channels.  So many times I've been in hotels where this was wasted on the good screen, here they have DirectTV to ensure that this doesn't happen, +1 star right there. :)  Oh and as a techie, this is the time to mention how fast and reliable the completely free wi-fi is.....I've been impressed having to do work late into the night and it never dropping the signal or timing out on a page.  Criticisms are few.  Keep the pool open beyond Labor Day when it's still in the 90's!  I don't know why that's a closure time for anything below the Mason-Dixon line, somewhat annoying.  Also, the workout area is in need of an upgrade, free weights would be nice.  HIE's are all over the place when it comes to the fitness centers, some extremely nicer than others....this one needs an overhaul.  The shuttle to and from town is a nice feature, it stops at the convention center, Inner Harbor and Johns Hopkins hospital.....this is nice for those that don't want to pay for parking downtown or came in on a bus themselves.  A walk to the city would be quite a pain since it doesn't look all that pedestrian friendly.  There is a reason it's also called ""At the Stadiums"", this is likely the best hotel for NFL fans attending a game against the Ravens.  In fact, I'm lucky I got a room on a Thursday night prior to their home opener because they are for sure booked solid this upcoming weekend.  Go because it's cheap and has FREE transportation to the city, not for the viewsDO NOT stay at Holiday Inn Express Baltimore at the Stadiums.  Why?  Two reasons:1) This hotel makes false claims  (on its website) about its location that it is located in Inner Harbor, Baltimore. Do not be fooled. The hotel is definitely NOT in the Inner Harbor area. It is almost two miles to the Inner Harbor. It is at the Stadiums; the Stadiums are NOT in Inner Harbor. Unless you want to be at the Stadiums, DO NOT stay at this Holiday Inn Express.2) Hotel charges for parking and then denies hotel guests parking. This hotel charged $15 per night for parking. We stayed at the hotel for two nights and paid for parking for two nights, June 6 and 7, 2014. On June 7, the hotel parking lot was full and we were forced to park at a Shell station across the street. When you paid hotel for parking, you expect to park at the hotel parking lot. While the hotel clerk was not rude, she did not even apologize for the inconvenience nor offered to refund our parking fee. It appeared to her to be quite normal - to deny guests parking after they have paid for parking.Then, when we tried to park at the Shell station, the Shell employee knew NOTHING about this arrangement. He tried to call his boss but his phone ran out of power. He had to use my husband's phone to call his boss who then gave him the OK to let us park. It took 15 minutes to sort all this out. This was 11:30 pm and this is NOT something any hotel guest should have to deal with late at night.Unlike the hotel parking lot, the Shell station is not a secured area. So we paid $15 to park at an unsecured space. We might as well be parking on the street.For these two reasons I will NEVER stay at the Holiday Inn Express at the Stadiums again. If you need parking, DO NOT stay at this hotel because you may find yourself denied parking even after you paid for it and sent to god only knows which gas station in the area.  If you want to be in Inner Harbor, Baltimore, DO NOT stay at this hotel because it is NOT in Inner Harbor despite its claims on its website. PLUS, the traffic at the Stadiums is horrendous especially on game nights.  The area this hotel is in, is generally quite shabby and not a specially nice area to be sent off to park at some gas station late at night.   Oh, the  wifi is pretty much useless even though free.Is this really a Holiday Inn?  Paid $$$ online.  Then we were solicited by two homeless people for handouts during our check-in process (and the new casino is not even open yet!)  We were assigned the room closest to construction of new casino -- was it the only room left???.  Room smelled bad, burnt out light bulbs, missing shower curtain (WTH!?!).  Trash found on floor of room.  Ear plugs were provided in the room, apparently to reduce the noise in the morning.  The only positive was the maintenance man (72 yrs) showed up right away with lightbulb and shower curtain, was friendly and nice.  Maybe the new casino will hire him and he can retire shortly thereafter.Stayed at this hotel one night as we were catching a cruise ship out of the Port of Baltimore the next day.  This is a pretty bare bones, no frills hotel, but they did provide a small breakfast the next morning.  Our stay happened to coincide with the July 4 holiday, and the hotel faces a busy street as well.  I will liken the experience to trying to sleep in the middle of the Gettysburg Battlefield (fireworks) and  the Indy 500 speedway (loud traffic noise throughout the night) at the same time. It is also located in what appeared to be a rather sketchy part of town. The best part of our stay was the fact that they provide a ""park and cruise"" option which allows you to leave your car at the hotel for the week for a small charge while they take you  by shuttle to the cruise port and transport you back to your car upon your return. We took advantage of this offer because it is much less expensive than parking at the port for a week, and there were no problems.  In addition, there are no real options for food located nearby.  The casino is next door to the hotel, and we were told by hotel staff that this is where most of the closest food options are located.  However, we have two children under 18 who weren't even allowed to go into the casino building even though we only planned to eat. In retrospect, many hotels in that area make available the ""park and cruise"" service, so in all likelihood, the next time I would choose another hotel on a quieter street with restaurants and other amenities located nearby.If it weren't for the manager Michael's assistance, this would be a 1-star. We had a lot of trouble with our reservation, but the service we received from the manager was good enough to overcome what could have potentially been a drastic situation. Holiday Inn needs to empower their managers to be able to assist guests easier. It was difficult for Michael to honor our reservation without having to displace others. In the end we got what we needed, which was a room.When I arrived at this Holiday Inn they couldn't fulfill the booking I requested weeks ago. I reserved a two-bed, non-smoking room. When I arrived all they had was a room with a king bed and another with two beds but it was a smoking room. We checked the smoking room out but it smelled horrible therefore we decided to go with the room with the king bed. The manager told us he would give us a roll away bed since there was two of us.Once we got into the room with the king bed we noticed it was much smaller. The roll away bed soon arrived and it barely fit in the room. The roll away was also unmade and the mattress was broken (I attached a picture of it). They also gave us possibly the worse room in the hotel. It was right above the lobby so we heard people talking below, and cars on the busy road. It is also advertised that they have free WiFi in the rooms but the signal wasn't strong enough for our room apparently. Due to these circumstances we decided to check out at 10 PM and go elsewhere.Also I'm a Priories Club member and I booked this reservation weeks in advance so this shouldn't of happened. I also noticed that this hotel has had previous car brake-ins. They have a fence and gate so I'm not sure if this is still a problem. Just make sure you don't leave anything in plain view of the window. It is a shady area.I will give the hotel itself 4.5 stars but the area 1 star.We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights. The first night we ventured out to get food and went the wrong way apparently cause we ened up in the ghetto. We were scared for our lives. We got the gps to take us back and decided to order room service for the night. The hotel is nice and new and updated just dont go outside.","I guess the bottom line is you get what you pay for. We booked based on the transportation to and from the port but you can't sleep because of all of the noise from the other guests and anything that's plugged into a wall that constantly runs. Complimentary breakfast should have been called ""instant breakfast"". It was horrible. We waited for two hours after coming back from our trip in the freezing cold. We all ended arguing over who gets the seats. The attitudes from the drivers were unheard of. It was very unorganized. We will never stay at a holiday inn ever again because of the very poor service that we received. One night was one too many nights for us. I never thought that I would end up writing a bad review.Well...I would have given this place 2 stars if my vehicle was not broken into during my stay.  It is a subpar Holiday Inn Express, but what do you expect for a name brand hotel that is cheap and close to town?  It is completely surrounded by abandoned buildings, the Greyhound station, and shady-looking dudes everywhere.  Don't even think about walking anywhere, cause nothing is nearby except gas stations (they don't sell alcohol).  But the hotel does have free shuttles to the happening stuff at Inner Harbor.If you can get over the hotel being in a not-so-pleasant part of town, I think you'll enjoy your stay here. The shuttle service is great, and it's free so you don't have to worry about walking around here. The rooms are great too -- I got a good night's sleep on the big comfy bed.The only thing I didn't like was during the free breakfast -- they have the toaster right in the middle of the line, so if you just want to grab a cinnamon roll, you have to wait for everyone else toasting their bread. The line can get very long just for that. Otherwise, I liked the selection offered and my coffee was tasty and hot.Booked a hotel room here 3 weeks in advance for a convention. 2 days before the convention, hotel staff called to inform me that they had to transfer the booking to Extended Stay, a cheaper hotel which is 5 miles away, and for the same rate! This is the last thing you need when you're about to attend a big convention! They're so inconsiderate!It has all of the looks of an old hotel that was renovated.  The area is kinda scary and they have hotel security inside the building.  But that is nothing compared to the HUGE rat baits in the parking lot. The breakfast was even lower than the typical they didn't have the cinnamon rolls, eggs... This is the LOWEST cost option for hotels in the area.  I stayed there because we were in desperate need of a hotel.  We used the coupon from the Highway Travel magazine (pick them up in the rest areas) one night for $99 including parking, which is normally $10.",,,,"['better', 'expected', 'complimentary',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-baltimore-downtown-inner-harbor-baltimore,Fairfield Inn & Suites Baltimore Downtown/Inner Harbor,3.5,$$,48,"Top notch service!  Allowed me to use the laundry prior to check in and than check in early!  When I'm usually leaving between midnight and 2 in the morning every night this really is a nice treat.Stayed here for 2 nights in November. Very affordable, very clean, and in a great location. Just a couple mins walk to the inner harbor and restaurants. Only complaint we had was maid service skipped our room, and we had complain several times before they finally clean our room.Kevin Brown was my Check In person &amp; was very professional &amp; engaging. The hotel has two towers so be specific if you have a room view preference. The smaller hotel divisions of the big hotel chains always gives an extra effort of extending good customer service. Such as opening my bottle of Malbec &amp; giving me a nice red wine glass for my suite. Plus the location was outstanding as my walk to Whole Foods, CVS &amp; the Harbor was a brisk 5-10 minute walk. This hotel &amp; awesome staff were right on the mark.Great hotel in downtown Baltimore. Customer service was outstanding from Janet at the front desk to JP in the bar, who was exceptional!! They went out of their way toAccommodate me, will definitely be back.I recently stayed at this find hotel while I was in town at a show at pier six pavilion. The hotel is a comfortable five minute walk to our destination. The entire staff that my girlfriend and I encountered were extremely friendly, polite,and hospitable.The rooms were clean spacious and very fordable. If possible, pay the small extra premium for valet parking. It's well worth it and you have 24 access to your vehicle!We reserved the room using points from my girlfriends employer-unfortunately there was a small hick up and my credit card was accidentally charged. Ellen the sales manager and Kevin who works at the front desk were very attentive in fixing situation and the entire problem was solved all before check out. We are both very grateful to their dedication and they made us feel we were their number one priority. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that will be in the inner Harbor area and you better believe I will be back.Thanks for a great nights stay-you all were great!I called and attempted to make a Marriott rewards reservation at this hotel for a Saturday night.This hotel has a 2-night minimum stay requirement, which they enforce even for rewards travel. The Saturday night I wanted had vacancy, but they would not accept my one night rewards voucher unless I paid for Friday night.I've always been a loyal Marriott customer, but it seems very disingenuous to offer incentives to customers and then black out days where the hotel clearly has vacancy.I've maintained Gold Status for several years, but perhaps it's time that I look at other hotel chains.Not acceptable.Boy, did our floor stink! I don't even know how to describe it, but it was bad. Thankfully, the smell didn't linger into the room.The complementary breakfast wasn't bad. What you'd expect for any other Marriott.Considering I was there for the Ravens' SuperBowl victory parade, I was hoping the front desk would have more information about it, but they were totally clueless.The valet parking was $30/day, but most garages will charge you $20 plus overnight anyway so it's worth it.This place cost me 20,000 points. In hindsight, I wish I had stayed at the harbor location for an extra 10,000.I had a very good experience here.  The location is great, walking distance to restaurants and a short drive to lots more.  My room was very clean, as was my bathroom, and everything worked. Beyond those basic requirements, I found the check-in process to be very quick and efficient, due to a high level of staffing at the front desk.  The in-house restaurant was interesting looking, but my group only had a pre-dinner drink, so I don't know about their food offerings.Shavon Staten has been a dream! I am the maid of honor in my sisters wedding (Paige) and the planning has been so great because of Shavon! The weekend is coming up and we just met with her to finalize and things we weren't even thinking about she has made easier on us.... Truly an amazing experience! All of our stressors (especially my mom) were alleviated because she has been so generous and caring throughout this whole process. She is a breath of fresh air always!IA thought this hotel would be great since it was green certified and had good decor, however, it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.The stay here was by far the worst experience in my life. I left the hotel feeling violated, frustrated, and dumbfounded that a hotel would treat a guest so badly. I checked in late at the Fairfield Inn in Baltimore.  I was not greeted that pleasantly by the night staff. I was a bit embarrassed as I was checking in with a coworker who I had recently converted to Marriott hotels. She is a preferred Starwoods member. Her comment about the staff was they were a bit ""ghetto"" and would our car be safe in valet. The front desk clerk checked me into a first floor room and told me there were no other options, but I overheard my friend check in and they asked her if she wanted 2 or 3rd floor. After checking in I walked to my first floor room which was just around the corner from the  front desk. When getting to my room I realized I only had my credit card and room key in my hand and was missing my Drivers License. I immediately walked back to the front desk and informed them, I thought they might have forgotten to give me back my ID. Without even looking up from her phone the front desk clerk said, ""No I gave it back to you, check the floor you must have dropped it"" I informed her I looked on my way back and since I was on the first floor and only gone less than a minute I would have seen it on the way back to the counter. She still said ""Nope not up here"" NOT EVEN LOOKING AT HER DESK, surrounding floor or putting forth any effort to find it. As you can tell I was quite upset but returned to my room thinking maybe I put it a pocket of my jacket etc. After searching all of my belongings I still did not find it.  I called the front desk and was told that if housekeeping finds it they would let me know. The next morning, I went down to the front desk where a new set of crew members were. I asked them about the ID and told them my story. They reported that the night clerk did not mention anything to them about it. I said, ""Well maybe there is a safe or drawer that you put things in, maybe you could check it just in case?"" Again I was met with ""if she would have done that she would have told us"" No one even went to look for it. By this point I was very upset as I had to fly HOME and needed the ID to get on my flight. I was met with no concern and they said they had my info and if it turned up they would call me. I continued to call all day and no one said they had seen it. I asked one more time when checking out and again the staff did not check any safe, drawer or anywhere and simply said nothing had been turned in. As you can imagine, it was very difficult to get on my flight with no ID.Upon my return home I received a call that my ID was found. The housekeeping manager found it at the FRONT DESK. I was livid. I asked the manager to mail me my ID. My story should end here HOWEVER it has been a week now and I still am without my ID. When calling to check on the status, no one can answer my questions: When was it  mailed, how it was mailed, they have no tracking number, and i am just getting general run around. At this point I have to fly AGAIN this week for both business and the Thanksgiving holidays and AGAIN do not have an ID. I will be forced to take Monday off from work and sit at the DMV to get a new one as I DO NOT know if it will be here on Tuesday or not due to their incompetence. If an ID is mailed to a customer it should have been done so with a tracking number that is given to the customer. I honestly do not even believe they found the ID. I am currently monitoring my credit as I believe the front desk clerk STOLE it.***This Fairfield is in a great location in Baltimore (right next to the nice Inner Harbor waterfront area and professional sports stadiums); it is a new hotel and it is very modern and comfortable as well as LEED-certified***This Fairfield Inn is a new location and it has a unique and different look when compared to most Fairfield Inns (or Marriott brand hotels for that matter).  It has a great brick exterior, which is consistent with a lot of the older brick buildings in Baltimore.  This look extends to the lobby, which also features the brick look as well as a nice classical wood front desk.While this Fairfield Inn feels like a classic throwback in many ways, it is very modern.  This is noticeable in its environmentally friendly nature--it is LEED-certified.  The rooms are very nicely appointed and comfortable.  The bed felt more comfortable than the beds at other Fairfield Inns I've stayed at and the digital temperature unit was much nicer than what you will find at other Fairfield Inns (it was also much cooler than the hot Fairfield Inns I have stayed at in Cleveland and Pittsburgh).The room was spacious and the bathroom was nice.  I do wish Fairfield Inns had soap dishes on their washroom counters though (it gets messy and the bars of soap slide everywhere).A stay at Fairfield Inn includes complimentary breakfast and the one here was pretty good.  There were a few hot options like scrambled eggs and sausage patties.  The scrambled eggs were fine though they did look like powdered eggs.  The sausage patties were similar to the kind that McDonald's serves; they were probably not healthy, but they were tasty.There was also a great variety of cereals and the fruit dispenser produced orange juice that was not watered down like you get at a lot of hotel complimentary breakfasts.I did not visit the fitness center, but I believe it is 24 hours.  Wi-Fi internet access is also complimentary.Service was very good.  The hotel manager seemed to be really on top of things.  He was polite, professional and very efficient.  He also seemed to managed issues effectively.  A non-guest tried to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast and the manager handled the issue without creating a scene; he also managed it in a way that was professional and respectful to both the hotel guests and the non-guest.This Fairfield Inn is in a great location; it is right next to the bustling Inner Harbor--a great waterfront area that is a must visit if you are in Baltimore even if the area is quite touristy.  Oriole Park at Camden Yards and the stadium where the Ravens play are within walking distance though it would be a long walk from this hotel.Because of its great location, the room rates at this hotel are pricey for a Fairfield Inn.  Still, it is significantly less expensive than the Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards and this hotel does offer advance purchase discounts.Fairfield Inn Baltimore Inner Harbor is a pretty nice hotel and my stay was much better than my stays at other Fairfield Inn locations.  Given its great location, I recommend it if you are spending the weekend in Baltimore and are loyal to the Marriott brand.  I actually prefer it to the Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards.  That Marriott does have a great advantage of being within two blocks of Oriole Park, but this Fairfield Inn is less expensive and provides a significantly more modern and fresher room.Parking at the non-full service Marriott brand hotels (Courtyards, SpringHill Suites and Fairfield Inns) tend to be complimentary, but since this hotel is located in Downtown Baltimore, parking requires a fee; parking is available via valet ($30).  The valets are very nice.Our first time staying at this hotel after staying at many other places in Baltimore. I would say it was a great experience and would recommend it to others. We will definitely be using them again in the future. And they have the best breakfast there too..not too many hotels that I have experienced have that great or fresh of continental breakfast waiting the next morning, everything there was so fresh and tasted great! This is a very clean and friendly hotel!Stayed here on a Saturday night after a great day at the aquarium and night out on the town. No complaints here, loved our stay. It was the cheapest rate in the area and very close to everything on the harbor. Great customer service, nice rooms. Only complaint was the continental breakfast, and that was only because there was about 40 people eating there at one time so the food was going faster than it could be replaced. Also, on top of all that, it is a green-certified hotel! Pretty cool!Honestly, this place smells like wet laundry. The staff was nice but unfortunately I wouldn't come back here. Too bad you can't open the window to air out, the plus side is that they have multiple washers and dryers!Do not stay here. The front desk employees are incompetent. I am a pretty laid back person, and I don't generally complain, but my stay was one headache after another. First, they did not have the room we reserved. My work college and I had booked a double, and they tried to put us in the ""honeymoon suite"" -- with one bed! Changing rooms was a nightmare. We finally got the room we had reserved, but only after one night in the other room. Our room keys also stopped working several times. We kept having to get them replaced. And the sheets were horribly scratchy. But the worst, by far, was the disaster of checkout. My colleague was leaving at 4 am, and I was leaving at 8am, and we were splitting the bill. We wanted to make sure it was split properly, so we tried to do it the night before. The man working the desk told us he could not settle the bill unless he checked us out, and that we had to do it at 4am! Now, I travel a fair amount for work, so I KNOW that it is fairly common practice to settle the bill the night before for easy morning checkout. This employee was either incompetent or lazy, or the hotel has a TERRIBLE policy. So, fine. We agree to check out in the morning. But when my colleague goes down to check out at 4am, the employee working the desk says that the computer is being backed up and she cannot check her out! Then, the employee gets mad at my friend for trying to check out at such an unreasonable hour. After my friend explains to her the details of early morning flights, the computer finally finishes backing up, and the employee proceeds to totally mess up the math of dividing the room charge. My friend does the math for her. When I go to check out a few hours later and settle my portion of the bill, a different front desk employee attempts to tell me that the room was paid in advance and the bill cannot be separated. I tell him he is wrong, that it was not paid in advance, and can he print me a copy of the itemized charges (because if I didn't sort it out, the whole thing was going to end up on my friend's credit card, making our respective work reimbursements a total nightmare). He prints the bill. I look at it and say, ""Hmm, this is interesting. It says here there is a credit of $XXX and a remaining charge of $XXX. So, how is that paid in full?"" He reads the bill (I assume actually looking at it for the first time) and says, ""Oh, I guess it wasn't paid in advance."" One mistake I can handle. Mistake after mistake after mistake is a sign of gross incompetence. No one working the desk seemed to understand what they were doing, and no one ever wanted to take responsibility. A total failure of hospitality, with no sense that guests are a priority. If the place were cheap, fine, but the charge is far too high for service this poor and sheets this uncomfortable!Very friendly staff. Room was very nice. Breakfast was good and really liked the to go bags. I stayed here for the weekend of the Baltimore running festival and really enjoyed my stay. Very reasonably priced and 5 min walk to inner harbor. I will stay there again next year.I am a Marriott Rewards Member and Travel all the time for work. I am overall highly disappointed with this hotel and its accommodations.The bed was messily made, 4 out of 5 pillows had a stain on them and the room had a musty smell..No room service menu in the room. I finally found a small version of the menu online and called down to request room service. Sunday night at 8 o clock with no one in the restaurant they told me it would be at least an hour. Also, very costly valet parking is your only option here. If coming to Baltimore, stay somewhere else.The room was musty, the decor was odd, the room service was completely disorganized and OUT OF FRENCH FRIES. How does a tavern run out of french fries?!? Also, no on demand so I hope you like watching whatever is on HGTV. The service was nice enough, but I wouldn't pay what they ask to stay here.Although the hotel is quirky inside with dark wood, brick, a light shade made from packing peanuts, and a garage door panel hanging from the ceiling it all works. Homey and warm. I was on the second floor overlooking a side street that was very close to President's.  Pretty darn loud during rush hour and later at night when police sirens are blaring. Nothing can be done about that but I would warn you from staying in room 204. The air conditioner has a ridiculous  loud vibration noise. I finally had to just turn it off to get some sleep. Hotel was sold out so I did not complain. Room was fine otherwise...clean with 2 queen beds, nice decor, and roomy bathroom.Beware if you need a cab - two of us were going to the airport the next morning and we were told it is standard procedure to charge each person a full fare because we were going on two different airlines. Really?? To save on the fare the hotel driver would take us to the airport for $38 each. The airport is 12 miles from the hotel and it is going to cost $76...call a cab yourself - it was $30 flat rate to BWI...total, not each.Beware!!Do not use valet. The hotel cannot accommodate for this service as there is a wait of about 30 minutes for your vehicle.","I travel to Baltimore a minimum of 2 weeks a month for a client. I have stayed at the Hyatt, the Renaissance, the Residence Inn and the Fairfield.The Fairfield is the closest hotel to my office, so I'm already a big fan of that. The Fairfield is really clean and my room (King Suite - this has the separate living area) is very spacious. The room I currently have is on the first floor and it has really high ceilings, which makes spending a lot of time in your room less cluster phobic.There are some weird things I've noticed. For instance, this hotel prides itself on being a very eco-friendly hotel. It's the biggest thing this hotel advertises, yet, the only cups in my room are disposable ones for my coffee machine. There aren't any glass ones to reuse. It also makes wanting a cup of water weird.Also, I don't know if this is because I'm on the first floor, but I don't have an ice machine in sight. I've walked the entire section of my floor looking for one to no avail. I have an ice bucket in my room, but have no idea where to get ice. Needless to say I've been drinking warm tap water out of disposable cups made for coffee.Ps, there were 3 packages of coffee in my room. All decaf. Not sure if that's part of the eco-movement, but I don't do decaf. I tried Tavern 101 and got the BBQ burger. The patty actually was really good. The bun had obviously been frozen because the center of it was cold and hard. The fries I got on the side were delicious. The prices seemed rather fair for the location and the increase for the hotel.The free breakfast is fairly plentiful. I wouldn't recommend the eggs or other hot dish, but it's really great to have breads, fruits, cereals, yogurts, etc. to choose from and snag in the AM before making your way out. The staff does an excellent job of keeping it stocked too, so you never have to worry. The coffee is quite dreadful, but that's not their fault. I suggest a different roaster.Finally, all the staff is incredibly kind and friendly. When you travel often, it's nice to be greeted warmly and made to feel comfortable.All in all, it's a pretty great stay.My 3 girlfriends and I stayed at Fairfield Inn this past weekend, for a bachelorette weekend. We came in not really expecting much, but were blown away at how great this hotel was! The staff is very friendly, and willing to go to great lengths to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The hotel itself is beautiful. Exposed bricks in the lobby, green, and has a cute little courtyard right in the middle of the building. At one point, we were very tempted to just stay at the hotel for the night, instead of going out! (We, of course, didn't. You don't drive 3hrs from Richmond just to hole up in a hotel).Pros: Hotel is very clean, modern. The room was perfect for four women (the counterspace in the bathroom proved sufficient all our night-on-the-town equipment :). Staff is great and made sure these four female out-of-towners were safe and knew where to go and who to call in case of a bind. Great location; walking distance to Inner Harbor and Power Plant. Complimentary breakfast wasn't the best, but it was actually far better than most hotel breakfasts I've had!Cons: Slow elevator. Room was a bit stuffy no matter how much we fiddled with the thermostat. $30/night valet parking (although the valet guys were thoroughly entertaining and quick to retrieve our car). This may be a little vain, but there was no power outlet next to the full length mirror, which meant we had to fight over mirror space in the bathroom to do our hair... But that was just us ;)I would DEFINITELY stay here again. In fact, we are planning to make this little getaway a tradition!Pulled up fast service from the bell man grabbed the bags and it was only complemented by the fast service at the desk, The room is neat and clean close to the restaurants and the inner harbor. When in the area i would stay again. GOOD JOBVery good location, free breakfast in the morning, free wifi, &amp; a business center. The hotel had a gym but didn't check it out. The only two things I had a problem with were the elevator. The elevator took FOREVER!!! It seemed like it just ran really slow and basically stopped on every floor and didn't matter what time of day it was. Annoying! Also we had to pay for valet parking of $30 a night. I hate valet parking and probably could of parked down the street for a little bit cheaper.The rooms are very nice, beds are comfy. I would give this place five stars (good value! great location!) but the service I received was seriously subpar. I was in town for a conference and stayed three nights and four days. My card key stopped working at least once a day. The second night, I called for an extra towel and a blanket around 10:30 p.m., as soon as I got back from conference events. They said they'd call me back. 45 minutes later, after I had gotten all ready for bed, they called back and said I had to come down to the front desk to get the extra towel and blanket. When I got there, what they actually had for me was two handtowels and a comforter cover, essentially a thin seersucker sheet. Housekeeping was closed and it was all they had, they said. Finally, on the morning of checkout I waited for 20 minutes while the front desk helped one man who was apparently staying in the hotel long term settle some of his tab. Essentially, every time I needed something from the desk, the customer service person was all alone and I had to wait an unreasonable time for it. But, all that aside, it was a good hotel stay. The rooms were clean, stylish, and felt nice for the price. The breakfast was very good (cold and hot options) and there was free wifi.Great location, friendly staff, and comfortable beds, but our key stopped working about 7 times during our 3-day stay. Other than that, a decently good hotel.The hotel was attractive and clean, in a great location, all the amenities I needed, the room was spotless and comfy, and the free wifi actually worked really well...but the star of the show was the excellent staff. I arrived at 5:30 am to valet my car for a later check in. The guy at the valet couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. After my marathon, I could barely walk (!), the valet staff retrieved my luggage while I checked in.  The front desk staff were also very friendly and helpful, answered questions and called me a taxi when I mentioned I was just going to hail one. When the taxi didn't show, they made sure to get me another one. I just can't say enough about how impressed I was with the staff. Every. Single. One.  It definitely made my stay and I shall be back next year, or any time I need to stay overnight in Bmore again. Thank you!!!!While it's not 'technically' a 5-star hotel, it gets a 5-star review from me as a top-notch hotel.Not entirely familiar with the Baltimore area, this location was chosen for a wedding in the area. Everything we needed was either (safe) walking distance, or a $3-$5 cab ride away.The design, look-and-feel of the hotel is warm and comforting. The staff is friendly, the rooms were inviting, and all the perks -- good Continental breakfast bar, free 24-hour WiFi when needed, convenient store, on-the-go business center desk -- all made it a worthwhile experience. All at a very reasonable rate.I look forward to my next stay at this hotel, as this will definitely be the location I recommended when wanting to experience Baltimore.The hotel is pretty nice and very close to the harbor. The breakfast is not bad, but the Holiday Inn generally has more to choose from and cheaper base prices. There is only one elevator, so you might as well take the stairs in the morning, when it's busiest, which is not the stairs right beside the elevator (they will take you to some fire door that goes outside), but are located all the way at the other end of the hallway. My biggest problem with this place is the shower. They have those rain shower heads that are pointed straight down from a high ceiling, so you can stand there trying to rinse the soap from your hair and body as long as you can stand it, but will still have soap on you. I guess if we ever stay here again, I will have to bring a big cup and fill it up with water to get rinsed, kind of like you would do with your kids in the bathtub.Pros:  Fabulous location. Incredibly friendly, responsive, &amp; service-oriented hotel team. LEED property. Great common areas for hanging out or doing work.  Complimentary continental breakfast.  Complimentary coffee 24HRS.  FREE WIFI everywhere. On-site restaurant w/superb food &amp; beverages.  Power outlets everywhere in the room. Cons:  Extremely slow elevator.  No in-room refrigerators.  Overnight parking of $30/day. Even with the cons, the hotel still deserves 5-stars!  Everyone was SO helpful and friendly. The women at the front desk were fantastic.  They were always good for quality restaurant recommendations &amp; even printed out directions/menus.  Also, we had an issue with the a/c - it was addressed w/in 5 minutes of calling the front desk. George, the service tech who fixed the a/c, was super. He waited to ensure the a/c was cooling properly before leaving, instead of just saying ""ok, it's fixed"" before confirming if it was even working.Definitely recommend!Stayed a second time (two nights this time) and we still had a good stay.  It's a great location near everything.  The breakfast is not that bad, just the basics, and coffee is available 24/7.  We just hung around the Inner Harbor with our rugrats and they, too, had a great time.  I agree with another reviewer that just the one elevator is a pain when it gets really busy with check-in/outs.Visited the bar, and had dinner. Overall good food and drinks for happy hour. Just stayed here one night, very clean and comfortable. Nothing major, would stay again. The staff was very friendly, they arranged us a ride to our comedy show and were very helpful. Standard hotel as far as the room goes.Checked out this new Fairfield yesterday for the Sox game. I'm guessing my experience was not representative of a normal visit (not on a sold out Red Sox weekend). I would definitely stay here again.Pros:-One of the few Green LEED certified hotels-Bar serves $3 beers-everything is new and rooms are well appointed-good locationCons-Check in was brutal and staff seemed undertrained/overwhelmedNice, cozy hotel. The lack of self parking bothered me initially but the parking lot across the street sufficed. Environment was fine and clean. I loved that the Wi fi worked throughout the hotel, which is rare to find nowadays. Not a bad hotel if you're in the city for a quick night.stayed here this weekend and was pleased. very convenient location for doing things in the inner harbor/downtown/fells point/little italy areas of baltimore. it's nice that you can walk to many surrounding attractions. room was clean and nicely furnished. the free breakfast was pretty lackluster - only appealing thing i found was cold cereal, but better than nothing i guess. all in all great property and would definitely stay here again.I really had a good stay at this hotel. Location is great which is right across the street from power plant live and the inner harbor. A green hotel too! Service was great and they also have a valet which is $30. But valet is great if you take your car in and out. Bathrooms are spacious and it has a rain shower. But the bed o my it is super super soft. They also have a big lobby if you don't want to sit in your room and there's also a bar downstairs where you can eat and drink. I had a great time and every time I go back home to Baltimore I will be staying at this hotel. O and Use cash for the bar because you might drink too much and be charged a lot,lol.Great location but it could be a better hotel if it had more than one elevator which was always so difficult to take. The free breakfast offered is mediocre at best. The staff is friendly and helpful, nice &amp; quiet rooms, very clean and secure. Nice architecture &amp; interior design. Very convenient, close to attractions. I would recommend this hotel to a friend :)Fantastic hotel! Love the green makeover and so does the staff: They were proud to point out the eco-friendly features of this hotel.This Fairfield has no ""cookie-cutter"" feel to it at all. It's a distinctive place with gorgeous clean rooms, all modern and yet still cozy-comfy. It's not often that you take pictures of the room because you like the color combinations so much you think of duplicating them in your own home. But yes, I did just that.Complain about the cost of parking if you want, but it was on par with other city locations I encountered during a recent nat'l tour. Parking  security may be an ongoing issue -- our rental car had its window smashed. The hotel was great about helping, even paying for a cab to get us to an appointment while the glass was repaired. But the fact that they had a glass-repair place practically on stand-by suggests our incident wasn't the first such. This incident is the reason I had to knock off a star.But again, things like these go with a big-city experience. And I never felt personally unsafe in the hotel.I'm looking forward to returning for pleasure not business, and doing more exploring in this historic neighborhood. How many times do you get a chance to stay on the site where Betsy Ross sewed Old Glory while enjoying the comfort of a perfect modern hotel with a fantastic staff?Only one place, and I encourage you to visit.Nice hotel.  Good service, clean rooms, free wi-fi, free breakfast, and a good location if you want to explore inner harbor.Just as other reviews said- valet parking is $30, which I think is way steep.  Try looking for parking on the side streets and save yourself the money.I am staying here tonight for the first time and love it. Our room is so nice and spacious. Everything is up to date and Eco friendly. The sports bar is great and staff has been friendly. Would defiantly stay here again! Also great location next to little Italy in downtown baltimore.","Four girls, two beds.Don't get too excited - we're sisters.  Eh, perhaps that made it worse.Anyway!  This hotel is well-situated for people wanting to explore the Inner Harbor area.  Shops, restaurants, sights, and assorted nightlife are just a short walk away. The rooms were new and clean.  Four girls and didn't have to call the front desk to request more pillows for the bed or towels for our showers.  Trust me, I know these ladies - that's saying something.Tip #1:  Also, in case you didn't notice when you booked online, Fairfield is owned by Marriott, so the first sign you are likely to see as you turn off of Pratt onto President is the one for the ""Marriott"".  Don't despair, that's your hotel!Tip #2:  Parking is expensive here (yikes!).  However, if you are just meeting people in the bar for a few drinks, they will validate your parking and get you a discount.  Do it to it.You pay for location, simply put. Valet parking is expensive but if you leave at 3am, you might get lucky and not have to pay for it. Bed is super comfortable but the room was very tight. Free continental breakfast but no different than any hotel you would expect from Seattle to Miami and also, lacks selection. Coffee was never made on-time so people always had to wait for a fresh batch. If you value convenience to the Inner Harbor and parking priority, this is your place but if you're on budget... it will likely be out of your price range.If you don't have a lot of requirements other than sleeping this place is fine, not great, not bad. First off, DON'T GET SUCKED INTO PAYING FOR VALET THERE!!! They wanted $30 for the night to park your car, however across the street is a parking garage that charges you $18 for overnight parking. It's maybe a 3 min walk. The only advantage to using their valet is if you need to take your car in and out, which we didn't. If you are going to take it in and out, they don't charge you. The parking garage would. We just had someone stay with our car out front when we checked in then when we were done for the night we parked in the parking garage. The staff was pleasant. The hotel itself is very nicely done. The things not so great about the hotel were that the beds were super soft, not the good kind of soft, but the kind that leaves your back hurting like hell in the morning, zero support. Also, our heater kept overheating the room, we actually turned it down to 67 cause it was so hot, but the room temperature was at 72 and the heater just kept pumping out hot air all night. The water in the shower was luke warm at it's hottest temperature. And something else weird I've never noticed at another hotel. After we were tired from site seeing all over Baltimore, we wanted to relax and watch a movie in our room, however you can't buy a movie from your room at this hotel. We even called the front desk in case we were just not looking in the right place, but nope you can't do it. There is no pool. There is a bar downstairs we didn't use, but was very popular.Nice new hotel with clean, well appointed rooms at a fair price. Helpful and friendly staff. The bar on the first floor had surprisingly good sandwiches.  Location is great for visiting Inner Harbor, Harbor East or Little Italy. Would definitely stay here again. Parking is expensive but thats normal for downtown Baltimore.its ok, but for a green hotel i expected them to be able to give me directions from BWI on public transportation.  instead two people at the desk told me to take a cab.  its a long walk from the train, but hopstop will get you there.I specifically signed up for Yelp just so I could write this review!!I will never stay at or recommend this hotel to anyone!  First incident was when my mother and I got completely ripped off (we were charged $10 for a  1/2 mile cab ride) by a driver with whom the hotel placed us with.  A very disappointing situation but when we spoke with the Valet Manager, Karl, about this he made us feel like he wanted to help make sure this never happened again which was all we could ask for.The second incident that we experienced is what sparked me to write this negative review.  After a hasty checkout of the hotel, my mother and I hit the road back to NYC.  As soon as I arrived home a few hours later I realized I had left some clothing (2 expensive pairs of jeans and a few other items) in the drawer of the dresser in the hotel room.  I immediately called to inform the hotel of this and they told me to call back the next morning as the housekeeping manager had left for the day.I of course called first thing the next morning as I was very anxious to get my clothing back.  After a few hours of going back and forth with the housekeeping supervisor and manager I was finally told that they had ""everything except for the jeans"" aka the more expensive items.  The manager of the house keeping dept there, Baron, basically told me that the woman who cleaned my room was 4'2 and would not fit into my jeans which were a size 27 so why would she take them... He told me it's ""your word against hers"" and did not offer me any solution whatsoever. At that point I asked to speak with the general manger of the hotel and was told she would not be in until the next Monday (it was now Friday).  Monday morning and afternoon I left the GM, Roberta, two voice mails asking her to please call me back ASAP.  I finally got a phone call around 4pm from the assistant manager Elisia; she told me that the hotel had no proof that my jeans were ever in the room and therefore would not reimburse me.  She said that the supervisor of the house keeping dept was the one who cleaned my room and implied that there was no way my jeans were taken by her.  I am not about to try and figure out who took my jeans or what their motivation was but the bottom line is that my jeans clearly did not get up and walk out of the dresser on their own so someone at the hotel took them!!  Combined they cost over $300 and I will never get them back...nor will I stay at another Marriot ever again. Shame on the Marriot for not even attempting to rectify this situation!!Great hotel...brand new rooms,friendly staff and tavern 101 in the lobby has 101 beers on tap...only complaint they don't have self parking and make you valet for $27 a day...I was told you can park on the street behind the hotel but was unable to find a space and the front desk lady telling me ""we keep the door locked cause there's crazys""...makes me kinda weary of returning to a car with all it's windows...all in all good hotel and within walking distance of the inner harbor!I have stayed at the new Fairfield inn and Suites several times and am always impressed.  It is a certified green hotel.  The courtyard has a rain barrel that is recycled from the Baltimore Brewery that stood there.  The floor of the courtyard is where the flag that flew over Fort  McHenry (of Star Spangled Banner fame) was laid out and handsewn.  it makes you feel good to stay here, knowing you are not leaving a huge carbon footprint on your travels.  The lounge has six large tvs and the booths have small private screens.  its a good place to catch the football games.  This is the first Fairfield Inn I have stayed in which has a kitchen.  The food is very good, especially the macaroni and cheese and the crab soup.  Drinks are reasonable.  The rooms are very comfy and the staff is attentive and helpful.  Special shout out to Lisa the bartender.",,,"['top', 'notch', 'service', 'allowed', 'use', 'laundry', 'prior', 'check', 'check', 'early', 'usually', 'leaving', 'midnight', 'morning', 'every', 'night',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-plus-hotel-and-conference-center-baltimore-2,BEST WESTERN PLUS Hotel & Conference Center,3.0,$$,39,"The best hotel I've stayed at, I went to visit my familly and this hotel is conveniently located across the street from the tavel plaza. I arived at 2 am, got off the bus crossed the street, checked into my room within 10 mins. The room was very neat, free Wi-Fi and when I got up at 8 I made coffee with the coffee machine that was in the room then I head out to the cafeteria and had my free breakfast then went about my business. Overall very clean and cozy I had a great experience I'll definitely be back.I will start off with I have not personally stayed at this hotel overnight. From what I have heard from friends, the process is complicated, the staff is disorganized and there were extra charges left and right that no one could explain.I recently used this hotel as a place to park my car while I was on a cruise. They charge you $50 for the entire week per car if you do not book a room. If you book a room it's free. There is also an additional $10 service fee for the shuttle to the Baltimore Port.Upon arrival I was told as per Best Western (via phone) all I needed to do to add a car to a room (a friend was staying overnight) was to come into the hotel, give the room number my friend was staying in and say I wanted to add a car to that room for cruise ship parking. I did this and was given a ticket to go put on my car. I had to move my car from general parking to cruise ship parking (identified by green lines) and hang the ticket on my mirror. I went back after I moved my car and hung the tag to pay. The person I had JUST SPOKEN TO had no clue what I was talking about. I'm an honest person so I explained 3 times that I was adding my car to a room for cruise ship parking and he had just given me the ticket and I needed to pay. A manager finally came over and I told the story again. She told me I had filled out the wrong ticket and needed to fill out a new one...walked back to the car to hang that one and finally paid. I asked when the shuttle service runs she asked me ""where are you going?"" REALLY?!Long story short, the only reason I'd ever use this hotel again is for my next cruise. It's cheaper to park here than at the port. The shuttle service they use is AMAZING (5 star rating) and deserves all the recognition.Hotel staff is disorganized, clueless and don't listen to a word you say. If you don't need to use this hotel for cheap cruise parking, I'd recommend you look elsewhere.Came here while visiting Baltimore Comedy Factory &amp; decided to stay here! I would first like to say if your coming from out of town &amp; needing some place to stay while attending a show, I would definitely recommend! We got a king size room, the room was OK, not so nuch modern looking, the hotel or self is nice. The view we had was Everything! The couch was worn out and need to be thrown away! They had everything we needed for our stay as far as coffee maker, iron, microwave etc etc! They also have a indoor pool, but didn't have time to go! Hotel gave use a free breakfast, in a little dinning area, basic stuff but you do get hot sausage,waffles,biscuits, &amp; eggs!  it's FREE! I will stay again!Stayed here for a few nights before our cruise for several reasons 1) rates were low $99 Thurs and $139 Fri night. 2) rate includes shuttle service to and from the harbor/port for the cruise.  Pros : rooms are clean, staff is very accommodating, close to everything, free wifi. Cons: hotel is dated (furniture is in rough shape, elevator inspection certificate expired last year and the location isn't in the best neighborhood ( views of the backyards of row-housing was depressing ).  However, I would most likely stay here again due to the friendliness of staff and price. Rooms are clean and the Wifi is free and dependable. We also had a mini fridge and microwave.  First night we called room service and it never arrived (waited an hour ). I went to the restaurant and they didn't have it. However, the waitresses were super and put my order in right away, very apologetic, allowed me to wait and gave us a drink from the bar for free. They also threw in a container of cookies!  Food was great.  Lastly, I had to use their business center to print out cruise documents and the printer wasn't working so the lobby attendants made copies for me ( I just needed extra printouts of my luggage tags so I made copies instead).  In summary, if you aren't concerned with luxurious appearances and just need a clean and economical place to stay for a short time, then you won't be disappointed.We have been to this hotel several times and for the most part, the staff has been friendly. If you're looking for luxury, you won't find it here. This is your average run of the mill ""motel"" type hotel. I don't know how I would describe the cleanliness of the rooms or lack thereof. While they weren't filthy, they weren't particularly clean either. I actually requested that they have someone come up and reclean the bathroom. They did this without a problem. Though they did come back in and there was an improvement, the appearance of the grout in the tiled floor (shower pan) was grungy looking. The smell that emanated from the bathroom randomly was of mild sewage. We noticed that only in the room that had a handicapped accessible shower, but not the other one. There was a hint of mold and dampness in the rooms. A couple of incidents that could use some attention aside from the cleaning are  making sure that they keys are activated for the appropriate amount of time and checking their email frequently so that when guests arrive they know that they have a reservation and don't charge twice. They do offer a free breakfast which you probably can't beat anywhere in town at no cost. The food isn't bad and there is quite a selection. Just a few of the items are scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, DIY waffles, yogurt, bagels, cereal, a variety of fruits, etc. Other amenities are free wi-fi, cable TV, free parking, and free shuttles to and from the hospital. They also have an indoor pool. They have a restaurant with room service and best of all, they have a laundry room. Those are just some of the services they offer. A big plus is that they are very accommodating with Johns Hopkins patients and offer a discounted rate to patrons.Great staff. Price is reasonable forr what you get. We had  a wonderful stay in a difficult time.  The buffet breakfast was great .  It's not a perfect place but for a mid level hotel   we enjoyed it.Went to stay at this hotel before and after a cruise out of Baltimore-  it was advertised as offering ""park and cruise"" service, with a shuttle to the pier.  Turns out my Expedia rate of $97.00 didn't cover the ""park and cruise"" which cost another $70- $50 to park and $10 each  for the two way shuttle. The park and cruise rate was $137- so not much of a savings- (they gave us some malarkey about how if you book on line you cant get the park and cruise rate.  The shuttle was run very well by a company called ""Elite Transportation""  that had a table there in the lobby.  I would recommend them highly.  Well, maybe it was a misunderstanding, but that was the first problem.  Next, we tried to get two ashtrays sent up for our ""smoking"" room.  Never got delivered until we went down to the desk to get it.  Same thing happened with our request for  a couple packets of regular coffee- (they were all decaf when we arrived.)  There was a free urn of coffee downstairs in the lobby but the coffee maker in the room only made ONE cup at a time.  What happened to those similar-sized coffee pots that made five or six?  and the cups in the room were paper.  The front desk staff was pleasant but not very helpful. The room itself was nice enough, comfortable beds. But ask for a bay-view room.  The ones on the east side overlook the back yards of a bunch of trashy row houses.  The hotel is not in a great neighborhood.  I didn't see much around it but there was a McDonald's next door.  One good aspect was the restaurant - Tradewinds-  good food at good prices- a full buffet breakfast was included in the room price and it was great.  We also ate two other meals there, a Saturday buffet at $15.00 and another routine evening meal at prices from $12 to $22.  I had a good chicken fried steak.  The wife had surf and turf which she enjoyed.  Service was very good- even at the buffet.  They also had several pizzas available for pick up or room service in the restaurant.  The hotel also provides a shuttle to the harbor area and to other sites.  not sure if they charge for that.  All told, a decent place for a nights stay.  The wi-fi was free and worked well.The staff at this hotel is very hot and cold. The girls that worked at the front desk were great, very courteous and helpful. The rooms are nice and clean, the lobby is nice etc. The staff in the restaurant are terrible. Very rude, unhelpful and so much attitude/negativity I was scared to eat anything they prepared and cancelled my room service order. They didnt have change for a 50, wouldnt let me pay with my card and said Id have to go down to the front desk to get change or pay. And they seemed really annoyed by me calling in the first place...not sure why. Either way, I wouldnt order from the restaurant. The older woman in the evenings sounds spiteful, I would not trust her food. Also, there was a man in the evening that worked at the front desk, he had maybe an arab accent, he went out of his way to try and mess up my check out. I called down in the evening and requested a late check out from him. He stalled, then said the latest he could do was 1pm. I said Ok and asked if he would put it in the system, he said he had. But, I got the negative attitude off him as well so I called again in the morning and asked them to check that I had my late check out. Of course, they said there was no late check out in the system. Which means I would have gone down at 1pm and they would have charged me extra. So I asked for one and the philipino guy in the morning kindly offered me a 2pm checkout, which was great...but it also means the man the night before was being unnecessarily terrible. All round, nice looking hotel...poorly managed, horrific staff (minus the front desk women, they were lovely). I wouldnt stay here again, too much potential for major problems...most of the staff have issues. Just stay somewhere else where you dont have to be paranoid about them trying to screw you over/take out their frustration on you.Worst! Worst! And I repeat the worst hotel! Do not go here. The concierge are rude and obnoxious!Save your money and go somewhere else. I had an issue with the hotel service which I reported and the manager was not helpful. Is this somewhere anyone would want to go? horrible I will never go to a Best Western Branch again.Ok, lets not get the review twisted, the stay was not bad, nor was it good. It was just plain average. The location is pretty neutral, its a little bleak if you ask me (I am from California). For most, the proximity to the cruise terminal is good. For us, we just needed to be in Dundalk and I couldn't find something better. We checked in late at night and were helped quickly. The couches in the lobby are ATROCIOUS. Like they have been sat on a trillion times and the padding is completely gone. You can stand there and watch people sit down and quickly get up. You are literally siting on the wood beams in the frame. Management really needs to address this. Our rooms were on the 12th floor. The whole hotel is dated, a little worn. It was not dirty. The room was large enough and had a microwave, fridge, king sized bed and nice TV. There was a couch and table as well. The decor was a hodgepodge of colors and textures. This is not the Westin. The bed was firm, but the wife liked it. They have a washable duvet on the bed which is good, I HATE hotel bed comforters which harbor germs like you can't believe. The bathroom was dated and worn. Tile floor had small chips and cracks everywhere. Wall paper had been cleaned/wiped with bleach one too many times. Understand that it was clean, but there were definitely stains on the walls. Shower was fine. Everything was just run down and older. We ate at the restaurant the first night and the food was .... edible..... It was likely cooked several days prior and warmed in a microwave. Breakfast was better (and FREE!). They had eggs, sausage, juices, fruits, waffles and a neat pancake machine where you just press a button and a minute later a pancake appears! I tried to use the business center and that was a fail. They had three computers and I needed to print my boarding pass. The website needed the pop up blocker to be turned off and I couldn't figure out how to do it. Maybe they had it locked? So I tried the computer next to it, that one wouldn't turn on. I gave up after 15 minutes. They have a little gift shop and you can buy some snacks and water. I noticed they have room service pizza. It was pretty cheap, we didn't eat it but were tempted! McDonalds is literally steps from the front door. Parking is in the lot, its free but make sure you get a permit from the front desk. Would we stay here again? Yes, if we had to go to Dundalk. But this was a rare occasion and we won't be returning to DundalkThis hotel is way below lackluster. The front desk staff aren't that friendly. Anastasia checked us in last night and it seemed like she really didn't want to. She gave us the room key she didn't say ""enjoy your stay"" or ""thanks for staying with us"". She simply gave us the room key and told us where the elevator was. The rooms are not the cleanest! There was a hair on the toilet. The ceiling looks like it could fall. The room smells like mildew. The beds look dirty and looks like they just threw the sheets and pillows on there. I'm so disappointed. What a waste of 187.00 dollars. Don't stay here! It needs an update! I called down and asked for toiletries and the front desk person asked me to come down at get it myself. I couldn't believe that. Breakfast was okay. Housekeeping doesn't speak.Reviewing the front desk service because I ended up not staying. Was staying in the lobby waiting for the friends to come from NY on a bus that often drops off nearby.  One of the employees came up to me and asked if I was staying there and told them that we were going go rent a room and had no reservations. Still waiting an hour later, for whatever reason they seemed upset ive been waiting in the lobby and told me I couldnt wait there anymore.  It was blatantly obvious that they thought I was lying as they didnt do a good job being polite - asking how many I had in my party and their names, to which I mentioned that we had no prior arrangements...  My friends did arrive and we ended up going to another place.  What a shame, but they lost business.I am back again. Our room is actually cleaner this time than the last, but staying here can be just plain frustrating. The key cards rarely work twice, and even if they do, we have yet to have them work two days in a row. Also, the staff rarely if ever check their email, which can complicate business check-ins because in cases like ours, the credit card authorization is in their email before our arrival and then they want to charge us on arrival because they didn't check their email. They need a little more organization. The price is right, though, and so is the location. I would give them three stars again if not for this problem.The room was small and tired,  but the shuttle into the Inner Harbor makes up for the room. The pool's filter system wasn't working properly and the hot tub was lukewarm at best. However, the Sauna was piping hot. The free buffet breakfast was nothing special.  With a little sprucing up, this hotel could be great.Staff was polite, and lobby areas were clean and updated. However the room itself was gross, AC did not work well, and the shower was beyond dingy. The ""full gym"" was way outdated and the pool looked like a swamp. The Jacuzzi part of the pool was not filled, and it was moldy and crumbling.This was our first stay at this Best Western Plus, it's very close to I95 very convenient to continue on your travels.  The staff was without exception friendly and customer service oriented. The room was clean and offered the general amenities such as toiletries, iron and ironing board, coffee maker, hair dryer, mini fridge, and microwave. The pool and fitness area were very clean with a variety of exercise machines to use. I would gladly rebook my next visit to Baltimore.First thoughts...oh crud... there's a cemetery across the street!?!?!?!?!?    But it's actually pretty far away, and the hotel sits high up on a hill, so you'll be good in case of the zombie apocalypse.  Here's a quick breakdown of my thoughts of the place...Pros-Indoor pool-Fitness center-They give a ton of amenities, even toothbrush and toothpaste and razor-You can make your own waffles!Cons-Fitness center is only cardio equip, no weights-Bathroom toilet sits too close to the wall(I don't like it when my knee touches the wall in any bathroom, and obviously, I'm sitting)-Bfast buffet is a little limitedFriendly staff, plenty of parking, and a restaurant in the hotel...always good signs for me cuz I'm usually so beat at the end of the day that I'd rather not travel even more to eat before bed...It's about a 10-15 min drive to downtown Baltimore from this spot so if you don't have a car, you may be cabbing it around a lot.It was decent. Better then most Best westerns that i have been through. Breakfast is basic.. but its free so no real complaintsI just learned, two days after checking out, that this hotel added a $100 smoking charge. I DO NOT SMOKE. This place is seriously disturbed and this is clearly the angry lady behind the counter when I checked in getting back at me. For what I do not know. She became seriously weird at check-in after I didn't say thank you. I. Do. Not. Smoke. Disturbing.Check was easy. Rooms were large enough with two beds.  Rooms were clean and hotel was quiet.  Breakfast served in the morning was eggs, waffles, oatmeal, cereal and fruits.  Would definitely stay there again.","My sister stayed her during her recent trip to Baltimore. The hotel is clean and well managed. They offer shuttle service to Johns Hopkins which is about 15 minutes away. They hotel is near to many attractions in Baltimore, including the inner harbor. This is a great inexpensive hotel that offers quality service and clean lodging.Stayed here for three nights and I can't really complain because I didn't have to pay a cent thanks to the conference my boyfriend was attending so I can't really complain.Or can I?The reason why I knocked off a star is because I saw a staff member being nasty to two of the cleaning ladies.  Her tone was condescending and harsh.  It appears that the cleaning ladies have difficulty understanding English but I don't think it warrants anyone to use that kind of tone on anyone.  Also, just a heads up: no one cleaned our room for 3 days and when we asked about it, they informed us that it's best to take the do not disturb/please clean sign completely off the door knob when you are leaving the room.  Since most of the cleaning staff cannot read English, they assume that all doors with the sign on, regardless of which side it's on, do not want to be disturbed.  Free breakfast: Buffet style, they have those rehydrated eggs or whatever, toast, mini muffins, cereal, orange juice, cranberry juice, oatmeal, mini donuts, wafflemaker, etc.  It's not an amazing meal but hey, it's free. Free wifi is available throughout the hotel.  A pool and gym is also available to guests.  Did not swim in the pool because the water was cloudy.  The ""gym"" consists of about 5 machines.  I remember seeing a treadmill and an elliptical.  Parking came free with our room as well.  The room itself was nice.  I found the bed, sheets, pillows, everything super comfortable.  The bed or room had no offensive odor and it was clean (except for a suspicious stain on our couch).  Bathroom came with a coffee maker, coffee things, shampoo, conditioner, bars of soap, shaving cream, toothpaste, razors and lotion.  Overall, I looked forward to coming back to the room to sleep every night.Great hotel for its price ($99/night) and free amenities (free breakfast, free wifi, fitness center, shuttle service, on site restaurant, free parking) which trumps staying at a 4-5 star hotel in the Inner Harbor to pay for parking ($20/night) and no free breakfast ...However, this location is less than appealing. It's near the Inner Harbor but not within walking distance thus the shuttle service. Not much around but Mickey D's and gas station, and Johns Hopkins Bayview.They renovated the hotel but the heart of the hotel is the same. Customer service is average. I found some to be rude. Too busy to finish their own conversation first to wait on me. Renovations were done half hearted...some water damage noted.Having stayed at numerous hotels in the area, this is just not worth it. Linthicum Area hotels offer better deals with similar amenities. I will not be back.I stayed here for the Park and Cruise special they have.  It was well worth it considering I could leave my car there for a week and avoid paying to park at the cruise port.Anyway, the rooms were very very nice.  I thought it was worth what I paid for it.  The employees who worked there were friendly and helpful as well as the shuttle service that is provided.  (The shuttle service isn't owned by the hotel, but I just wanted to put that out there too)I took one star off because the breakfast buffet was just okay, they could have had more options.If I ever have to stay in Baltimore again, I'll be back.Awesome staff, very friendly and helpful.  The hotel was also very clean and tidy.  You could also get a pretty decent nights sleep since the walls there aren't too thin hehe.  Complimentary breakfast was also a plus (food quality was better than the Hampton Inn IMO). Rates are also decent considering the other hotels by inner harbor runs 200+.We checked in early and the staff was very friendly and accommodating! Very clean rooms and maintained hotel.  Would def stay again  and recommend this hotel!Location is fairly far from inner harbor. They have free shuttle service but if the bam doesn't see you immediately, they leave you (which is what happened to a lady today at the surgical eye center!). The quality of the 'breakfast' is extremely low. The pool had an in identifiable foam on the top of it. The ice machines weren't working. And our bathroom was missing tiles. Definitely not worth the money. Would gladly pay more for better quality.When I first checked in I thought it was ok.  A few minutes after getting into my room I realized how dirty everything was. Bathroom floor was not swept and room appears not vacuumed.  Later I realized that the entire hotel was really dirty.Checked in today and have already seen 3 roaches and a bed bug. As soon as I post this I am looking for a new home for the week.If you're visiting Baltimore with a car and are looking for a decent but cheap hotel, Best Western definitely fits your bill.  If you want a little more luxury that is a little closer to the action, you should pass.We fell into the have-a-car/want-a-cheap-bed category and this hotel was a-ok for us.  There aren't many frills, as you might expect, but neither were there any upcharges that come with a more expensive hotel.Here's the good:~Free parking.  This becomes an even bigger perk when you pay to park at the Inner Harbor.  (My tip on that is don't pay $10-20 to park in the Inner Harbor - find a side street and stalk a spot.  You're going to walk your ass off anyway, adding a few more blocks won't be a deal-breaker)~Free breakfast.  It's only a step up from a continental breakfast (hot eggs and bacon) but it'll fill your belly with food on the cheap.~Free wi-fi.  I'm not sure why the cheaper hotels are the only ones giving away their wi-fi, but I guess I'll take it where I can.~Free shuttle to and from the Inner Harbor.  We had a car and didn't feel like messing with the shuttle (you have to reserve your spot both ways at least an hour in advance) but it's there if you want it.~They're only a couple of miles from Fells Point.  The Inner Harbor is where the tourist action is at, but Fell's Point has a much more local feel.  Want to eat at a non-chain restaurant and then bar-hop more than a dozen pubs/taverns/bars in a 2-3 block radius?  Fells Point is your destination.Here's what kept this review at three-stars:~Everything about this hotel is old and worn out.  But it puts a pillow under your head and a roof over your head without putting a serious dent in your wallet.Bottom line, we stayed at Best Western the first and last nights of our trip and it worked for us.Not bad...I have some mixed feelings about this hotel. I've stayed here on multiple occasions for work and each time, I've been given a different style of room. The first time I stayed, I had a cramped room with two queen beds, which was fine since I was there alone on business, but it was pretty tight. The television was not flat screen, and I'm not trying to be snobby, but it was tiny and difficult to watch. Also, I left a pair of nicer tweezers (Tweezerman brand) on the bathroom sink counter and they went missing, which upset me.The second time I stayed here, I was given a HUGE room with two queen beds. Again, there was a bulky television and the same furniture as before, but just spread out in a bigger room. I had no problems during this stay.On my most recent stay, I was given a room with a king sized bed and it was fancy! There was a nice, big flatscreen that had a computer/dvd player hooked up with a nice lap desk for you to use in bed. I was really pleased with this room.Overall, the hotel is clean and comfortable and I like that they offer free breakfast in the morning, though, it's nothing special. They have eggs, sausage, assorted breads/danishes, Belgian waffles, and cereal. The rooms are decent, but I didn't like how the quality of the three rooms (all at the same price) differ so drastically. I know now to request a king-sized room if I stay here again. The location is great - it's right by Greektown and it's a short drive from the Inner Harbor (and they offer free shuttle service) and it's right off of I-95, so it's a convenient place to stop. The free wifi cuts in and out from time to time, but is decent.This Best Western was hosting a New Year's party that my boyfriend and some friends were attending with about 2000 other people. We decided to get a room for the night so that we wouldn't have to worry about driving home afterwards. The party didn't start until 9 pm, but my friend and I went around 5 so we could check in and get ready in the room and just hang out. The hotel is not in the nicest place. It is actually in the Baltimore Travel Plaza, right off of exit 57 on I-95. It is kind of a shady area and is not in the middle of any downtown action at all. You will need to take their shuttle or drive down to Canton, Fells Point, or the Inner Harbor if you want to tour the city. There is plenty more to do there and I would not recommend walking because there aren't any sidewalks and doesn't seem too safe. However, for the price, it may be worth it to stay at this hotel and just make the short drive to the city everyday. Hotels around the Inner Harbor are ridiculously over priced. Even though the hotel is not in a great area, the hotel itself is pretty sweet. Our room had a king size bed, sofa, table, and a decent sized bathroom. It was clean and we were on the top floor and had a great view of the city (once you looked past the travel plaza parking lot and construction zone). All the rooms in the hotel were booked. Consequently, the staff was overwhelmed upon check-in, but they made up for it by being friendly and checking us in as quickly as they could. The hotel offered a complimentary breakfast, but it was over by 9 am and we did not wake up in time to experience it so I cannot comment on the breakfast. Since we did not have breakfast at the hotel we headed over to Miss Shirley's Cafe for brunch in the Inner Harbor. I highly recommend this place (<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/miss-shirleys-cafe-baltimore-3#hrid:_5F5tr_i7uphrzWmkOtidQ"">yelp.com/biz/miss-shirle...</a>). Nice hotel in a shady area, but the price can not be beat.I can't believe how high this place is rated. I ended up here on a work trip and it is by far one of the worst hotels I have stayed at. The conference center is under construction. The rooms smell, I believe this is because they still allow smoking in the hotel on some floors, the room I had was in need of an overhaul. The room had patches on the walls, cracks in other parts, the door had light coming in all the way around, the bedding had stains, there was paint on the celining. Old out of date TV's. the lobby did look nice but the workers were uninvolved to the point on rudeness. I would not stay here again and I would suggest that anyone else do either.The AC and heat was very loud, I could hear everything that went on in the hallway and there were no closets, just a cubby that was hardly big enough for a suitcase.I stayed here for a two-day business meeting. I spend 70 plus nights a year in hotels for business and pleasure.This property is fairly run down. The room I had was clean, but needed major updating. Smelled old and the carpet and furniture had seen better days. Price was reasonable and included a very basic breakfast. There is nothing around this property. No restaurants, stores, places to walk or relax outside. There is an indoor pool. This property is geared toward those leaving on cruises from the nearby port or for those that need to be near Johns Hopkins. The hotel does have a complimentary shuttle for getting to the Inner Harbor and other attractions, but it must be on their schedule and the last one leaves Baltimore at 10:30 pm. And strangely, no airport service. There is free parking. I am 60, and was one of the youngest guests staying at the property.This is not a four star hotel by any means, but then again, I am a barely-getting-by college student, so I'll take what I can get. I recently traveled to the Baltimore area for business- I had a couple of interviews in the area, one at Johns Hopkins-Bayview and one at the University of Maryland, and I wanted to book a place that was convenient to both places and relatively cheap. I ended up booking this place on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotel.com&amp;s=1c9cd25474134bd332ead348e1af3dd34ef04702a504940ac882b95d1297049a"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotel.com</a> and spent about 190 dollars for a two night stay. This was the best rate I could get for something a little better than a Motel 6 for example. Overall, I was incredibly impressed by the hotel and so glad that I made a reservation here. Check in was easy and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was entitled to the morning breakfast buffet even though I thought my reservation explicitly stated that I was excluded. But even more than this, the shuttle service provided by the hotel was easy to use and extremely convenient for my purposes. Shuttles run every hour and take you to a variety of places, including Johns Hopkins-Bayview as well as the University of Maryland Medical Center and Inner Harbor. And even though I was told that they didn't have a drop off point in Canton Square, the one shuttle driver dropped me off directly at the restuarant in Canton where I was meeting people for dinner on one night of my stay. The facilities themselves are about average- the indoor pool was a little sketch, made even more sketchy by the fact that I was the only one using it. But overall, would recommend this hotel just for it's overall convenience factor- especially if you have business at one of the local medical centers.I was in Baltimore for two nights and couldn't have asked for a more comfortable spot. The employees were so welcoming and helpful that it made my stay in Baltimore so much better! The breakfast had many tasty options and room had everything I needed. I left Baltimore not only thinking that I'd eventually return to such a vibrant community, but knowing which hotel I'd call to make a reservation, the Best Western on O'Donnell Street.Best service ever. The management is the most professional and friendly that I have experienced in a long time. The rooms are extremely clean and well stocked. This is where I will stay every time I am in Baltimore.This hotel is awesome.  I travel to Baltimore all the time.  I have stayed in expensive, nasty places.  This place has been remodeled.  The beds are amazing...as nice as the fanciest hotel.  Management is super spectacular and it shows all the way down to the friendliness of the staff.  Rooms are big, with couches, lovely bathrooms, great furniture set up.  Shuttle service.  Close to everything.  I highly recommend this place for your business, family, trip.  STAY HERE!cleanest most sparkling gleaming freshest comfiest most immaculate good smelling hotel I think I have ever been in with no mold of any kind no rips no stains no chips and the fluffiest most comfy pillows and awesome sheets.  Seattle's Best in multiple locations...free parking ...free wifi....Pantene...toothpaste!....decent food options inside the hotel as well as a 'dinner theatre' and right on top of major arteries, DC, Inner Harbor, galleries....Broadway Diner a stone's throw...pricey but reliable and good...Chaps Pit Beef two stones throw...fantastic food options inside and out.   This place is a gem.  Room 703 close to elevators directly across from ice and vending (Coke) and slept like a baby.  No noise.  Separate floor for 'families'.   Only negative is no outdoor pool.  Otherwise perfect.  I felt totally comfortable walking in barefeet in this hotel something I never ever do.   Immaculate.   and a MacDonald's 24hr in the parking lot.  Fantastic shuttle to save time and money on very challenging parking.",,,,"['best', 'hotel', 'went', 'visit', 'hotel', 'conveniently', 'located', 'across', 'street', 'plaza', 'bus', 'crossed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-by-hilton-baltimore,Homewood Suites By Hilton,4.0,$$,37,"Great location near both the Inner Harbor and Fells Point.  Staff was very helpful, our room was spacious and clean with great views of the city.We had a very comfortable stay here for New Year's Eve. Valet parking was a little backed up, but the attendants were patient and helpful. The room was spacious with a full kitchen, desk, couch and loveseat. Slept through the continental breakfast (happy new year hangover) but that was a nice touch. Starbucks and Whole Foods conveniently nearby!Significant problems with the room.  No batteries in tv remotes, no PLUG for the tv.  Doors to closet hanging off hinges.  Cheap mattress, paint patches on the ceiling.  Moved rooms and got one with fewer problems, though still with issues.  At least the staff is friendly and helpful.  Overall, very disappointed for a Homewood Suites property.  My general impression is dirty and pretty beat up....Very comfortable stay as I decided to do a little staycation over the weekend. There are no real complaints and that is saying something since my room was right next to the elevator and I not once was awakened by people utilizing it. I did opt for valet parking as everything you could possibly need and want to visit is within walking distance.For those of you that want to keep up on your exercise regime you get complimentary access to the Maryland Athletic Club located on the second floor.  I had every intention of utilizing it but you know how that stories goes.Breakfast was good and you have an option for room service but with so much to choose from in the area I doubt if you would need to use it.Parking: Self or valet optionsValet parking is located in the front of the hotel.  This includes in and out privileges. $35 a day.Self-parking entrance is located on the opposite side of the building on 650 S. Exeter St. (across the streets from Wholefoods).  Self-parking is operated by a third party and not with Hilton.  There is a parking ticket machine near the parking elevator on the hotel lobby floor where you can pay in advance before leaving or pay on exit at the gate.  No in and out privileges. The rate is hourly with a maximum 24 hour fee of $23.00. Everything is in walking distances so I self-parked for 2 days.Staff is very friendly during check-in. They were able to provide the lay of the land and answer all the questions we had about the area.Starbucks, AMC and Wholefoods are all in walking distance of the hotel.Breakfast is located on the 2nd floor lounge. Do not expect the same type of offerings as an Embassy Suites, but it was sufficient.Definitely a big fan of this property and would return again soon.This property is newish and well kept. Our suite was spacious with great views and beautiful light. There is a full kitchen that we did not use. The property is well located in the East Harbor area with the harbor walk, little Italy , stores etc all within walking distance.   Lots of restaurants nearby. Access to the enormous fitness club on the 2nd floor is included. Overall, a good value for the cost.Comfortable stay. Fantastic location. Complimentary breakfast and dinner Monday through Thursday was a nice money saving feature. Loved the apartment feel to it. I could stay up and watch tv while my other half snoozed behind closed doors in a separate room. My evil insomaniacal twin enjoyed that a lot. Adored the rooftop terrace and access to MAC gym.I've been staying at this Hilton Property for the past 4 years, Love the location. Access to everything and anything and it's very convenient to Little Italy, the inner harbor, etc. The people that work the breakfast do an outstanding job every morning. They keep everything very clean. Room are getting a little tired. The first room I was given had to be changed, I had requested a queen or kin size bed, but the receptionist insisted in giving me a with two double beds. Mind you I checked in at around 5 and apparently housekeeping had not finish ding all of the house cleaning. I've tried calling the front desk and got no answers. I decided to go back down, then bumped into the Assistant General Manager Hatice Meral who asked me if everything was okay. I decided to address the problem and she personally took care of it and found me a more suitable room. One overall comments, I think the decor is starting to look tired. Will have to look for something newer next time.A perfect dog friendly hotel right in downtown Baltimore. The location is great, one block away from Little Italy and walking distance from Fells Point. There are restaurants, movie theater, 24 hour CVS and a fresh market all within one block of the hotel.The room is set up perfectly. You walk into your room from the hallway and you are in a little kitchenette that has a microwave and stove top and then the living room that has a pullout couch. The pullout couch is not comfortable and kind of springy, but I still got a good nights sleep nonetheless. The bedroom with a shower (perfect water pressure, I could shower in there for days) and bathroom are through another door. The separation of these rooms make it a perfect situation if you have a dog. You can put the dog in the bedroom with the tv on so they don't have to hear people walking up and down the corridors. They have a HUGE courtyard on the eighth floor that you can go and walk your pup. This is really nice because I would not want to walk around Baltimore at night all by myself. We did not hear any other dogs during our stay, no barking or running around, so we really felt that we got all the positives of being a dog hotel with no negatives. Another great thing about this hotel is the free breakfast that they offer is open until 11 AM (at least on weekends) When you're on vacation sometimes you can't make it to the breakfast at other hotels because it closes too early. It was a breakfast buffet, don't expect the four seasons, but it was good nonetheless. Definitely satisfied our family. Lastly, there is a full-blown gym connected to the hotel which apparently you get free access if your hotel guest. We went to check it out as we were leaving and we saw yoga classes going on and it looked really nice and clean. Next time we're in town with the doggie, we will definitely be back!We stayed here New Year's eve.  I normally stay at Hilton properties and chose Homewood Suites because it's close to Fells Point and I was able to get a room with a view of the Inner Harbor.  It was very cold and windy that night, so we watched the fireworks from our room while having cocktails.  The room selection worked out perfectly.There is definitely a difference between Hilton and Homewood Suites.  The bedding at the Hilton is almost luxurious.  There is a variety of pillows from firm to plush and the sheets and comforters are always soft and inviting.  The bedding at the Homewood Suites wasn't as comfortable and consisted of a thin scratchy comforter and a top sheet and no variety in pillows.  The other substantial difference is that Hilton offers a cooked to order breakfast with all of the other food items being relatively fresh.  The staff at Homewood didn't seem to be concerned that most of the major breakfast items were empty.  It might have been that it was New Year's Day, but I've experienced the same thing at another Homewood Suites.Homewood Suites and the Hilton Garden Inn occupy the same building, but on opposite sides.  Between them is the Maryland Athletic Club.  As a guest of either property, you get to the use the gym.  I've been to a lot of hotel gyms before, but the MAC is definitely worth checking out.  They have squash courts, a full line of fitness machines and free weights and a variety of cardio equipment.  There is also a pool and Jacuzzi.  I'll be back to Fells Point, but will probably stay at the Hilton.  In my opinion, Homewood Suites doesn't compare favorably to Hilton.  I definitely prefer the cooked to order breakfast and bedding at the Hilton.  Each property caters to a different demographic, but Hilton will continue to be my home away from home.My Hilton property of choice has always been Embassy Suites but I gave Homewood Suites a try, and glad I did. As a compact suite property, it offers the comfort of home including a kitchenette, living room, desk work space, private bedroom and bathroom. Additional property perks include a complimentary hot breakfast and dinner buffet, and a beer and wine reception. Recommended for the extended traveler!We stayed at this location recently and loved the location. It is in a prime location within walking distance of the harbor, Little Italy, Under Armour flagship store, the aquarium, and more. It is unique in that it is connected to a Hilton Garden Inn. They share a lobby. The hotel is nice and the staff was very friendly. Our room was just what we wanted in the location we asked for. It was nice and clean with a great view of the city and a nice courtyard. They had small windows that opened up so we could enjoy the fresh air! One of the biggest perks is the fitness facility. There is a nice gym in the building connected to the hotel and you have free access to it with your room key. It was a very nice gym with 2 pools, hot tub, sauna, free weights, cardio equipment, and fitness classes. Very nice benefit to staying at this hotel! That evening my husband and I went up to the restaurant/lounge to watch a game on TV and enjoy a drink. It was quiet with a nice city view and friendly staff. Overall great experience!I am in town for four days so I decided to get a suite and I am very happy with the room. I have a kitchen with stove, fridge, micro and dishwasher - as well as dishes and pots/pans. A dining bar and a living room sitting area with a pull out loveseat and chair, desk and tv. 2 free wifi options via the Hilton and AT&amp;T for the duration, at good connection speeds.The bedroom has a king bed, tv, dresser and dressing area with sink and closet and a nice size toilet/shower.I don't have my dog but if I wanted, I could - and right next to the inner harbor - it's a great option if I had wanted to bring her along.There is free breakfast and light dinners four nights a week if I want and the Whole Foods is 2 blocks from the hotel across from a 24 hour CVS.I love staying in the Hilton Homewood Hotels and prefer them to a single hotel room.    Stayed April 2013We stayed at the Homewood Suites for a long weekend with our 3 year old twins and another family with two small children.It is really nice and the location is awesome!  We were able to self park our car (cheaper than valet) and not have to move it all weekend.  We were able to walk to pick up dinner at a local restaurant, get groceries at Whole Foods, and even have pizza delivered to our room.  It also was a short 5-7 minute walk to the aquarium which we did on Saturday afternoon.  Pros:1) the separate bedroom and living area.  We were able to put the kids to bed and then hang out till we were ready to go to bed.  2) the ability to use the gym that is attached to the hotel (affiliated).  They have 5 pools including a relatively large one for kids.  We went to the pool two nights and the kids had a blast.  And I got to sneak in a few minutes at the hot tub!3)free buffet breakfast every morning :)Cons:1) the beds were horribly uncomfortable and small.  They were doubles but wish they were at least queen2) no DVD player or real children's channels.  We had to buy the Disney jr on demand package for $8.99 for some in room entertainment for the kids.Overall, really nice place to stay in a great location.  I would recommend for families for sure!Clean, comfortable and spacious rooms. If the weather is good, the location makes for  a terrific walk to the convention center - right along the water. One small comment: one night I returned to my room and found it had not been serviced. When I called the service number they said it was quite late and there wasn't much time to have it serviced. But they would service it if I wanted. Huh? I later asked the front desk if i was required to request service but they apologized for the comment. Okay, no problem if it was an error.What a great hotel! I was lucky enough to get a great deal through Priceline. Firstly, the location is great. It's in walking distance to Fells Point, Inner Harbor, and if you're a city-dweller like me, Federal Hill. Check in isn't until 3, but since we arrived at 10:30, we decided to see if we could at least drop our bags off. The staff was welcoming, and not only was our room ready, but we had still enough time to grab some complementary breakfast. The bed was comfy, and the hotel room was big enough to live in. Much bigger than some studio apartments I've been in. I'd stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a centrally located hotel.This was a great hotel. I had a wonderful experience. Stayed in April for a fun weekend in the inner harbor with my friends. It was clean and comfy and the staff was helpful and nice. The location is great and walking distance to the inner harbor and fells point. I would definitely recommend this hotel as an affordable suite to stay in for an extended stay in the baltimore area.Great hotel!!!Excellent staff, good food, nice rooms . . REALLY nice place.Well deserved 5 stars!The bell staff in particular are GREAT and VERY helpful.This is my go-to hotel now at the Inner Harbor.Whole Foods one block away, theaters next door . . Great locationNow . . .That being said:I texted as requested for my car. 35 minutes later, I went downstairs, (they request 30 minutes) and no car . . They tell me another 30 minutes because someone called in sick. .There were about  10 SERIOUSLY upset people who waited longer than I did!!!The valet's themselves are great, and really try to do their best, but their company policy that prevents them from simply giving people their keys, and letting them get their cars from the public garage located adjacent to the hotel, is RIDICULOUS!!!!EDIT:I spoke with the management at the Hilton desk at check out this morning, and they advised me that were meeting with the Valet service to determine how to avoid this situation again.Hopefully this will resolve the valet issues.I stand by my praise of the staff at this hotel, and will certainly stay with them again.Check In:  Fast and efficient early check in around 2pm with the clerk from the HGI side coming over to help out since the HS clerk was on the phone. Location:  While not right in the mix of Inner Harbor tourist sites, the hotel is close enough to still be convenient and it's is located right by a CCC Green and Orange Line stop. Food:  They serve a light evening dinner Mo-Th and breakfast is included seven days a week.  When we were there the Homewood Lodge area was closed for renovations so everybody was eating in the HGI area and that led to some confusion that I'll get to.We came for dinner on Thursday night and even though the in room menu showed Meatloaf when we got there about twenty minutes before shut down time there was no Meatloaf in sight.They had out salad, a very creamy Tomato Bisque, rock hard breadsticks, and personal sized Red Barron-like pizzas.  The reception attendant had no idea what the menu was supposed to be nor why the kitchen was putting out pizza.That aside, we ate because it was free and other than two guys who stopped in for some of the free beer there was no one else there and it looked like no one had been there for quite a while as all the tables were fully set and cleaned.Breakfast was quite chaotic both days because the Mo-Fr staff did one thing and the weekend staff on Sa did something else.  You are suppose to show your room card to let the staff know where to seat you and if the breakfast is free (HS) or if you're paying like a sap $12.95 (HGI) for the same thing.On Friday we were never asked for our room key.  At 8am the breakfast area was dead and we were allowed to sit where we pleased.On Saturday at 9am the place was quite busy yet we were told by a HS staff member to sit wherever since it was so busy.  After sitting down we were approached by a very pushy and rude HGI staff member who I'll refer to as the ""Breakfast Nazi"" who told us that we had to move to the HS side, which was full, or we had to go down the hall to an adjunct meeting room that was being used for overflow HS breakfast guests even though the HGI side only had two of maybe twelve tables occupied.Eventually after the Breakfast Nazi conferred with the HS employee ""A"" who told us to sit wherever we wanted to sit but BN exchanged several shitty glances with my wife and I the remainder of the time we were seated in ""her area"".Housekeeping:  We kept the DND on our door for our entire two night stay so I can't say.The Room:  The king bed was standard and comfortable and the pull out sofa was thin and hard as you would expect.  We did take advantage of the full size fridge, microwave, and two burner range top to help keep our food costs down and all worked well.We didn't use the gym/pool/or overpriced parking so I have no idea about them.Overall this Homewood while quirky, because it's one building with two hotels that are separate (One side Homewood and the other side Hilton Garden Inn)yet share some amenities, is definitely a place we will return to the next time we are in Baltimore.Just watch where you sit at Breakfast or else the Breakfast Nazi is likely to say ""NO WAFFLE FOR YOU""!(Minus one star for the Breakfast Nazi's harassment.)I enjoyed everything about my stay!! The room was efficient. Everything was clean and the staff was very nice!!","I booked a room at this hotel for a ""get out of dodge"" birthday weekend for my boyfriend and me. Having been to Baltimore many times, I still was not well acquainted with the Fells Point neighborhood that the hotel is located. I was very pleased when I discovered that my plans for the weekend were going to work out since we could walk to Little Italy, the Inner Harbor and the area of Fells Point where all the night life is located. Additionally, it was just a short taxi ride to Camden Yards. We used the valet parking so we could take the car out for day trip to Annapolis. They were responsive and quick with car retrieval.Everyone I encountered of the hotel staff were very friendly and smiley. The breakfast attendant struck me as so cheerful that he really started me off in a good mood for the day. The breakfast was so so - good enough to get you through to the nice lunch you should have later. At some point our card keys both did not work and I went to the front desk to get them fixed and the front desk agent was playful, friendly, and helpful. It is so nice to interact with these type of people on your trip.Our room was very nice. We stayed on the 11th floor and had plenty of natural light. It was quiet, clean, modern, and the kitchen was handy since we made drinks and appetizers prior to our nights on the town. We used the MAC, Maryland Athletic Club, that hotel guests have access to and it was great.Overall, I would definitely stay here again.I do really love this place and plan to stay again the next time I am in town.Positive:  Free beer Monday - Thursday, Free breakfast is okay but the evening social food was very good.  Hotel staff are awesome!!!!  Beds are comfortable and cozy.  View was beautiful.  Gym.  Pool.  Full kitchen.  Not much space to move about in the room, but it was still a great room.  Water pressure is great.  Name brand shampoo, soaps, etc   LOVE THIS PLACE!!Negative:  Valet ($32/ each night) takes up to 30 - 45 minutes to get car in the AM.  Self park ($22/ per park) is also expensive, but you can get your car when you want.This is not a group I would do business with again. When you make a reservation at any of the hotels of this group (Homewood Suites by Hilton) it is very difficult to cancel. They tell you there is no refund or changes that can be made. What hotel does that? And it isn't any easier if you are merely changing to another Homewood Suites by Hilton at a nearby city. You would think that an organization with hotels in different but neighboring cities would be able accommodate your request. I don't care how clean the place is - they can't be 'all that' if they can't provide great customer service. Not only would I not recommend this hotel, I would dissuade people from using it until they change their customer service policies.I have been staying at the Homewood Suites on a business trip since Saturday and it has been one of my worst hotel experiences. First, I had to fight just to get the air conditioning fixed in my room on Saturday. Second there is no hot water in the entire building and will not be until Tuesday at 6:00 pm. I check out Wednesday morning. Sure, we can go into a connecting fitness center to shower but their water isn't very hot either. Alternatively, I've been told by the front desk that I can go out of the hotel, around the corner and down the street to another hotel to use their showers. They claim it is a ""utilities"" issue but it seems to me that if there was a utilities problem there would be no water at all, not just a lack of hot water. Finally, the television in my bedroom doesn't work but I haven't even mentioned it because it's not really worth it at this point. I will never stay at a Homewood Suites again.Excellent location.  Great room value.  We stayed in a one-bedroom suite.  At 400 sq ft you're not going to host any parties, but just enough during your visit to Baltimore.  Stayed Saturday into Sunday and enjoyed the free hot breakfast (eggs, bacon, corned beef hash, pancakes) as well as juices, coffee, cereal, yogurt and danishes.  Only thing to watch, if you valet, is that you only pay $32 per night -- our bill had two charges for some reason, but was quickly corrected.  Great location near shopping and Eastern harbor attractions.THRILLED WITH MY EXPERIENCE HERE!HERE ARE ALL THE GREAT THINGS!-----PRICE: At the hotel across the street (Mariott) for a single room with just a bed and bathroom, the cost per night was what we paid for our entire stay. With my AAA card we only paid $150 a night for an entire SUITE at the Hilton.-----ROOM: Huge, Clean, you literally could live out of your room if you went shopping at Whole Foods (right behind the hotel) since there's a small but fully functioning kitchen right in the room! The living room area made the hotel feel more like an apartment or condo and we actually enjoyed spending time in our room, as compared to other hotels where you only want to return to go to sleep.-----AMENITIES: The Gym, FANTASTIC!!! It is a MAC (Maryland Athletic Club) that city residents belong to too, so it is a fully-functioning gym with all the equipment and classes you could deam of. This is also where the pool is located. Main Hotel staff is friendly and hepful. I requestd a non-smoking room that had never been smoked in and we got exactly that! Wi-Fi was a little slow but the room came with an internet cable, that when plugged into my laptop provided much faster internet.-----LOCATION: We were so close to the Inner Harbor that you could see it from our room! (I posted pics). My boyfriend and I both don't mind walking so the 0.7 mile walk to Fell's Point in one direction or 0.8 mile walk in the other direction to the Inner Harbor was not a big deal and really pleasant. You can pay $20/person/day for the water taxi and take it anywhere around the Harbor you want.-----FOOD: We ate at the complimentary breakfast that runs from 7-10am. There were some little kids running around but they were all in good spirits so it was not obnoxious at all. I would recommend getting there before 9 so that you can get the best food ;-). There were scrambled eggs, hash browns, baccon, breakfast burritos, a make your own waffle station, bagels, pastries/muffins, yogurt, cereal, juice, water, coffee/tea, etc. We were never disappointed and were rather impressed with this breakfast compared to other hotels we have stayed at. The only negatives I can draw are that I called for a new hairdryer because mine was cold and it took the staff nearly an hour to come to my room, but it turns out the cool button was stuck so it didn't even need to be replaced or repaired and that parking was $25 a night; we parked ourlselves to avoid an additional $10/night valet charge. There is another garage near Fell's Point that is only $10 a night but it's probably 3/4 mile from the hotel. The hotel elevators go right to their own garage, which was definitely a plusStayed here for a long weekend with the family,  Been to Baltimore a few times but usually stayed over near Camden Yards.     This area is so nice - within walking distance of everything (a bit of a stretch coming home from the ballpark at night but not awful).  Staff was friendly and they had a good breakfast buffet.  This will definitely be my go-to next time I am in Baltimore.DO NOT STAY HERE if you want high speed Internet (speedtest had them at .15mbps which is like dial-up speed)Hotel is a pretty good location, new area of the harbor they're trying to develop.  Not the feel of the convention center/camden yards area, but nice.  Great restaurants, movie theater, walking areas nearby.  Rooms are standard for newer Homewood Suites in urban areas.  The rooms are in good shape.Stayed here for 2 nights about a week ago and thought it was a comfortable, clean and overall decent place.  We loved all of the space in the room (kitchenette, separate seating area).  The location was also great (East Harbor), close to pretty much everywhere we wanted to go.There is a CVS and Whole Foods right around the corner.  The front desk staff was super friendly and gave us restaurant recommendations.  Parking is a bit high at the lot connected, but I think that is normal for the area.I have only two issues with our stay: 1) no one told us about the breakfast that was included with our room - so we didn't get to take advantage of that and 2) there was a fan in the bathroom that ran continuously - as far as we could tell, there was no switch for it.  It wasn't that big of a deal, we just shut the door to minimize the noise.Really great location for seeing all the Inner Harbor sites.  It's a short, safe walk to Little Italy, the Aquarium, and all of downtown.  Parking is in the garage for the shopping center next door.  Parking costs about $25 per day.The rooms are modern and nicely laid out.  I heard almost no road noise.One confusing thing, the lobby is shared with a Hilton Garden Inn so you may do a double take.  Breakfast, while not great, is a step above most other Homewoods I've stayed in.Great room - extremely spacious.  Great value.  We did have one problem, though, when the fire alarm went off in the building not all floors heard the alarm.  I happened to go down to the breakfast room before my family so I heard it, but when I went outside I didn't see my family.  I called them and told them what was going on.  There was no alarm on our floor.  I tried to get an answer from the local firemen about the seriousness of the incident and could not get a straight answer.  I did report the faulty system to the front desk who seemed unaware of the problem and really did nothing about it.  In the end, the incident was minor and no one was hurt.I would have given this hotel 4 stars if it weren't for this incident.I would recommend finding another spot.  The valet was not helpful and told me that it was too cold, so he would check my car and move it later.  The front desk experience wasn't any more pleasant.  I had to sign a ""no party"" policy which made me inquire - I learned that signing didn't mean following when the party next door got out of control at 3 am and no one came when I called the front desk.  I got a kick out of the front desk asking if I wanted a higher floor, and then telling me they were sold out and it wasn't available 30 seconds later when I said I would like a higher floor.Someone had smoked in the room, and the solution was to open the windows in 40 degree weather....a great cold greeting in the room.  My roo m had a large iron burn in front of the sink, and it was a constant source of snagging my socks or scraping my foot.  I was floored that I probably paid the same as other guests and got a crappy room - I wasn't going down for another exchange with the ""don't care"" attitude at the front desk.Overall, I presume a clean room without burns is nice.  The pull-out bed in the couch has obviously dirty sheets - I called housekeeping and they brought new sheets for us to make the bed (they were unhappy when I asked them to take the dirty sheets).  The breakfast is okay, the location is great, and the access to the athletic club is GREAT (thus they are getting 2 stars instead of 1).Management at this hotel should invest in some training on a culture of service and caring about a customer.  This hotel was not a ""Home"", and I think a better attitude by all of the staff could go a long way.  It is disappointing when management doesn't care, and I hope that they improve.Another great stay at Homewood Suites. The hotel is clean and comfortable with a great location, nestled between the Inner Harbor and Little Italy. Parking is in the attached garage and costs approximately $20 per day. Several restaurants, an Irish pub, a Whole Foods Market, and a CVS drug store are literally steps away.This place is decent. There were some highs and some lows. The high is that it is in a really good neighborhood. The Cons: Shabby carpets, expensive valet that is always backed up and slow( there was really only one friendly happy valet -Chase) breakfast isn't great or even good, the dinners are worse. My window was opened some days (in decemeber), they left the bed totally unmade one day - when I called down they laughed but sent up someone who complained the whole time (they left it unmaid with no sheets, etc). There was a laundry area but one had a broken washer, the fire alarm went off while we were there, but it only went off on floors above 6, which means part of our party never heard it. The TV stations were boring and the internet connection was slower than dial up in 1996. Pros: Free wine 4 nights a week, Great area with lots to walk to for dinner and entertainment.Area felt very Safe!Great hotel! I've been to Baltimore about 8 times now for medical reasons and will never stay anywhere outside the Harbor East neighborhood again. I have not found a good hotel in the city, even the Monaco wasn't good. Stayed in an apartment for the last trip which was amazing, but next time I go up I'm staying in Homewood again. Good price a night, and if it's too pricey for you, you save money on food because they serve a good breakfast and and dinner at, and for the Homewood side only, free whine and beer. Just be sure you get there before the end of the time period, because they won't refill everything, and staff will get a bit pissy if you do. The Hotel is in a great area, and you also have access to a REAL fitness center next door, not just a tiny room with 5 pieces of equipment. The hotel didn't have a pool, but the gym did. Staff was great!The only few (small) things I would complain about, 1) the rooms were not as big as they looked online. I got a suite-which from online, it seems like you only get a suite or a studio, and the suite has the kitchen, dinning room table, desk, and separate bedroom. And online it looks huge, but I opened the door and it was just a kitchen and small living room. Not a big deal whatsoever, but need to investigate to see if they are showing another option. 2) Other small issue, I asked for a room with a view, and the front desk associate, put me in a room on the 8th floor, which is a big outside area connecting to the adjacent office building, and also a place where people can let out their dogs. This isn't a bid deal, but the door that enters that patio, let out right next to our room, making it a bit awkward since everyone can just see in your room. So we kept the curtains closed the entire time. I wouldn't be frustrated about it if I hadn't asked for a view. I would highly recommend staying here. If you don't like eating out for every meal, and having a homier feeling hotel room, then stay here! The free dinner was awesome, especially that it was with free drinks. Lots of shopping and restaurants and water is right next to hotel and a walking path along the water. Parking at $23 a night, $32 for valet, pretty comparable to all hotels in area. Starbucks next door which was good. If you have free time, definitely just take a nice walk by the water. I'll be back here at this hotel in 6 months!Nothing bad to say about this place. Rooms, the service, location and MAC being next door make it one of my favorite stops in Baltimore.Good choice in the Baltimore area.  The room was laid out like a mini-apartment in a high rise.  People were friendly and the place was spotless.  Lot's of shops around and places to sight see.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/rachaels-dowry-bed-and-breakfast-baltimore,Rachael's Dowry Bed and Breakfast,5.0,$$,31,"My wife and I live just a few doors down from this LOVELY place.   We love walking by and seeing the quaint detailed TLC on the outside.    I look forward to taking my wife here for a weekend getaway.    It is lovely.I can't imagine that there would be a better place to stay in Baltimore than Rachael's Dowry Bed and Breakfast.  I stayed for one evening and it was definitely the right choice for picking a place to stay.  It is located right outside Oriole Park and a short walk from the light rail.  They do an unbelievable job of making you feel at home and do everything they can do make your stay very comfortable.  The room was very nice, the bed was very cozy.  Breakfast served the next morning was very good.  I can't stress enough the very comfortable and secure feeling you have while you are a guest in the house.  I would absolutely stay here again when I visit Baltimore.Lovely and unique place to stay in Baltimore. The bed was very comfortable and the room and building full of small touches like many wonderful books, orange brandy and homemade treats out every night, and well chosen antiques that never felt fussy. The neighborhood is quaint with a few good restaurants and a coffee shop. Its walkable to the conference center and harbor, though a bit of a hike to the buzzier local neighborhoods. The one bummer is the limited availability of breakfast from 8-9am. I understand that many people stay here for conferences, but its very difficult for those visiting from more western timezones to drag ourselves out of bed on time. Maybe extend the hours a bit if only on the weekends? (admittedly- I did not ask, as I was planning to get up and slept right through my alarm instead, oops).I stayed at Rachael's from Sunday-Thursday because I have accepted a research position with the University of Maryland-Baltimore and I needed to come up to fill out paperwork and do some training with my new lab.  This was a very short walk away from the medical building where the office is so I was very happy with that.  There are so many reviews that I thought I might take some time to hi-light some of the details that don't often come up in the reviews I read.Breakfast: The breakfast is excellent.  The typical breakfast hour is between 8 and 9.  My HR orientation started at 8:15 and they were flexible with me and had breakfast available starting at 7:30.  I was very appreciative.  For breakfast expect to come down every morning to a table set just for you with a dish of fruit tossed with yogurt (I'm guessing vanilla) and topped with home made granola.  The fruits I had included things like fresh pears, bananas, cherries, oranges.  You wouldn't think that oranges would be right with yogurt, but it was nice.  There is also a small glass of juice at the table waiting for you (e.g. cranberry apple) and a cup ready for self-service coffee.  The coffee is a very strong roast (I would guess a french roast) and is apparently local.  I love that the coffee was self service because sometimes I want one cup and sometimes a want 3 cups, and I would rather get my own rather than wait.  Just as a tip, I did see that he has to go cup lids available if you're a take-away coffee kind of person then you should just ask.  Then the entree comes, I'm just going to list what I had on each day so you can get the feel of what to expect.  I like everything I ate:Monday: Something like an egg frittata with pineapple in it (I know, strange, but very good, the pineapple became caramelized and was excellent, 2 link sausages, and some sweet breakfast breadTuesday: Another baked egg dish with some hot peppers in it, bacon, and little heavy breakfast muffins with butterWednesday: Poached eggs on butter english muffins and sausagesThursday: Buckwheat pancakes with toasted almonds and warm maple syrup along with sausages and orange slicesThere were also a small fresh batch of cookies every afternoon.  I think that I personally ate almost all of the peanut butter cookies on Wednesday afternoon by myself (ops).  There is also honey cognac available.  I will often drink a bit of honey whiskey at home/make a hot toddy with it.  I started to feel like I was getting a cold and I poured some into a cup of hot tea, it was a good substitute.  I stayed in the Carrie Frank suite the first day and the Randolph room the other 3 days.  The bath products have a lovely floral scent.  The rooms are very clean.  The sheets are very soft.  The bed in the Randolph room was comfortably soft, the bed in the Carrie Frank suite was impossibly hard, I would strongly suggest a new mattress.The neighborhood is great.  There is a sort of general convenience store next to the house which would be great to get a snack or something.  There is a coffee place next to that called Sidewalk Espresso Bar, and the lovely Corner Bistro and Wine Bar is very close too.  Don't get turned off by all of the market prices listed on the menu.  They are really nice there, and I almost got the impression that they were even nicer to me because I was staying here.  I had a great stay.  I did not regret the choice to stay in a B&amp;B rather than picking a big chain hotel.A bed and breakfast gem nestled in a delightful neighborhood with plenty to see, do, eat, and drink within walking distance.  This is my second year in a row staying here and I will be back again.  If you are staying here please try the Sidewalk Cafe, only a few blocks away, also The Corner Bistro and Wine Bar.Excellent in everything they do. I stayed Thursday thru Sunday while attending a conference at the nearby Hilton, and I'm so happy I selected this charm-filled B&amp;B rather than the host hotel. A month later I still remember the delicious breakfasts, served at a time that suited my unfortunately early starts - spicy eggs, dairy-free muffins made especially to suit my dietary restrictions and fresh fruits. The bedroom was enormous with a spacious, comfortable four-poster bed giving excellent nights of sleep. Of course, it goes without saying that the service was incredibly friendly and personable. Has my highest recommendation.Really enjoyed my stay here.  The House is beautifully decorated with period antiques, books and clocks.  The host made a great breakfast, wish I hadn't had so many early breakfast meetings as part of the conference!  I definitely recommend staying here.This was my first bed and breakfast and I was very impressed.  The home was very comfortable and welcoming.  Tish was very friendly and accommodating.  We were also impressed with the homemade breakfast!  The home and neighborhood were quiet, despite it being a block away from the ballpark.  The location is also very conveniently located to the harbor and Camden Yards.  We will definitely be staying here again and highly recommend it to others looking for comfortable, homey accommodations in Baltimore.Great place to stay.  Tish was very accommodating.   The location, room, food and hospitality are as good as it gets.    Walking distance to the inner harbor.   Highly recommended.DaveAs a native ""Baltimoran,"" it was a pleasure to have an opportunity to be a guest in my former hometown! This B&amp;B is a treasure!  Staying at this well-located Inn helped turn a weekend of family duty into a lovely weekend of exploration and comfort! The Inn is beautiful and so well-maintained!  There is simply nothing that could have been better: the sleeping accommodations, the bathroom, the breakfast, added amenities and of course, the warm but not intrusive hospitality.I encourage you to stay at Rachael's Dowry, but hope there will be room at the Inn for us when we want to return.My husband and I stayed at Rachael's Dowry which is located in the heart of Baltimore, walking distance to the inner harbor.  Tish was an excellent hostess and made our stay very comfortable.  Our room was outstanding, the breakfast was yummy terrific, the location was convenient and the experience sold my husband on future B&amp;B visits.  We had a fabulous Bicycle Tour with Penny, the owner at Light Street Cycles.  She rode her bike and met us at Rachael's Dowry and we took off from there for a leisurely 15 mile tour of the inner harbor and surrounding area.  How awesome to spend a couple of days in a quaint residential area, blocks from Camden Yard and a perfect location to enjoy neighborhood restaurants.Close to the harbor, sporting arenas and great food!  One of the most comfortable beds I've every slept in. And most importantly wonderful hosts!My husband and I stayed here when attending an event at the Hippodrome. We were able to walk there and to an excellent restaurant recommended by Tish: Forno. Our room was absolutely lovely and comfortable. Norman, our host, was wonderfully attentive, offering history of the area and the house. Each room in the house is beautifully appointed and individually unique. Elegant, including charming antiques. The house is quiet, the fire delightful for early morning reading and late evening cosy comfort in rooms with a fireplace--gas but well done. We are staying there again--in another room--this weekend and look forward to staying each time we visit Baltimore! Breakfast was simple (and varies): delicous coffee, juice, eggs, bacon, english muffin, fruit with lovely yogurt topping. Charming dining room. Good romantic getaway. Easy walk to the Harbor area.What a great stay! We were only there for one night but it was wonderful. Norman was so pleasant and welcoming. The inn is warm and inviting. Very romantic. Everything was extremely clean and updated. I would highly recommend this bed and breakfast. I definitely plan to return when it's warmer out and I can explore more of Baltimore. Breakfast was delicious! Thank you Norman!Wonderful hospitality and great charm. Tish was very considerate to the needs of our family and made us feel quite welcome. We will stay here again if we are back in Baltimore again!Aaaaafrigginmazing!  stayed for two nights with my boyfriend. We were on a Baltimore food tour. I researched many restaurants Glad I did!The weather was crappy- so we drove everywhere (all the awesome places were close)Back to B&amp;B gorgeous - breakfast was deelish The host was awesome &amp; sweet! The room was quiet and relaxing. I def took advantage of bathtub.Can't wait to go back this summer (hopefully make a Yankee game down there)The location is excellent. We were able to walk to the inner harbor and the stadiums. Breakfast was wonderful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The owner, Norman, is kind and friendly. We will certainly stay if we are in the area again.What an amazing find!  My husband and I stayed here for our mini-moon.  We scoured the internet looking for a nice play to stay in Baltimore, and were excited to book Rachael's Dowry based on the excellent customer reviews.  This place did not disappoint in the least!Titia, one of the proprietors, contacted us shortly after we made our reservation with helpful information and directions to their private parking lot (no extra charge).  We parked our car and never moved it because the B&amp;B's location was super convenient...a short walk to Camden Yards and all of the attractions at the inner harbor.  Our room (which we selected from the several available) was tastefully and comfortably decorated, with modern amenities that didn't take away from the historic/period touches.  The rest of the B&amp;B was wonderfully restored, and we were invited to walk around and enjoy it as if it were our own home.  We felt so welcome!The breakfasts were incredible.  I looked forward to seeing/smelling/tasting the delicious meal we'd be surprised with each morning.  Everything was locally grown or made, and prepared fresh each morning by Norm, the main proprietor (I need to get his recipes).  We'd usually move to the cozy shaded garden in back and let breakfast settle before heading out for the day.We had such a great overall experience, we intend to return to Rachael's Dowry at least once a year for a romantic get-away.  This place was top notch.This bed and breakfast is fantastic. The owners did a great job of renovating a historical building to create a comfortable and tasteful abode with modern conveniences while retaining the charm and details of the building's background. The balance and touches of history and modernity are just the right mix, not overwhelming or stuffy (nor flowery).The large room we stayed in had tall windows that looked out on to their beautiful garden and the street. Even the bathroom was large and beautifully outfitted.Located within a quiet charming (i know, i said charming already...) little network of old little buildings and streets. Perhaps a bit like a miniature NYC West Village? There is a large front garden, so it' set back from the street. It's also walking distance to the stadium, convention center, waterfront, and med school.Parking, WiFi, TV, library, great big breakfast, cookies, water, cognac, thick sheets and towels, host is helpful and non-intrusive.I travel once every 6 weeks and find corporate hotels rather boring and uninteresting, so asked my wife to find me a nice place in Baltimore. Rachael's Dowry B&amp;B place is fantastic, great hosts, great room, very quiet and clean and a delicious breakfast. The rooms are beautifully restored with modern conveniences such as wireless internet (great for me as a business traveler). Breakfast was lovely with great attention to detail and beautifully cooked food, I have never been this relaxed on a business trip before. I'll be back......","Stayed over Memorial Day weekend and had an incredible time.  We stayed in the Ella Virginia suite and it couldn't have been more cozy and comfortable.  We had plans to go out and see the city but it was a struggle to leave the room at times.  The rest of the house could not be more charming, as well.  Tish was an unbelievable host, and the breakfast each morning was divine.I cannot recommend this place highly enough!Coming from a first time B&amp;Ber... we absolutely loved our stay! The owner, Tish, is welcoming and helpful, but not overwhelming. The home is charming, beautiful and very clean. The breakfast was different each morning and was a real treat. My girlfriend and I recently stayed a weekend in January and will definitely go back.My wife and I extremely enjoyed our one night stay at Rachael's Dowry. We stayed in the Randoph Room and it was very accommodating. We could not ask for a better location in Baltimore, as we attended the Orioles game at Camden and we enjoyed walking to the Inner Harbor. We will not stay anywhere else but here when we return to Baltimore.I stayed here for 10 days, and i couldn't have been happier with the room, the food, and the hospitality. Tish and Norman are both great cooks, and they are super nice, too.My husband and 13 year old vegetarian daughter joined me a few days after i arrived. They were just as impressed as i was. My daughter was served her own special breakfasts, and she was very comfortable staying there.I really could not recommend Rachael's Dowry enough to anyone wanting to stay in Baltimore. Be sure to check out Corner Bistro and Peace and a Cup of Joe just a few blocks away, too.Our B&amp;B experience at Rachael's Dowry was perfect.  We came for a one night stay in Baltimore to explore the inner-harbor and particularly the aquarium and science museum. The B&amp;B is within easy walking distance (5-6 blocks) and would be a good place to stay if you were planning to go to the convention center as well!The B&amp;B itself is really well put together and is run in a fun, no-nonsense, kind of way that lets you get past any logistics and lets you relax.  The bedroom was great with a a cute electric fireplace and lovely antique furniture that made it all very cozy.  My wife and I stayed int he Ella Virginia Bath Suite which was fantastic.  The bed was very soft and having the bath for us to relax with some (provided) bubble bath was great.I would recommend this to anyone visiting Baltimore and the inner-harbor area.(Thanks Tish!)Wonderful find in an incredibly convenient location. We came down for a long weekend for a convention/mini vacation and really wanted to find a more palatable price tag than the hotels near the Inner Harbor. Looked all over the web and found this B&amp;B, which was much more reasonable per night AND included free parking and breakfast. Our walk to the convention center was 15 minutes at most, basically just on the other side of the baseball stadium. And by the way, there were games both nights of our stay but you wouldn't know since you could barely hear it, even being so close.Tish (innkeeper) couldn't have been any friendlier. She gave us very helpful recommendations for local eateries, remembered the activities we'd mentioned and gave us directions to and from our destinations. Her breakfasts were awesome, and she was very thoughtful. She asked about vegetarian preferences, and made me a separate quiche without meat.We stayed in the Ella Virginia Suite and the room and furniture were gorgeous. Everything was clean and well maintained. All in all, this was far better than getting ripped off for a generic stay in a chain hotel. We will definitely recommend to friends and family and book for future visits to town!A wonderful option near the convention center. I had a large, comfortable and clean room with sumptuous colonial furnishings, delicious fresh-baked cookies, custom-made breakfast, and all for less than the Hilton a block away was charging. Highly recommend.Rachel's Dowry: a Bit of Shangri-la in Ridgley's DelightRachel's Dowry, though it has been in business for only a few years, might have been conceived as a bed and breakfast.  It is so ideally suited to that purpose that it can hardly be imagined as anything else.  Its excellent accommodations, antique-filled rooms, and aura of comfort are as quintessentially ""B &amp; B"" as its historical lineage and walkable locale.The house is Ridgley's Delight's most imposing and has outlasted innumerable dust-ups and reconfigurations, not only to the City of Baltimore, but to a politically complicated country that has been invaded once and attempted to tear itself apart fifty years later.   Orioles Park/Camden Yards looms above its chimneys and cornices to the east while two-lane roads that are lined with two and three-story houses meander along, away from, and catty-corner to, its spacious front yard.  Rachel's Dowry was built in 1798 and has bones to match.  And while its facade is Victorian, its interior hearkens back to the days when George Washington was said to have slept in every home and wayfarers from New York and Philadelphia found a comfortable place to land while they were in Baltimore City on business.Modern-day guests may well gawk at its well-appointed interior, which has been restored to such a fare-thee-well that its many nuances go, paradoxically, unnoticed.  Yet all of its amenities blend to create an experience that is tinged with the brandy one can sip in its library and suffused with the light that is filtered by a ""heritage"" magnolia in the courtyard, from which a guest may enter after parking in its private lot.One may choose from six rooms, which can be found in the main house as well as an annex that had very likely housed slaves and servants.   The one my fiance and I stayed in was appointed with a fine four-poster bed, a fireplace whose flames could be remotely controlled, and a basin-style ""water fountain"".  Its bathroom, while small, was well-designed, with a walk-in shower and ""green""/single-flush toilet.  The room's color-scheme was as calming as its view of the courtyard, whose brick-inlaid charm was as potent as any of the house's interior features.Though we didn't utilize them, complimentary internet, satellite TV, as well as iPod/iPhone docking stations, were available to us.  (We are luddites whose techno-savvy extends to opening car doors.)  Solar panels contribute to an energy-efficient heating and air-conditioning system.   And should business-folk want to catch up on emails, work stations provide for that.  Our host, Norman Finnance - who, along with his sister, Letitia Finnance Bohner, renovated the house in 2010 - could not have been more generously unobtrusive, though he was always accessible and never less than gracious.  He and his sister are obviously in love with the place.   No B &amp; B in my experience has been given such lavish care and attention.  Mr. Finnance (et al) is so intimately acquainted with the restoration process - which was necessary to get the house ""in gear"" - that his subtle decision-making is embedded in every little thing.   His thoughtful questions regarding our nutritional preferences bore fruit (as it were) in our breakfast, which suited our vegan propensities to a T.  Kudos should not be spared on the dining-room, whose marble fireplaces and random-width floorboards evoked the past as unassumingly as the parlor into which it flowed.  Because of a security system that was easy to operate and understand, our comings and goings were drama-free.  Though I don't claim to have much savvy in this regard, I have stood outside of hotel rooms pleading with the gods to let me in.  Eventually a three-dimensional person comes, to our mutual embarrassment, and rescues me.  At Rachel's Dowry, there was, thankfully, no need to worry about being stranded outside.    What was wrong with Rachel's Dowry?  If I could think of something, I'd love to share it with you.  But when perfection comes into one's life, it's best to enjoy it and hope that it won't be the last time.    Rachel's Dowry is at 637 Washington Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21230.It can be reached by phone at (410) 752-0805 or through its website, whose address is: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rachaelsdowrybedandbreakfast.com%2Fthe-inn%2Fthe-inn.htm&amp;s=889395fddcb906f13110f022e3f8fdf96b888375fe6fd92454645b972aa65062"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">rachaelsdowrybedandbreak...</a>Rachel's Dowry accepts Visa, Master Card, American Express, and Discover cards.  Cancellations must be received twelve days before check-in in order to avert a deposit forfeiture.  Many attractions, including the Inner Harbor area, are within walking distance.  Consult the website for the comprehensive choices that will be available to you.Rachael's Dowry is a gem!  Located near the heart of downtown Baltimore this Inn is fewer than 10-minutes' walk from the Convention center and the Piers (Aquarium, Museums, Entertainment, etc).  The rooms are lovingly restored, spacious and thoughtfully decorated.  We stayed in the room with the large soaking tub on the top floor.  The bed was so comfortable.Rachael's Dowry includes special treats (but they're a surprise!) that make you, the guest, really feel like the innkeepers are happy to have you there.  Parking is included in a lot with video surveillance just around the corner.  Free Wi-Fi is available and the innkeepers are incredibly knowledgeable about the area.  They give good recommendations for entertainment and dining venues.The breakfast was delicious and included fresh-squeezed orange juice--yum!I highly recommend this place; we will be back!MgOur stay in this lovely old house (1798) was enhanced by the friendliness and culinary talents of our hostess and the historical information shared by her co-host. We were too busy to take advantage of the lovely patio and library but enjoyed passing through them. Though the house was an easy walk from the Inner Harbor, it was very quiet and peaceful. Looking forward to a return visit.As one of the first guests ever to stay at Rachel's Dowry B&amp;B, I can't say enough good things about it! Such a GORGEOUS house with a fabulous restoration.  The attention to detail is impressive and I could definitely see George Washington staying there (which he really did!).The rooms are beautiful and the hosts are SUPER friendly! Not to mention the location being PERFECT for baseball games (only 1.5 blocks to the stadium) and about a 10 minute walk to the inner harbor. We stayed in the Ella Virginia room which was very cozy. My favorite part might have been the bathtub though! We will definitely be coming back again soon! Can't wait to see the huge magnolia tree in bloom!",,,,"['wife', 'live', 'doors', 'lovely', 'place', 'love', 'walking', 'seeing', 'quaint', 'detailed', 'outside', 'look', 'forward', 'taking', 'wife',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/inn-at-the-colonnade-a-doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-baltimore-2,Inn at the Colonnade - A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,3.0,$$,38,"You get as many warm cookies as you want.  I think that sold it for me.  I must have consumed about 12 cookies during my 2 night stay there.  The staff was very professional and nice.Cookies aside. I think the location near Med Star Union Memorial Hospital and John's Hopkins University makes it ideal of any trips that involve those two sites.  In addition for Med Star Union Memorial there is a set rate for 109 dollars a night.The room I got was enormous.  I had a view of the JHU campus.  All the furnishings were good.  There are a few areas were you can see the age of the building, but those are minor issues.  Overall didn't see any reason not to give them a full 5 stars.This is a real black mark on the Hilton brandThey get 2 stars, but only because their staff is very helpful.Unfortunately you have to call on them all too often. Foolishly we've stayed there twice because of its proximity to Union Memorial  Hospital, but never again. The rooms aren't maintained. TVs aren't connected, outlets too loose to hold a plug, Jacuzzis that don't work (but are advertized), a WiFi that is substandard, showers and mattresses that are spotty....I speak from experience with 4 rooms as we needed changes made both times.Beware of the pricing. They are way high for the Baltimore market. Parking is expensive at $25 a day. Deals that purportedly get 20% off don't. (But they will get you stuck into a room that's a bit bigger than a closet.) Restaurant is also pricey, and while the free breakfast is OK, the dinners are to be avoided.Hilton would be well advised to jettison this franchise and find another one for the staff to work at. It's just two floors of rooms that seem to have low occupancy judging by the traffic in the restaurant and lobby. (For example, the breakfast at the resturant is free, but diners seem to easily outnumber staff) Seems it's just a tag-on to a much larger condo association. The franchise operators are clearly gouging the hotel market and squeezing as much out of the building as they can.I booked this venue based on the beautiful Atrium and the friendliness of the staff- in particular Rebecca. I had no issues until the day of. I was informed that my wedding scheduled to take place in an hour and a half was not able to take place in the Atrium. It was made out to be a freak accident. I found out later by hotel staff that this is a reoccurring issue at the hotel. I made a complaint after I returned from my honey moon. My once friendly Rebecca was now combative and extremely unhelpful. She claimed to talk to the Catering Manager and they offered me $500 back after spending almost $15,000. I told Rebecca that was unacceptable because I spent at least $500 on decorations for that room alone. I asked that the Hotel Manager give me a call back and was never contacted. I have been following some hotel events, and since my wedding 5 events (that I know of) have been moved due to the rain. Also, included in our price was a honeymoon room. The hot tub in the room did not work nor did the shower. No bubbles despite the apparent button to turn on the hot tub and the special shower (with bluetooth/steam/etc) did not work at all. Was a regular shower. I have now contacted a lawyer to try to get some of my funds back.Rooms are good sized and clean, and the staff are incredibly friendly.  I think that the showers and tubs are a little dated and could use and upgrade and some improved water pressure, but the staff is so incredibly pleasant I'd ignore that little problem.Great location if you are visiting Johns Hopkins University.My wife and I stayed here last week. The staff here is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are a great size and clean. It's nice to get away even though we live outside of Baltimore.  We usually go out and have a night on town... so it's nice to have a place to stay where everyone is so friendly.  Definitely check this place out it you are out and about. I've seen some of the bad reviews, but this place really is a great place to stay.I have to be honest and acknowledge how wonderful and amazing this hotel and staff were to me and my friend during our girls trip. I enjoyed our room immensely however that was second to the SERVICE. from the valet,  concierge,  front desk (Warren especially) and house keeping,  my friend and I did not want to leave.  Food...the restaurant Alizee is amazing, wonderful and not a disappointment.  I loved everything from the risotto,  shrimp cocktails,  crab cake and soup of the day etc. Just to name a few....words can't express how I enjoyed my stay. This us the hotel to stay. It's 15 min from the harbor which was ok by cab for 14 bucks. This will be my go to place. Rating this first doubletree stay was a pleasure. I highly recommend.Had a two day reservation and last minute the day before wanted to make it a one day. Hotel refused saying there was a two night minimum. Nowhere on the websitie was this ever stated and they refused. Have stayed here before so close to Johns Hopkins but never again. I guess they would rather have an empty room.  Will post this on Hopkins parents page as well telling people not to stay here.  So Unaccommodating. The room is available we r talking one day in advance. The hotel would rather have an empty room.Don't understand the three star rating; this hotel is very, very nice, and considering the surrounding neighborhood (around jhu) I'd say this hotel is EXCELLENT. I had a great experience with the helpful staff and the clean, spacious rooms. I did encounter some annoyance when the person on the other end of the room service call had NO idea what their menu was all about (made me feel rather silly asking for an item that was listed as BEING INCLUDED with the meal I ordered).... but then again it was early in the morning, so being not a morning person at all I was commiseratingly forgivable. (Still, learn your freaking menu, Staff. You're lucky your gratuity is automatic because the combo of my tired, crankiness and your rude, ineptness would yield NO tips whatsoever). jAnyway. Room service aside, wonderful place to stay.And you get a freakin' warm cookie when you check in! You can't get mad at that!Update : the vending machine in floor 2 doesn't work and steals money. Room service adds automatically 20% tips + 6 dollars to the room account,  which is a shame ! Don't give extra tip. The restaurant looks elegant and the free cookies at the reception are really good. But the room is dusty, we got allergies all night. The walls are so thin, you hear what your neighbors say. When the A/C decides to work, it's very noisy and it gives dust.Pretty classy looking place. I came for a health and wellness expo. I have to say that even though the event itself was pretty nice- the area it was held in was strange. It was just not set up well. I would like to try the restaurant inside one day. I will have to come back to get the real feel of this place.Staff were cheerful and warm.  Loved the bedding and plentiful towels.  And...the ""guess what else you have to pay for"" speech at check-in was really annoying.  I travel quite frequently and haven't seen such a time-consuming nickel-and-dime vibe in a while.  $20 per day for parking in a neighborhood with limited transit is just ick.    The walls were thin and the hallways were noisy, especially during the day.  Gym was about average for the type of hotel- adequate, as long as there's only one person there.   This place is clearly cut out as an event space and not a place to relax, at all.  There was pretty much constant activity- they even curtained off the ice machine!  Maybe that's nice for whoever booked the event, but I didn't appreciate it.Definitely not worth what we paid for. ""Whirlpool jet tub"" was disgusting. King size bed was low end. Pull out bed in sofa was absolutely horrific. And bathroom fan may as we'll have not existed the bathroom felt like a swamp after a shower. HHonors member very disappointed. Pool is nonexistent and ""fitness room"" includes 2 treadmills and a bench press. Very disappointed in you DoubleTree Hilton.$20 a night to have a refrigerator in your room??? This place could use more traffic but nickel and diming customers is not the way to go.The good:  Friendly, good food, good bar, clean lobby, clean hallways.The bad: Hilton should be ashamed to list this as their hotel.  So lets run down the list of issues since entering my room: The first thing I noticed was that the sofa cushions were flipped around, so the zipper was facing outwards.  I thought this was odd and spun it around so the zipper wasn't exposed to find that the correct facing side was sliced open with a knife (I assume the staff will just flip it around again when I leave). The vertical moulding strip along a corner that goes from floor to ceiling is only attached at the bottom two feet of the wall, so the top of the moulding is pulled away from the wall and dangling.  About an hour prior to going to sleep I found a fairly large 1"" spider on the bed waiting for me, that made for a nice sleep.  The shower heated quickly, but the sink took over a minute before the water was tepid...I didn't stick around for hot.  The shower tub was a faux-jacuzzi, meaning it was a jacuzzi tub, but the knobs were replaced with blanks, and presumably any water that went into the tubs jets (which are present) would just sit there after the shower.  I have no idea how old soap scum and water is cleared out from the jets.  The thermostat is digital, and I guess uses a battery that needs to be replaced as you can barely read the dim display unless at an extreme angle.  The clock radio had a broken bezel that fell off when I moved it.  I don't know what's wrong with the toilet, but it's an insanely weak flush.  As others have noted, there is a lot of dust, looking around the ceiling, almost every edge between the wall and popcorn ceiling has a line of dust and cobwebs.  But it's all okay, because free cookie, right?I stayed at this hotel for one night and the service was excellent.  I arrived at 1:30 AM and the night staff was courteous, warm, and professional, unlike at some hotels where I have arrived very late at night.  The valet handed me a chilled bottle of water when I gave him my car key and the front desk staff handed me a warm chocolate chip cookie when I checked in.  Even minor mishaps, such as my room key not working, were handled smoothly and efficiently.  My request for a very late checkout (3:00 PM) was also accommodated, which I find to be unusual these days.I ordered the crab and artichoke ravioli from room service for lunch and it was excellent.  It was also probably the fastest room service delivery I've ever experienced (just under 20 minutes.)I stayed in a standard king room and it was clean and very spacious.  The decor in the interior of my room was very slightly shabby, but the (apparently) newly renovated bathroom with whirlpool tub and Crabtree &amp; Evelyn bath products made up for it.  My room had a not-so-lovely view of the parking lot, but it did have a large balcony with patio furniture.For the price, I think this hotel is an excellent value.  IMHO, it deserves more than the 3 stars it is currently averaging on Yelp.It was clean and the staff were really nice but it was expensive. Parking and breakfast are not included. My boyfriend and I went there for only one night to experience the night life of inner harbor and check out a game. We're not familiar with Baltimore so if you want places that you can easily walk to from the hotel at a reasonable price, don't stay here. Taking a cab to inner harbor is about $2-15 each way.It was expensive, for one night it was just over $170, even with my AAA discount. yikes.This a nice budget-friendly hotel option.  I came to Baltimore on a work trip and this place was recommended to me because it's location is convenient to everywhere I was going.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was part of the DoubleTree/Hilton chain - they're my go-to, and the warm cookie at check-in is always an awesome surprise.  The hotel was easy to find, the parking garage is clearly marked and connected to the hotel, the lobby was clean and pretty and spacious.  The room was nice - again, everything seemed clean.  The bathroom was a little small and the vanity area has absolutely wretched lighting, but that wasn't too bothersome.  My only real annoyance was the heating system - it never seemed to reach the temp that I set it to so it was a little chilly the first night.  The housekeeping staff must have fiddled with the settings when they came in during the day because when I returned that night it had been reset to a different temp.  Also for some reason there's this faction of hotel heating systems that suck all the moisture out of my skin overnight, and this was one of them.  But overall, that really isn't a big deal.  The hotel was super safe, clean, the staff was friendly, and it was only $70/night.  I'd definitely stay here again.There aren't that many hotels north of downtown to stay in. We found this one last minute. It's expensive, but we asked if we could have a discount and got $30 dollars off and the guy slid two chocolate chip cookies across the counter. The beds were super comfortable. You do have to pay for parking, but there is also free street parking across te street between 6pm and 10 am. We were charged for te garage parking, but when we said we parked in the street, they removed the charge. Staff is nice.* Very nice hotel to stay at, but be forewarned, you have to pay extra for parking in their garage &amp; it is expensive!  The front desk staff people were fine, businesslike, but not friendly (no smiles).The room was great ~ clean, comfortable and nicely decorated.  The mattress was very comfortable &amp; the room temperature was fine.  The bathroom is modern &amp; has  a real cast iron tub &amp; marble walls.  The shower had good water pressure and temperature.  No complaints.I found this hotel in <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmarylandhotels.com&amp;s=282b7a575e65f7f7f53af7c128d9fef0259aba265cbd027a9f887ba4d4ee6bfd"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">marylandhotels.com</a>.  The room rate was good (I called at 9:30pm for a room for that night); was quoted $56., which was in the price range I was willing to pay.  After taxes, it was $61. There is valet parking, but I decided to park the car myself after checking in.  Why?  As I said in the beginning, if I used the parking garage, it would have been very expensive, so I parked on the street, knowing that I would be out early the next morning.  No problems with that.I would recommend this hotel &amp; would stay there again if I need to return to Baltimore.* I wrote this review for a friend (a 38 yr old single male) who stayed at the Inn At The Colonnade after attending a convention in Baltimore; however, he isn't ""into writing reviews"".  It's pretty much verbatim.if I could rate just the VALET portion of this, that's what i'm doing. This Valet department is a joke! The staff is rude, arrogant, unwilling to help, and CANT DRIVE! They parked my car, okay, they pulled it out, and took it against a pole! The guy gets out of the car denying he did anything, after I watched him do it claiming he thought it was the windshield wipers! WHATTTTT! Now here we are, two months later and this joke of a hotel is jerking me around of my money for the damage there guy did! I sent in a review to the corporate of the hotel and they are now jerking me around, stating they will send me a $75 gift card! WHAT?! How is that going to fix my car. They issued me a small portion of the money, but still owe me $350. The ""valet manager"" is now denying there was damage to my wheel. When the original paperwork report and night of incident, he took pictures of the wheel as well as documented damage on my wheel. I AM FURIOUS! What a joke! I went to the hotel for an event, not to stay. and I will never step foot in this hotel again! So, word of advice, if you come here to stay DONT VALET YOUR VEHICLE!","Of all the hotels my husband and I have stayed at over 26 years, we agreed that this hotel was the worst by far.  We were simply shocked at how small and outdated the room was. Overall SF of the room was perhaps 120FT?The bathroom had no vanity space. I had to put my makeup bag on top of the toilet.The bathroom had no towel rack.The entire bathroom, including the shower, was about 5'x7'?The shower curtain was ripped.There was 1 bath towel, 2 hand towels, 2 tip towels--I've never been to a Hilton where only 1 bath towel was provided. I saw other guests asking for additional towels at the Reception. I didn't know why until I got to the room.The closet was half the size of average hotel room closets.The telephone was from the 80's.There was only 1 free outlet in the entire room. I had to plug in my phone there and the IPad in the bathroom.The AC/Heater was so loud that we turned it off to get some peace and quiet.The hallways on the 2nd floor *HHonors floors was hideous and smelled ""old.""Instead of flowers, there was a sad looking unhealthy house plant on display near the elevator.The elevator was outdated and slow, subpar to what is available on the market.The flowers near the tour desk was literally dead and the water in the vase was completely depleted.They're  very lucky that the hotel is the closest chain hotel to Hopkins. Otherwise, I'm not sure how much business they'd get. I took pictures of the room and plan to post on Hopkins parents Facebook page, Expedia and other websites to never go to that facility unless they would like to experience a 1 or 2 star hotel room where they can see what claustrophobia feels like.  I was so disgusted that I really wanted to leave immediately. The only consolation was the friendly staff.  Sorry, but the  facility needs to be reevaluated by the Hilton Group.  It's time for an upgrade or set appropriate expectations with future guests. The Colonnade is a 1.5 or 2 star facility.Rooms are so so. The heating system is completely messed up, so the rooms are always cold. The only heat output in my room is in the bathroom, facing inwards (towards the shower).  In my experience the rooms are poorly lit too.Last night the smell of cigarette smoke started wafting into my room through the ventilation system, at one point it was quite strong. Probably some idiot smoking in their room, so not the hotel's fault, but it's a risk you take with shared HVAC.The biggest problem is lack of attention to detail. Instructions for how to use the business center printer were incorrect and incomplete. The front desk failed to properly validate my parking. In general the place is just really disorganized.Location is convenient to JHU, which is why people stay here.I probably won't stay here again next time I am in Baltimore even though it means a less convenient location to get to JHU.I would like to say this is a 3.5 rating by my standards. We were fortune to get a special using our AAA discount so the rate wasn't horrible. Parking was extra and pricey at that. Hotel is pretty big but our room was located near the elevator so it wasn't too inconvenient. Our room was fine, nothing super fancy but served our purposes well enough. I do remember the water jet features were broken and it was annoying since I wanted to take a bath. Oh well.The wi-fi is free provided you get the access code from concierge.   For our stay, the hotel was conveniently located enough since we had a rental car and were hitting different areas of the city. There is a coffee shop in the hotel for standard coffee and snacks. Another local coffee shop is outside the hotel about a 3 minute walk away. Would I stay here again? Well, if the rate was cheap- I might.The staff are friendly and helpful, giving me good first impression.The room is spatial but the decoration is a little old.The WiFi is the SLOWEST I've ever seen.  Never got a single email downloaded, not to speak streaming video.We came to Baltimore for a short vacation.  Choose this inn because it states there is a gym and pool.  I give it ONE STAR because the pool &amp; gym failed miserably.  I can't swim in the pool as first it was extremely dirty  (you basically can't see what's ahead).  Second, the depth of pool is so shallow that one basically can't swim in it.  I was utterly disappointed with the pool as well as how uninviting and weird the gym lay out is!I do like the spaciousness of the room but hated the air con system which automatically came off and on according to certain temp.  I felt warm and cold at times as the air came off through a small vent and as a result cause the loud sound. The hot water from the vanity sink is only working on the last day prior to our checking out.  Hated that it does not come with a fridge!  It is on rental though and will charge on daily basis.  What kind of hotel is that.  although on paper, it says car park cost $20 for hotel parking.   it automated deducted $24 when we drove out of the garage.  You are better off with off street parking which is free from 6pm till 10am.Use this hotel only for transit or if you are here for the meeting @ the John Hopkins university.The hotel was beautiful.  My room was great.  The staff at the hotel was hit and miss on if they were  friendly, or helpful or not.  The most helpful was darked skinned male that was very nice in greeting people and asking what they needed and was helpful in giving restaurant advice. Everyone else seemed like they didn't want to communicate.  There were several of us there for a conference and none of us got the cookie at check in, The double tree I stay at in California leaves the cookie or cookies in your room.  This one, I guess you are supposed to get it at the front desk.  When we asked about it, the woman, said ""we must have been out"" and didn't offer anything more.  Another unfriendly.The breakfast was very over priced, but it was onsite.  There was no diet coke in the soda machines or any available to buy in the hotel, which was sad.  Hotel entry = 5 starsHotel room = 4 starsHotel reception = 2 starsDiet coke availability = 1 starBreakfast = 2 starsOverall =  2.8DO NOT USE FOR EVENTS - They completely botched our wedding planning.  We pulled out and found another venue with 3 weeks before wedding.  Horrible management.  You have been warned!Overpriced!The rooms were comfortable however, the parking was expensive and there weren't very many options nearby as far as food goes.  The downtown area is about a 10 minute drive.My LSAT class used to meet here twice a week... Never went into the ractual hotel rooms but the conference rooms were either too hot or too cold... Also not the greatest experience to practice an LSAT test because the dividers are flimsy and you could hear EVERYTHING on the other side... Small bar/restaurant seemed pretty overpriced... ((shrugs shoulders))Spent five days at this hotel on a business trip. Good points: room was clean and bed quite comfortable, staff were helpful and friendly (except for the very snippy day guy at front desk, seemed annoyed to be asked anything tearing him away from gossip with his friends), and a nice location near Johns Hopkins. Negatives were the heating/AC which were extremely loud, too warm or too cool, had to shut it off and open the window, which was fine in the nice weather. The room was a bit narrow, and more importantly the shower is dangerous--not even a corrugated surface or bathmat on the slippery tub floor. The lobby is large and nicely appointed, but the rooms and HVAC system could certainly use a bit of remodeling.After trying to find a hotel around Baltimore for a few hours (conventions and college graduations made this very difficult) my road trip buddie and I ended up here after sharing our sob story with the Hampton Inn in Glenn Burnie (which was also sold out). While this was the only open room in the city on a Saturday night - it was also pretty expensive. Like $31 valet expensive - but what can you do when there's no street parking? I must say that the customer service was impeccable. From the valet, to check-in and check-out, each interaction with staff was pleasant. I especially enjoyed the trademark Double Tree cookie at check-in; it helped subside my grumpiness. The room was spacious, clean, and equipped with a very comfy bed. The bathroom was ""water-closet style"" - not ideal if you have a roomate. Brushing your teeth, washing your face, etc. happens in the room. While out of my usual price range, I would stay here again to be near John Hopkins and tour the university area when its not under construction.A disappointing property. The location is good, and the basic features are nice, but it's not well managed. The front desk staff is uniformly unfriendly.  The housekeeping staff, on the other hand, is very VERY friendly.   Some light fixtures in the room don't work &amp; tub barely drains, plus some lights out in hallways. Pool is cold and very limited hours; whirlpool is only lukewarm (broken temp sensor according to staff, so why don't they fix?). In-room thermostat is locked - seriously, WTF?I've stayed here 4-5 times in the last 10 years. Convenient to Hopkins and walking distance to a couple of decent restaurants. Rooms are okay, though last time we had a double bed instead of a booked queen/king (even though the hotel claimed it was a ""queen"" -- it was NOT!). The Alizee restaurant at the hotel was not bad; not great, but pretty decent. Less stuffy than the Polo that preceded it in the same location.We had a very nice and helpful waitress.The gym is small but nice: clean and functional. One problem was that the room wasn't cleaned one of the days. The front desk said it was because the do-not-disturb button was pressed. (This could've been the case). However, when we called at 5pm toask for the room to be made up, it took 2 more calls and 3 hours.In fact, no one came to make up the room but they just brought ussome toiletries and towels. (After 2 hours of waiting we had to sneaksome fresh towels out of the maids' closet).Excellent service!   Nice, clean, comfortable room.Great place to stay.  Only a few minutes from the downtown district.  Very nice place and free wifi.  The new Alizee restaurant is very posh as well.  Highly recommended.  We got just a regular room and it had a 37"" flat screen in it.  Only problem is parking.  Cost per day or get valet for $20.I  picked the Inn as it is conveniently located next to a a conference venue that I was going to attend in Baltimore in early June. I had a positive experience with the housekeeping staff and a very poor and unfriendly with the management.  Bottom line: the customer is not always right here.  The hotel is clearly geared for corporate business and large groups,  where the rate per nite is the most important thing. Do not expect  the attention to detail or the willingness to help you when things go wrong  that one can expect from other hotels in the area.  Google will point you to a few alternatives in the same areas of the Colonnade!The details: I had previously booked a room with the conference rate. I then calledasking the front desk if I could use a 'Livingsocial' coupon that for the same rate would add one free  breakfast and dinner. I was told that yes, it was possible. I then proceeded with the purchase.At the check in the financial manager refused to accept the coupon. I asked to talk with the Hotel manager, who the day after confirmed me that the coupon was subject to 'black out dates'. The Livingsocial contract said 'subject to availability' and the room was obviously available as I was in it! For fairness: the contract  also mentioned in the fine print to call an Hotel  number, but without saying that it was a direct line to the financial manager, NOT the normal boooking number that I instead used. That is a pretty fine print, I think. I was disappointed and  as  compromise I said I 'd not  take advantage of the free dinner option, and stressed that their staff had told me that that I could use the coupon instead of the conference rate.  The Hotel manager  said he could not help me in any way and refused to acknowledge any responsibility.Bottom line to save a few dollars, the hotel managers  were quite willing to have a customer (who acted in good faith) lose $300. Thankfully, Living Social was gracious and promptly refunded me the coupon. they are awesome, so at least I did not lose money on this misadventure.Details on the Hotel: - The room was advertised as smoke free, but it definitely smelled like somebody had smoked there before (yes, I could have asked to change room, but after the  cold  shoulder treatment received regarding the LivingSocial coupon, I could not be bothered). - The electric socket on the desk lamp where unsafe and sparked when I plugged in my laptop. Not cool. I called the  housekeeping manager and they fixed the problem pronto. Still, not something I expect from an expensive hotel.-The threadmill at the gym was broken and the safety  clips were not functional on several machines  (a maintenance crew was working on the threadmill  the second day of my stay though).Pleasant exterior and common rooms, but for the price this leaves a lot to be desired, e.g.   (1) The staff is not knowledgeable about anything in the area; (2) the airconditioning is set so that you cannot make it cool in the room to sleep--the unit actually cuts off if you set it below 69 degrees!This place has a good exterior, but the insides aren't quite as nice.  Nothing wrong with the place, but sometimes the window dressing isn't quite representative.  Nevertheless, it's the best thing I've found near Hopkins.",,,,"['many', 'warm', 'cookies', 'think', 'sold', 'must', 'consumed', 'cookies', 'night', 'staff', 'professional', 'nice', 'cookies',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-baltimore-downtown-baltimore-2,Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Downtown,3.0,$$,22,"If you've ever stayed at holiday inn express you know the quality of breakfast that you get. It's the same coast to coast and I love it. Biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, fruit, chiobani or activia yogurt, sausage, special k cereal or other kinds, bagels, cheese omelets, hot chocolate and the list goes on.  However this hotel has a great touch of history because it is an old bank. The lobby has tall marble columns and the vault is an office where they bake cookies haha. Check in/ out was easy. Only self parking available for $15/night and is very limited and on a first come first serve basis. The 4 star rating isn't for anything they can control its just a noisy area. Since you want a good night sleep when paying for a hotel I feel the 4 stars reflects that. There is a large homeless population on the block. Like tents and everything. Police sirens are constantly going off. The parking is charged at checkout. Staff is great and if you forget shaving cream or something they offer it for free. There is a 7-11 attached to the building which is great for late night munchies!I changed my review from a 4 star to 5 star after the front desk went above and beyond for me regarding a rental car issue.  (tire was flat and they brought the keys back inside the hotel after it had been repaired by roadside assist).This is a really unique and cool place as it used to be a bank and has a high atrium interior that is really pretty and the rooms are newly remodeled.  There is a little noise but that's to be expected because it's downtown.It is in the urban area of Baltimore, opposed to the more expensive rooms on the Harbor.  Some people may not be comfortable walking in the neighborhood at night. I didn't have any problems even at night and frequently walked around downtown and the area.  I was able to jog from the hotel to the harbor in about 10-15 minutes along the concrete trail by the river, it was pretty fun to see Little Italy along the way and some other cool places.The front desk was helpful and professional and I felt the price was very reasonable, about half the price of the harbor side hotels.  Parking was convenient and was able to find a spot each night although the lot was almost full.We got lucky on this one.  Apparently their hotel flooded on the floor we were to be on.  They were going to put us in a smaller room (for 5 people) and we asked about cots - which they have none, what hotel doesn't have cots?  I guess it was a good thing anyway.  We ended up getting a suite with a room connected and had a stairway shared with one other room.  The hotel was gorgeous inside.  The area though seemed kind of shady.  It felt so unsafe to keep our car in the lot.  I wouldn't walk out there alone at night!  10 minute walk to the Harbor if I may add.Our bathroom had a HUGE window as well as FOUR long windows in the room, with perfect black out curtains.  Two windows on one side of the room, and the other two windows looking INSIDE the hotel.Lighting I will say was HORRIBLE (in the night I mean) cause we obviously didn't need any during the day.Fridge was completely empty with tons of room in it to store food!Breakfast was great.  I thought it was continental it included pancakes, eggs, buiscuts, and more.The one thing that did disturb me was Church service on Sunday's.  It's in a room off the main lobby.  You can easily hear the bass from the microphone.  I'm not sure why they have service there but it should go.  It's unnesssary, and for people traveling, and late sleepers - I would not want to be woken up by that.After a long day of working, I finally checked into this hotel and went to sleep.  At about 3 or 4 in the morning I woke up and noticed roaches crawling on me.  And that is roaches. . . plural.  After screaming and changing my clothes, I went to the front desk to explain the problem.  The front desk person was kind and helpful and saw the still live roaches crawling around.  He offered me another room.  I transferred rooms and lo and behold the other room's bathroom had shaved off hair in the sink.  I called the front desk person again.  By this time, I was not willing to stay at this hotel any longer.  Word to the wise- if you have a problem in the middle of the night at an IHG hotel, it is very difficult to get in touch with customer service.  When I did, the representative started speaking to me about pricing for other hotels.  I feel that at that point, there should have only been offers to upgrade me to the best hotel room available in the city given that the two previous rooms I used at this current hotel were substandard.  The Holiday Inn I transferred to by the casino in Baltimore had a dirty mattress and dirty mattress pads but at 5 am, I couldn't fight with anyone anymore.  In addition,I was never compensated for the items I needed to leave behind in the room where I encountered the roaches.  The likelihood of me staying at a Holiday Inn every again . . . you can take a guess. Please note that waking up with roaches has never occurred prior to this hotel stay, nor subsequently nor do I have any infestation in my home.Recommended by Johns Hopkins as an affordable hotel while my dad was there  for surgery.  The hotel is a little run down and not in the best section of town.  But the staff was very accommodating, they had a good pet policy and the rooms, while not fancy, were comfortable.Parking is $12/day and the lot was always full on Sat and Sun.  There is free breakfast in the morning:  pancakes, eggs, bacon, cinnamon rolls, muffins, yogurt, etc.  The lobby is interesting and Art Deco.  There is a complimentary shuttle van that takes you to Johns Hopkins, Inner Harbor and other areas of town.  There is no dining in the hotel (besides breakfast) but the front desk staff gave me menus to nearby places that deliver.On the con side:  The area is sketchy (as most of the area near Johns Hopkins) and I was a bit nervous to dog walk late night.  Wifi was excruciatingly slow.  I probably wouldn't stay here for leisure travel (I like the Hilton in Inner Harbor much better)  but it was an affordable alternative for a longer term stay.The location of this facility is quite frankly not good. It's down the street from a rather seedy part of Baltimore and it is in a bit of a food desert - not much safely accessible restaurants nearby unfortunately. The building itself in situated in an old bank and has a great art deco theme to it. My first room they gave me appeared okay...until I opened the closet door and saw a cockroach skitter for cover. I immediately asked for another room. The front desk attendant at the time didn't really apologize or say anything to acknowledge the incident and seemed to not believe me. My next room looked okay on my cursory inspection but either that means I couldn't find the roaches or there were none there. The room was a nice king with a desk and large LCD TV. After that start, the rest was very good. The breakfast isn't gourmet but is diverse and filling with plenty of coffee to get your day started. Free newspapers in the lobby was a nice touch too. The hotel shuttle provides great door-to-door service to JHU; do note that for pick-ups you may have to wait up to 40 minutes (like me during traffic). Most of the front desk staff (other than the 1 guy above) are very nice and helpful.Clean and spacious single bed rooms. Friendly front desk people. Nice variety for breakfast the following morning. Very reasonable week day pricing considering the location although the Orioles weren't in town so that may have something to do with it. Location could be better but too late now. Definitely would stay again!Tiny rooms. I had a suite but it was smaller than most regular rooms. The king size bed was almost a foot less tgan a real King bed and staff kept on insisting that is what the hotels call a king. Crmaped, outdated. Too bad, since its in an old bank and lobby could be so nice.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention the unsecure parking lot and the homeless people who hang outside the place. Lovely combo, but you are near the highway....well literally right beside/underneath the highway.You know those HIX commercials, yeah, well, its not based on this place!The hotel lobby is architecturally beautiful and the rooms are updated and comfortable.  Housekeeping needs to be told what you need or you may run out of important little things like toilet paper but the hotel itself is clean and comfortable.The staff was friendly and helpful and went out of their way to be accommodating. The hotel only gets 2 stars because despite the above it feels fundamentally unsafe.  The poorly lit parking lot had homeless people in it every time we walked through.  The immediate neighborhood for 3-4 blocks in all directions is filled with homeless beggars and derelicts.  It is a short walk from the inner harbour and we did the walk during the day but we were harassed for money during the walk as we got close to the hotel.  The hotel has a shuttle service and if you stay there and use it you will likely have a lovely time.  The holiday inn on Lombard street was less expensive and a better location.I recommend this hotel for people who need an affordable place to stay with first class service and comfort. I'm giving the Holiday Inn Express 4 stars for many reasons. 1) They are good neighbors and welcoming to all. Online, people had complained about the ""homeless"" they saw near the hotel. I was pleased to read the hotel's response, which was detailed and defended their neighborhood. They noted that being ""misfortunate"" doesn't mean dangerous. The response sounded like they were a neighborhood business, rather than a chain. I was so impressed with that. Kudos!2) Front desk service is exceptionally sharp and helpful. I thought the staff was amazing and made me excited to be visiting Baltimore. 3) Free Continental breakfast and newspapers in lobby. That's becoming a rarity nowadays.I had a few problems in that they tested the sprinkler system for what seemed an interminable time. But I had been warned in advance about that. How can I complain about safety tests. That's better than dying in a fire.Very good service and extremely polite. Our room was spotless and the free breakfast in the morning was very nice. Great for my girlfriend and I to just have a place to rest after a concert out in Baltimore one night. Not the best area but overall we were satisfied!Got stuck here in Baltimore seeing doctors so they recommended that we stay here at the Holiday Inn Express. If I were driving and not taking their shuttle, I really could have easily missed this place. I was really quite stunned (in a good way and not in a I got tasered way) when I walked in. The lobby looks like a fancy hotel lobby. The person was quite nice at the text to help us check in and such. I found it to be very clean and welcoming. They have a free shuttle service that takes you to where you want to go at the top of the hour and picks you up from a reasonable distance at every half hour. You will have to call the front desk to let them know you intend on using the shuttle. The rooms are actually quite cozy. The 2 we were in were awkwardly designed with a small hallway that you had to walk down inside the room before you got to the actual beds. Not very spacious but enough to be comfortable. If you plan on staying, order from Mo's Seafood. They deliver and they are a great seafood restaurant!For Johns Hopkins affiliates, they have a $89.99 special so make sure to mention that.Having never been to Baltimore and wanting a place near Inner Harbor...I enlisted Hotwire to find a hotel, and I actually got a great deal!  Pulling into the parking lot, I was a bit skeptical.  The property backs to kind of a shady neighborhood...but hey, at least they have parking on-site ($12 per day).  We entered through the side entrance (which appears to double as a bus stop).  Walking through the door, you're immediately slapped in the face with the smell of lemon.  The lobby (an old bank)  is absolutely gorgeous!  The front desk was accommodating as we checked in early.  The room was super clean, quiet, modern, and came equipped with a fridge.The hotel was just a short walk away from Inner Harbor.  During the evening, we opted for the free hotel shuttle service which dropped us off in Midtown.  Although the conversation (keep your eye out for my upcoming memoir, ""10 Things You Hope No Person Ever Says To You"") was a tad on the creepy side...it beats paying $10 in cab fare.I can't comment on the breakfast buffet because the trip was cut unexpectedly short.  What I can say is that Hotwire has a HORRIBLE cancellation policy!A suitable hotel in a poor part of town.  There are three times as many rooms as there are parking spaces so arrive early!.  Parking is $12 per night and if you miss out one of the 20-odd spots, you're on the street.  The view out our window was of the lovely Juvenile Justice Center which provided some good people watching (in conjunction with the ""takeout"" shop across the street.)  The hotel itself is in an old bank, leading to an impressive lobby area.  The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was spacious and clean.  The pillows were really nice as well, a mix of firm and soft, which is hard to find in this type hotel.  So all in all, its a good hotel, affordable, less than 10 minutes from Johns Hopkins, with a shuttle that runs to and from, but I wouldn't stay here again unless I were visiting the hospital again (which hopefully doesn't happen.)Wonderful clean rooms, few issues tho. The staff for the most part are friendly and helpful. The incidentals are RIDICULOUS. $100 is a bit steep, I'm not responsible for what other people have done so the story of people breaking rules has 0 to do with me. Beware parking is $12 per day. You won't find anywhere free so don't waste your time, unless it's between 6PM - 8AM. It's not the best area but it is nice, and the price is decent besides that incidental mess.Stayed at this boutique hotel for over a MONTH while my husband was at Johns Hopkins for a very serious condition. Let me say, you get to know people very well in that extended time frame &amp; the staff was consistently incredible! Erica, James, Tina, Letitia, Kevin, Justin, Mark &amp; all those whose names I'm forgetting -- you guys rock!On to the assorted travel-type details --  lobby's architecture of this converted bank is gorgeous &amp; adds interesting character. Rooms are comfortable with well appointed amenities like micro, fridge, coffee maker, blow dryer, lotions/potions, etc. I had no trouble with the free Wi Fi on access or speed. Bedding includes both soft &amp; firm pillows. The free breakfast offered is more than just the usual continental selection. There are restaurants which deliver or you can dine out near the harbor. Free shuttle to JH Hospital &amp; other areas within a mile of the hotel. Didn't use their parking, but parking is scarce so it's nice they offer it &amp; $12 is reasonable. Surrounding area is a typical downtown -- some blocks are upscale, others not. But if your circumstance puts you in DT Baltimore for Johns Hopkins you will be well taken care of by that hospital AND by the kind, caring &amp; professional staff at this Holiday Inn Express!I can understand Alpa V.'s frustrations; I wouldn't want to be caught with extra charges for nights I didn't stay. I hope everything works out and I hope it's a once off error with this hotel.My stay at this hotel has been pleasant so far. I am staying here for 2 weeks for Hopkins Winter Institute. The place is certainly a step or two up from Motel 6 and others like it. There is a modern feel to the room. The rooms have microwaves and a small refrigerator if you need to store anything. The hotel serves basic but reasonable warm breakfast including eggs, sausage, toast, biscuits, french toast and danishes. I certainly think they are better than many I've stayed at. There is a gym at the basement which is accessed by the room key. The hotel is new and the staff is pleasant.I think it's definitely worth looking at if you want to stay in the St Paul, Charles Street area. It is about 15 minutes walk to Hopkins if you want  to go it on foot. Pretty decent for the price.Eh...not sure what to say here, it's okay. Being located in a less than desirable portion of town was the first thing I noticed. Being from NH and frequenting Boston, I guess I was expecting something a bit different from the area. There's plenty of food in close proximity to the hotel, but I for one would not be comfortable walking anywhere from this hotel. I'm not saying it's not safe, but I just didn't get that vibe from what I'm typically used to.The hotel itself is clean, modern and nice. It has free Wi-Fi which seemed spotty and I opted to hardwire to get better speeds. The view out my window of the Baltimore Juvenile Justice Center is a cute twist since there wasn 't much of a view of the downtown area. The staff here was friendly and easy to work/deal with. The temperature controls worked well and actually kept the room comfortable, not too hot or cold which seems to be my luck in hotels.The bedding was comfortable although I wasn't a huge fan of the pillows...they just weren't the right height for my head and had a hard time manipulating them so they were.All in all, I like the hotel, but the location would have made a massive difference if I could have walked to a pub for a couple drinks.I stayed here in March for one night after I got a great deal through Hotwire.  It isn't in the best area, and I would not suggest young ladies walk around there alone, but it is maybe a 10-minute walk to the downtown harbor area, and maybe 5 of those minutes are in a shady part of town.The hotel staff were friendly, the breakfast was tasty, the room was clean and comfortable.  For night before a cruise, it was perfect, though I would not suggest staying there for longer than a night or two, just because the location isn't ideal.We stayed two nights in early July, and it's a pretty standard Holiday Inn Express with the standard amenities.  Something that I found odd, the staff that maintains the breakfast bar walks around and talks to the guests for prolonged periods of time while they're eating.  Overall I'm satisfied with my stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.","Boy was this area ghetto! Despite the unsatisfactory location, the hotel was pretty nice. Everything was clean and in great shape, and housekeeping was very friendly and amiable (even more so than the front desk!). The fitness room is a joke with only 3 machines, all of which are ""Hotel Fitness"" brand and pretty much falling apart. The rooms are equipped with a microwave and fridge which is great, and the complimentary breakfast definitely saved me a lot of money on having to eat out. It's nothing special though, with the same old microwave eggs and fake bacon.I would avoid for two reasons:1. It is not in a very good location (only to get to the stadiums, but not the city)2. The staff is not helpful at all (they neglected to properly check me out when I left so my credit card kept getting charged- even though I booked for 1 night only with hotwire. They refused to fix the problem and I am currently having to deal with credit card disputes.Stay away. Much better options are available and you'll be happy you spent the extra $10-20!",,,,"['ever', 'holiday', 'inn', 'express', 'know', 'quality', 'breakfast', 'coast', 'coast', 'love', 'biscuits',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-brexton-baltimore,Hotel Brexton,3.0,$$,30,"- Great staff and comfy room.- Having no fridge or microwave was a downside but I could go down in the kitchen &amp; use it there. - Spiral staircase is beautiful and enjoyed quirky art works displayed in the hall way. I liked wooden floors &amp; high ceilings.- Was a little disappointed bc there was no bathtub but shower box.- Close to light rail and Charm City shuttle- Free breakfastThis is a very nice and dainty hotel! It was built in 1810, but remodeled in 2010 from the interior. My husband and I loved the look of it, although the restroom is too damn cold to shower in this time of year lol! It seems like there is cold air going into the restroom area instead of warm. We loved the convenience of the location. About two miles from the harbor ($5-8 lyft cost) and another two miles to own stationThe bed was also tiny! It did not look like a queen size, more like a full size mattress. My husband is 6'1"" and I am 5'6"", so we were quite uncomfortable, but we made it work. If we were to come back to Baltimore, we would definitely stay at the hotel again, but request a king size bed. Staff was amazing and extremely nice! Also, complimentary continental breakfast :)The entire hotel is gorgeous. Beautiful big windows, very comfortable beds, and lovely details. Furthermore, the staff is helpful and very professional. You won't find much better for this price in any urban area. The location is about 10 minutes from Fell's Point nightlife by car, and very close to the new restaurants and bars popping up on Charles St. And free parking!My husband and I stayed here for our mini-moon. Spent almost $900 dollars for our two night stay and the room was in horrible condition. I stepped on a beer bottle cap, there was no fridge (it looked like it was removed), stuff was broken in the bathroom, and there were stains on the bed. Not to mention they gave us two double beds instead of a king like I requested. The manager said they would give me a free two night stay, but I have yet to receive my voucher. I wouldn't stay here again.My boyfriend and I stayed here for our one night visit, and had a great time. We absolutely loved the big open windows! Granted there was not much of a view besides the gay bar across the street, but it gave us plenty of natural light during the day. Front desk is friendly and offers sound advice on where to explore. The location is sort of away from all the chaos of inner harbor which wasn't bad for us either. It is only a mile away. You can access the free trolley from here to take you down to inner harbor too. That is only a couple of blocks away for you to hop on if you choose not to drive. Hotel Brexton has only 29 rooms. I don't know if you would really consider this a boutique hotel even though it is not part of a chain. I would think it has its own little identity. It is not super upscale, but it is not low quality by any means. It is a simple place. The rooms are designed with a modern touch in a restored historical building. I think my biggest complaint was the noise level. You can't here anyone in the building itself, but conversation outside can be heard clear as day. I think it was primarily because of where our window was situation as previously mentioned and being on the 3rd floor. Though I should point out that noise we did here was only brief and it didn't last long. Otherwise, it was very quiet and relaxing.Price is reasonable. You can get some deals if you look on some the exterior hotel booking websites versus booking direct. Just be warned though if you do book from a third party, you won't be able to refund your money like you could if you did book directly with the hotel. Rates may be different though with one compared to the other per usual.Breakfast consists of bagels, select cereals, and fruit served from 7am-10am daily, respectively. Nothing hot. Breakfast is found on the bottom floor with a small kitchen area.You win some you lose some. Here is a total win if you like something unique and different.We booked a block of rooms here for our wedding. OMG EVERYONE IS SO NICE AND EVERYTHING IS SO CLEAN. It rained during our wedding and the general manager (Bob) drove folks around for us. I couldn't have asked for a better place. They allow dogs for cheap so our little guy chihuahua could be at the ceremony. I just love this place. I only have one wish, that there was free wifi, but other than that, this is just a perfect place with wonderful people. Terrell, the other manager #gem. Pat, another person who worked at the front desk #lovely. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.Pros- Nice-looking historic building.- Helpful staff, made good local dining and transportation recommendations.- clean lobby and room.Cons- less than desirable location- slow, small, stuffy elevator- noisy room - mostly from the AC unit and neighboring rooms.- tiny shower.- charged us $20 for 3 days of Wifi when they had a price listed of $10 for 48 hours, which is what we requested. We stayed 3 nights but only wanted 2 days of wifi, but they wouldn't allow that.- the breakfast is a joke - lousy toaster, mushy bananas, and warm milk for the cereal.I stayed overnight.  It was ok  I gave it 3 stars because the staff provided excellent customer service.Very disappointing Hotel. No night lighting to help you find the hotel. Very limited on street parking. watermarked furniture and peeling walls leave much to be desired. The architecture itself is very intriguing but the hotel is a disappointment. The breakfast bar was mini cupcakes and cereal and bagels.  a loose runner in the hall nearly caused a fall. The smallest elevator ever. Musty smell in the room. Steep stairs to the front door that you have to be buzzed in to day or night.My husband and I stayed here for one night only and really enjoyed it. Hotel Brexton is a beautiful and historical on the outside and modern on the inside. It's a really small hotel with only 29 rooms. We were in a king room. Room is spacious and so is the bathroom. There is a coffee maker, but no fridge or microwave (there is a microwave in the basement). Everything was clean, we felt really comfortable. We paid 91$ for a king room in January, breakfast included. They put a 50$ hold on the credit card. We got it back in a week, but didn't like that. I read that some people paid for the wifi, but they gave us the password with no extra charge. There is a free parking in front of the hotel, but it's limited. The breakfast is served in the basement area. Bagels, cereals, yogurt, some fruits, basic stuff. There is a coffee machine available at all times. Cappuccino, espresso, french vanilla, hot chocolate...    A lot of options, all the good stuff. Overall, we were happy with our stay in Hotel Brexton, would definitely recommend.It's a historic hotel and it looks lovely on the outside.  However, it is too small for me to be able to like it.  The elevator could barely fit two people.  The halls are narrow. The bathroom is so small you cannot turn around in it.  A person with disabilities or an older person with mobility problems would hate this place.  I don't think a wheelchair can fit into the elevator and there are lots of stairs everywhere.  I think the limit of space made the updating of the inside challenging.  The room had a noisy A/C unit located above the door to the hallway.  Closets are not in the wall but cabinets that take up space in the room that I would have appreciated having.  The bed was comfortable and my room was quiet.Parking is a challenge.  Another resident was complaining bitterly to me.  I paid $25 for one of two slots on the side street, which was very odd and very cramped.  The street is tough to find at night.  Lots of hidden fees and nothing is given away for free.Stayed here this past weekend.  Got a great deal through Hotwire.  The hotel itself is beautiful and nicely designed on the outside.  The renovated rooms are nice, a solid 3 stars.  I find our room on the 2nd floor to be spacious and comfortable, bathroom is simple and nice, but I did wish the shower was bigger, or may be a tub.  Parking is a challenge if you choose to do street parking, but I opted for the reserved parking which guaranteed me a spot, that was nice.   The area itself is quiet, but like a lot of parts in Baltimore, there are some questionable characters roaming around especially late at night.  There is a Rite Aid and a 7-11 that you could walk to (within a block or two), so that was very convenient.  The hotel is about 3 miles from inner harbor so it's rather nice to be away from all of that.  I checked out the continental breakfast, but chose to go to The Bun Shop down the street instead as they had some great coffee and tea, as well as pastries, and they're open 7am-3am.AC didn't work.  Poor assistance at front desk.  Despite the cute setting, I Would not stay here again.  I did not feel cared for at allTechnically this is a 4 1/2 star review, but I'm rounding up because my stay was so thoroughly delightful.Pros: LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! everything (and I mean everything) you could want or need is near -- drug store to  7-11 to fancy brunch to dive bar to bespoke sex toys to free Inner Harbor bus. Also steps from Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and a quick cabride from the Amtrak Station. Latenight munchies are are within (drunk) walking distance. Easy parking right out front.  Keurig Machine in the room.  SUPER CHEAP BARGAIN.The room itself was light and roomy. no funny smells. Bathroom was modern and shiny w/ fluffy towels. Bedding was a solid B+ and the lighting was better than average. Super nice staff, free quicky breakfast.Cons: Some of the furniture was unfortunate. no restaurant.  The TV required an MIT degree to understand. Thankfully, my traveling companion fit the bill.We stayed at the Hotel Brexton for one night while visiting family in the area. To decide whether this is a good hotel for you, you should understand what the Brexton is and what it is not. If you are looking for a clean, spacious, decently priced room in a convenient, but less touristy area, the Brexton is a good choice. If you are looking for a luxury hotel experience with plenty of amenities, or need a hotel with large public areas or want to be in the center of the city's activity, you will probably be disappointed.We paid for the internet and parking package. The hotel has 4 spaces in front that are first-come-first-served, and 4 in an adjacent courtyard that are reserved for those choosing the parking package. We found it worth the extra $30 for the peace of mind of having a space waiting for us at night (plus included internet, which is otherwise $10). The building is old, but quirky and charming. It has been nicely renovated and is clean and well kept. Our room on the 5th floor was oddly shaped in an interesting way, but spacious and spotless. The large bathroom was updated. The bed was extremely comfortable. There was a well placed flat screen tv hanging from the ceiling. Service was friendly. We skipped the provided continental breakfast and the staff at the front desk recommended a nearby restaurant where we could get a full breakfast. When we returned, she seemed genuinely interested in whether we had enjoyed our meal. All in all, we had a fine stay, and found the Hotel Brexton to be a good base for enjoying Baltimore.I have never had worse customer service at a hotel.  I called to reschedule my reservation and the person on the other end of the phone refused to be of assistance. He stated that my card had already been charged and that there was nothing else he could do. With this, we wanted to cancel the reservation and again we were told that there was nothing that could be done. All told, I was billed for a single nights stay that I didnt even use. I wasnt even in the same state to be able to use it. When I told the customer service rep that I did not approve of the charges he informed me that I would need to take the issue up with my credit card company...can you believe that? I asked him if I could speak with his manager and he said that I would have to call back the next day.  If you want to be treated like dirt then ripped off then be my guest and try to stay here.When planning my trip to Baltimore, I was torn between staying at a big name chain hotel, or Hotel Brexton.  I'm so glad I made the right choice by staying in this unique and adorable hotel, in a beautiful and historic building.  The neighborhood is quiet but charming, and there is plenty to do within walking distance or picking up the free bus that takes you right to Inner Harbor.  The staff were extremely helpful and friendly throughout our stay, and we had no complaints about our room (seriously, who cares if the furniture is ""cheap"").  If you are looking for something with a little more charm and character than the big name hotels that are the same in every city, I recommend staying at Hotel Brexton!Awesome place. Rooms are immaculate and it's in a great area of town. First time staying in Baltimore and so glad I picked this place. Staff are very friendly. Don't be put off by outside it's an historic building. Once inside you can see that the owners have put an lot of money into this place. If you are glbt the this is an perfect location for the nightlife.Staying in the hotel Brexton tonight. Unfortunately I think I had a guest below me that was unreasonable. I ordered a pizza for my wife and I. When the front desk called me they let me know my food was here,and we had a noise complaint for a lot of noise from the room below. The only thing I can think of is when I moved my suitcase from the bed to floor(which I admit banged loudly) that was all,one bang. I really can't believe I got a complaint. If anyone had came up to listen they would have maybe heard our TV on,that was all. The hotel is nice,and the girl at the desk was nice but that was all, one noise. The front desk should really check out these claims of noise to see if it's happening,before they confront a guest.  I read bad reviews of the hotel that seemed ridiculous(but checked it out for myself) guess I'll just believe what everyone says from now on without seeing for myself.thats what the front desk does.Our stay here was fine. There are some nice things about this place and some not-so-nice things. The neighborhood doesn't seem great. It's also not close to a lot of the attractions we wanted to see, such as the Walters museum and the National Aquarium. The hotel is a historic landmark, and it is still beautiful and looks historic on the outside, but when they restored the inside, they really didn't maintain any of the hotel's former historic charm. The furniture looks like any other generic hotel furniture - they could have at least tried to keep the place in character. On the plus side, the room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. As another reviewer mentioned, they have Keurig machines in the rooms, and there's 24-hour access to the breakfast room in the basement, where there's a fancy coffee machine that makes all kinds of espresso drinks and hot chocolate. Breakfast was complimentary and was fine. They had bagels, some fruit, cereal, OJ, and some pastries. The woman working at the concierge desk was friendly and helpful. Some people on here have said they had to pay for WiFi, but it was free when we were there. You just had to call the front desk and ask for the code. Maybe that's new? Anyway, like I said, the stay was fine, but it wasn't as special as we were hoping it would be, given the history of the building. On past visits to Baltimore, we've stayed at the historic Admiral Fell Inn in Fell's Point, and I think we'll go back to staying there next time.","I paid $125.99/night for a Wed-Sat in late October.Pros: The room was clean and the bed and bedding was comfortable. There was very little noise from outside or from other guests. The building has been beautifully restored.Cons: cheap Ikea furniture -- the lamp was falling apart, the veneer surface on the nightstands was blistered and peeling, etc. Room smelled of bleach because of the 'bleach bomb' in the toilet. Why does a toilet cleaned everyday need a tank bomb? There are towels for two, but only one coffee cup and one drinking glass. The property is handicap accessible, but to get to the ramp, you go through the dining area on the lower level, not the lobby. For my disabled father, it felt like going through a service entrance. I'm finding that poor handicap access is the norm all over, though. They advertise 'Wine and Cheese Receptions', but it turns out only on Wednesday. The confirmation email said there was free bottled water, but the bottles had big price tags on them. No newspaper (website says there is). Not that I care that much, its just that they mislead on these little details. The breakfast was fine, but not as fancy as their menu makes it sound; basic fruit and store-brand breads and cereal.Street parking is scarce, so you will probably have to pay $25 extra for one of their reserved spots around the corner. They charge $20 for internet.  The really annoying thing is the $50 per night 'block' they put on your credit card when you check in. Not for incidentals, and not a new $50 block a day either; a full $400 block on my card. I hear this is common practice in Las Vegas, but at a boutique hotel in Baltimore? Am I wrong? Do many hotels do this (i.e. via taking your cc number for incidentals) and I just never noticed? In any case, the message it sends is, ""Although you (pre) paid for your stay through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>, we still think you might trash the room."" When I registered my displeasure, the hotel clerk was condescending, and told me is was standard procedure. It was insulting. Summary: good for a decent night's sleep, but it is run more like a chain budget motel than like the first-class boutique hotel they claim to be.LivingSocial customers are not the only ones Hotel Brexton refuses to accommodate. Having purchased tickets to see Louis C.K. at nearby Meyerhoff Symphony Hall on New Year's Eve, I booked a room for two via <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hotels.com&amp;s=70d850fdc4458a46625a5a76abcd95c831c5ea1da5084a75ec745d8c83781a62"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> six months in advance. I received an e-mail confirmation immediately after, and another on Thursday, December 27 (this one saying explicitly, ""You don't need to call to reconfirm."")When we showed up on what was supposed to be the night of our stay, we were told that they'd had some ""unexpected overstays,"" and that they'd instead booked me a place at a Doubletree hotel two miles away, and relatively removed from any bars, restaurants, stores, or anything else of note. I should note here that we were lied to about how far away the Doubletree was, and also about the circumstances of our relocation: the hotel manager tried to get in touch with us repeatedly, it was claimed; our phone and e-mail records tell a different story.The whole point of our reserving a room at Hotel Brexton was that it was within walking distance of the show we'd already paid to see. Instead, we had to waste money (not to mention compete fiercely with hordes of other fares -- it was New Year's) to take cabs from place to place. A minor inconvenience, certainly -- but that's not the point. If a reservation made so far in advance is treated with the same disdain as LivingSocial customers apparently are, then whose reservations are secure, exactly? Unacceptable. Avoid.Great night in a historic building in a convenient spot, the staff was pleasant, the room clean, the breakfast was small but sufficient, building was quiet.  The furniture was worn, but clean and usable.  All in all a nice place for a decent price, I would go again.I stayed there with my girlfriend on a last minute decision because everything was booked. Wow a great surprise to see this beautiful hotel. Service was excellent, rooms where very well kept . The staff takes great pride in there establishment . Close to all activities , dining, clubs etc.......... I would definitely stay there againThe CEILINGS of hotel rooms at Hotel Brexton, apparently, are PAPER THIN because you can HEAR EVERY SOUND, step, thump, bounce, drop, laugh and tip-toe of guests upstairs. No kidding: if nightly PEACE and QUIET is a priority for your hotel experience, then DO NOT STAY HERE.  I am a really, really tolerant and experienced traveler and, despite my tendency never to voice a complaint, surprisingly I had to call downstairs TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW to notify hotel staff about this problem. The first night, the thundering noise continued until 4 am, even after the front desk informed me that the upstairs guests had been asked to stop making noise. The second night I assumed the same noisy guests must be stomping around upstairs but, surprisingly, I was informed by the front desk that ANOTHER GUEST had checked in. The only conclusion I can reach, then, is that THE INCESSANT ECHOING NOISE FROM UPSTAIRS isn't the result of inconsiderate guests but, rather, the hotel must have REALLY LOUSY SOUNDPROOFING, REALLY LOUSY ACOUSTICS.  On top of that, while I regret to pile on, the hotel only has parking for maybe 4-6 vehicles. Plan on not being able to park in front of this hotel. I had to circle numerous blocks around the hotel both nights in order to find public street parking -- giving me little confidence that I wouldn't find my rental car towed (or worse) when I searched to find it the next morning. Location is great but ""Meh"" is right. Unless you have relatively moderate lodging standards, this hotel has unfulfilled potential at almost every level.Tried for three months to book with our LivingSocial and even said we would pay more for their ""premium"" room and not only did it end with a null response but we returned our LivingSocial deal which involved them calling the hotel and confirming that they would not let us book. We read up and there was a complaint about the same thing. The owner even told us he was tired of dealing with the LivingSocial people of which whom he signed up with in the first place. I was very frustrated even after offering to pay extra. The owner said it would be %50 a night more and we agreed and when we tried to book with that he wouldn't let us book even then after we agreed to the extra money for the ""premium"" room. Not a well run business and I can't imagine it being nice to even go too. With such rude owner/clientele I would never suggest this place nor go there.Charming boutique hotel in the heart of Mount Vernon.  As a Baltimorean looking for a place to stay for a few days while a condo was being renovating, I stumbled upon the Hotel Brexton doing a quick internet search.  The hotel is in a historic building, in a great location and reasonably priced.  I paid $119 for a weekend and $125 for the weekend, including breakfast.  The price included on-street parking in front of the building.  Our room, on the fourth floor was quite large, with a spacious bathroom (in the turrett section of the building which provided great angles).  It's walking distance to the City Cafe and neighborhood bars - with a Starbucks a few blocks away.  Would absolutely reccomend to any out-of-town guests - or even for a hometown stay-cation.My stay at the Hotel Brexton was pleasant.  My bf and I arrived late, around 2am, and check-in was no problem.  The meters out front are free on the weekends, so no need to worry about searching for parking or if the lot is full.  The complimentary coffee and continental breakfast in the morning was definitely appreciated.  Two things to note though.  We were staying on the 1st floor and since the hotel is an old townhouse, the noise abatement between the walls and the floors above has something to be desired.  We could hear guests moving around as early as 6:30am.  Also, there is no central air and the air conditioner in our room was not very powerful.  The room was a little stuffy.  Overall, these were minor inconveniences in a overall very nice stay.  I would definitely visit again.the pros---walking distance from the Amtrak station and Joseph Meyerhoff Hall (we took the train from VA to see Louis CK on New Years eve). so the location was perfect.-we arrived 2 hours before check-in and they had a room ready for us for no extra charge. awesome!-K-Cup coffee maker in the room, can't go wrong.-very friendly desk staff.-Beautiful historical building.-they let us check out late (our train wasn't until 3pm) for a fee.the cons---WIFI COSTS $10!!!! (for 48 hours) you're kidding me? even motel 6 and super 8 have free wifi. the amtrak train i took to baltimore had free wifi. i paid $120 a night and i have to pay for wifi? that is insane beyond words for 2013. seriously. c'mon now.-not a very lively neighborhood. maybe because it was new years, but the area was dead. no restaurants were really open or seemed to exist without walking several blocks.-cheap furniture was bubbled and worn because of the coffee maker. there is no pitcher to put water in it, so water dribbles on the counter, since it's particle board, it just dissolves. cheap! i would expect a hotel that costs from 120-150 a night to have nicer furniture and showers/sinks.-their TV is hooked up to DirecTV box which was literally falling off the wall, just dangling by wires. the tv had been set to another input, so i had to fiddle with the input to get the tv signal, also the remote didn't control the tv (input or volume). hell, i don't even let my home tv get this disorganized. it's a simple thing that the customers shouldn't have to reconfigure the tv to get it to work.-buffet in the morning is just like super 8 motel. cold cereal, bagels and pastry from the grocery store. they have a big, fake espresso machine thingy, but honestly the coffee in our room was better. food quality could be stepped up just a little bit to make a big difference. felt like a youth hostel.overall it was a medium experience for what is supposed to be a higher end hotel. glad it was so close to the train and performance but i've had better experiences at cheaper places.The Hotel Brexton is a major ripoff.  I bought a 2 night stay with the only restrictions being no holidays, but when I tried to book it 5 months before it expired I found out that it is impossible to make a reservation on a weekend.  The only nights available were Sunday - Thursday.  The Hotel Brexton oversold the deal, limited the number or rooms available and was unwilling to accommodate people who bought their vouchers.  When I contacted Living Social they said there is nothing they can do and they are ""aware that many people were not able to book rooms at the Hotel Brexton before the expiration date"".  Yet, they continue to do business with the Hotel Brexton by continuing to sell getaway deals for them even though Living Social knows that Hotel Brexton doesn't honor the deals that are sold.  This is a major ripoff and there are many more reputable hotels in Baltimore that would not steal money from unsuspecting people and give them nothing in return.  Stay away!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-inn-at-hendersons-wharf-an-ascend-hotel-collection-member-baltimore,"The Inn at Henderson's Wharf, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5.0,$$$,28,"My boyfriend and I came down to Baltimore for a spontaneous weekend trip and a friend had recommended to stay in the Fells Point area. So glad we found this place, as it helped to make our weekend wonderful. Some of the highlights included:1. front desk/staff: kind, helpful, and even let us check in a few hours earl2. parking: easy, across the street, and only $10 for the day3. location: on the water; our room was garden view which was wonderful because it was private, quiet, and still had a beautiful view4. room: decor was perfect for a cozy bed and breakfast feel; bed was so comfortable it was hard to convince ourselves to get out of bed the next morning; the only downside was the hot water situation- you have to wait awhile after one person takes a shower to have hot water again5. extras: did not check out the gym, but the breakfast was wonderful, the wine down was a wonderful addition (as was the night cap), and the free starbucks coffee was a nice touch as wellOverall, fabulous stay and cannot wait to come backThis is an intimate hotel in one of the oldest neighborhoods in Baltimore. The rooms are spacious and beautiful with wood plantation shutters and exposed brick. Some rooms face the water. The view is pretty. Be aware if you have a water view, you may hear people (early morning joggers, late night dog walkers, etc). Some rooms face an interior court yard which is very tranquil.I found the bed very comfortable although my companion would have liked it more firm. And I think that is the only negative thing either of us would say about our stay. The staff is amazing. They are nice and attentive. There is a night cap station for drinks and roasting marshmallows for smores.The Inn at Henderson's Wharf is touted as Baltimore's best hostelry.  This title is ridiculous and I don't know what folks are talking about.Located in Fell's Point, directly on the water, Henderson's admittedly has a fantastic location.  All the rooms are on the first floor, and while privacy can be an issue, the views are fab.  Alas, we had a courtyard room, but took advantage of the lovely boardwalk running along the hotel.  This is where the good ends.  While the rooms are large, they are dated, and not everything works well.  Our bathroom sink backed up, the bed was lumpy, and the TV was missing a bunch of channels.Storage in the bathroom was non-existent as the cabinetry didn't open, a ludicrous design flaw.  Walls are thin, and noise carries.  We heard every voice in the hallway and every door close.  The room was not cleaned well, and debris discovered on the bathroom floor the first day remained through the third day.  The gym in the hotel has dated and worn equipment and is not the cleanest.Service is supposed to be a hallmark of this hotel and you are charged nine dollars and change daily for the honor.  I didn't get the big deal.  Butler service consisted of a couple of cups of coffee in the morning and shoe shines.  However, if you don't explicitly ask for it, you get nothing.  Free ($9 and change daily) breakfast is okay, consisting of beverages, pastries, fruit and yogurt, but no hot items.  There is a coffee maker in the room.  Nightcap service consists of a few bottles of Grand Mariner left out on a table. The folks working the check-in desk were not overly warm or helpful.  Their affect was competent. Fells Point has tons of good bars and mediocre restaurants.  You are a 15 to 20 minute walk from the Inner Harbor neighborhood where the better restaurants are located.  If you have meetings at the convention center, it's a 8 to 10 dollar Uber or taxi ride away.  I walked it in about 30 minutes.  Downtown Baltimore is not salubrious, and you are better off staying in one of the close by neighborhoods of Little Italy, Inner Harbor, Fells Point, or Federal Hill.  Baltimore comes alive in these neighborhoods and takes on a charm reminiscent of Georgetown, Annapolis, and Old Town Philadelphia.  The Inn at Henderson's Wharf has a wonderful setting, but it is not Baltimore's best hotel and it is not worth the outlay of cash required.I was there with a group of Friends this past December. We had a wonderful time. The hotel is beautiful. The staff (Winsome, William, Nija and Joan) were the best. So friendly, helpful and fun.  I would recommend a stay there when visiting Baltimore.I have known of the Inn at Henderson's Wharf for years. It has a reputation as the best (and priciest) hotel in Baltimore. While recent additions in Harbor East may have knocked it off that perch, it certainly is not by far. It is tucked into the end of a pier in Fells Point, just far enough from the action to stay peaceful but close enough for an easy walk. It is in a gorgeous brick building that blends into the condo units surrounding it. (Fans of a long-running satirical show will be amused to see that you can live at the Penthouses in the Lofts at the Residences in the Inn at Henderson's Wharf in Fell's Point.) When we wanted to splurge on a hotel room for Halloween in Fells Point, I knew just where to go.Everything about the hotel is beautiful, from the stately lobby to the open garden atrium to the rooms themselves. There are not many amenities on site, but they seem to have partnerships with many places nearby if you desire a workout or other standard options. There is a wine reception in the lobby on most days, which seems to run for exactly one hour. The times are posted in the material in the room (but if you ask me, if you're checking in within an hour of the start time the desk clerk could mention it.) They apparently also offer Grand Marnier at the complimentary coffee stations as a nightcap in the evening, but I don't think I would have availed myself of any even if I noticed it after returning from a fun evening in Fells Point. We did receive a text from the hotel shortly after we left for dinner asking us to contact them if we needed anything, which was nice if we needed a cab I guess.Aside from the coffee stations, they do have a lovely and varied continental breakfast laid out in the morning. It made for a pleasant morning after a pleasant night.Definitely my favorite hotel in Baltimore.  Located at the edge of Fell's Point, this is a really nice and charming hotel.  Large rooms with great views of the harbor.  Everything is clean and modern.  Great continental breakfast with fresh fruit, pastries and some hot items from time to time.  They also do a manager's wine happy hour at night from time to time.  Free wine, why not?Price wise it is a bit on the higher end, but I don't mind paying for it given the location and lack of hotels in this area.  They also have a parking lot for those of you driving in.I managed to get a good rate here for a business trip and I could not have been more pleased. The staff were professional and friendly at every interaction. I snapped a photo of the room when I arrived and it really is exactly as the brochures and web site make it out to be.  Located right in the old neighborhood of Fells Point, stumbling distance to incredible taverns along historic cobblestone roads and beautiful townhouses, this inn lies at the marina along the water.  The insides are built to impress.  Rich wood trim and furniture, plush carpets, and tasteful decor greet you.  The usual amenities are all there with nothing wasted on frivolous things, attention is spent on what matters: comfort, lighting, bedding, rich pillows, and the little extras like fresh eggs, berries, and melons at the breakfast bar.  Only two things could have made this hotel better: an on-site pool and an on-site hot tub. I would definitely recommend this place to others, even at their full price.Beautiful in every way!  Loved the location, the views, the ambience, the Grand Marnier/Chocolate night cap hour, the furnishings, the staff, the breakfast, etc., etc. One of the nicest and friendliest hotels ever.  As good as it gets!My partner and I were in Baltimore for an overnight (Sunday into Monday) and this boutique hotel had come highly recommended to us. When we arrived, we were immediately pleased with the hotel and its location - in addition to being on the water, the hotel is right around the corner from a ton of trendy restaurants and local shops. It's also only about a mile from the busy and beautiful Inner Harbor, which we were able to walk to in no time. The hotel itself is lovely. It has an old-fashioned charm with all the amenities you could possibly want or need. Our room was much larger than expected, with windows that looked out onto to the water and, most importantly, it was spotless. From start to finish, the hotel employees were excellent - polite, professional, etc. There were, however, a few things that struck us. First - we were told parking was valet and there would be a wine reception at check-in (5 p.m.). Turns out parking isn't valet; instead, you park in a (very) nearby lot. And the wine reception? It's only Monday through Saturday. Neither of these were a problem - parking was easy and super-secure. Also, it's included in the room rate, which is a great value in that part of the city. And while we would've loved complimentary wine, there were plenty of fabulous restaurants to more than makeup for the miscommunication. Next? Check-in isn't until 4 p.m., but we were told the hotel would hold on to our bags and call when the room was ready. They accepted our luggage and tagged everything accordingly, but we never did receive the call regarding our room. To err on the side of caution, we headed back to the hotel around 4:30 p.m. and the woman who checked us in apologized for not calling - she said she hadn't realized we were waiting for our room. As it turned out, the woman waiting to check in behind us had the same problem.Finally, upon check-out we were charged an additional $9.95 ""Guest Service Fee"" for a list of services we didn't utilize. Harbor Magic Hotels, which owns The Inn at Henderson's Wharf, among other properties, explained on a brochure that it's ""excited to now offer all of our most popular services in one convenient Guest Service Fee of $9.95"" ... PER NIGHT. Among the services? A ""complimentary"" bottle of water; free Wi-Fi (Is charging for that still a thing?); unlimited calling; a daily newspaper, etc.In an effort to fight back, my partner and I ate $10.95 worth of berries at the ""complimentary"" breakfast buffet, read our ""complimentary"" newspaper - twice, and pocketed some Earl Grey tea bags.Honestly? The hotel was terrific and we would absolutely stay again, but we were disappointed to find the kitschy brochure and hidden fee - just increase the cost of the rooms by $10 night. It's still a great value and much less offensive to travelers when they wake up in the morning and find the bill underneath the door.I'm a local so I've never stayed here but I've known a couple of folks who have and by all accounts this is a fantastic hotel. Prices aren't cheap but you get what you pay for. The rooms are gorgeous and very tastefully decorated and the location along the water is fantastic. Hotel staff come off as very professional and apparently there's a free breakfast that's far better than the usual junk that most hotels feed you in the morning. The only real reservation I have about Henderson's Wharf is the price. Unless you get a great deal it seems silly to drop the kind of money a room here usually costs if you're only using it to sleep. For romantic or special occasions though you'd be hard-pressed to do better.What a beautiful hotel! I stayed here for a night over the summer with a bachelorette party in a stunning room right on the pier in Fells. Although there were 7 or 8 of us, we all fit just fine in the room with two queen beds. I was lucky enough to snag a spot on the heavenly pillow-top for the night!I'm sure the front desk staff had a laugh as we ran back and forth asking for tape to hang decorations and ice for the drinks. But they were very helpful and even though we had to wait before checking into our room, they were apologetic yet friendly.There was a fantastic garden/courtyard area right off of the lobby where we took pictures and probably got laughed at (again) in our matching shirts.Possibly the highlight was in the morning when the lady cleaning up the complimentary breakfast stopped to make sure we could all grab as much as we wanted before she had to toss it! Such great service, beautiful location, and fantastic rooms. I don't know about the price (not sure I want to) but I think it would be worth it!A very delightful surprise.Staff/Check-InThe staff was extremely courteous and welcoming. The gentleman who staffed the happy hour and nightcap event was phenomenal. I would hire him to run my business. The company that runs this hotel really has their stuff together. After check-in I even received a welcome text on my cell phone and I was free to text back if I needed anything.LocationExcellent location on the wharf. Walking distance to Fell's Point, Inner Harbor, and Little Italy, and Canton.RoomsAll rooms in the hotel are located on the ground floor, so views are limited. The hotel is fairly small, only ~32 rooms I believe. The hallways are adorned with original handmade brick and really didn't feel like a normal hotel. Things looked new, well-kept, good-sized rooms with a real flower in the bathroom vase. Our room window opened up into the courtyard, where there were people seated (it was a little awkward so we kept the shutters closed). The courtyard was lushly landscaped. The rooms feature an iHome system (iphone 5 or newer) which was great.$10 Amenity FeeThere is a $10 fee for amenities/events which include: WiFi, continental breakfast (no hot foods), happy hour cheese and wine event, evening nightcap, a Starbucks coffee machine, and parking. The morning paper is delivered in a nice cloth bag.Overall, I highly recommend the Inn at Henderson's Wharf, and would look into staying at their 2 other sister properties in the area.I recently spent my first weekend at this place and I plan on coming back in the future. I have been coming to fells point for 3 years and have stayed at Admiral Fell inn ( which wasn't bad either) , but I found this place on yelp and I'm glad I found it. The customer service at this place was outstanding , anything at all you need is handled by the guest service butlers, free wine and cheese, and Gran Marnier &amp; chocolate at night. The staff were all very friendly and all had great recommendations on where to find  local events . I will be booking my next stay in Fells Point at the Inn at Henderson's Wharf !!Great Hotel, great location, great staff. The facility is beautiful with a premium location right on the harbor, easy walking to all the Fells Point attractions and frankly not a bad walk to the Inner Harbor also.There is secure parking right next door and if walking is not your thing there is a shuttle that will take you around.The staff are exactly the people you want in the hospitality business, friendly, efficient and always willing to go above and beyond for the clients. Shout out to Katie and Marvin in particular, they could not be nicer or more helpful.Based on the Yelp reviews, we booked here this past weekend when we came to Baltimore for a concert at Pier Six.  This is the CUTEST little hote!  Clean, the rooms are cute, and the location is fantastic.  Wine Hour was great - complimentary wine and cheese in the afternoons, and the free breakfast was really great (much better than most hotels).  It is a great value for the price.  We had a room on street level and there was no issue at all with noise.  I would stay here again anytime!Always great.  We booked 5 rooms.  All wonderful.  The hospitality of this remarkable staff is unbelievable.  Chrissy at the front desk not only took care of our reservations and rooms, she reconfigured my iPhone with great apps for the area.  Marvin made our family feel so welcome, he was so kind we feel like he is now part of our family.  All five siblings and our spouses were there for Mother's Day weekend to celebrate our wonderful Mom who passed away at Christmas.  We all live in different cities, so it was great to get together in this lovely spot to spend time together.  Katie at the front desk took care of us as well, letting us know what was happening in the area and arranging a shuttle to take us to dinner on Saturday.  Raymond was our driver and he did a great job of getting us all to the restaurant on time.  Brett you do a great job and your staff is amazing.  We are thinking of doing this every Mother's Day weekend.  Thanks so much.  We really needed that and we appreciate your kindness.I'll try this again, apparently my reviews of Hendersons Wharf are ""too gushing"" and the Yelp filter throws them into the hidden category.  Stayed here again, April 2014, for 2 more days and are planning another visit in June.  Favorite hotel on the planet and we cannot say enough good things about it!  Our goal is to stay in every room, which is doable since there are only 38, all quiet and peaceful and just a few blocks from the bars and shops.   Once more to the staff:  Thank You All AGAIN!!stayed here during our last-minute trip to baltimore on a tuesday night.  pros: in fell's point and right on the water -- a really cool part of town, walking distance to great bars &amp; restaurants.  the rate was reasonable, considering that the place was right on the water.  the complimentary wine at check-in is a nice touch.  the breakfast is good -- lots &amp; lots of fresh fruit, cheese, breads, lucky charms. cons: the parking lot is somewhat questionable at best.  the decor is a little meh -- suited for an older crowd, i guess.  the ""garden view"" room...well, someone got a view at breakfast.  oops.I adore this place.  Most importantly, I love - I miss! - the breakfast.I can't explain exactly why it's so great ... the food is good (overflowing bowls of blackberries!) and the staff is adorable.  Somehow, all together, it makes for the most relaxing experience.You can eat properly at a table, outside in the courtyard, or curled up in an armchair in the lobby.  You can even bring a wooden tray filled with food back to your room.Maybe I love the breakfasts here so much because they epitomize the spirit of this place - not at all pretentious, but luxurious.  Warm and comfortable, yet elegant.I want to go back.The room I stayed in was spacious, clean, and inviting.  The bathroom was equally spacious and renovated. I stayed in room 111, which has a very nice view of the harbor.  I was also pleased with the breakfast- hard boiled eggs, fresh fruits, bagels, pastries, and fresh juices.  They have hot tea and coffee in the lobby whenever you like and their friendly service tops off with a complimentary wine in the room.  Now, that's service!!","We had an AMAZING experience at Henderson's Wharf Inn.  We stayed at the hotel on a last minute trip to Baltimore.  The location is absolutely amazing.. The setting is right on the water of the harbor. Each morning we woke up to a beautiful scene of serene water and the boats across the harbor.  From the moment we stepped into the inn's lobby and were greeted by the amazing staff.  The front desk receptionist (Shelby) was super friendly and assisted us with every request during our stay.  The lobby is beautifully appointed with plush, luxurious furnishings and the rooms are super comfortable.  The beds are amazing, the furnishings and bathrooms are wonderful..The atmosphere and location was exceptional.  One nice thing about the location is that it's located in the residential area off of the main Fell's Point area so it is super quiet as opposed to being located in the heart of Fells, but is in close walking distance.  There is a driver and plush Mercedes Van that can take you to and from the Inn to locations around the harbor up until 10pm.  The overall experience was definitely a 5 star experience,  the  breakfast each morning is awesome and Shelby the front desk agent is amazing and friendly.This place is a sure-bet if you are looking for a very nice place, close to the Fells Point action.  The location is fantastic, and even though the rooms are all on the street level, noise was never an issue.  Complimentary bottle of wine, the best TV channel selection I've ever seen (the entire DISH package), wonderful complimentary breakfast.The only thing preventing a 5-star rating is that our room and the lobby bathroom were a tad worn.  The tub in our room has some cracks around the drain.  The lobby bathroom was a little ragged.  Also the online reservation system is a bit odd and could use an upgrade.  Other than that, very very nice place.It would be hard to stay anywhere else when visiting Baltimore.I came here for a party in one of the penthouses (yes, some people actually do live here) so I didn't actually stay in the inn so I can't vouch for the hotel rooms but based on what I did see, I'm sure they're incredibly nice.  The location is pretty great, right in Fells Point.  The view is gorgeous, you can see for miles down the harbor.  The staff was sooo nice and helpful.  Living 15 minutes away, I have no real reason to ever stay here, but it is very tempting.This is the second time that my wife and I have stayed in the Inn at Hendersons Whart and both times we loved it. The place is beautiful, the staff is friendly and top notch and the rooms are extremely nice. We find the Inn very romantic and it is located right near all of the Fell Point activities and only a short water taxi ride to the Inner Harbor. They provide you with a comlpimentary bottle of wine and have a very nice continental breakfast. We always book a room overlooking the marina although the garden is very beautiful and a great place to enjoy breakfast. We find it a very relaxing and comfortable place to stay while we are in the Baltimore area.Oh my gosh-- this place is SO nice!!  The people who work there are extremely helpful and very sweet.  The toiletries are orange-scented and will tempt you to bathe when you don't need to (I'm serious about this-- I totally jumped in the shower when I didn't have time or need just because I wanted to use the soap and shampoo again).The bed is heavenly, although the pillows are a little fluffier than my liking.  I like my pillows pretty close to flat.  You'll get an amazing breakfast with tons of choices including fresh berries.  The rooms have a view of either the water or the gorgeous courtyard.I hear they have a 24-hour workout room, although I didn't use it.There are cool little bars nearby and a live-music venue, but I didn't visit them either.  It was a work trip and unfortunately, I saw the office and the hotel.  Good thing I loved the hotel.  :-)My boyfriend surprised me with a night here last weekend and it was incredibly romantic.  The complimentary bottle of wine facilitated a beautiful sunset over the harbor right from the window of our spacious room.  The location at Fells Point is ideal and the generous continental breakfast with fresh fruit and all the fixin's sealed the deal - we will be back!So , If you are in a quandrey over what special gift to give someone--- why not consider a night or two in Baltimore--- and stay at the most delightful Inn in all of Baltimore the Inn at Henderson's Wharf. Recently, my husband and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary-we wanted to go to Italy - but that was out of the question--- however, we stayed at the Inn at Hendersons Wharf for the weekend and enjoyed all the wonderful offerings of downtown Fells Point- great food, eclectic choices  and more musical venues than you can imagine in one little area....just a marvelous time...The Inn at Henderson's Wharf really made our weekend special--upon arrival everyone receives a complimentary  bottle of wine for the room ( of age visitors)- what a great way to start!The rooms are  refreshing and stylish and with the Inn's  spectucular location, right on the water...provided great views.The staff were friendly and accommodating, and the morning complimentary breakfast was  outstanding.So, If you want a great getaway without the hassle of trains, planes, and body scanners--- enjoy a stay at The Inn at Henderson's wharf.TerriWe ended up finally getting in for an incredibly reasonable rate last year, I think because they had a day of cancellation. On top of the hotel just being really cool and on the water, it's located in a great part of town. Soooo much is within walking distance. To start, they have a private gated parking lot, I guess because as someone mentioned the top floors are actually condos that people own. The lobby area is very nicely decorated. Guest get a complementary bottle of wine, a small cheese plate, and two chocolates, which were a nice touch. Our wine was red, I only drink white, and they allowed us to trade at the front desk. The room was above and beyond; I will add pics later, with exposed brick and antique wood furniture. I don't know what the full rate would be, but I'm assuming I wouldn't be able to afford it. The stay included a continental breakfast which was good, pastries, fresh fruit, and the usual. The staff was great, they assisted us with suggestions of places to dine, and other parts of the city we might enjoy. There was a flower festival on the opposite side of town, which they directed us to. Overall a great stay, I would definitely go back.",,,,"['boyfriend', 'came', 'spontaneous', 'weekend', 'trip', 'friend', 'recommended', 'fells', 'point', 'area', 'glad', 'found', 'place', 'helped',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/home2-suites-by-hilton-baltimore-downtown-baltimore-2,Home2 Suites by Hilton Baltimore Downtown,4.0,$$,31,"We stayed here for 3 nights while visiting family. The hotel was clean and inviting. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to any/all of our needs. Each time we came into the lobby, we were greeted right away with a very friendly voice!  We used the valet service for our car and they were very quick each time we called for service. The rooms were very clean and straightened up each day that we were there.   They even changed the towels each day, even if we left them hung up to dry, which was a nice surprise!The only thing that might need improvement is the breakfast service, if you got there within 20 minutes of closing there wasn't much of a selection as far as breakfast sandwiches or oatmeal...but the early bird gets the worm, do we need to make sure we are there earlier next time we stay. The hotel is easy to get to and close to a lot of the main Baltimore attractions.It's not a great hotel, but's a good one and it was perfect for my recent Christmas visit to see family in Baltimore. Edward L. redeemed his HHonors points and picked well for us.The room itself is large and well appointed. I get the feeling this building was converted to a hotel from studio apartments or a medical building. If so, great reuse of the space. We didn't need or use the kitchen during our trip, but the appliances were new and even included a dishwasher. I guess that's why they call it Home2 because it's sorta like your home, too.I like the fact that the building is a narrow highrise because there aren't many rooms on each floor and the elevator is pretty fast. Parking isn't ideal and I'd prefer an attached parking deck, but they do a good job running valet service 24/7 and there's a lot of metered street parking available, which was surprising because in most cases like that you're fighting for limited spaces, high rates, and inconvenient time limits. This neighborhood doesn't seem to have those problems. We didn't try it, but I'd encourage hotel guests to consider street parking because I think it's a really good alternative.Location is always important when traveling from out of town. We were 20 minutes to family gatherings and about 5 minutes from Horseshoe Casino. I'm glad that was there because there were torrential rains every day, all day during our trip and being able to escape inside to the adult arcade was fun. Plus, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, M&amp;T Stadium, are all within walking distance.Our 10th floor room had a great view toward the monument that was decorated with Christmas lights from top to bottom. You can also see out toward the Inner Harbor area. Oh, and free wifi! Just connect to ""attwifi"" or ""HHonors"" and you're set.I stayed here one night on a business trip last week. It is a downtown hotel. Parking options are street parking which is free overnight but your car must be moved by 7 am; valet parking which is $36? / night or there is a garage 2 blocks away that charges $15 for 24 hours (it's next to the Embassy Suites). I chose the garage. The hotel is of European design. There is a breakfast offered in the morning which is minimal but sufficient. My room was spacious.  I arrived at 11:00 pm due to a delayed flight and when I walked in the room the thermostat was set to 81 and this was in late June. It took me about an hour to cool the room down.My stay was ok. I would return only is the price was attractive. The parking options were not appealing to me. Front desk staff were nice and the property was clean.Inexpensive and clean rooms but on the top floor the street noise was still a problem and heard the neighboring room's alarm clock.I teetered on the 3 star bubble, but would average this hotel at 2.5.We were in town for a wedding and this was the cheaper of the 2 options we were given. We called for an early check in and they said a room would be ready by 1. We arrived at around 1:15. When we got to the front, Latina I think he name was, we told her our name and she mumbled basically ""not ready"". Um. ok? Well do you have a time frame? Can we put our luggage somewhere? We were told 1pm, and no we got told another hour at least because everyone was at lunch.  We had to ask a million questions like they had never checked someone in before. No one seemed to know where we parked or the valet situation. It was just a bit of a mess. When we finally check in, we got our ""queen"" room, which was in fact a full sized bed in a giant room that could accommodate 2 kings if it had to. I took off my flops to get unpacked and the floor was soaking wet. I mean, like walking on a sponge wet. It was gross. When we told the front desk, their response was ""ok"". Not I'm sorry, or anything, we had to ask if it had been cleaned that way, could they do anything? Again, we had to do all the problem solving. Their response was ""yeah we have something to dry it, we just have to find it."" They obviously didn't, because the floor was still wet when we returned. It finally dried by the next morning. The bed wasn't comfortable at all and squeaked quite a bit every time we moved.You have to valet your car, there is no on site parking. And give yourself 30 minutes to get your car ready. We had to twice and each time they told us 15-20 minutes and one time it took closer to 45 minutes. So be ready for a wait. The breakfast was ok, basically a waffle maker and some microwavable sandwiches. I will say the one man stocking and taking care of breakfast was extremely helpful and friendly.Overall, this wouldn't be my first choice in Baltimore.I had stayed at one of these properties when I was in San Antonio for business. I had many choices of hotels to choose from at even lower rates but decided on this one because they provided transportation to my events. Next time I will stay further out and just rent a car.I was able to catch the van out without incident a couple times but had problems getting rides in. I called and was told someone was coming. Called 30 mins later and was told they had already been out. I was in the same spot watching and no one had come through. They sent the driver back. He said he was picking up me and another person and he had ""waited 15 mins"". I had been outside all the time and the van is easy to spot. I even told them where I was when I called in. I asked him ""So you just left me?"" He apologized.The next time I was told someone was on the way. Another guest recognized me from staying at the same hotel. We were out there about 20 mins. They called and were told no one was coming due to traffic and to just call a cab. (1)Why wasn't I told the same thing? They had my room # with my contact#. Why didn't anyone bother to contact me as a courtesy?Another time I called, I was told the van was out and to call a cab. The van was at the site when I got there. My visit was mediocre at best. The staff seemed to have attitudes at time too. This by far was one of the least pleasant visits I have had at a Hilton property in all my years of traveling.Will definitely stay elsewhere next time. Very disappointed with my stay and will not recommend it to my friends and family. I do think the Home2 Suites is a great concept but feel some of this staff at this location could benefit from some customer service training. Some of them give off nasty vibes. Some of the conversations with customers were less than appealing.Terrific bargain for the price paid. We got a full kitchenette, the bathroom was amazing, and had so many unexpected surprises. We had a full refrigerator, toaster, dishwasher, cutlery, pull-out sofa and a beautiful bathroom. If this room had a range cooking area, we would move in as a condo or a renter! Will definitely be looking to book at this hotel in the future!Pros: this was a very clean hotel. The suites are of good size and the amenities are nice. I liked the tv setup and the comfort of the bed.Cons: The location is odd. It's tough to get in and out of. I opted for the valet at $16/day which made it much easier. Overall a good place that I would enjoy visiting again.Excellent! Wonderful staff. Great room with kitchen - modern and clean. Nice fitness room with laundry. Delicious breakfast. One complaint - the iron was chincy. Otherwise a wonderful home away from home!The cleanest hotel by hilton we ever stayed in ! Jason at the front desk is very nice and helpful, walls are not paper thin like other hotels, everything in the room was new, and the staff are all friendly. The only thing is that the breakfast selection is very poor, so don't count on it.My husband and I, my sister in law and her SO and three friends all stayed at this hotel from 4/25-4/27 for my daughter's wedding. The cost is reasonable, the hotel is clean and well managed. The breakfast is not skimpy like some free breakfasts are. The rooms were very comfortable and the addition of a kitchenette made it convenient too. Will definitely stay here on subsequent trips to Baltimore.Great deal for your money. Stayed 1 night in July and was very happy with the eco friendly options. Breakfast was good and staff were great! Clean hotel and nice outdoor eating space.I'm running the Baltimore half marathon on October 18, 2014 and booked my hotel room back in July. I'm a Hilton rewards member and booked this hotel specifically because it was a Hilton and for the in room kitchen. Then, a few days ago (October 8) the Hilton Home2Suites on E. Pleasant St. in Baltimore bumped 30 runners competing in the Baltimore Running Festival because they could get a higher rate for the rooms due to the Orioles making the playoffs. It's been a while since I've seen such greed and terrible business practices. Apparently being a reward member doesn't mean a damn thing.We stayed at the Baltimore Home2 for one night, and it was a wonderful experience. They did everything they could to make it a good stay, even helping us find a good place to park. Great breakfast, wonderful beds.I absolutely love this hotel!!! Have stayed here on two separate occasions with the bf and I can say I always love my stays here. The service is top-notch... free breakfast!!!! and smoking rooms that have ipod/ipad docking stations!!! rooms are spacious, full kitchenette with dishes, silverware and cups/mugs.FREE WI-FI!!!!!!This place is soooo convenient that you will not miss being right on top of the inner harbor. The hotel is about 6 short blocks away from the inner harbor, but there's a super market and food court a block away.There are bars that and restaurants that line Charles st which is one of the cross streets that the hotel sits on. There are strip clubs a few blocks away including hustler, and a few clubs on east Baltimore. Being from NYC and in love with New Orleans Baltimore is more 3rd favorite place and I will always stay at this hotel if possible.I love this place so will you!!!!Hands down the best hotel stay from the West coast to the East coast!  The rooms are very, very clean...not even dust!!! Customer service is wonderful..delightful even!  The rooms are fully equipped with everything you could possibly need to feel at home away from home.  Yes, the valet is a bit expensive, but it's downtown Baltimore. Some garages charge $5 for 20 minutes.  Get over it, El Cheapos. Other positives:  rooms are very quite. Miminal street noise, can't hear anyone in the other rooms.  Huge TV, amazing bathroom, lovely housekeeping staff, AMAZING IN-ROOM COFFEE!!! The only issue we had during our stay was the water temperature control.  It was never an option to get cold tap water from the sink, but the showers can get super hot, so proceed with caution!  I love this place.  Great location! Try Maisy's just around the corner on N. Charles St. for some tasty comfort food and hard drinks!  If we ever need another hotel here in Baltimore, we already know where we're staying, folks!  LKLove Love Love this hotel! I have stayed in this hotel about 3 times. Very unique from other hotels I have stayed in. All rooms come with a kitchenette! Bathroom has a sliding door...Yes...A SLIDING DOOR!!! Service was great. Prices are not bad. You can find specials online for this hotel as well. Not far from the inner harbor at all. Don't take my word for it.... Try it on your next visit to Baltimore City or to just get away! :)Hotel is centrally located in Baltimore.  The stadium, the Poe grave site, the aquarium, and the Baltimore waterfront are all within a mile.  Walking distance if you are up for it!  Plenty of places to eat around the hotel.  The rooms were clean and spacious.  The staff was incredibly accommodating.  They offered us plenty of recommendations and assistance if needed.  They always asked how we were doing when we walked in the door.  Darnell, the breakfast attendant, is amazing.  The only downside I can mention is that the parking is valet and is an additional change, but this seems common for hotel in Baltimore.  Overall, highly recommended.A very nice property in the heart of Downtown  Baltimore. Great location and very accommodating staff. The rooms are spacious and clean. Views are nothing spectacular due to the location around larger buildings. The #1 negative however is the parking. Valet is available, but at a cost of course. Other than that, there is on street parking if you can find it. Still, a nicely priced property.I like this hotel.  I actually stayed here last year for my birthday.  It just seemed right.  The hotel is between the Charm City Circulator Purple Route,  how perfect is that.  I booked online and stayed on a low floor which was fine, it was very quiet so I had alot of peace and quiet.  I love the free wifi and the lovely flat screen t.v. There is also an alarm clock with an Ipod dock in the room.  The room was clean and comfortable I had enough room to lay about.  There is also a supermarket about 2-3 blocks over that has already prepared foods and goodies that you would need if you didn't feel the need to go to the restaurants that line Charles Street.  The only issue is that is on a steep hill which for some may be a real problem for some namely the elderly or a person in a wheelchair but I am from The Bronx, NY, my borough is consists of steep angled hills so it wasn't much of a problem.  The free breakfast was so-so, I preferred to walk over to a Dunkin' Donuts about 3-4 blocks away to grab some breakfast.","I spent two weeks at this location and could not have been more pleased. Entire staff was exceptional.  Rooms clean and comfortable.  Would strongly recommend to anyone.I recently stayed here to have a place to crash before and after the Baltimore Half Marathon.  It's in the perfect location-right in the heart of Mt. Vernon, half way between Penn Station and the Inner Harbor.  At $150 for a Hilton hotel, you can't beat it.  Plus, it has a kitchenette, so my gf and I were able to eat take out on real plates and silverware and drink wine out of glass like we were at home in our living room.Let us just say that we stay exclusively at Hilton Brand Hotels.  We phoned in to the front dest to ask a question prior to booking our 2 room 5 night stay on line.  The girl, and I use that word intentionally...the GIRL who finally answered the phone after picking it up and talking to her peers for about 20 seconds answered my question with an, ""um...NO.  Is that it?""  Before she shuffled me off the phone.  So, needless to say, we booked our rooms elsewhere.The accommodations were clean, and neat. However, the front desk is a bit disorganized - they failed to warn me of an ""incidentals"" charge of $50 against my debit card. Of course, this will come off after a few days, but I was upset that I was not forewarned about e charge. The other thing is that the A/C was not working, and I didn't get a chance to tell them until the next morning. Marlon (manager) there was very helpful, and made up for the up fact that it didn't work by removing my parking charge of $25.00 after I spoke with the front desk about the problem.Would I stay there again? Probably. But the front desk needs to be extremely clear about there charges up front.This hotel is wonderful!  The staff is incredible!  The guests are all happy!  The rooms are clean and have absolutely everything (except a bath tub). Even the housekeeper Shyneice is terrific! Be sure you remember to leave her tips. That girl works hard and has the best attitude and smile! I would give the staff 10 stars and thank whoever hires here. They all seem happy and take pride in their work. I would give the overall stay a 5 if they had shuttle service (but the staff will happily call a cab for you and it will be prompt...thanks Cameron!). And a big thanks to Mike for being so thoughtful at 3am and making sure my water for my hot tea was hot enough and prepping the great breakfast at 6am...he is just so thoughtful and attentive. Other than no tub or shuttle it's just a great great place to stay!For the money, it's a great deal.  Really, really nice rooms with new amenities and firm beds.  Exceptional service.  The lounge downstairs was nice and comfy and the hotel was generally pretty quiet.  Being that we would have had the same rate at the Mount Vernon Hotel a couple of blocks away, I'm glad we stayed here.Great deal , extremely friendly and helpful staff, good room, and great location... To disagree with others reviews about parking i thought the valet service was great, 25$ a day unlimited in and out, and knowing my car was save I'm a garage and not on the street is enough for me. Coming from A place like Philly where your car is not safe on any street any time from being dinged and side swiped, having valet for 25 a day is amazing. We plan on looking for more home 2 suites if we travel again, and definitely would come back to this one.PROsGreat price and brand new :)AAA members get 10% off and they don't check your member card, if you know what I'm sayin'There was a super amazing helpful employee named Lakia who always went above and beyond. Everyone else resonated around sub par. Breakfast is offered from 7-9. Selection is just carbs and coffee (coffee is around through the afternoon though yay). Yogurt. All rooms have a full size fridge,large microwave, dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker and a hotplate/skillet upon request. There is also a pull out couch and a curtain to separate the bed from the couch bed. wifi and printing are free. Remote printing is not available. There is a decent fitness center, ""game room"" (just an xbox), and laundry room.No bed bugs yayyyyyy There are lots of bars/restaurants within walking distance. Neutrogena shampoo and body wash are stocked in dispensers in the shower (which is only a shower... and the dispensers sometimes leak..)CONsParking is kinda shitty but as long as you read the signs you're good. They have valet for $25/day, but we just did parking lots/street parking and ended up spending less than $30 for Fri/Sat/Sun combined. Bed was pretty uncomfortable.Some of the dishes weren't *ready*to*use* clean.We stayed from Friday until Monday morning during St. Patty's Day. The sign in the bathroom explained the cleaning services are only provided M-F, and on the weekends as requested. They also offered a ""full cleaning"" every 5th day. However a cleaning person came on Saturday. The bathroom is had a sliding door, and the cleaning person moved it in such a way that it was stuck :( When we came back to the room later on Saturday we had to call the front desk several times (thank god Lakia was working!!). The staff persons -- janitorial engineers or something ridiculous who had the tools to fix said door wouldn't be back until Monday and Lakia offered to move us to another room. We magically figured it out with a screw driver, because all our toiletries were in the bathroom... and I would not have survived the weekend.We ended up here because the Brookshire Hotel had given away our room, even though we had informed them we would be late when we booked.  We were very happy with the suite.  Plenty of room and clean.  People at the desk were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was more varied and tastier than other places we've been.  I'd stay again.Very pleased with this property for the price and location. It is off a side street in a great location for restaurants and easy access to the interstate. I really loved the rooms for the class of hotel it is. Comfortable bed, nice kitchen area and very modern looking. Will try to stay here again. I personally think about the same as a new Hampton Inn.Meh...It served its purpose. The location was not easy to find and the noise from outside was loud. I travel frequently for business and this isn't a place that I would choose on purpose again.",,,,"['nights', 'visiting', 'family', 'hotel', 'clean', 'inviting', 'staff', 'friendly', 'accommodating',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/baltimore-harbor-hotel-baltimore,Baltimore Harbor Hotel,2.5,$$,46,"Stayed one night so we didn't have to drive after a concert at the Royal Farms Arena.  On the plus side - very pleasant staff at desk and valet, the room was clean, bed &amp; pillows very comfortable and the location was perfect. We did have a microwave and mini fridge, but didn't need it.  On the not as good side - we booked a Queen room, but the bed was clearly only a full size. The room was on the small side, but in the city that is what you get.  Breakfast buffet was disappointing.  You do have to pay extra for parking. I would stay here again.If I could give the Baltimore Harbor Hotel zero stars I would. The hotel was over priced for the room. The room was no bigger than any regular hotel room. The nicest part of this hotel was the lobby. There is a bar by the lobby area that does not serve food, aside from the continental breakfast, which consisted of cereal and a waffle maker. The rooms were outdated and small and it looked as though the mirror hadn't been cleaned in months. The bathroom mirror wasn't any better. Speaking of the bathroom,not the water pressure was terrible and the water itself was cold. The hotel staff are rude. Every last one of them. Granted, there was a blizzard outside and they were stuck at work, so I would not be the happiest person either, but all of them were flat out rude. The valet got my car stuck in the snow so myself, along with other guests had to dig my car out for over an hour. Had I not said anything to the valet personnel, they would have left. Thanks to the plow truck driver (who was also stuck) who gave my party a bucket of salt to help us move my car, otherwise my car would have been stuck in the valet's driveway for even longer. After getting my car stuck and inconveniencing my friends, other hotel guests and myself, the hotel still tried to charge me $38/night for the valet, when at the end of the day I drove my own car into the parking lot. If you do decide to stay here, just know that you have to utilize the valet because there is no other parking available, other than another parking garage down the road that is $20/night without in and out services. So make sure you include the parking price along with the cost of your room.In all of my years of traveling, I've never encountered such terrible customer service, and that is coming from a New Yorker. I love downtown Baltimore but I will never give the Baltimore Harbor Hotel another penny.Booked a last minute room here for my friends mini bachelorette party. The hotel was actually really nice, I was impressed. Checking in the staff was nice and the lobby is very well decorated. Our room was just as I expected. Two double beds. The room was nice, a little warm but nothing the AC can't fix. The only downfall was that they do not have refrigerators in the regular rooms. We were constantly filling out ice bucket and thank goodness we brought a cooler too to keep our drinks cold. The hotel is just a 5 min cab ride to the inner harbor or fed hill which is what we wanted. I'd definitely stay here again.Terrible customer service. Bathroom was dirty and I didn't stay. My gf and I took one look at room and left. Hotel charged me 50 dollars stil... Terrible customer service in a bad area. Don't stay here there are plenty better around in better safer areasPictures can be deceiving. Main lobby looks great. You get up to the rooms and they're worn down. Stuff is falling apart in the rooms. Dirt on the walls. Just not the best hotel experience especially since this was fairly expensive.This review is from August 2014 and was posted on what was the other Yelp entry for the Baltimore Harbor Hotel that has changed names to a non-existing hotel at this address.For many years the group I travel with has stayed here during Otakon with pleasant experiences. On the Sheraton Baltimore City Center Yelp page I gave this hotel a four star rating. The situation has greatly changed with the hotel no longer being a Sheraton.From the outside it looks slightly different with changed signage and a coat of paint. Valet parking staff are still excellent and were nothing but helpful. The South Tower is now closed and it was the first time we roomed in the North Tower. The North Tower was a world of difference in the wrong direction. Starting off, the room for a double was smaller than the ones in the South Tower were.What we found in our room:1. Capped electrical wires had fallen out of the bottom of the rooms cooling unit.2. Graffiti/Vandalism was written on the inside of the closet wall.  3. The center divider on the top of the table in our room had broken loose.4. The electrical socket closest to our bed was loose and falling out of the wall.The room remained functional but we reported many of these problems to hotel staff immediately. Checkout was even more of a disaster then Otakon Sunday tradition. Of the three elevators, one broke, leaving two functional units for 20+ floors. Another surprise we received, when calling for a baggage cart is the bellhop position at the hotel has been terminated. You have to get your own carts from the lobby and transport your own luggage. My friend and I carried our luggage down seven floors to the lobby via the stairs, consequently reducing my rating from three stars to two.The only reason we are giving two stars to this hotel is because the staff were excellent and helpful, that has not changed. Our group has made the decision to look into other options in the harbor area after this year as the hotel has visibly gone backwards. I can't recommend this hotel right now.So...things that were good: staff, location, valet parking.That's it.  Bad things: water pressure (a complete joke), upkeep of the hotel property, and sheets were torn up. *UPDATE: I forgot the worst part. I went to get a cup of coffee and fruit from the breakfast bar.  The banana was warm.  I don't mean room temp....I mean HEATED!   For what we paid for it, it was just fine (priceline discount).  For the money they wanted to charge - absolutely not.  We stayed one night for the ballgame - and it did what we needed.Stayed here overnight last month. Checked in really late so everything was pretty quiet when we arrived. Until we got up to our room that is--the walls were paper thin. Like paper paper, we could hear the moans of the woman across the hall (corner rooms) gettin' her whole world rocked. It was pretty surreal.Add this to a lumpy mattress, dim lighting, and my own 1am check-in and I just felt cheap the whole time I was there lol.They also charged us inaccurately for a movie rental-still need to resolve that!We picked the wrong weekend to come. Apparently there was a football tournament nearby so there were 150+ youth football players and their families. It was complete craziness. The breakfast was held in the bar restaurant in the hotel. There was not enough seating for everyone. There were only two people working. One making the waffles and one supposedly cleaning, but the tables were a mess and there were cups everywhere because apparently the guest don't know how to clean up after themselves. The mirror in the men's bathroom was broken and the only thing anyone did was put paper towels on top of the broken glass. They didn't clean up the glass on the floor. I would not recommend the place to anyone.I have had to have my key re-magnetized every single time I enter my room. Over five days I have been waiting in line at the front desk at least twice a day to fix the key issue. Also, the AC unit is dirty and aggravated my sinuses. They seem understaffed and I am underwhelmed.Their only morning tea choice was Lipton.We rented the deluxe corner room, room was nice and clean but we expected the room to be bigger. Bathroom was clean but very small. If I come back to Baltimore City I will most likely choose another hotel.Booked through Hotwire two rooms for the weekend. Location close to convention center, and the breakfast was ok. Room was small but clean, and we had no issues with our stay. Recommended.We booked three rooms here for my friend's bachelorette party. After looking at the website we thought we would be staying at a really nice hotel for the weekend. When we arrived we saw a cockroach in the lobby. After arriving in our rooms we found ripped curtains, stained bed spreads and wallpaper peeling off of what looked like a moldy walls. We did have a refrigerator in our room, that was the only perk. We felt extremely Mislead comparing the rooms we were staying in to the pictures on the website.Enjoyed the stay. The room (King size bed) was not that spacious. Its just enough room for one person, but if you have a guest be prepared to tango while getting dressed. We found out as we attempted to grab a bite to eat they do not have a kitchen. They have a grab and go section, which has wraps, sandwiches, and salads. The deal for $10 (sandwich, fruit cup, and beverage) was surprisingly good. I grabbed the pastrami. Back to the room, the bathroom stylish, but also small. The heat, however worked great. Imagine so, since it has but so much space to heat. For some a small room would be just fine, but if you're looking for something to stretch out in this is not the spot.Expected Stay:12/23/14-12/31/14Actual Stay: 12/23/14-12/24/14Room:1201We booked this hotel for the holidays while visiting family. The reason we decided on this hotel because it was pet friendly and located near many different things.1. First issues we encountered was parking. The hotel valet parking is $32.00 per day. We were advised that our only other parking options were a public lot that charged $15.00 each time a person drives in or out. We asked about street parking and they said ""good luck"". We were also advised even if we did find street parking that we could not park on the street overnight. So we were basically forced into the valet parking. Another issue with the valet is trying to get your car. There was several times that I called to get the car and no one answered it would bounce back to the front desk. 2. There is no bell person at all. The valet will help you unload and load. However you are on your own getting things to your room. We were on the 12th floor by the way. Two people, two dogs and lots of bags and no one to assist us. I found this really weird since there were several people just standing around the front desk area. Why the need for so many front desk staff but no bell person? 3. We picked this hotel because it was pet friendly. This is really not a pet friendly hotel. There are no area's at all to take your pet to use the bathroom. The front desk front told us that we could use a grass area across the street that people took dogs. As soon as we went over to the grass area we could see many different signs saying ""no dogs on lawn."" We were very confused why the desk person would send us to an area that didn't allow dogs. Pet friendly and no pet areas at all. However if your pets have an accidents you will be charged $100.00 cleaning fee.4. The Traditional King room was the size of a closet and no way sufficient for two people. The room was booked for two people. The bathroom was not even big enough for one person. The heating didn't work properly so the room was cold most of the night. There were huge brown stains of the curtains. White stains on the floor and the blankets on the bed smelled of old newspapers. The hotel is in downtown so it is very noisy and loud at night. A hospital is very close so lots of sirens constantly.5. Breakfast was the bare minimum. Toast, cereal, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, waffles and juice. The boiled eggs tasted very old and gross. I opened the yogurt and as soon as it went into my mouth I spit it out. It tasted really funny. I looked at the date and it said 12/02/14. So the yogurt I was given by this hotel was over 24 days old. So now I know that the boiled eggs were definitely old. The yogurt was given to the front desk we when checked out so they would know about the issue. We planned to stay 8 night but after the first night decided to check out and go to Best Western Plus BWI. There was no way we could put ourselves or our dogs through this disaster of a hotel. There was really no good points about our stay at all. Just a big disappointment and a headache finding a new hotel last minute on a holiday.Decent downtown hotel but it still has the same problems that the Sheraton had when this was the Sheraton. The place is dated and the AC often doesn't work properly and you'll wake up sweating. I was sort of pissed off when I call down to the valet and they tell me the car is available for for pickup in 1 hour they estimate. I thought I misheard them so I said excuse me and they told me everyone is checking out now so it will be a while. (palm to head). The place does have its positives though. Great downtown location where you can walk to the sports stadiums and it is dog friendly. It has a nice pool and gym and the price is reasonable. Would I stay here again? Sure. Would I seek it out? No.Our room wasn't ready even though it was 5PM when we arrived. They double booked our room. Loud concert playing outside our room which was loud until 11PM even on 22nd floor. Room was dusty. Someone tried to enter the adjoining room door in the middle of the night which made me nervous. Loud neighbors even though we were in a corner room with only one other adjacent room. Luckily it was only one night. Oh and bar where happy hour took place had no dewars. What!??!!My family and I recently spent 5 nights at the hotel while my daughter underwent major surgery at Johns Hopkins hospital. From reception to the valet parking, people could not have been more friendly or accommodating.  Rooms are clean, breakfast is included, though limited.  I would recommend to anyone, especially if your visit involves the hospital.I just have to say that after reading the awful reviews for this hotel, I was pretty darn scared to come here.  But, I didn't experience ANY of the problems that everyone has complained about - the air conditioning in the whole building was really quite chilly - I was here for a conference and the meeting rooms were pretty darn cold, and my room was perfect.  All the employees were very nice too - maybe because there were a hundred or so people there for a conference, they were on their best behavior?  I don't know.  But I didn't have any problems at all.  Oh - one of my favorite things about the place was the pillows in my room - four huge down pillows on each bed - I quite literally just wanted to lounge in my room all day snuggling with those pillows!  I guess the only downfall would be that there wasn't a mini fridge in the room, or a microwave.  Most rooms have those these days.  Anyway, I would definitely stay here again.The room was small however very clean and neat. The biggest problem was that everything was unplugged. Bedside lights and clock unplugged  and required us to move the bed in order to plug in. We thought the TV was broken until we realized that too was unplugged. For $200 a night I shouldn't have to move furniture and plug in the lights.","The hotel staff is very discourteous and slow. It took us an hour to check in and when we wanted to check out there was no one available to check us out for a half an hour. A and when we did finally get someone to check us out, she acted like we were bothering her.  Plus the rooms are small. I would never stay here again.Hotel itself is old appearing. Parking is expensive $30 for valet $18 for self park across the street. Free WiFi. Nice swimming pool. There is a continental breakfast that has basics yogurt hard boiled eggs waffles pancakes and other carbs. Also cereal and milk. The shower did not have great water pressure. Beds were comfortable enough. The hotel bar had a decent selection of taps and a happy hour from 4-8pm. Not sure if I would stay here again. For being called Baltimore harbor hotel would think it would be closer to the harbor. A good 12-15 minute walk. Front desk and housekeeping were very nice.Nice hotel. Room was clean &amp; this hotel had decent amenities. Good service &amp; the continental breakfast was plentiful. Security guards were very friendly and the gym was well equipped for a good workout. Overnight parking was overpriced though. Overall I would say that this hotel was a good place to say.It was fine-but nothing to rave about. It is clearly an old building, but they have tried to keep it up to date and it seemed clean. My standard room had a fridge and microwave which was nice. The beds and pillows weren't particularly comfortable, but could have been worse. Fine for one night on a work trip, but probably wouldn't stay for longer.The room was perfect. The bell staff was great they went above and out of their way. Gerald extra kudos to him he helped mw load jn both to the conference and to my room...he also periodically passed and asked if I was ok. He made the stay feel extra special with hia attentiveness.The bar was a nightmare. The Bartender was very slow,  rude and unprofessional. A middle aged guy on Friday night with no clue how to properly service a bar and many left the bar upset and frustrated. The hotel has no food except a small cooler of very expensive sandwiches - really $3 for a Gatorade?! It was never properly stocked and price gouging.Good experience. In/out parking included. Hotel rooms are nice and the staff are attentive. We had an issue with the air in our room and they were very responsive. This hotel is not neat the harbor though so there aren't many views of this is what you're looking for. And the free breakfast is more like continental style not deluxe as advertised... That's my only hang up. Overall I would probably stay here againNope just nope, standard room means STANDARD room BUT that was not the issue , the heater didn't work , the fan worked (it blew air) but not hot air just air even cranked up to 80 , so we went down to the front and asked and they said they'd send someone up , an hour later still nothing, went down again , an hour after that still nothing , SO we fell asleep then low and behold in the middle of night the heat was on and fine , dunno if they did anything but it behind below 30 outside and no heat was not funDon't be fooled, this is NOT on the harbor. It should really be considered as being downtown.  The renovation helped a little on the inside but it is still an old building in a location that is not very convenient for most tourist attractions. It's a bit of a walk to the water front, passing through an area that is a somewhat unsavory.Where to start, beds and pillows are awesome, customer service are ok. It is clean but my big thing is the room was hot we couldn't cool it off. The maintenance guy had to come and unlock the window. The water pressure in the shower sucked. The continental breakfast was average. I would stay here again if i needed too.Service is very so-so!  Key didn't work 2 times and they tried to blame me...   Upon checkout, I did not get a receipt and was asked for an email address so they could transfer the profile and charge the account without my viewing of charges...  Bad service in my opinion!!!!!!The first receptionist was very accommodating, however the night shift was NOT. I checked in around 10:30pm and when I finally entered my room, it smelled like an astray. I called to complain, no response. I turned on the heat because it was chilly and it never came on. I think my room was colder than outside. Called downstairs, waited 20mins, no response. I finally went down to the front desk and the receptionist was rude. I decided I was not going to stay there at 12:34am and she had the never to say she would charge me half. YEAH RIGHT..... The hotel should invest in renovating the rooms, as they did the lobby.The staff were very nice to me, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this hotel.  Our room was extremely drafty and cold the entire time. In fact we went to look at the window to see if it was left open and it turned out the window had no seal on it--so we could basically feel it in our room every time the wind picked up outside.We also had 3 people in our room, all sleeping in separate beds, and they refused to give us a rollaway bed to sleep on. They insisted it was due to some fire code restriction. All I know is that there appeared to be plenty of room for another double bed in there and they couldn't even give us a measly twin to sleep on. We had to use a makeshift mattress of pillows and blankets to sleep on every night, and it was incredibly uncomfortable and cold. At one point they finally agreed to allow us to have a rollaway and promised to send it up to us. Several hours later after no one showed up I went back down and asked them where the bed was and they told me once again that they were going back on their word and would no longer give us a bed.The lobby is ok, the rooms are tiny with even tinier bathrooms.  The bathroom sink is pedestal style with very little space for anything. There was no space to put clothing if changing in the bathroom...just some very narrow glass shelves that were dusty.   The carpet in the room was old, dingy and dirty feeling and buckled in places.  The hotel offers very few amenities.  There was no safe in the room for keeping valuables.  There is no room service in this hotel and the ""tavern"" offers very few options.   The day we checked out, I noticed a problem with the bill that had been slipped under the door.  It looked like I had been charged for three days of valet parking when we had only been there two days.  I stopped at the front desk to deal with this issue while my traveling companions took all the luggage, including my bag, out to wait for the valet to bring around her car.  It turned out that they had charged two days of valet parking to a random Discover card that didn't belong to anyone in my party, and one day to my credit card.  While they were trying to figure out who's Discover card they had used, I asked if they could just please correct the charges on my card and deal with that later...which they did.  When I walked outside, my friends were waiting in the vehicle and we left.  Only when we got home (5 hours away), did I realize that my bag never made it into the car.  I called the hotel and they had it there behind the front desk.  I asked if they could ship it to me and they said that I would have to make arrangements to have it picked up and shipped.  I spoke to my friend who had been outside when the car was loaded. She said that when the valet (Bob) brought the car around she and the girls had started to put our bags in the back of the car and Bob told her that one of his guys would take care of that.  All of our bags were together on the curb.  My friend and the girls got into the vehicle while Bob's ""guy"" loaded everything in.  He asked if that was it and my friend looked at the curb where our bags had been and there was nothing there, so she said yes, that was it.  Somehow, my bag was left out.  There were several vehicles being loaded at the same time so the only thing we can guess is that my bag inadvertently got picked up by another of Bob's ""guys"" and put into another car...and then when those people said it wasn't theirs, was taken into the hotel lobby.  When I explained this to Aaron (at the front desk) on the phone that night, he told me that the valet service was not connected to the hotel and I needed to call their manager (Mr. Emerson I think he said) if I wanted my bag shipped back to me at their expense.  I asked to speak to a hotel manager and he said there was not one on duty.  I felt that since the hotel charged me for the valet service, that it was indeed an agent of the hotel and a service they provided.  Plus, the hotel had possession of my bag.  I called again at 8 am the next morning and was told by Sarah that there was no manager there, but that the staff had discussed my bag and that it was guests responsibility to keep track of their own bags.  I asked to have a manager call me and she assured me that would happen.  When I asked her how they normally handled these situations, she said that it had never happened before. (I find it hard to believe that nobody has ever left anything at the hotel before).  I waited over two hours and no manager called, so I called again. After being put on hold for over ten minutes...twice (I hung up each time after ten minutes and called again), I got Sarah again.  She told me that the manager was in a meeting and would call me when done.  I told her that I had contacted UPS to arrange for pick up and they required a weight for my bag and that it be placed in a shipping box.  She again told me that it is the guest's responsibility to keep track of their own bag.  She said that she wasn't sure what they would be able to do but she would have manager call me.  No manager ever called me.  Luckily, a co-worker of my husband who lives in Maryland agreed to drive over an hour to the hotel to pick up my bag for me and bring it the next time he comes to town for a meeting.  When I called the hotel to let them know, I was placed on hold again for over ten minutes. I hung up and called back and immediately said to please not put me on hold...that I just wanted to give them the name of the person who was going to pick up the bag.  She took the name and said she would put it on the bag.  Needless to say, this is the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  I still have never heard from a manager.  Do yourselves a favor...when you go to Baltimore do not stay at The Baltimore Harbor Hotel.We booked thru groupon looking at the nice pics ..First they said they had no booking in our name and then they gave us a card for the room with which the room wouldn't openWe went down to tell them, they got the card changed and gave it to us. We went back to the room and opened it only to find out it is occupied. Someone's Victoria secret bag n boots were lying there... They again gave us another room and this time it was a smoking room though it is supposed to be a non smoking facility. And yaaa... They charged us for parking.. Ridiculous!! Rooms arnt so great too.This was just a weekend getaway trip and a chance to see Orioles Park at Camden Yards. The Hotel was in a convenient location in regards to walking distance-- the Inner Harbor and The Baseball Stadium. A few restaurants around its locations (The Sushi restaurant around the corner was amazing). They only offered Valet Parking for a price otherwise there was pay for parking across the street for a price up to 24 hours. The Hotel itself was nice, very visually appealing but you can tell it's an older building as with most hotels. When you walk into the lobby, theres so much space. One downside would be the chandeliers, for a hotel this nice, the chandeliers are quite ugly (they were just round glass casing with bulbs in them). We got to the hotel at night and a couple was ahead of us on line, it seemed odd to me that it would take two people to check in one couple. Finally, after what seemed like forever, we checked in and it didn't take that long. We got to the room and couldn't find the switch, when we got the lights on we were able to look around the room, which wasn't as advertised. For the room itself I was disappointed, not so much in the room itself, which was nice with a huge (comfortable) King bed, typical TV channels, clean and all the comforts we needed for a weekend stay. We were more so disappointed that it was nothing like what the pictured showed when we booked it online (the size for one). We were expecting a LARGE Deluxe King and it was just a typical sized corner room with a king bed. Didn't matter too much as we weren't going to be staying there for an extended period of time but it's always better to get what you are expecting. The bathroom didn't have any amenities (razor, toothbrush, etc) as i've had in other hotels (just hand soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash- all tiny size). The view was great. I loved having so many windows and being able to open all the blinds and have sunlight come in. We were on the 20th floor which I was excited about because I'm a fan of high floors. The hotel had a pool, which we didn't get a chance to use but the view of it from our room looked nice. The hotel offered complementary breakfast and that was GREAT. They had many options from cereal (6 types), muffins, waffles that you make yourself, coffee, tea, juice, bread, boiled eggs, etc. There was a wait staff always there restocking if they ran out of something. One specific thing that I appreciate from this hotel is having breakfast until 11am!!!!!! When you're on vacation, no one wants to wake up at 6am to catch breakfast before it stops at like 8/9am! Most hotels stop serving free breakfast early so I really really like this. At times it seem like there wasnt enough seating because everyone came to breakfast. There was a bar on the premises which is always an added bonus. Overall though this was a very pleasant experience with great proximity of where we wanted to spend our time in Baltimore and would stay again upon a return visit.nice clean rooms don't make up for the lack of decent parking and the rudeness of Aaron, our desk attendant. our room has a nice view of the buildings across the street and the people below which was pretty entertainingYuck and Yikes! The hotel should not contain ""Harbor"" in its name. It's too far from it. Priceline gave it 3 1/2 stars. Shame on you Priceline. Check in was slow but when finally greeted by Justin, it got a little better. As indicated, I used Priceline. I was given a room that was dated, small, smelled of old cigarettes and had a very loud hvac unit. The bathroom sink had dried up toothpaste on it and the toilet bowl was not clean. In fact, I saw spots that clearly reflected recently use. Basically, it was just dirty and does not warrant a property that Priceline should be reflecting as 3 1/2 stars. Even the elevator smelled of old cigarettes. I won't be using Priceline to book another last minute hotel in Baltimore.DonnellWell, where do I begin? Let's see ... The room was surprisingly small, considering it cost me $245 for the night. I've paid less for a suite. Believe me, this was no suite! The bathroom is ... well, small is an understatement. It's really tiny. There's no hotel restaurant here. You'll have to walk at least two or three blocks to find anything that remotely resembles a restaurant. There's a bar, but it doesn't open until 4 pm ... Wait a second... It's after 4 now, and the bar still ain't open... Okay, Tony the bartender finally got here and opened the joint!  Hey, we're here to see the Eagles concert! So, the hotel is the least of my concerns! Well, maybe not the least. As a matter of fact, all those other reviews that mentioned the lousy air conditioning -- they're true. This hotel has one of those penny-pinching energy-saving systems that keeps the a/c pretty much in a state of non-operating limbo unless it detects movement in the room. So, if you're going to spend the night here and you like your room to be cool, you'll have to wake yourself every 10 minutes or so and wave your arms around over your head so the a/c motion detector knows you're still alive and in the room. Otherwise, enjoy your warm surroundings. Oh yeah... I almost forgot; if you want a cold soda, you'll have to go down to the main lobby and walk next door to the bar to get it. Did I mention that the bar doesn't open until 4 pm?I am staying at the Baltimore Harbor Hotel to attend the Stevie Wonder Concert. The concert was spectacular however the hotel was subpar. Let's start with the valet parking cost 35.00 for guest however on their website it said free. The Queen size beds rooms are in a corner on and get this up to the six floor. My room was facing an office building and construction site. I guess 160.00 a night gets you this in Baltimore Inner Harbor. There is no direct line to the front desk noted on the rooms phones. When you call the telephone will ring for a very long time which by then you could have walked out of your room taken the elevator to the lobby and stood at the front desk and by then no one would have answered. I left my room at 7:15 placed the heat on 90 degrees and when I returned the room was still cold. So I go through the calling of the front desk process three times when what to my wondering ears there appears an answer. I explain that I had no heat and had left the heat on 90 for about 4 hours the response was I will send maintenance at first I said ok then I thought what for me to be attacked in my room. No thank you. There was no offer to move me to another room. The lamps need replacing some work and some the leather is peeling off. No restaurant and I was referred to another hotel Monoco for a sit down restaurant. Really? If you are in a pinch and don't have time to look for a more decent hotel then stay here however I will never stay here again.I had a great weekend the hotel staff was friendly the room was clean. I am not sure of the reason for all of these bad reviews. Complimentary breakfast free WiFi. Great bargain for the price. I only wish they had free parking. Location is great you can walk to everything.","This place is an excuse for a hotel. They will charge you full price for half the necessities. The first room we went to had a bed not made and clearly not cleaned up. The second one was VERY hot. After calling the electrician and waiting till 3am twice he told us that they did not have AC in the hotel and refused to help. The bathrooms are nasty and the room is cramped. There were drunk people downstairs causing chaos and people fighting in the room right next to us. I would definitely never recommend anyone to stay here. One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a hotel. DO NOT GO HERE.I just can't say enough good things about my stay at BHH, I booked on priceline. I checked the reviews of the hotel after it was booked and I was pretty worried about the quality of my lodging. Well the place is a little oldish. But I don't think of that as a bad thing. In the reviews there was all kinds of info about how cold and drafty the place is- well in February of 2015 at -2 outside, walking through weather that froze my eyebrows- I can report that my room on the 17th floor was so toasty!!! The heater pumped out the warm vibes and with the tiniest of prompting produced balmy almost too warm temps. The sheets and towels smelled good and were nice and soft. the comforters and ample pillows were like heaven after a long day of business at an annual trade show. i would be happy to stay here again. Oh and the wifi was free and FAST!!This hotel is so so. We got a good deal. The towels were old and nasty but you get what you pay for. The room was clean and the staff was friendly.  I would stay here again, only if, I was trying to save $, otherwise I would pay more for a better hotel.The only reason I didn't give it zero stars was because I liked my room. That has nothing to do with Baltimore Harbor though, because Sheraton built this building and sold it. Whoever bought this hotel clearly has very little experience with the hotel business. The customer service is HORRENDOUS here, there is shit everywhere. It looks pretty at first, but then you find all this random shit everywhere. The night staff couldn't care less about the guests and I've had multiple employees talk back to me. I would NEVER suggest anyone stay here. It'll be gone within a few years anyway. Should be an Omni.The room was hot and the thermostat will not set lower than 73.  Facilities are clean, but no water pressure.  Staff is friendly.  Could hear people in adjoining rooms all hours during the night. Jackhammer going outside all day long... Construction!  No coffee in the bar in the evening.   We will not be back!Loved the stay. Convenient to many parts of Baltimore. Safe. Quiet. While a few websites are still advertising much larger rooms that are no longer available, the rooms are still spacious. Housekeeping was always pleasant, on time, and efficient. The front desk staff are very pleasant at all times. The attached bar could be better. Some easy events to help entertain guests would be an excellent idea. It was always a ghost town which made it feel awkward to hang around. A vicious cycle I suppose. The breakfast is advertised as a 'Deluxe Breakfast' but I would have to disagree with that. Regular coffee with no flavored creamers. Waffles, boiled eggs, cereal, and some yogurt. That's not a deluxe breakfast in my opinion. Starbucks is two blocks away. AleWife is a local pub with excellent food and drinks. A few other local spots makeup for the hotels lack in food/drinks. Overall, excellent experience and I will be staying again",,,"['night', 'drive', 'concert', 'royal', 'farms', 'arena', 'plus', 'side', 'pleasant', 'staff', 'desk', 'valet', 'room', 'clean', 'bed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-mount-vernon-hotel-baltimore,The Mount Vernon Hotel,2.5,$$,49,"We stayed here on 6/21/14. It wasn't bad. The decor was dated and getting a bit shabby,  but the room was clean. The bed was extremely comfortable, the AC worked GREAT, and our room was enormous, as was the bathroom. There is very limited parking under the hotel (get there early if you want a spot) or there is reasonably priced parking across the street.The staff was friendly and polite. I can't speak for the free breakfast quality as we generally sleep too late and miss it most places. The area is decent and only about a mile from the harbor, very short cab ride away.This hotel wasn't anything fancy or particularly special, aside from the lobby, which is rather pretty,  but I'd certainly stay again for the value/price.You can't check in until shift change. Hilarious, and awful. The woman working today until 3pm just gazed past everyone in line until her relief came in.The room honestly isn't that bad. Sure, bed bugs might be lurking, but I can't see any yet!The lamp near my bed had no light bulb. Was somewhat hard to use without it.Our room had an ironing board, but no iron.There's three of us in the room and on the reservation, but only two sets of towels. We requested more, and when housekeeping cleaned the room the next day, they left us with only two sets again.No bible. But we did find a phone book from 2008.In one of the nightstands, we found a Disney character t-shirt with the tags still on!  Bonus!  There's a safe in the room and they're nice enough to charge you for using it, even if you don't!  We put the shirt in there for safe keeping.The breakfast is good for the price (free). The staff in the cafe are the only friendly people in the entire hotel. Especially the guy with the cool chef hat. On our second day here, someone discharged a fire extinguisher in the hall outside our room. The sprayed down two hallways. Powder everywhere. It took over 15 hours for the hotel crew to even take a vacuum to it. I'm sure that stuff is safe to breathe, so no biggie.If I could summarize the Mount Vernon Hotel in one sentence it would be, ""Transitional housing unit masquerading as a ""hotel."" Sure, it's walking distance from the Harbor. Whoop-de-do, so are certain locations seen in The Wire.  This old YMCA is located near a soup kitchen and given the look and smell of some customers I think Family Services uses this hotel when it needs immediate shelter for clients.  My room was dark and old, with an outdated tube TV (didn't know those were still around), a nylon-like comforter, old light fixtures, sad little pillows ( see photo comparing its height to that of my IPad).  MOST importantly! when I found a BED BUG, the morning after my first night's stay, I was told by the very nice woman at the front desk that they had a ""problem"" but sprayed two weeks ago. NO NO NO!!!! That isn't how it works.  I checked out early and booked a room at the Hyatt.  I know this hotel might seem like a deal b/c you can get a room for $70 or less in the city, but it isn't worth the risk.  Someone else wrote ""if you are not a snob and need a room"" book this place.  I would disagree and say ""if you don't mind a skin disease and need a room, book this place.""  Seriously. Spend the extra $30 a night at stay at the Days Inn if you are on a budget.My husband and I went to a Ravens game for our one-year anniversary.  We picked Mt. Vernon because of its location, price, and the pictures online made the hotel look very charming and historic.  If we ever visit Baltimore again, we'll probably go to the Days Inn that is nearby.When we walked into our room, we noticed that our towels had fallen into the toilet.  No big deal, these things happen, and the desk clerk was quick to provide us with new towels.  Unfortunately, we didn't know at the time that our towel situation was going to get worse during our stay.  The hotel was very busy, and probably was fully booked for the weekend.  This hotel apparently does not have enough towels for each room.  We were given two towels, one for each of us.  When we requested a third towel, we were told they didn't have any more. We spent a day out in Baltimore and got caught in the rain-big time.  When we walked into the lobby (soaking wet) and asked if there were any towels available yet, the desk clerk said no.  We had a three-night stay and never had the opportunity to get any fresh towels.As we were on vacation, we slept in on most days and only got to enjoy a free breakfast once, as the cafe closes at nine o'clock.  The breakfast is served cafeteria-style and wasn't much to brag about, McDonald's makes a better breakfast, and they serve it until 10:30.  Apart from the towel situation, it still really wasn't much to brag about.It didn't feel super clean. Room was spacious. Internet worked.My second stay at the mount Vernon was horrible. The hotel smelt like mildew and bleach. One of the girls at the front desk lied to me when I was checking into the hotel and asked how much parking cost per night and she told me it was free. I end up paying almost $200 dollars in parking fees because of that girls stupidity. When I called to speak to the manager, he didn't believe my story and basically said I was a liar. The morning breakfast food is the quality of high school cafeteria food. Never staying here again.Hotel Vernon's website is deceiving, be careful of that. Yes, the rooms are cheap. Yes, the Hotel is only a stroll away from the Downtown area and a little farther from the Harbor. Yes, there is a free continental breakfast in the morning. Here's where the negatives are. Our room's AC was broken and it was pretty hot when we walked in there. Alas, it wasn't ""I'm going to die"" hot - but it was pretty uncomfortable. We had to kick off our pants and chill in our boxers, considering that you cannot open the windows. There was still trash in the bathroom garbage can too, but it just looked like paper. The bathroom and beds were clean for the most part, but in comparison to the pictures on the website it obviously did not live up to what they had made the hotel out to be. For a one night stay, I'd say not too shabby.Didn't even make it to the room. Had a late arrival and was scared for my life as I drove up to the hotel. Spend the extra money and get a hotel out of this area. Mount Vernon is in the hood.Good  Breakfast, rest  horrible.  Upon arriving, our room was hot and since  we can  not sleep in a hot room, we cranked up the air conditioning and walked down to the port.  When we came back the room was still hot and I called down to the desk who informed me that turning on the air conditioning would make the room hotter and that they had no fans.There was no toilet paper in our room but luckily we found some in the maids closet which we discovered from our room map (it was supposed to be the ice room)Our tv was  mostly snow and no remote.  Got another remote from the desk and it did not work.Breakfast was better than avge thoughMy parents have stayed here a few times while visiting my sister in Baltimore and I joined them this past visit. Hotel is decently priced and not expensive, have a buffet continental breakfast and is close to the inner harbor.On the down side, the Internet is spotty, sometimes you can pick it up, other times you can't. It can get loud, even 6 floors up, with street noise, and our room smelled musty. Our bathroom in general could have used some work to. It's a hotel and does the jobParking under the hotel in the garage is horrible. It's so tight to get anything down there and you can see where people have hit the corners. I'd opt for the parking aross the streetWe booked the hotel through Priceline. We had an emergency so had to cancel our trip last minute tonight. I called the hotel and was expecting that they would not give us a refund, but the lady ""Betsy"" was so sweet and understanding, really going above and beyond. She assured us it was going to be no problem and said they would be happy to cancel the reservation, just call priceline. :)Very painless. First class customer service!!ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE !!!! Do not stay !!!! We found a bug I'm our room !!! Pretty sure they have people living In the hotel !!! Front desk is horrible management is no where to be seen. They told myself and the people I'm staying with that they have no towels for us and one desk clerk went on to bitch about his coworkers that they did nothing for him during the day shift didn't even fold anything for him (FYI not my problem ) in other words do not ever stay here you will regret it !!!Where to start.. An absolute nightmare. I usually don't write reviews, nor do I lie or write things online if they aren't true. This was a complete mess. I drove from VA to go to an orioles game and wanted tins to be a nice night, but the only nice thing was the game. We arrived and it was 90 degrees in our room. Turning it on only made it blow hot air. We ran into a couple in the elevator who was sweating from having no AC. We called to complain about it and they said there is nothing they could do because they don't have air this time of year. Would have been nice to know that. That's not all! We walked in to stains on our blankets, sheets, and all. Right out in the open for God and everyone to see. We asked twice for new linens and they Never arrived. When calling the front desk they say that THEY don't have linens but house keeping might and they will TRY to find them. Nice service huh?  Well aside from burning up and not being able to sleep in our bed, we figure a cold shower may help so we come to find out there is no complementary soap or shampoo in the shower. We once again call and the front desk says THEY don't have any at the front desk and they believe they are all out!!! What!!!? Did someone forget to go to the dollar store before running a hotel in downtown Baltimore!? We asked for them to comp us since by the time we got back from the game it was midnight, and we walked into a sauna of a room with no sheets or shampoo and they said if they helped us with the price, we would have to leave.. That there is nothing they can do. So for 100 dollars, I sweat, slept on extra clothes that I laid down on the bed, and took a soapless, shampooless shower, and am now about to pull out of my bike sized parking spot.. PLEASE listen to me when I say don't stay here. Pay the extra 10-20 bucks to stay somewhere with clean air conditioned rooms with some kind of service!!!A really outdated hotel with very little amenities. Exterior is blah, interior is straight from the 50's movies, room is fairly clean, no gym, no parking, staff are ok, ice machine is only only the 2nd floor. Stayed here for 3 nights, wished I stayed somewhere else.I really want to give it 2.5 stars.  Its not the greatest, but its probably the best you can get for the price in downtown Baltimore.The bad:  The pics from the website are a bit deceiving, its a lot more dilapidated than the pics show.  A lot of stuff is quite visibly worn and looks a little bit dirty.  Slightly smelly room (expected for cheep downtown hotel). Free breakfast was supposed to be at 6:30.  I left at 7:10 and it still hadn't been set out, but at least there was coffee.  The good:  Of course location, the staff was very helpful and deodorized the room (not quite so successful, but I appreciated the effort.Would I stay there again - probablyStayed here for one night recently and had an afwul experience. Quickly to cover the good: affordable prices, location is near the inner harbor, free breakfast. Now for the bad- there is no parking available so you must pay for your own parking. The rooms are some of the dirtiest rooms I have ever stayed in. There were bugs in the coffee cups left in the rooms and the beds smelled awful. Honestly if these were the only things wrong with it I would only have been a little upset but that was just the beginning. I bought my ticket using hotwire but they told me they needed to run my credit card just as a confirmation and that no charges would be added. I checked my bank account after check out and saw they had charged me 90 dollars. I called the hotel and after being told to call hotwire even though i explained the 90 dollar charge had nothing to do with them I was told I could not be helped because she did not know how to pull up my account. She told me to call back the next day because that was when the manager was on duty. I called back 4 seperate times the next day leaving voicemails everytime with no response from the manager. I still have not gotten my money back from these charges and had a pretty awful stay. I would not recomend this place to anyoneI stayed here for one night, a Friday.  We arrived at the hotel around 8pm and had no wait to check-in, they even had our keys ready.  There was a huge coach (52 passenger) bus parked in the hotel lading zone when we arrived, and it stayed there overnight, so there was no where to park while you checked in.  Luckily I was travelling with another person who could wait in the car with the flashers on, otherwise I would have had to find street parking just to check-in.  Our room was on the 2nd floor, but I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of street noise.  It was very quiet. The room was quite spacious, plenty of space around both queen beds (I hate it when you get a 2-bed room and you have to squeeze between the beds b/c they are jammed so close in a tiny room!).  They could have even fit in a little loveseat &amp; coffee table with the open space in the room.While the furniture and carpet was a bit dated and slightly worn, everything was clean.  The wallpaper in the bathroom had a few spots where it was peeling, but the tub and toilet looked to be pretty new, and the sink had a nice granite counter-top.  The free breakfast was very extensive.  On the Saturday morning we were there, they offered scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries, and biscuits &amp; gravy.  They also had a selection of bread and bagels you could toast yourself.  Yogurt and fresh fruit were also available, though we missed out on the fruit as all but one piece had been taken by the time we got down there at 9:30am (breakfast is served from 7am- 10am). Coffee and juices were on offer too. I did try to park in the garage, but after parking and coming up to pay at the front desk, was told the garage was sold out and I would have to move my car. That was annoying. The garage is a tight squeeze, but easily manageable if you know how to maneuver your vehicle and don't drive an enormous SUV.This is not a top of the line hotel, but it is affordable and clean.  As for the quality of the neighborhood, it's Baltimore, so just keep in mind that's the type of city you're in and be smart about it. I felt perfectly safe inside the hotel, but wouldn't go wandering the streets at midnight.Very nice hotel.  The rooms were clean, the staff friendly.  Breakfast is good.  They have an underground parking lot, but if you're driving a full size suv or larger, it's tight.Neighborhood is pretty good too.  We wound up staying there a second time we went to Baltimore.Not the fanciest hotel, but well worth the price.If you're looking for a place to crash for a night, it's not that bad. The room was clean - there was some washed-in stains on the sheets but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Park in the 15 West Franklin Street garage - $4 for 24-hour parking on weekends and located right across the street.The website will lead you to believe you'll be staying in luxury but I assure you this won't be the case. The price is decent for Baltimore. It's a bit further from the harbor than I'd like and it's a pretty hilly walk but it's an okay choice. The free breakfast was run of the mill. The egg's were slimy though. I couldn't even finish them. The AC/heater only blew out hot air, so luckily it wasn't a super hot weekend, being that it was early April. There was also garbage in the bathroom's garbage can, which is gross. When you're paying a low price relative to the area, your expectations should be relatively lowered as well. With that in mind, this place is alright for a night or two.","For the price - less than $70 per night - how could you possibly beat the Mount Vernon Hotel? The location allows you to enjoy all the best of what Baltimore has to offer - venture south for the harbor, take a stroll in the neighborhood for some intimate restaurants and an art museum, or drive a little further north for Hampden. The room decor leaves something to be desired, but no chain hotel in the Inner Harbor is going to offer you groundbreaking interior design. If it's clean, who cares? You can return home to your feng shui in just a few short days. The hotel has an underground parking garage with an elevator that will take you directly to your room, and you get free breakfast vouchers to use during your stay. When we arrived for breakfast before 11AM on a Sunday  morning, we may have seen spaghetti and meatballs, but that didn't stop us from stealing a cup full of Raisin Bran for our ride home.In short: if you're not a snob, and you need a place to stay, book a room here.PROS: Cheap price for the location ($60/night in downtown Baltimore), front desk staff was attentive and helpful, within walking distance of lots of little shops and boutiques.  Not a bad view from the clean room, either.CONS: Bed was uncomfortable... extremely firm, but not in a good way like in the commerical where they have a wine glass on the bed and are jumping on it yet it doesn't spill.  Staff didn't mention the air conditioning was broken, but they brought us a fan after we called to ask why the AC didn't seem to be cooling the room at all. It was noisy so we turned the fan off.  Oh well.P.S. I would recommend Maisy's restaurant a few streets over, which we discovered browsing aroundThis is a case of you get exactly what you pay for. Clean hotel in a good location, but bare bones. Parking is $15 extra, and the lot is the smallest, worst designed underground lot I have seen! I ended up scratching my brand new car trying to gingerly come around the corner. Breakfast is until 10 am, and if you do what I did and sleep till 9:55 by accident you can't even get coffee. What is so hard about having coffee available? The bed was fine, but the pillows were....flat doesn't really describe it fully. Like a pancake. You get exactly what you pay for here...is it worth it? I don't think so.You know how you see an older person who dresses well and looks good even at their advanced age? Well that's kinda how I felt about this place. Nice enough place that is still holding it all together after all these years.Located in downtown Baltimore, a decent walk from the Inner Harbor is this hotel. A former YMCA it looks quite distinguished from the outside (and from it's website and brochures). Going in though you see that it has seen better days. Things look older or worn down. The feel is like of a place that was once greater than it is now. That's OK because for the very reasonable price, it's not bad when you think about it. I stayed overnight for a conference and settled into the room before going to the events. My room was sizable with an indirect path into the spacious bedroom space. The furniture looked colonial and a bit dated. Like something your grandparents might have in their home. There was one window, a king-sized bed that was comfortable enough, a desk with side drawers from which you could write from, a TV cabinet that was probably used for clothes at one time with a basic TV with basic cable. Two nightstands held classical-looking lamps. The alarm clock was like a travel clock but was plugged in with the accurate time listed. The carpet felt worn with no padding but wasnt an issue. The bathroom door was small but the bathroom had a nice countertop, ornate mirror and a suitable shower that produced a nice flow of hot water. The control to the shower had ""Pull"" written on it and there was a well-worn drain stopper chained on the side. Despite the unusual look, it was adequate for me ( A woman might feel differently). The place offers a nice enough breakfast with eggs, bacon, hash browns and grits as well as chilled cranberry and orange juice. I didnt have the cereal or french toast but everything was modestly provided by the very sweet chef ( you should tip her). I saw a few Europeans who no doubt probably felt this place was more like it appears in it's lietrature and online. It is a bit deceiving. The place has a piano in the lounge and underground parking. The surrounding area is urban, reflecting what Baltimore once was and how this part of town has been gentrified. Kinda reminded me of Boston, Mass. Overall though, I liked the place. The price was right. I noticed from the outside that my room had windows that were effectively built over. The sheets and some of the towels were on the thin-side (Some discount, high thread-count sheets are in order) but I was downtown and felt relaxed in the space. For what I was paying for, it was alright with me. I would go back if I was looking for a decent place to stay without wanting to pay a whole lot for it all.Check in at the hotel begins at 3pm.  So when we arrived at 320pm to check-in, I was disappointed to see that my room was not yet ready.  I was not the only one that had this problem.  Approximately 2 dozen people had to wait as their rooms were cleaned and ready for them to check in.  The hotel manager was nowhere to be found when we asked to speak with him/her.  The reason for the manager being unavailable was that they were busy cleaning rooms to get everyone checked in.  The scene in the lobby was a mess.  It didn't help that the lobby had no air conditioning.  We did not get into our room until approximately 5pm.  Furthermore, only one of the two elevators were working.  Once we got into our room, our telephone didn't work.  The only reason this place gets two stars from me was that the rooms were clean, and the hotel was reasonably priced compared to other hotels close to the harbor.  The parking garage is across the street, and it charges $4/day during the weekends.I travel to Baltimore often and to be honest, I'd rather pay money for a hotel then drive back to Virginia drunk than not drink.Anyway, I first stayed here after purchasing a LivingSocial deal. Ironically enough, to pay full price on the govt rate is the same as the LS price except you only get parking if you have the LivingSocial voucher which sucks. I guess normally they have parking here that's included but until the deal expires, you're shit out of luck and have to park across the street and pay $10/night weekdays and $4/night weekends. It's definitely not so much a cost thing but more of a ""fuck, we're in Baltimore lets not get out car stolen"" type of thing.In regards to the hotel, it's ok. It's old (or as they say ""historic"") so don't expect to walk into a glamorous place. For the most part the hotel is well maintained but the rooms are pretty gross. We did a complete bed bug inspection and while it passed, we did find stray hairs and random cracker crumbs under the mattress. Take from that what you will. Aside from sleeping and monkey business, we spend more time outside the hotel enjoying Baltimore stuff. What really won us over to come back was the price and location. While you are not walking distance (unless you really wanna WALK) to the inner harbor, you are a $5 can ride away. Literally, $5 for two people. There is also a few nice places within walking distance (nice Spanish place).  WiFi is included. Staff generally nice. No fridge but they will send one up if you ask.GOOD: Decent rooms (stayed in a queen double), nice staff, cheap. you don't necessarily need a car since it's very close to bus lines (including the free Charm City Circulator), walking distance from a variety of restaurants + bars on Charles Street, more of a haul but still easily doable to walk to the Inner Harbor, and I saw some Zipcar spaces in the neighborhood.OKAY: I eat mostly vegetarian and I can't have eggs, so the free breakfast was more like a free bagel - though they may have had more variety if I had went to breakfast earlier. Some other people have said it's in a bad area or whatever - I (a twenty-something suburban girl) would not wander around by myself at night but I felt fine with another twenty-something suburban girl. Wi-fi was a little spotty for a day but I think they put in a new network while I was there (some rooms can probably pick up a good signal from the Enoch Pratt Library).BAD: Housekeeping could have been better. The room wasn't dirty, per se, but under the bed etc hadn't been swept in awhile.My boyfriend and I stayed there for two nights because we were at a wedding and the entire wedding party was staying there with the exception of bride and groom. it was probably one of the worst experiences ever. I got $60 stolen out of my wallet when the cleaning lady was there. the room is dirty and just moldy. our friends room had hand prints everywhere on the bed frame. it was disgusting. the bath tub still had hair and stain in in. Not sure how people still stayed in this hotel. oh and the hotel never resolved the issue of the thief that stole my moneyThe hotel was decent. It's not the best but it is clean. Like I told my cousin who accompanied me on my trip, "" it has character"".  Pros:  Located in a decent area, we walked A few blocks during the day when we got here to see the area. Free breakfast (may not be the best but it's free).Cheapest hotel around the area.Maids/cleaners folded my blanket and pillow on the bed. (sweet gesture seeing as other places I have stayed they have just left it waded up.Cons: 15$ a night parking in the garage under the building which was very oddly set up (park across the street for 4$ a night unless you plan on leaving a lot) Kinda werid smell in the hall and when you first walk in. Request not to be near the elevator! We are tucked back in a corner but the elevator makes buzzing noises as it goes up and down to each floor. It would be annoying with a room right across from it.I stayed here for three nights last week, and I feel like this place is being slagged a little. Then again, I'm not someone who gets bothered by mismatched carpet or elevator problems (that's why there's the stairs, in my opinion). Here's my take:GOOD:- As affordable as the area gets.- Very close to Charm City Circulator- in the middle of a great neighborhood, Mount Vernon. I loved hearing the bells at the top of the hour from the nearby Basilica, and one of my prime destinations (the Walters Art Museum) was less than a 5-minute walk. I wasn't out after 9pm but comments that this neighborhood was unsafe don't make much sense to me.- breakfast was better than I expected. Hot line varied daily, with French toast, pancakes, various meats, scrambled eggs, and potatoes seen. Aside from that, a couple of cereals (corn flakes and...something else), yogurt, and a variety of bagel types (and they weren't the cheap packaged bagels).- of the 4 hotels I tried to take an actual bath in on our road trip, this was the only one that had an actual stopper.- no problems with wifi- cheap, convenient parking deck across the street ($10 per 24 hrs), though I arrived at 8pm Saturday evening and took advantage of unregulated meter parking outside the hotel until moving on Sunday night.- the city had a water main break during our stay, and even though the hotel was not at fault they comped my night's stay and offered free bottled waterUNGOOD:- you can hear what's going on in the next room at times. Couldn't tell how elevated the volume had to get to bleed through, but we heard our neighbors in the evening enough to comprehend some of their conversation.- would have been nice to have a fridge- yes, the elevators were acting up for most of our stay in one way or another, but one was usually working and the stairs were fine for anything otherwise In any case the pros far outweigh the con. A great base for seeing a great city!This hotel is good if you're not planning on spending too much time in your room and you don't want to pay that much money. The rooms aren't anything to brag about but what is good is their free breakfast is pretty on point. Another plus about this place is their location, it's walkable to the inner habor and it's also about a block away from the free shuttle stop. I'll probably only come back here for the free breakast--everything else is sub par.Ok- this isn't hotel Monaco or the ritz but its super cheap. I have stayed here twice and will again for the price and location. The furnishings are old and everything is dated but it's fine for a place to crash when visiting Baltimore. I've had only positive experience with the staff. The free breakfast is excellent. Grits, eggs, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, fruit, yogurt. It's a definite perk. Affordable parking across the street.The hotel was pretty nice, affordable and basic, no frills. The full service breakfast was also really impressive (eggs, bacon, potatoes, biscuits, juices, coffee, etc.). This definitely helped since everything else in Baltimore is so expensive. There is a $15/day charge for parking in their ""hidden"" garage. We drove around the block a few times before we finally found it. You have to physically get out of the car to open the garage door (with your room key). We chose this hotel because it was ""just blocks from the Harbor"". Well, it's about 10 blocks away, which isn't awful for walking, but the neighborhood is super sketchy, and didn't seem that safe. After a couple of days, we ended up driving over to the Harbor instead, but then couldn't find parking for under $20. No knock to this hotel, because it was overall pretty descent, but in the future, I would spend the extra money to stay closer to the Harbor.I lived in the Mount Vernon Hotel for 5 weeks while teaching at Baltimore International College.  The experience was just like being at home.The prospect of living in a hotel for 5 weeks was not exciting to me, but this place has a very homey feel and the staff is outstanding.  At the front desk, Andy and Ben were always accommodating, regardless of the request.  The room I had was like many of the historic Bed and Breakfast Inns I've stayed in.  It was a loft with huge living room area and upstairs bedroom.  The 20 foot antique windows looked out over the street and gave me a sense of being right in the middle of it all.  Something the Holiday Inn can never duplicate.If your expectations are a sterile, brand new Marriott-type hotel, this is not the place to come.  However, if you like interesting architecture, unique rooms in an historic atmosphere, just like an excellent B&amp;B experience, you should stay here.The rates are considerably less than Inner Harbor locations and I feel you get A LOT more for the money.  Plus, the location is absolutely perfect if you want a Baltimore experience other than the strictly tourist areas.The hotel is within 5 minutes walk of just about every theater, museum and restaurant you could ever want, and a 1/2 block off the central Charles Street Corridor, including the Washington Monument.If you really need the Inner Harbor tourist spots, it's just a 10 minute walk down Charles Street.  Another 10 minutes walk and you're in Federal Hill or Little Italy.They have on-site parking which is incredibly convenient in a city with crowded parking problems.For the reviewers that say it's near a ""ghetto"" (using that word shows the paranoia), it's not true.  The hotel is in the middle of a busy city where people may not look like you do.  I think that's the beauty of it.  I needed no ""burly man"" to walk around any time of day or night.  If you're scared by an urban environment, the neighborhood is not your problem, you should visit Kansas or something instead.I was introduced to the Mount Vernon area by this hotel and was so impressed that I wound up relocating within a few blocks.  Too bad I'll be living near by, because I'd love to stay here again.  I'll be sure to send all my friends and relatives that come to visit Baltimore.Thank you Mount Vernon Hotel and Staff for a fantastic re-introduction to Baltimore.Thought the location was pretty decent, especially for the price we paid for a room. It also has very cheap parking in a garage across the street. Room was clean. Walls are a bit thin but not too bad. Complimentary breakfast which was just okay -- had fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, unappetizing eggs and sausage though... I agree that the reviews which state it's near the ""ghetto"" are not true and I'm assuming these reviewers have never even lived or stayed near an area that would be considered a ghetto... Overall if you are looking for a decent place to spend a night in Baltimore, don't count out Mount Vernon Hotel. Pretty good bang for your buck.This place is a total dive. The one thing it has going for it is the price, and you certainly get what you pay for. For the sake of expediency, I'll just list my complaints:It was dirty, the room smelled dingy, was missing shampoo, a do not disturb tag and a light bulb, the internet was functionally useless, the ""business room"" was the size of a closet, the air conditioning was poor, and there was neither vending nor ice machine on our floor.Wtf man.  For a hotel downtown I was disappointed.  I just finished running the Baltimore marathon at 12pm. Finished four beers at the beer garden and all I could think about was taking a nice shower and taking a nap on a nice bed. So I BS'ed around until 3pm.  But NO...........  I get here and my room is not ready for the 3pm check in.  So I wait an hour to check in because non of the king rooms are ready.  Im tired and need a shower while I'm sitting here watching other people check in to their queen and double rooms.  So I finally get my room an hour later and I admit the room was decent.  The sheets on the bed sucked though. Kinda harsh.   Im sorry, all hotels should be prepared for check in or at least offer another comparable room.Great place to stay if you like roaches and bad smells...would have been better off sleeping in the car.WARNING: An outsider targets guests by pretending to be hotel staff.  The front desk transferred a guy to my room at 1:30 am and he pretended to be from the front desk.  He said there was a freakish meltdown with the hotel computer system and that they needed to manually enter guest information.  He said it was an issue that needed to be dealt with immediately because of hotel liability and guests that could slip by without paying (because all of their information was gone).  He told me I could come downstairs or give him my info over the phone.  The worst part about  this is that when I told staff and management, no one so much as apologized.  Moreover, they didn't appear to document it or take the issue seriously at all.  They did not appear to be concerned in the slightest that outside individuals are targeting their guests for credit card fraud.Other problems I had with the hotel:room smells bad and bedding appears to be from the 80s.  I didn't complain about this or change hotels.  I adjusted by buying and spraying a lot of febreeze and purchasing pillows.  housekeeping was sub par.  There was a tampon wrapper floating in the toilet when I arrived and no conditioner stocked with the toiletries.  I left a note for housekeeping to leave it the next day.  They wrote on the note that they would bring it back.  They never did.  I found out at check out that the hotel doesn't even carry conditioner.wake up call didn't happen.  I asked the front desk for a wake up call and I watched her write my request on what I can only assume was the wake up call sheet.  That wake up call never occurred (PS I was staying there because I was taking the Maryland bar.  Punctuality was very important.  So was uninterrupted sleep.)manager response.  I received no apology, condolences, or anything positive at all, despite the fact that I was calmly explaining my situation and not even demanding anything at that point.  The manager's response was his hotel is always booked, he doesn't receive complaints from guests, and his staff are exceptional.  So, his response was more of a rebuttal to my complaint than anything.I stayed here for a trip to a conference at the Baltimore Convention Center.  It didn't look too far away on MapQuest.  In reality, it's right on the cusp of the decent Inner Harbor area and the somewhat frightening ghetto.Walking to the Inner Harbor took about 15 minutes and was fine during the day time.  The streets were also easy to navigate.  It's right across the street from a big, beautiful library.  However, I wouldn't suggest walking at night unless you are in a big group or have a big burly man with you (or I suppose if you are a big burly man yourself).The rooms in the hotel were not great-- they were decent.  The air was stale and the elevators were borderline creepy.  Nowhere on their website or in any reviews did anyone mention the fact that the hotel houses college-age dormitories on their top floors, so there are often young people in their pajamas hanging out in the lobby area.The reception desk people were very friendly and helpful.  They offer free breakfast for every morning that you are there and the architecture in the area is very nice.All in all, the hotel was a nice experience and you get what you pay for (it's relatively cheap), but if I would have known how close to the ghetto it was, I would have looked for something closer to the Inner Harbor, even at a higher price.","If your looking for fancy, look somewhere else..if your looking for a hotel with a bed, bathroom and electric than this is your place. Our room was alittle dirty when we checked in, garbage behind the nightstands and the garbage pail still had garbage in it. If you stay here, bring your own pillow cause the ones supplied were absolutely horrible. Decent breakfast considering, parking was a parking lot across the street which was very cheap and convenient($8 for the weekend). 10 minute walk to the inner harbor, which is fine during the day, sketchy at night, take a cab but be careful of cabbies trying to get one over on tourists, shouldn't cost more than $5. Staff was friendly.I got a good groupon deal for this spot so it was great price. Im pretty sure there are better hotels around this one but i have to admit that i like the location a lot. as for the stay, things like newer tv with better programming, newer heating, and some newer furniture would bump this stay up to four star in no time. Its an old hotel in a very busy area so i can see why its still there. Me and my girl liked the stay so given another shot with a good deal id go again.Pros:Clean, hot breakfast included, close proximity to inner harbor, easy check in and check out, accommodatingCons:Staff is not that knowledgeable about tourist information.Based on the mediocre reviews, I was nervous to give this hotel a try. But I had a definite budget and was only going to Baltimore to take the LSAT, so I thought I'd risk it. However, the hotel was a completely pleasant surprise. This has got to be the best value hotel near the harbor. The rate is extremely low on the weekend ($60 when I booked through Priceline) and it's in a nice location near the harbor and a couple museums. There are also a number of restaurants fairly nearby, as well as places that will deliver to the hotel. The service is also extremely helpful and accommodating. Throw in the free breakfast (which is not bad) and this is honestly the best deal in Baltimore - I know, I researched A LOT. The parking garage was probably the only aspect that needed improvement (my boyfriend literally did an 11-point turn to get out of our spot in the morning), but that's my only complaint. It was definitely very secure. While I wasn't impressed by Baltimore as a city, I was extremely impressed by this hotel.I went to Baltimore in May and needed a hotel for one night.  The cheapest hotel looked like it might not be too clean.  This was the second-cheapest hotel I could find, and it was a great deal for the price.The room was basically clean. There were little things I wish they'd change, but they weren't too distracting overall. For example, some of the furniture was nicked and showed slight signs of wear, they hadn't swept behind the nightstand in quite a while, there was no luggage rack to put my luggage on, the TV had some basic cable channels but didn't have the ABC,CBS, NBC or Fox networks, and the coffee maker was on the counter in the bathroom because there was no counter space in the sleeping area. But none of those things really bothered me, so I don't count them as negatives.On the plus side, the king-size bed was huge and comfortable, the shower was clean and had great water pressure, and the complimentary breakfast buffet was very impressive (if you have no dietary restrictions).  French toast, sausages, scrambled eggs, hash browns, instant oatmeal, yogurt, very fresh apples and oranges, and lots of cereal. I had eggs and potatoes, which were fresh and hot. The french toast and the sausages also looked really good if you like those items. Unfortunately, I didn't notice any juice. All they had to drink was coffee, Lipton tea, and sugary fountain drinks.The dining room is large and the decor overall is lovely. It's a converted old building and they've retained all the charm and architecture. Even the pictures in the rooms are interesting. It was centrally located and I could walk where I needed to go.This isn't a 4-star hotel, but for the price, it's perfectly serviceable in a convenient location and well worth the cost.As another reviewer said, Mount Vernon Hotel offers great value for the money.   The pros: Rooms are clean and large.  Parking is a relative value at $15/night.  Staff is extremely helpful and friendly.The cons: Dated decor, both in the rooms and the lobby.  The parking garage is SUPER tight--good thing I have a compact sedan!  Not necessarily the BEST neighborhood, particularly at night.I stayed overnight at the Mt. Vernon, and everything was clean and serviceable. The place could use some updating and there were some quirks (every door seemed to have a different trick to open it - lift this handle up, turn that one a little to the left), but all in all, this was a fine, inexpensive place to lay our heads. I appreciated the laid-back, friendly staff. If you get a chance, ask for Room 102, which is bigger than my apartment and has a loft!Great value for the money. Cheap, but still in a nice neighborhood and within an easy mile walk of the Inner Harbor. The staff was pleasant and efficient. Our room was much nicer than I expected it to be given the dated appearance of the exterior and public areas of the hotel. Our room was very clean, with nice furniture and a good view of the surrounding neighborhood. Our cable was a little weird--we only got some random channels--but I don't go to other cities to watch TV so I didn't really care.I read a lot of reviews before staying in this hotel and most were right. It is clean and comfortable but its decor is outdated. There were no bed bugs, thank God! I really appreciate good customer service so this 2 1/2 -3 star hotel gets an additional star because they were extremely friendly and helpful when we needed it. They also upgraded us to king sized beds which was great and we really appreciated it. Its location is okay. Mount Vernon is not exactly an exciting place to stay but Inner Harbor is pretty close, about a 15-20 minute walk away.The negatives about this hotel -some hotel guests seem to think it's okay to go to the complimentary breakfast in their pajamas. I wish the hotel would have mandated that guests be dressed when they come down to the lobby and cafeteria- the breakfast was edible but nothing I would go to a restaurant and pay for -there were some people loitering in front of the hotel when we got back on Sunday night. They didn't look like hotel guests so that took away from the hotel's image",,,"['bad', 'decor', 'dated', 'getting', 'bit', 'shabby', 'room', 'clean', 'bed', 'extremely', 'comfortable', 'worked',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/pier-5-an-ascend-hotel-collection-member-baltimore,"Pier 5, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3.5,$$$,45,"We loved this place. We came for my birthday weekend. The staff were super friendly and professional. They remembered our names. On Saturday, they host the ""Chocolate Event"" and it was wonderful. We also had the National Aquarium package.It was an amazing weekend and highly recommend you stay here. In the famous words of Arnold, ""We'll be back"".Call them. Ask for a room and work with the front desk. I tried Expedia, Priceline, and <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> and just kept getting higher prices for rooms. Calling them directly, I was greeted with friendly service - but ontop of that... they saved me money for the room!Now I will say, the view was ""A-OK""... hence the 3 star rating. There were more expensive rooms with the patio.... though those were booked, so I asked for the next best thing - and it wasn't a bad view but it wasn't breath taking either. Overall, I had a fine stay here although the annoying thing as check-out was at 12pm the next morning... room service came at 9am in the morning knocking on our door, asking us when we were going to leave.... that to me was a little rude. Other than that, everyone else was ridiculously friendly and the place was overall clean. Does feel about 6-7 years old though (building/materials).We loved this place. I booked it the first time via Groupon but will absolutely book again with or without! I must say, however, that the $40.00 a day for valet parking threw me for a loop but I was informed that the parking lots are privately owned by the city. You'd think that a resort this big would have it's own lot.So ok, $40.00 parking aside, we checked in. I was under the impression that I'd purchased the package with breakfast and a bottle of wine included. Well, I didn't. No problem said Brett at the desk. He appeared with a cold bottle of chardonnay and 2 tickets for a beautiful breakfast buffet that is served in the lobby every morning. Nice. And about the lobby, lets not forget about ""Crabby Hour"". Every night is a different theme with the chef teaching how to make everything crab. So just so you understand, everything crab and matched cocktails, free and just part of the awesomeness that is Pier 5.I would be remiss not to mention that adjoined to the hotel on either side is a Ruth's Chris that has  spoiled me for oysters and carpaccio forever more, and a McCormick and Schmik's.If you go, remember that you have to request a refrigerator for your room. Enjoy!Just returned from my second stay at Pier V Hotel in the inner harbor in Baltimore. First time was a couple trip and I loved that I was allowed to bring my Lab and how nice they were to him. This second time was a work trip and I had convinced my boss and colleagues to stay here rather than at the Hyatt where our convention was. Brett made it an extremely fun stay with all of his happy hour activities- wine and crepe night. We missed whiskey Wednesday and paint night. The hotel staff was wonderful especially Brett., who made us laugh and joked with us making it memorable.   Could not recommend higher. Location is convenient and a more unique corner of the harbor, lovely balconies, convenient to little italy, Ruth Chris, McCormack and Schmidt, national aquarium, etc.  this was a much nicer experience than we would have had in a bigger chain. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g60811-d120957-r299555377-Pier_5_Hotel-Baltimore_Maryland.html&amp;s=e33372021d3914353a46947ba610965c55e668d2388559516b78511b6d09d8a9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>Dated, Dirty, and Disappointing....the only saving grace is that it's located on the water. They need to do a soft goods (furniture, curtains, and carpet) renovation at the very least to bring it up to par with the other hotels in the area.Stayed there with my gf this past week.  It is on the Inner Harbor, with the aquarium a 5 min walk.  They are *very* dog friendly, with no restrictions on dog size, type, etc. - no pet deposit either, and, your dog can stay in the room by itself.  Also, every day during the week they have a different ""crabby hour"" which they call happy hour.  Tuesday is sushi, wine, and beer - all free.The hotel was very clean - the room was very spacious and modern.Only downside is that it's $40/day to valet park and the wifi wasn't working very well (it was included in a mandatory hotel fee).This place continues to go down hill... stayed here for business on 11/17 and the experience was pretty bad. Rooms are very dated, dirty, and falling apart. Water stains, peeling wallpaper, NASTY bathroom!! I wish I had taken some pictures to post. They even charged an additional 9.95/day for ""Guest Services"" which was not explained to me when I checked in. When I questioned the charge on checkout I was told ""you initialed to accept this charge sir"" when I challenged the woman she basically gave me the oh well response... can sum it up in a single word, DUMP!!I really like this hotel for it's funky cool design and location.  Second time I've stayed here.  The rooms are spacious and well appointed for a very comfortable stay.  The staff is very friendly and helpful as well.  Pier 5 feels more like a boutique hotel, not like the big chain hotels.  They have ""Crabby Hour"" M-F featuring a chef who teaches you how to make fabulous crab dip. Then you get to enjoy it with drinks. I recommend requesting a harbor view room to enjoy the beauty of the Inner Harbor.  Located just steps away from restaurants and everything the Inner Harbor offers, the location can't be beat.  Compared to the price of other waterfront, and not waterfront, hotels in the area, Pier 5 is priced significantly below similar hotels. They offer valet parking for $38 or you can park in the public lot next door for $22 a day, so parking is easy.I'm looking forward to my next stay here.Ritz Carlton and Four Season level service! Best stay for New Years! Checkin with Donita was outstanding. Front desk provided coupons for free and reduced prices for places having celebrations within walking distance of the hotel. Complimentary champagne, noise blower, hat, happy hour with crepes and fantastic crab dip.  What more could you want? Chris made the best omelets I have ever had at the fantastic buffet bar. Chris has a phenomenal personality that starts your day. Loved the lobby.  Price was reasonable and you are right on the water.  Ruth Chris is also in the building so I did not have to go outside. Love the tree in the lobby. Walking distance to great shopping, convenience stores.  Loved this place. I will return.I'm hard pressed to understand why some give this hotel poor marks.  I was here for two days for a staff meeting and everything was great.   The meeting room for 24 was adequate and the food was terrific.  My guest room in the second floor was nice. No complaints.   The lobby area was welcoming and a group of us watched a presidential debate over a few bottles of wine.  I will definitely stay here again.  Location was the best. Next to the aquarium and three block walk to little Italy where we went for dinner.This is one of those places that was the coolest thing in the world when I discovered it but now it's just meh.  The primary reason is the decor.  When I first stayed here it was 2000 and the decor looked incredibly hip and contemporary.  15 years later, it looks like it was furnished by Ikea.  In 2000. The staff is nice enough but not really engaged so you just kinda feel like you're on your own.  And the cavernous lobby adds to that feeling.  I'll go back because the location is great and the prices are reasonable.  But it no longer holds the allure it once had.I had my wedding here in February 2014.  When I booked the venue, I lived half a world away in Hawaii, so let me tell you, I was NERVOUS about this whole thing.  I saw that the Yelp reviews weren't that hot, but I decided to go with them because out of all the establishments I talked to in the venue selection process, Pier 5 had the most top notch customer service.  They were the most straightforward about price and what to expect and I appreciated that so much. My wedding planner from the hotel was Chris Sikora and he was just phenomenal throughout the whole years' worth of planning.  He stayed in close contact with me throughout the process and I wasn't nervous about any of it.  Pier 5 handles everything, from the food (which was so good my guests can't stop talking about it a year later) to the cake, the liquor, and the decorations, they have it all. It was effortless for my friends and family to book rooms, and they got a pretty steep discount for being a part of my wedding.  Everyone really enjoyed their stay, and the extra perks (like the bridal room and the groom's room) were excellent.On the day of my wedding, I didn't have to stress at all.  Chris and his team took care of everything beautifully.  The servers were so awesome!  My bridal assistant was just phenomenal as well.Basically, I could keep going about how wonderful the whole experience was, but I think you get the point.  I will never forget my wedding at Pier 5 and I would never hesitate to recommend it to any bride-to-be.Great location but you're stuck paying at least $24 for parking in an outdoor lot. Super loud AC unit in room. Light in bathroom didn't work. It's pet friendly, so that is cool...Look guys, you can't generate goodwill and the likelihood of return visits when you stiff people $20 for valet parking. Your neighbor Ruths Chris steakhouse offers the very same service for $8 and the classy Cinghiale in nearby Harbor East offers it for $0. My point is this: you miss a great opportunity for future business when people are onsite to attend an event and exit with a bad taste in their mouths.Very noisy room bc the walls r so thin. The resort fee of $10 and a $22 self parking fee per day didnt help. even with a $22 parking fee, there is no guarantee one will find a parking spot since anyone can park in the lot if willing to pay. the hotel is located right behind the aquarium, so that is a good thing. This hotel allows pets so if one has pet allergy, might want to think twice before booking.Not really sure why this hotel is not rated higher! I would hands down stay here next time I am in town. The location of this hotel is right on the harbor close to everything! Look no further if you are looking to stay in Baltimore. Stayed here Friday/Saturday night. Super cute boutique hotel. Staff is top notch/super friendly and helpful! You can find the GM socializing with the guests and this is something I have not seen at any other hotel. Everyone was always smiling and saying hello to the guests. This hotel offers a ""crabby hour"" during the weekdays with complementary beer/wine and delicious crepes in the lobby and ""chocolate hour"" on weekends with complimentary champagne and chocolate/carmel fondue. Not really sure where else you would get something like this at any other hotel. The room was spotless and everything was updated in the room. Thanks to everyone who made our trip as great as it was!   To anyone who complained about paying for parking.. what do you expect? Its a city I am pretty sure that every city hotel I have ever been to makes you pay for parking one way or an other whether its included in the daily rate or charged separately..1st thing I must say is we stayed here for very cheap, almost 70% off their regular price. So, that makes a BIG difference for a review..... You don't seem to expect or demand as much when you get a great deal. Anyway, nice place, spacious rooms with high ceilings,  great location that allows you easy walking to the entire inner harbor and Little Italy. It's also very beautiful at night due to it's location on the water. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.Stayed for a couple of nights for a wedding.  Very nice hotel.  Staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable.   Pet friendly, so we had our 75 pound puppies.   Would definitely stay here againHad to stay the night in Baltimore because of a concert (I didn't feel like driving back to DC after rocking out and possibly drinking) but my options were limited since I have a dog. Lucky for me the pier 5 hotel is in the prime location of Baltimore's inner harbor, my room even faced the Baltimore aquarium and harbor. The staff was friendly and welcoming and treated my dog like the princess she is. The room, was fun (bright bold colors) and inviting. They even were nice enough to make recommendations on restaurants that were dog friendly. The hotel was within walking distance of the concert venue which made it ideal for the evening as I was able to stumble back (drunk, with the help of a friend) to my room. My dog was happy here too, I feel like I got my money's worth and I would definitely stay here again.Stayed here 3 nights. We couldn't have asked for a better stay. The staff was great. The rooms were clean. We attended ""crabby hour"" twice. Fun and free wine. How can you go wrong? Would definitely stay here again.","I read past reviews on Yelp and was not really sure what to think. It almost seemed like things were suspiciously bad.Anyway, I am sitting in their ridiculously chic lobby to set the record straight because I love this hotel too much to not share!Think W hotels but slightly more laid back and better customer service.Seriously.This is a independent, non-chain, cute little boutique hotel that has funky decor and art all over the place. They have Ruth Chris (yes, that ridiculous steak restaurant) and McCormick's &amp; Schmicks (seafood!) attached to their lobby and spilling out onto the street with waterside tabels. No bland full-service hotel restaurant here! Only the good stuff. For breakfast they had eggs, waffels, paninis, bagels, yogurt, coffee, etc. right there in the lobby- more than enough to start the day.The aquarium is literally next door, and power plant will fulfill any bar/club craving you have. The gallery has some nice shops, though this area is probably better known for restaurants, not shopping.The rooms were cute. Again, the whole art theme. They are not your bland, beige decor. You can tell that this hotel is not brand spanking new, but whatever- you're not paying an arm and a leg for it. And it's completely unique and independent. It's really nice to stay somewhere different that is not a cookie cutter place you would pay the same- actually probably more- for.Oh yeah, and free craft beer during their happy hour/crab dip making class. And free wine with their chocolate fountains (food is free as well!). Seriously, what hotel does that?! At the Pier 5. That's where.Okay enough rambling! Check it out :)This review us for a stay in August of this year. Thank you for making the first REAL vacation my husband and I have had since Sandy memorable! The view from our room was fantastic, your staff were extremely helpful! My only complaint was about the bottle service function...the music was very loud! For a romantic weekend we will definitely be back!This review is not a pleasant one to write.  First off I must say thank you to the manager for helping to try and fix what was wrong with this stay but even he couldn't overcome what was a bad stay.When we checked in everything looked ok until we discovered two flies had somehow gotten into our room, this without even having the patio door open.  The bathroom light had a short which the engineer was sent up to fix, the towel rack on the back of the door was inadequately screwed on and then to top things off, there was only one wash cloth in the bathroom.  I addressed that with the night manager who asked in front of me that housekeeping provide more but they didn't until the next day.  It's not that this is a bad hotel but if your staff doesn't help you, as a manager and owner you will continue to look bad.  The price you pay for this doesn't even add up for the service not provided here.  The free passes to the gym is nice but that is really included in the 9.95 a day along with the Internet you get which you have to pay for no matter what.  Maybe the next time we have a chance to stay here it will be better but this stay in particular was not on par with what we were expecting for a weekend getaway.Hotel is a great spot and the staff is super friendly. However, valet is woefully slow and inefficient.  My guess is it is an isolated incident, but the self park lot next door would have saved twenty minutes.Update:   The staff from the hotel emailed after seeing the review to apologize.  Very cool.  They offered to send something to make up for the trouble.  Very cool.  They either forgot it, or just never planned to do it because it never came (months later).  Not cool.   I could have cared less about what they were ""sending""; however if you say you're going to do something, you should do it.  Perhaps the crappy valet service wasn't too isolated after all.Location, Location, Location.This place is in a great location.  Moderately priced.  I picked up a nightly rate which included breakfast and happy hour online at one of the discount websites.  It was a great deal.  We stayed here because it's on the inner harbor Baltimore.  It's a gang plank away from the National Aquarium.  We were tourists without a car, so it was an easy taxi ride from the train station to the Pier 5 hotel.  They're also on the free bus line which interconnects to the other free Baltimore Charm City bus lines.From here, we walked the gang plank to the National Aquarium.  For lunch, we had crab cakes at Phillips  between the National Aquarium and this hotel.  The hotel has a couple restaurants, Ruth Chris, etc. in  the lobby, but we were tourists and so the crab cakes and pickled watermelon were on our list for lunch.Our rate included a free bottle of wine.  I was thinking it was going to be some small split, but it turned out to be a dry malbec. For ice, they turn off the ice machine during the day -- probably because just about anybody can walk into the lobby and help themselves.  So, you have to ask the counter staff to get you ice from the kitchen.  At night, when you have to use your key for access, the main ice machine is working and available. From here, we walked to Camden Yards for an Orioles game.  It was about a 20 minute, safe, scenic walk.  Our hotel room had all that we needed.  The carpet was a little dingy.  The soaps reminded me of my stays at places like the PGA National.  Its a nice boutique hotel with friendly staff.Great hotel in a great location!This hotel has a very friendly staff, a trendy vibe, and great food options. The breakfast is really good, and a Ruth's Chris on site is perfect.  The surrounding area has tons of options for things to do.The room is top notch.  Comfy bed, good shower and TV.We just had our wedding there and had an amazing experience! The staff was wonderful, helpful, and able to meet any need we had. All of our family and friends only had glowing things to say about the experience. The Harbor Club for the reception had an amazing view of Baltimore's Harbor and it was great that people could pop out there for fresh air or to hear the concert across the way. I was most impressed that now a week after the wedding they have emailed us that we overpaid and want to send us a refund. So many places would just keep that money for themselves, but they have the integrity to refund it. The food was also wonderful, and as someone with difficult food allergies they were able to prepare foods to meet my specific needs!The location is fantastic. The Aquarium is your neighbor and all the shopping and sites are within walking distance. Little Italy is minutes away. At first glance, the property looks good, but there were some service missteps and structural problems that made our stay just ok.The Good: The rooms are spacious. They include a coffeemaker and the usual bath amenities. There's a bar of massage soap in the bathroom that I liked. The hotel offers a free shuttle service between its three properties in the area, so you can easily get to Fell's Point.The Bad:We had a problem with our bathtub. The stopper wouldn't come up so the water drained ever... so... slowly...Bf had ordered champagne and chocolates to celebrate our anniversary, but the chocolates were missing upon our arrival. We had to ask the concierge twice about them before they were finally delivered to our room on our second night.The room doors SLAM shut even if you're being careful. At all hours of the night, I heard people shutting their doors up and down the hall. Also, if you have a connecting door and your neighbors are loud, you can forget about a restful night. The family next to our room had immature kids slamming the doors again and again and again very early in the morning.We got a special breakfast package with our reservation. We had to inquire about the breakfast vouchers. Then, we found out that the advertised restaurant for the breakfast had been out of business since last year. Fail!Our room faced the harbor so we were thinking it would be pretty peaceful. Nope. We could hear tourists and guests talking and laughing outside from our room. There was also a conference in the lobby of the hotel on one of the days we stayed. It was so annoying and awkward to pass by all the vendors several times throughout the day.Over all, I liked the location, but so many things were wrong.This is a nice, tourist friendly hotel. Rooms are nice, but will agree with other reviews that the carpeting is visibly stained. I selected the hotel for the following reasons...1. Location: once you park you do not need you vehicle again to experience the harbor. 2. Convenience: perfect for a quick overnight trip. I was able to check in early, they accommodated my last minute request for an adjoining room. If you valet with them, although you check out at 12, they will grant you access to your car until 5:00 pm.I got exactly what I expected.This hotel has a great location. However, the plaster was dripping from the ceiling due to roof leaks, there were buckets in the hallway to catch the drips, and nobody on the hotel staff seemed at concerned about the appearance or shape of the hallways or rooms. It was very expensive for what it was and there simply must be better options nearby.The staff was polite and professional.Nice lobby and close to Little Italy. Horribly big A/C units right outside my balcony. There is a great view of the harbor ruined by 10 A/C units. Loud at night. Would have loved to sleep with window open or sit on patio with my morning coffee. Can't tho. There are only like 5 rooms like this tho.  The service and staff were great.  Lovely little food and beer/wine in the evening.  I would stay there again bc of the staff and request a different rooomGreat location. GREAT location. It is a little bit funky with the whole art deco thing going on, but I also go out of my way to find hotels that do not look like they hopped right out of a cookie cutter mold.Unfortunately, that normally means you have to spend a little bit more, but I was able to get a room for $160. Super cheap. Definitely would come back.We got married in this hotel on 11/12/11 and my wedding was AMAZING! Everyone was great and all my guests and family still to this day say that the wedding was the most fun hey had ever had. The whole process was so easy- there were no hidden fees like you always hear about with wedding venues. The food was all great and definitely not typical ""wedding food"". The harbor club room over looks the water and you feel like your on a boat almost. We went back last year for our anniversary, Valentines Day and are going again this year for the weekend. It has become a little escape away from home for us and takes us back to all our wedding memories. Donna - who helped me the day of my wedding has become a friend when I go by there. She went above and beyond on my wedding day and was with me every mintue whether i needed a drink or to say something nice to relax me. She knew exactly what needed to be done  2 minutes before and was on point! WE LOVE DONNA!!!  I am looking forward to going back this weekend- every time we have been there everyone is so accomodating and friendly. Great location and close to everything.Great hotel!!  Pier 5 is located in a great location if you're visiting the Inner Harbor.  It is super convenient if you're going to the Aquarium or any of the other local attractions.  The staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating to our needs.  I stress that a lot!!  The staff really made the stay so great.  Sure, the decor is a bit outdated, but really.  Who cares?  The rates are great, the hotel was really clean, and our room had several nice amenities.  All in all, we loved it and would stay there again in a heartbeat.  And thanks to the staff- you were wonderful!!!the best part of this hotel is the convenience. otherwise it just seemed run down. the lock on my balcony door didn't lock luckily the security bar was there. the  wall paper is falling off has bubbles or is torn.  the repairs around the room seem like quick fixes and poorly done. I can still see the pencil mark of where the measured the  room mirror. (it's a pretty big mark).. the front door has a mark where it's obvious they had to break in the room. for the price I expected more. $20 parking for hotel gets on top of it all!my wife called it the ""Just Ask"" hotel when we left today.....  you want it ""just ask""  they'll get it for you.... nice folks, nice room and close to everything..... l  I love Baltimore's free charm city buses!!!!     will return next time we are visiting Baltimore ocation location and location....Yeah this place blows. There were some nice people who served breakfast , but my god this place is dirty and tacky. Also fun is the rock concerts going on out on the pier !! Sleep isn't an option. Avoid this place like the plague.Well, Pier proved to be hard to work with. After my husband and I went to contract, we were in for a bumpy road! But Pier 5 worked hard to restore our faith and we had a gorgeous wedding and reception! Our guests were so amazed and ecstatic about our wedding! Our guests enjoyed the delectable cocktail reception and plated dinner. The drinks were also mixed well and not watered down! And the Cake was absolutely delicious!!! I mean, there was no cake left except for the top layer! Our family and friends were especially happy for us and our parents couldn't have been more proud. The Pier 5 Staff did an outstanding job of hosting our family and friends throughout the weekend and the staff was very kind to my husband and me. The music was good and they were very accommodating to our elderly guests with special needs and dietary restrictions. Also, the location was perfect for my husband's family and friends who traveled from New York to be with us.  In the end, the wedding was venue was gorge, the food was amazing and the ambience was sexy! And remember Brides, no matter what happens, it all works out in the end!The main bragging point for this hotel is it's location: it is RIGHT on the harbor, with nice views from most rooms, and is directly next door to the National Aquarium and all the harborfront restaurants and shops.Besides those perks, there isn't a whole lot else going on here. I hear that they have 2 very nice suites, but the rest of the rooms (I stayed in a ""Premier Harborview King"") are not particularly impressive.The room service is extremely limited. There is no mini-bar, nor even an empty fridge to utilize. The bathrooms are boring and standard. My sheets had (blood?) stains on them. There is no pool or spa, and the only ice machine is on the second floor.All in all, if they hadn't charged me $260.00 a night for what is really a motel with a great location, I wouldn't have been so disappointed by my experience.I haven't been back in Baltimore for very long, but this is by far the weirdest place I have visited since I have been here.  I don't know if this is supposed to be a hotel or just an elaborate event venue.  Every time we walked through the lobby there was a rowdy group of people occupying the space.  We were only there one night and we bumped into participants in a young lady's bat mitzvah, a software convention, a wedding celebration, a doggie club meeting, and an anniversary party.  In fact, the hotel seemed so comfortable with having the lobby be a social scene that they had a chocolate tasting party for the hotel guests midday on Saturday.  Apparently, it is something they do every Saturday during the fall and winter, a lovely gesture.  I will certainly say that all of it gave the hotel an extremely lively/upbeat atmosphere and provided me and my friends with hours of comedic people watching.  However, it did make me feel like the hotel was a little too open to the public...in the sense that, usually hotels in big cities make a big deal about security in order to protect their guests.  I really didn't get that here.  If that's a concern to you, you may want to find a different hotel. As for the rooms, again, I was amused and confused.  At first glance, the rooms are spacious and artfully decorated with a flair for the colorful and contemporary.  Plus, I was overjoyed to find that most rooms have a small or shared balcony that provides a breath-taking view of the harbor.   But, upon further inspection, the carpets and the balcony curtains were heavily soiled.  I joked to my companions that my room may have once been a crime scene because the stains on the floors, walls, and curtains were reminiscent of either hot chocolate or dried blood.  Hey, this is the city that inspired the show ""Homicide.""  However, don't let that scare you.  I assume the reason the rooms are dingy upon close inspection is, the hotel is dog friendly (which I support so bonus points to Pier 5) and pets are a bit harder to clean up after than humans.   One additional note about the rooms, my companions had a bit of trouble during check in.  They were initially given a room that was occupied and walked in on a set of hotel guests.  When they returned to the front desk, they did not receive much of an apology, but were quickly given another room.  Unfortunately, the second room must have also been reserved for another party because a mere hour after my friends' arrival, a bunch of strangers walked into their room using a card that had recently been issued by the front desk.  While the front desk never apologized for this scenario to my friends' satisfaction (my buddies wanted a free night), the staff was ultimately courteous and helpful. Despite the unevenness of this establishment, there are a few great things to keep in mind about this hotel.  First, it is within one mile's walking distance of Fell's Point (the younger more eclectic side of Baltimore).  And, of course, it is in the heart of all the things that make the Inner Harbor great:  shopping, H&amp;M/Best Buy/Barnes &amp; Noble; restaurants, Cheesecake Factory/Ruth's Chris Steakhouse/McCormick &amp; Scmick's; and the Aquarium.2.5","Upon arrival, I was very excited about my stay at Pier 5. All that quickly disintegrated when I arrived at my room, which 1) wasn't the harbor view room I had booked and 2) had such a strong smell of cheap, flowery carpet deodorizer I could barely breathe.  When I tried to change rooms, they gave me some lame excuse about how I had booked through a third party and they hadn't even been paid for my stay yet.  I finally called negotiated a new price for a new, smaller but less offensive, room.  Then the real fun begins....from midnight until about 3:00 am a large party across the hall kept us awake.... Music, yelling, profanity....  It took a few calls to the front desk and a visit from the police to get the thing under control. I am currently seeking a refund.My husband and I came to the Inner Harbor for our 6th wedding anniversary.  We chose this hotel based on its location to the aquarium.  If I rated this hotel solely on its location, it would be 5 stars.  Here is the short and sweet:Pros:  They allowed us an early check in (2:30 pm) and the rooms were clean.Cons:  For the price, the hotel is not decorated well, nor does it offer many amenities.  My husband and I had left overs that we were forced to throw away because they did not have a small refrigerator.  These may seem like small gripes, but for 300+ a night, the hotel should have included more.  My husband and I opted for the extra package that came with the hotel which included wine and breakfast.  The breakfast was the standard toast and boxed cereal (not worth the extra money).  There was an omelet station in the middle of the carb feast, but it was not included.   We were only informed of this by the very rude staff that came over to ""police"" the food.  Bottom line:  I would not return to this hotel.  There are many other hotels in VERY close walking distance that offer rooms at a similar or lesser price that would have been much better to stay at.  If your goal is to stay as close to the aquarium as possible, this would be the hotel; otherwise, take the 5 minute walk and look into other hotels.Sorry, but I really can't recommend this place. I'm sure there are a few fabulous suits here, but they certainly don't take care of the business clients very well. Issues?-coffee or dark stains on carpet-cracks in tiles-rust in tub-missing handle on draws -room service not available 24 hrs a day (out of luck if you get in late or get a hunger pang)-blood stain beneath sheets! Ewww...Anyway, I've stayed at a lot of hotels and I would not recommend this for the biz traveler.Baltimore isn't the best city in the world, nor in the country, in the east coast, heck matter of fact, not the best city in the state of Maryland. Yet somehow people continuously flock to the city, go figure! Take it from someone who worked across the harbor from the city and had to endure the funk in the air day after day. So where do I go when I need a break from it all? Where else? Baltimore! This hotel sits right on the pier (I think it sits on pier 5... just a guess... =p) by the water (surprisingly not stinky). Once you walk in, your senses will be overwhelmed by color purple. The decorator dude had to be a serious Prince admirer. There are funky symbols everywhere and plush purple velvet couch in the lobby. Now the rooms. Well, THE room in particular actually. It's called the ""Tradewind Suite."" It is located on the second floor and it used to be a cigar lounge that they turned into a bedroom suite. As you walk through the double door, you will say, OH MY GOD (period). Through all my travels in diff countries, this room by far is the most memorable. The bed was phenomenal! High sleigh bed and oh so comfortable. They still have all the boxes on the wall for cigars (no cigars though, I checked). In one corner of the room, there is a bar area completed with all the glassware and supplies (mixers, shakers, etc) and next to it is... wait for it... in-room jacuzzi!!! I turned them bad boys on and it was simply heaven. Something about taking a bath in a bedroom totally rocks! Oh, yeah let's talk about the bathroom. It had a shower and the faucets that are flushed into the ceiling so water fell from the ceiling. It was like taking a shower in the rain. LOVE IT!!! The hotel has only ONE Tradewind Suite and they get booked WAY in advance. Jan and Feb booked solid on weekends already. I wouldn't book this room if you are interested in looking outside the window (e.g. New Year's Eve). The room has ABSOLUTELY no view. It literally sits above the air conditioner units (and there's alot). I would love to spend every weekend I can at this suite but the room costs anywhere from $500 to $800 per night (pending season). They also have ""Experience Specialist"" who arranges bubble baths, rose petals on bed, champagnes, chocolate covered strawberries (do not get this), etc etc. Go! And experience Baltimore like you've never had before!Jada Pinkett &amp; Will Smith got married here....now why did they do that???Went as a wedding date with a friend to her cousin's wedding. The place is located in Harbor, so I was thinking this is gonna be super romantic...what a dream wedding.Well visually...everything was great...only problem is theres an outdoor stage next door blaring Pat Benetar's Love is a Battlefield as the lovebirds are reciting their vows on the grassy knoll outside the hotel...WTF???Well the reception hall is smaller and definitely for a intimate sized wedding. Food took FOREVER to come out....and the desserts (mango peach gelato) and appetizers (duck quesadilla, beef bruschetta, coconut shrimp) were better than the main course (filet, crab cake and vegetables). -__- FAIL!The acoustics were OK, we could barely hear or see whoever was on the microphone. Parking is ridiculous...cars are back to back in this tiny lot next to the hotel. I wouldn't have my wedding here, but i'm sure it could be someone's else's dream come true. :)Good thing is we had an open bar right next to the ""party table"" and I was with a bunch of chingus who could handle their drink. party on!",,,"['loved', 'place', 'came', 'birthday', 'weekend', 'staff', 'super', 'friendly', 'professional', 'remembered', 'names', 'host', 'chocolate', 'event',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-baltimore-downtown-inner-harbor-baltimore-2,Residence Inn Baltimore Downtown/ Inner Harbor,4.0,$$,47,"I love this hotel.  Perfect location... walkable to many great restaurants, waterfront and Federal Hill (lots of great bars in this area).  Great views from the room I was in.  Amazing staff who is willing to go the extra mile to ensure you feel like a guest in their own home.  And most importantly, it was CLEAN!!!  Wouldn't stay anywhere else if I ever make it back to Baltimore.The Residence Inn is a perfectly decent hotel: small and clean lobby, decent sized suites, competent room service and efficient bell boys.It's a cookie cutter Marriott, but with a vey filling breakfast buffet. Gotta love Americans and their hearty appetites. I spent three nights here while attending a conference, and I definitely appreciated the proximity to the convention centre, inner harbour, fells point etc. Baltimore can be super sketchy so I am especially thankful for the safe location.My stay here was unremarkable except for their good coffee in the lobby which my friends commented favourably on.My stay here was brief, but they made a good impression.  Points for having a very friendly, accommodating, and helpful staff, that made sure everything was set up as needed.  Points for a nice view outside as well.  Minus points for the area in Baltimore... which isn't their fault, but hey, it's Baltimore.  Shortly after I was there the city was on fire.  Some pretty sketchy alleyways were taken from the airport shuttle driver to the hotel.  The room was very nice but had some wear and tear.  Overall a solid stay.Dark and dingy. I was a little disappointed with this property in terms of comfort and ambience. There is a pungent smell that will hit you as soon as you enter the hotel. The best part of the hotel was its location. Just a few blocks from inner harbor making it a good cheaper alternate to the harbor side hotels. Breakfast was just ok.Stayed here a few months back and have nothing except for nice things to say about The Residence Inn Baltimore Downtown / Inner Harbor.The location is ideal for anyone wanting to explore the Inner Harbor or even get to the stadiums. Our room was beautiful and spacious. The staff was accommodating and friendly. Breakfast was good with a lot of different options. I liked the little market area because it allowed me to sneak down late at night for some ice cream!I would recommend this hotel to anyone and if I am ever in Baltimore again, this will be my first choice for a hotel.I came to the hotel for Otakon 2015 at the Convention Center a few blocks away. My group stayed in one of the corner suites. It was very spacious, organized, soundproof and it even came with Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner!Our group needed items at odd hours and the hotel staff always delivered extra towels, blankets, etc. within 5 minutes. We were in the 11th floor.The free breakfast had a HUGE variety of food! As a vegetarian I really appreciated the  large selection of fresh fruits. My favorite part of this place? The staff. They were genuinely friendly, not just professionally polite. Everyone I met - from the bellhop to the manager - would offer a smile and keep up a happy conversation.I had the pleasure of staying late for breakfast and watching the manager brief the maids for the day. He treated all his employees with respect, friendliness and dignity and called them all by first name. The cleaning staff seemed very comfortable with him. I found out that he started this hotel 10 years ago and has a passion for his business.The front desk woman went out if her way to help me with some laundry issues. She even sent a runner to the laundry room with some soap when I forgot mine downstairs. Rarely have I experienced such great customer service and staff in a hotel. This place has a very homey feel to it because of the people. For that alone the experience is worth it. My roommates and I all agree and we choose this hotel every year.Absolutely recommend to anyone.My parents receive medical services from Johns Hopkins, but they live just outside Washington, DC. Whenever they're going in for medical services, they get a room at the Residence Inn because it's so close in proximity to the hospital campus. Not only that, they have a small dog that they're very attached to and the Residence Inn is pet-friendly (for a $100 fee). The rooms are always clean and well-appointed. They are equipped with kitchenettes and flat-screen TVs that have three HBO channels, which is wonderful. Not only that, a buffet breakfast is included in the room price. It includes scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, potatoes, fruit, cereal, bread/pastries, Belgian waffles, and delicious coffee with International Delight flavored creamer (which is always available throughout the day at a station in the lobby). There's also valet parking, a lounge area, and a 24-hour limited selection convenience bar that features things like beer, wine, snacks, frozen entrees, sundries/toiletries, and Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream (!!). The lobby also features a restaurant (17 Light) that has a full bar, and delicious food -- most of it is seafood, so if you don't eat that you won't be too impressed with the menu. The hotel is also right next door to a Dunkin Donuts and a CVS, plus there's a 7-11 across the street and a Royal Farms, which sells the best fried chicken (in case you weren't aware). It's also in walking distance of the Inner Harbor (shops and restaurants and museums), and is only a 7-10 min drive to Baltimore Penn Station where you can catch Amtrak. Recently my dad had an extended hospital stay at Hopkins and my mother and I stayed at the hotel with our dog. Our stay was wonderful as usual. The staff of the hotel is really nice and accommodating. In particular, there's a woman named Chasity who works there who is simply amazing. She has taken such good care of my parents over the years, is always in such a great mood, and is just all-around a pleasure to work with. There's never anything we've asked of her that she hasn't done (within reason!). Several other members of the staff from housekeepers to valets are just a delight. They work hard to anticipate your needs and deliver before you even have to ask. But then they're just super-accommodating to ensure your stay is a good one. My parents will probably never go to another hotel in Baltimore ever again and now that I've spent a significant amount of time there, I don't blame them! As long as Chasity is there, I know for sure we'll keep coming back. Thanks for making us feel so comfortable in the midst of a difficult time.The biggest problem with this hotel is the ridiculous price for a Residence Inn... but the free breakfast was quite good the location is downtown and the rooms were entice and clean.  I would stay here again but would like to stay for less then $300 a night.  After the over priced food and the exorbitant pet fee it turned into a $500 stay.I stayed here for an extremely stressful couple of nights and was very comfortable. The hotel staff was nothing short of wonderful, even with all their stressed out customers. The room was beautiful, huge, and clean. I got two queen beds with a kitchenette and oh Lordy was that lovely. There was a full sized fridge, a half sized stovetop, a dishwasher, sink, and cabinets full of everything you could need to cook up dinner and eat it. When I checked in, I asked for a wake up call. Although she said no problem, I think she may not have heard me fully: you have to set up the wake up calls through the phone in your room, so they're fully automatic. It worked out fine because I brought several other alarms to be safe. The bed and pillows were comfortable but I did call and ask for another blanket. The blanket was brought up in less than five minutes. I didn't watch the television but I did use the wifi, which worked fine for Facetime calls. Cell reception was likewise acceptable. It is VALET PARKING ONLY. I parked out of the city and took the light rail in so I wouldn't have to pay for the parking. If you can do that, it's totally worth it. When I checked out, I was able to leave my luggage in a locked room behind the front desk to pick up after the day was complete, which worked beautifully.  I am absolutely staying here again the next time I have something going on in the Inner Harbor.Me &amp; my boo boo stayed here for 2 nights. Or stay in BMore was okay. The only bright spots was the restaurant &amp; this hotel. Before coming the front staff was very knowledgeable &amp; friendly. One person in particular Steve. I believe he is not here full time. But he knows his stuff. Very helpful we are from Philly. The room was clean only knock I'll say is the when I turned off the heat to cool the room it took along time. Other then that Perfect. If we come to Baltimore this place will be it!FYI Pick the high floor!I stayed at this hotel for one night. When I checked, the process was quick since I reserve a room by using the Marriott app. The overall room was great. The room was pretty big. The room was very clean. I was happy to see that they offer 3 HBO channels along with other major channels such as ESPN or CNN. I am very glad it was a smoke free hotel. The breakfast buffet was delicious!!! The room looked very clean. I was completely suprised when one of the employee took my empty plate without me asking. I absolutely appreciate it.This was our 3rd time at the this hotel, and we still like it. The staff is very friendly and the place is clean and welcoming. Their suites fits our family of five perfectly, and the kids have a blast at the breakfast buffet. As a side note they allow pets to stay. However, the interior is getting a little worn and could use an update, and the madras in our beds were too soft for our liking.This is for the staff at the Residence Inn. I arrived right before the riot on 4/27. I was unaware of the situation until I checked in and turned on the news on TV. After getting a call from my company to reschedule the meeting and leave the city, I approached the front desk expecting to pay for the day stay. To my surprise and delight the front desk staff said we understand and there will be no charge for the stay. Kudos to the staff and management for this act. Really good to know that there are times when businesses and people recognize a special situation and act accordingly. I have a whole different view of the staff at this particular establishment and of Residence Inn in general.Really well done. I will look forward to coming back.The first thought of this hotel - perfect location. It's a close walk to EVERYTHING.Our room was beautiful! We had the two bedroom, two bath suite. It was HUGE! Although the sight out our window wasn't so beautiful. You pay almost $40 to park your car. A little ridiculous if I may add. I didn't know that's how you treat guests who already pay enough.Paul Mitchell's shampoo and conditioner, SWEET! And a free breakfast! - I'm only assuming we pay for this when we park our car for $40.00, right?Looks at this fancy room with a kitchen and everything!  Ok it's not really that fancy.  But it was nice enough, and probably more than we really needed.  We only stayed one night whereas these kind of rooms are built for people staying longer periods.  This would totally be a great place to stay for someone staying a week in Baltimore.  Also they are pet friendly!The breakfast was so horrible.  Don't even bother.  Especially if there is a line.  Dunkin Donuts coffee is right next door.Also I had flashbacks to college days waiting for an elevator for like 10 minutes.For the price of a regular hotel, you can get a kitchen (apartment style) and some meals at no additional cost (breakfast and two dinners).  The food provided is low quality food, but one can pick around for whole foods.  The staff is less than stellar, but everything seems to run smooth enough, as expected.The gym has dumbbells, two benches, and cardio machines only.My favorite hotel in Baltimore - good rate, close to convention center, convenient stores nearby, friendly staff, free full breakfast and bar restaurant if you don't feel Ike headin out - And if you're lucky - get the 2 room suiteVery rude front desk clerk named Bill HOWEVER the hotel overall isn't bad.  Valet can be a bit too busy since they only have room for about 4 cars coming in and out. The location is great for getting around the Inner Harbor area too.As for the room though... it was very clean and large. Unfortunately it's a bit outdated and features a good amount of tacky furniture and art.Since the price is phenominal though I'd definitely return.Such a good experience.  I think that was a newer renovation, and they did a great job with it... it does not have the older Residence Inn vibe that I have experienced elsewhere.  Light 17 in the building was a cute and yummy restaurant with great service.  Everyone at the hotel had great customer service skills as well.  Great location, easy to walk anywhere in the Inner Harbor.  Highly recommended.  We will be back!Baltimore Running Festival - Perfect Race Location for Half-Marathon.Spent two nights here for the 2013 Baltimore Running Festival - ran the half-marathon. For the race, the Half Marathon, the hotel location is PERFECT (the start line is less than a 2 minute walk). For the full marathon and from the finish line area, it is about a .75 mile walk (took about 12min to walk back to the hotel. I cannot speak high enough of this hotel (as described below):STAFF: The front desk staff on Friday the 11th unfortunately was not wearing name tags, otherwise I would have mentioned her by name - but, she was very customer service oriented, check-in was quick and I was offered my room, early, without even a hesitation. HOUSEKEEPING: Again, perfect. I asked for extra towels - and got them immediately. Room upkeep was perfect and timely. The only shortfall was a 11:51pm wake-up with a knock at the door with a night housekeeper with 2 rolls of TP----I was dead asleep....but, the knocking persisted.....got a good laugh out of it in the morning.....just worth mentioning that the night staff needs to triple-check room numbers before knocking on doors that late (plus, after the 2nd knock, if I was expecting TP, I would have answered after the 1st knock...lol).BREAKFAST: Hotel was sold-out for both days I was in the property (marathon, convention and Green Bay vs. Raven game) and they easily kept up with the morning demand. And, as a plus, there is soda available in the morning (wish more hotels did that). Plentiful hot items available.PARKING: OK - see my picture below - and I hate to ruin the $32/day fee the hotel charges, BUT, park across the street (directly south of the 7-Eleven) at the 25 Charles St garage (yes, the entrance is off of Light St) - - - the weekend (Fri, Sat, Sun) fee is only $10/day (yes---only $10 day). My picture has the parking fees. Even during the work-week, the fee is only $20/day - so, still a substantial savings. The valets are extremely friendly (all of them I engaged during my visit) - while not Marriott employees, they definately extended a customer service level that most valets do not. So, for my entire weekend - I spent $30 for parking - - no in-n-out, but, it didn't matter....you don't need a car in downtown Baltimore....you can walk everywhere.ROOM: I was in Room 1503, with a nice north view. 2 Queen studio and as the pictures reveal, the room was huge. Room is well maintained, everything worked, plenty of space (with the exception of the bathroom----but, still do-able). HVAC worked perfectly - plenty of AC. Kitchen was well appointed and we utilized the appliances on several occasions. Beds were extremely comfortable.INTERNET: It's free! Not that fast - but, fast enough.ELEVATORS: OK - it's an older building - and only has -2- elevators - but, we never really ever had to wait for a ride. 17 Light St Bar: Very friendly bar on the ground floor - resonable ""hotel"" prices.MARKETPLACE: OK, again, I hate to ruin the ""money-making-marketplace"" - but, there is a 7-Eleven literally directly across the street - and the 7-Eleven prices are a bargin, compared to the hotel prices (yes, I said that 7-eleven was a bargin....bet you never heard that before). There is also a CVS and a Royal Farms less than a 1 minute walk from the hotel. Also, McDonalds is 1 min away as well (but, that McDonalds is over-run with transients).We were extremely happy with our stay, and this will be my home-away-from-home on all trips to Baltimore. Room rates are extremely competitive (and a value) for such a central Downtown location. Throw in the 2 free newspapers (USA Today and WSJ), free breakfast and free wi-fi and the roomy suites - and you just cannot beat this property","For Baltimore, prices are good, rooms are decent. The problem: The hotel is in a shady area. Lots of homeless begging for money. Last night, there was a shooting a few blocks away which caused lots of issues next to the hotel. MAJOR PROBLEM: Hotel charges $32 a night to park your car in an unguarded lot next door, where I witnessed someone taking a piss right next to mine. This is also where a ton of police activity happened last night. Not the hotel's fault per se, but security would be nice outside!GM couldn't really care, making up lame excuse after lame excuse. He eventually refunded our parking fees after lots of arguing. Also, don't put ""garage parking"" on my bill when it wasn't. Shady shady shady.Stayed here for 5 weeks while working in Baltimore. A satisfactory - if not great - experience. Really a 3.5 Good location; Friendly staff. The room that I had was small for the price, and the couch/sleeper sofa was really uncomfortable - like sitting on a cardboard box. The towels were old, thin, and scratchy, and the bed was less than luxurious.Breakfast was okay, but only okay. I often found myself eating breakfast  at  the Cheapside Wharf (just around the corner on Water St.) instead of eating the same tired food at the hotel - even though it was ""free.""  [And speaking of Water St. - the Water Street Tavern (also *very close*) is AWESOME! Great drinks, and good food served late! (read my review for more info)]Still; the staff was good about bringing mail and packages to my room; greeting me by name every day; and really taking care of things when Hurricane Sandy threatened to make things rough. Housekeeping also did a great job of keeping things tidy and comfortable.Why do I keep using the word ""things""? I don't know.Things.The biggest pro/con about this place is not their fault - but I'll mention it just as a caveat for fellow travelers:  Baltimore has wonderful history, beautiful scenery and architecture, and fabulous food. It also has a very very high homeless population, lots of crime, and can be a generally rough place.This hotel is right in the middle of ALL of that.  So, just know that you can walk or take the free ""circulator"" to just about anywhere in town during the day - but be very careful when you're out for the evening.Friendly staff, clean &amp; comfy rooms, modern decor, good location, safe, decent price, D&amp;D/7-11 across the street. All in all a great hotel. MY only gripe is the gym; the elliptical &amp; treadmills are all pieces of...... yeah, not so hot.The hotel was very nice and close to the inner harbor. The rooms were decorated in modern decor and had a kitchenett with granite countertops. I was shocked when I opened the door to see how nice the room actually was. The first room we had was a large corner king room, standard. It was huge and very nice. Unfortunately, we asked to move because of the screaming child next to us. Customer Service was great. They were up to our room within a couple of minute s to take us to a new room. It was not on the corner, rather the side of the building but still a nice room. We definetely had a nicer room the first time. I woke up by teenagers hollering on the street below at 2:00 in the morning. I got up to look out of the window to see what looked like a club down below. So, the location is great for inner harbor, but not good for sleeping. The free breakfast buffet was good. It was very crowded around 10:00, so we had to share a table with others. The hotel was nice, but I am not sure I would pay the price again because of the noise compliants. The parking deck is right accross the street, but very expensive. Pay attention to what you will pay if you leave and return. We ended up paying $20 for one night stay.While the parking is over-priced, it is efficient and cheerfulLight level in our room was insufficient for reading.The ""turkey Canadian bacon"" served at breakfast was a curious pressed Spam-like meat, sliced paper thin.I was very happy with this hotel. Although I was only here one night, I was very impressed with the quality and cleanliness of our room, especially considering the fairly large size and the kitchen. Very clean sheets, floors, bathroom, everything! I will certainly stay here again next time I'm in Baltimore. Wonderful value for the quality!I recently had a house fire, and was relocated here while some repairs were going on. We were staying with our dog (white German Sheppard) and our toddler (15 months old). We stayed here for about 5 weeks, and it was a very positive experience. The staff was EXCELLENT! The folks working the front desk were always friendly and accommodating. The valet staff was always prompt and smiling (even in the rain). The breakfast in the morning (when I was able to wake up before 9am) was delicious, and always changing from day to day. The room itself was fairly spacious, and had it's own little kitchen (minus a stove), which was fantastic! We like to cook our own food, and are not too keen on getting takeout or dining out. This little kitchen definitely suited our needs. The amenities were clean and easily accessible, although we didn't really use them much ourselves. The entire place was fresh and clean. The Aquarium (as well as the rest of the harbor) was within close walking distance. It wasn't home, but it was close!Really nice hotel that is so convinent to the inner harbor. Very friendly staff, pretty good continental breakfast buffet, and clean rooms. My family and I were always greeted when we left and entered the hotel. The front desk also gave us great walking directions to near by shopping and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again.The hotel is great. Great location. The staff is super helpful. Not excited about 33/day valet - but I can deal with that. The rooms don't have great views. The rooms are clean and spacious. I have been to many residence inns and this is a good one.A great location for the price we have paid...its only a 5-10 min walk from the inner harbor.  The valet is a bit expensive, $32 per night, but the attendents were very attentive and efficient.  I requested a higher floor and corner room, and I got what I wanted.  Daily breakfast is included, and it is a great breakfast.  Coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are provided throughout the day.  The only down side is there is no swimming pool.  I will definitely come back to stay here again if I am visiting Baltimore again.Great location! Great staff! Adequate rooms.. Reasonable parking rates... I'm a fan..We had a great experience at this hotel on a recent weekend getaway from the DC area.  The staff was some of the friendliest, most helpful that I have ever experience at a Marriott property.  From the time we pulled up until the time we loaded up to leave we couldn't have asked for more from the staff.  We enjoyed our time there and will be coming back.The hotel appears to have been renovated, and provides free breakfast (full breakfast, not just continental) in the mornings. It's in a great location for those wanting to go to the National Harbor. They have a business center that offers 3 computers with free internet access and a restaurant by the main lobby. I'm not sure if they requested the local police to patrol the front, but they are regularly there. The only down side is you must pay $30 per day for parking.Great location a couple blocks up the hill from Inner Harbor.  Good security (front door requires key to access after-hours, and you can't even use the elevator most of the day without a door key!), nice front desk staff.    Rooms were spare but clean, though the pull-out bed that was advertised as comfy was really not.  We probably should've seen through this selling point.  Nice kitchenette in the suite with a clean fridge and dishware.Valet parking was $29/day, compared to $21/day at the garage next door (at Light &amp; Lombard St.).  Walk one block and you can park it yourself, maybe save a few bucks.Like most/all Residence Inns, this place is pet friendly... for a steep fee.  My brother brought his dog along at a cost of $100 for two nights.  You have to walk a little ways to find grass where the dogs can do their business, but Tigger liked walking around with all the excitement of the harbor.  Beats being left at home!  He also loved the front desk, which was generous in its distribution of dog treats.My only real complaint is in regards to the breakfast room, which was a complete zoo throughout Labor Day weekend.  The staff did their best to keep the food stocked and the coffee pouring, but it was pretty insane.  Kinda reminded me of a feeding frenzy at a fish farm.I stayed here during the busy Otakon 2010 convention weekend.  The staff were very friendly and check-in was a breeze.  Parking was around $23.00 a night.  The room was $219.00 a night, which is a bit exorbitant.  The room was nice and big.  One large bed, a sofa bed, two desks and chairs, and a coffee table.  There was a television, stove, dishwasher, fridge, plates, bowls, cups, etc.The shower was nice.  They served breakfast every morning, although I did not go down for it.  Checking out was quick, I just had to drop off my room keys at the front desk.I stayed here recently and we paid $99 the first night and $119 the second night. They have recently remodeled and we were pleasantly surprised when we got to our room. It was so nice that we called the front desk when we got up there to make sure they hadn't given us a suite by mistake. We had 2 queen beds, a pullout sofa, desk, dining table and a fully stocked kitchen. The customer service was above and beyond. They consistently went one step further to anticipate our needs. I was so impressed and I will only stay there if and when I return to the Inner Harbor!I almost gave this hotel two stars, but they  made up the one star in location,  convenience, and size of the room. I really liked what I saw when I checked in, it looked clean, and staff was really nice. But the next day when I went to take a shower, there was no water. When I called the front desk, they mentioned that they had ""cleaned out the water lines"" despite the fact that everyone else I was with had plenty of water...Anyway, they got the water on, and it was RUSTY!! I let it run for a good 15 minutes and it seemed ok, until I dried off with a white towel and discovered that the water was still rusty. :-( I figured that I would see what would happen when I returned in the evening, it seemed ok. Then when I took a shower the next morning, and dried off, it was still a little rusty, but a lot better than the previous day. It eventually got better, but I shouldn't have had to go through that, when I told the front desk all she could say was sorry.The breakfast was pretty much non-existant, some runny scrambled eggs, and coffee (which I don't drink).On a brighter note, the room was clean, and decent.DISGUSTING. EWWWWWWWWW. Cheap and dirty. You can cook your own food which is nice, but make sure you do the dishes yourself, the maids will just put them back in the drawers when you aren't looking without cleaning them, I watched her do it. The sheets never get cleaned unless you tell them to, I was there for 4 weeks. When I first got to the room the sheets were dirty, so gross!  Free internet, eh ok.  other trainees like myself staying at the place said there were bed bugs, I didn't see any, but I was in the 15th floor.  The neighborhood is scarey lots of homeless asking for money, so be prepared for that gem of an experience too.$105/night for a king size bed.  Not bad at all considering the location.  Room was clean... a lot better than I thought it would end up being.  The parking on the other hand, cost $29.  The complimentary breakfast was decent!  biscuits, sausage, eggs, fruits, granola &amp; other cereals, yogurts, juices, seasoned potatoes, and... I think that was about it.  The ONLY thing I did have a problem with the hotel was that the housemaid came about 3 TIMES in the morning time on our check-out date... 8am, 10am, 12:15pm.  We were granted for a late check-out @ 1PM.  She almost walked into our room at 8am... the boyfriend and I were passed out and didn't hear her until she opened the door.  I was asked, ""who is it??!!"" and she just simply replied, ""oh I'm so sorry"".  I don't blame the housemaid, I blame the front desk staff who obviously failed to communicate something as simple as a late check-out for my room.I reserved two large rooms for a group of girls. When we arrived (past check in time), both rooms weren't ready. They were not helpful, kind or a bit apologetic. Only upside- Large rooms. In a city full of unique and beautiful hotels, I do not recommend this hotel.","Great place to stay in the Inner Harbor. Clean, spacious rooms, a quick jaunt to the Inner Harbor, pots of Marriott coffee always brewing, and the nicest, most helpful staff, from the manager right down to the valets. The price seemed just right for the accommodation. I would've loved a few more good restaurants close by, but all in all more than pleased with this place!Close to the stadium for the game and free breakfastVery nice and clean hotel right next to the Inner Harbor (the shops are within walking distance). My parents always stay here when they're visiting me at college. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, and the hallways are brightly lit. The bed are comfy and the staff is friendly and helpful. When they make a mistake, they try to make up for it. They might bake you fresh cookies.The only thing that kind of irks me when we stay there is the valet service. They can be quite slow sometimes, even when calling ahead. But I've found that this isn't limited to just this hotel, so we'll cut them some slack.Rooms are decent, parking is over-priced and the Inner Harbor is a good 5 block walk, which can be shaky after dark. No decent eatery close by, including on site. This place will usually save you a couple of bucks when compared to hotels closer to the harbor, but it comes with some drawbacks. If you don't mind hoofin' it in the dark, this place is a decent choice.super friendly staff, clean, free breakfastWe celebrated out son's destination wedding at this location.  The corporate office was FABULOUS for booking our wedding block and the hotel itself accommodate our every need.  We had so many rooms booked for friends  who traveled from many different states and they all received excellent service and accommodations.  We loved the buffet breakfast it was a wonderful treat to all our guests and the front desk was very helpful!  Since the state is a dry alcohol state it was very convenient that they sell alcohol at the front desk.  Thank you again to all who helped make our son's wedding a treasured memory in MD.I stayed here when I was taking the bar exam which was a really stressful time. However, this hotel was wonderful. The staff goes out of their way to help you and the service is great. The people are friendly and the rooms are quite comfortable and spacious.  Also, the breakfasts in the morning were really good. To top it off, I left my phone charger in the room and when I called and asked if the hotel could mail it to me, they overnighted it and didn't charge me a penny! I would stay at this hotel anytime I'm in Baltimore.",,,"['love', 'hotel', 'perfect', 'location', 'walkable', 'many', 'great', 'restaurants', 'waterfront', 'federal', 'hill', 'lots', 'great', 'bars',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-baltimore-downtown-convention-center-baltimore,Hampton Inn Baltimore-Downtown Convention Center,4.0,$$,48,"Great hotel for an unbeatable price. Robin and Charles are hands down the best staff I have encountered at a hotel and I have been traveling for years. I would stay here again in a heart beat. My traveling partner and I took pics with them because they are fun and we love memories!Breakfast is much better than your standard continental breakfast and it changes daily, variety is the spice of life.THE BEDS, I was tempted to stay in bed all day and skip a day of playing tourist!!! I want to order one of these beds and have it shipped back home. I will be back!Great Hotel.Robin and Shanee were excellent and helped us in any way.Cant beat free cookies and free breakfast (if you wake up in time).A great location for the ballpark and having pickles pub next door is kind of coolThis hotel was very expensive - $100+ and 20,000 points per night of the Gold Cup semi-final. We were given a corner room on the eighth floor, and it was great! I think it's the biggest Hampton suite I've ever had (though whirpool suites are the best). We had views of Camden Yards and M&amp;T Bank Stadium; we could see the mound inside the ballpark. Breakfast was mediocre. It's your standard, typical Hampton breakfast of lightly baked scrambled eggs, watery sausage patties, etc. There's a waffle maker, oatmeal, cereal, pastries, applies/banans, yogurt, juices, and coffees. Frankly, Hamptons have my least favorite breakfasts on the Hilton totem pole because the quality isn't the best.The manager at least let us have a bottled water, bottled coke, chocolate bar, and Utz crab-flavored chips as a welcome gift. You're really supposed to only get one beverage and one snack. During the stay, the front desk and valet were very accomodating, including getting an airport cab for me at 6AM. I would've given the hotel two stars, which is typical of my Hampton ratings, but I added a star for service!I ""downgraded"" to this hotel from the Marriott because the rate was $100 less per night.  But it wasn't a downgrade at all.  The amenities at this place are ridiculous:- valet parking- they give you a snack anddrink when you check in- free wifi- amazing beds- warm walk in shower- THE THERMOSTAT IS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE BED SO YOU DONT HAVE TO GET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO CHANGE IT- free awesome breakfast in the morning and if you aint got time for dat they have pre packed brown bags you can take with you that have muffin apple water etcThis place is the bees kneesThe staff hands down is the reason this place gets a five star from me....hotel is very clean...appears to be fairly new...good location for those wanting a hotel downtown but away from a lot of traffic. Frank and Keon were very helpful with bags and anything else you needed during your initial arrival and making sure your car is parked and well taken care of. I was leaving right back out for dinner so they were sure to keep it close to ensure I made my dinner reservations. Tim at the front desk made sure my hotel room met my needs....had an issue with one of the rooms but he changed it out with no questions added. Would certainly stay again...keep up the good work Hampton Inn...I had a great experience at this hotel. The valet parking men were so friendly and professional. They made us feel welcome from the get go. The hotel itself was very clean, attractive, and the perfect size. Free breakfast every morning from 6-10am. Check out is at noon which is nice because some other hotels in the area have early check out times. The pool and hot tub areas are nice, along with a nice size gym. My only complaint was the water temperature in the shower took a while to get hot and when it did, it was scorching. My only minor complaint. Great hotel!Can't say enough great stuff!  Staff is great. Location is perfect. Sitting in my comfy king bed right now. Update tomorrow   MaybeI've stayed in a few different hotels in the Baltimore area and this one is definitely one of the better ones I've stayed at. Before arriving there was a slight booking snafu but it was fixed by the staff and they were so friendly about everything when I checked in. The rooms are spacious (especially the bathroom which is always a plus) and they were clean and comfortable. I also really liked how close the hotel was to the Inner Harbor and you have access to major roads which makes it great and easy for getting around and for catching a taxi. It is also right across the street from Camden Yards and a few blocks away from M&amp;T Stadium if you are looking for a place to stay while catching either baseball or football games. The free breakfast was is pretty much a deluxe continental breakfast. They have eggs, make your own waffles, fruit, cereal, yogurt, etc. The overall dining space is really clean and if there isn't any room to sit, you can easily take your food up to your room. Another thing that is helpful here is the parking. It's a little pricey at $29/night but you can take it in and out as often as you can and when you check out, even though you have to leave the hotel at noon, your car can stay in the lot until 3PM if you wanted to leave your car and explore a bit before leaving. I would probably look into staying here again since I had a great experience and it's recommended if you are looking for a place to stay in Baltimore!What a nice surprise this hotel was.  The rooms were very comfortable, quiet and updated.  We had a lovely view of Camden Yards.  The location was walkable to nearly everything that we wanted to see.  There was free continental breakfast which was perfect for getting up and out to see the city with children.  The kids loved the free popcorn, cookies and beverages in the lobby in the evenings. The pool area seemed a little bit worn/dated, but there was a super-attentive employee who handed my children fresh towels as they got out of the pool!  What service!The best part, though, was the price!  An unbelievable value for an East Coast US city!Best place you could stay if you're attending an Orioles game or Raven's game. The hotel is about five or six blocks (half a mile) from Inner Harbor, but only one block from the Convention Center and literally 70 feet from Camden Yards and a block from M&amp;T football stadium. Costs will run 139 per room plus about another 30 for parking nearby.After staying at this hotel the furniture was in bad condition. Both rooms that we had were in poor shape. One of the rooms that we first saw had AC that was not working properly.  Other issues with the other rooms were sheets were dirty. The beds were in bad condition. Also one of the rooms had stains on the chair.  General Manager Mustaha Agourram called us and threatened us. The General Manager Mustaha Agourram was very defensive and did not was to resolve the issues. We are providing no stars. Due to poor management and lack of taking ownership of the situation. In addition told us never to comeback.  We reported to Hilton about the situation and provided comments that the general manager said. We would not recommend going to this hotel.Finally came back to Baltimore for a Vacation to show my lady the places I have lived and experienced. I was able to E-checkin to the best room the hotel has to offer, the King Suite Top Corner Room with the Panoramic view. I arrived to the Hotel to have my first set of keys not working...and when i got the second set to work and went in, the room was still under construction...which i was very disappointed thus we would not be able to stay in this particular room that i wanted us to be in, i told the front desk person that the room does not look ready since it seems to be under construction...he provided me with another room in a different floor but not the room style that i booked, which i let him know from the room. He was able to book us to another room which was the panoramic view king suite that i wanted but 3 floors down :(. He did the best he could and was able to comp us on 1 night of valet parking and something i wanted from the condiments, since it was in the evening time we wanted to rest up and check out the area to go eat as well. The next day i was able to give my honest feedback on my experience of the first of the 3 nights as a Diamond member and from the front desk lady i spoke to, she told me the parking and the whole stay was comped.....to find out the check out day that they had only comped the 1 more night parking, and we would have to pay the whole stay...I was NOT HAPPY when i heard it was only for parking..i have talked to the manager and she comped just one night, but in the end i am Very Dissatisfied!!!!.....The Hampton Inn had everything we needed. It was right across from the ballpark and we were there to watch the Yankees play. We got two rooms because we had 3 adults and 4 kids. So the king size bed with sleeper sofa was perfect. Our room was on the 7th floor and at the end of the hallway so it was nice and quiet. The room was spotless and clean. With fresh smelling linens. Including the ones in the closet for the sofa bed. The continental breakfast was everything the kids needed and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again.My wife and I stayed here one night with our 3 year old daughter. This was a very good experience. The hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly and very good at what they do.The indoor pool is a little small, but the fitness center was very nice. The hotel is also right across the street from Oriole Park which was the biggest plus for us since we took in a game.We will defiantly be staying here in the future.I've been sitting on this review for a while but finally decided to post it:DO NOT BOOK A ROOM AFTER THEIR NORMAL CHECKIN TIME, DESPITE IT BEING AN OPTION VIA THEIR WEBSITE.I had book two rooms for my colleague and I to stay in. We are from Hawaii, and our travel time to the east coast is typically 10- 12+ hours. Our flight would arrive by midnight, and we were due to check in at around 2am on July 5. I had made this note when I booked the reservation online (as indicated on the website, if you plan to check in after their normal business hours). After making the reservation I gave them a call to confirm that it would be possible to check in at 2 am. I booked these rooms more than a month in advance and called three separate times leading up to our arrival date to confirm that we could check in at 2am. Each time I received a, ""Yes, not a problem,"" confirmation. I even called the day before and got the okay. Well, when we arrived we were told we could not check in because all the rooms were booked as their files ""still say we were in July 4."" If that's the case, I wanted to know why we weren't told that each time I had called to confirm. The person insisted it is their policy and I pointed out that their instructions on the website say otherwise. Ultimately, they called and sent us to their more expensive sister hotel, the Hilton,  a block and a half away. At 3am. After we checked in there, and weren't even given a discount (off our Hampton reservation or our new Hilton stay) for their mistake. Before we left the front desk attendant at Hampton told us if we wanted a room on July 5, it would be first come first serve for people who arrive early to catch one of the rooms that a occupant was leaving early. So, essentially, even though we booked our rooms way in advance, they made a mistake and didn't have enough rooms and sent us away without a discount, they had the audacity to ask us to come early to get a room that wasn't guaranteed -- for one we had reserved in advance. Seriously. Regarding our actual stay: the Hampton rooms were cozy enough. Nothing blatantly wrong or unclean. However, regarding the breakfast option: my colleague and I pulled out bagels and cream cheese with mold in them. Both of us. It was a shame because the complimentary breakfast was part of why we chose the Hampton. We ended up getting breakfast elsewhere.The hotel was great. Every employee from the bellman to the receptionist to the ladies that cleared my room were so friendly. I was greeted every time I walked past an employee. The hotel was clean, my room was ready for me. They even granted me a late checkout due to my flight schedule. Also the breakfast was great. Lots of options and the counters were always clean and tidy. I don't know if I'll ever be in Baltimore again. But if I am, I'll stay here.It's tough for me to give a great review for anything in Baltimore because it is the single most screwed up and scariest city I've ever been to. OK, except maybe Newark.But the Hampton Inn was decent and conveniently located near the harbor and Camden Yards. The rooms were clean and very nice, despite their lack of mini fridges to keep drinks cold or tubs in the bathroom. Hampton Inns always have the most comfortable beds, even more so than pricier chains.However, the climate control in the room was set up very strangely, and despite being on the sixth floor, the alley our room overlooked was pretty noisy on and off throughout the night. Additionally, there was a large group there for some kind of convention, so the breakfast the next morning was just a wreck with really nowhere to sit and people fighting in and out of the buffet. We were eventually herded away from the large group into a meeting room. The breakfast options were only so-so anyway but provided enough sustenance until a seafood lunch could be obtained.The big kicker is that this hotel has NO parking lot and NO parking garage underneath it or nearby. Unless you're getting dropped off by a taxi, I would recommend you don't fall for the good prices that this Hampton Inn puts out there on Expedia and similar sites. They make it up with a whopping $29 overnight valet parking fee -- and unless you want to leave your car stranded out front on the street (in the middle of it, because there's no street parking), you have no choice but to pay for the valet parking.I really don't want to go back to Baltimore anytime soon. The place was just entirely too run-down with way too many rough characters hanging out on every street corner. There's no 'good' side of town, it seems. But if I do go back and need to stay overnight, I'll probably try somewhere else that at least has a parking garage and that's perhaps closer to the aquarium.Friendly staff, decent breakfast, pool and hotel gym were adequate. The room was clean. The only negative is that my room smelled like stale smoke, like the previous guests had smoked in the room.Definitely a fan of this hotel in this particular area of Baltimore.  I stayed here for a couple nights since I was in town for the AOTA conference.  The customer service here is spot on.  I had such a horrible and dreaded train ride coming (blame Amtrak, stuck in station for 3 hours with no updates or anything) and finally arriving at the hotel was such a sigh of relief.  Although I missed the opening ceremony and a few lectures I had planned to attend at the conference, I was somewhat happier at hearing that my room was ready for me and I was able to help myself to free popcorn and coffee/tea! Score!!-Room: The room I got wasn't too shabby or fancy.  The view itself was quite boring and somewhat of a downer; the windows faced some electrical plant which was not quite appealing.  I had thought I would get the view of the baseball stadium, Camden Yards, or at least something more scenic than a graffiti wall but nope.  However, the room itself was quite cozy and clean. No complaints about the upkeep. And best of all -- Who can say no to free wifi!!? -But the best part of my stay was the FREE BREAKFAST!! My oh my, everything tasted so good.  I had steak and eggs with home fries the first morning, eggs and kielbasa sausage on the second, and regular sausage and egg omelets with cheese on the third morning.  These are the ""special"" dishes they put out each morning.  But, you'll get your fresh oatmeal and add-on's, a diverse assortment of pastries (their banana nut muffins and banana scones were AH-MAZING and a MUST-TRY!!!), and fresh fruit that the morning staff keep replenishing.  But to top it off, the waffles..were the best!! Their waffle mix somehow produces some of the best tasting and soft, fluttery waffles I've ever had.  I've even looked up the mix and they sell it online!! All in all, I had a terrific stay at this hotel and would love to stay at other Hilton-associated hotels, especially the Hampton Inn.  The breakfast is something to look forward to, and of course, hopefully the view will be better next time (that's why I gave 4, not 5, stars). And, you'll definitely feel safe here since they lock the front doors at 9pm.  No entry unless you present/have your room card.  Throughout the day, they have fresh coffee/tea waiting for guests and also warm cookies for snacking. Considering this was my first time at the Hampton Inn, I must say I had a wonderful stay.Seriously very happy with our stay this weekend. The room was immaculate and had a beautiful view of Camden Yards. Front Desk was extremely helpful and friendly. We had an issue with the mini fridge, was replaced by a very nice maintenance man immediately. We our Hilton Honors members and this was our first time staying at a Hampton Inn, highly recommend staying here , you will not be disappointed. On side note if you our staying during the weekend you can park on S. PACA street for free instead of paying the $29 to valet.","I'll never understand why people complain about a hotel like this! This Hampton Inn is a very nice, clean, pretty hotel for an EXCELLENT price. Wifi is free, breakfast is free, and I stayed for a weekend for under $200 which was remarkable in the area. Think about it, just across the street there's a Hilton, where you're paying more money for the room, and you have to pay extra for wifi and breakfast!I had an extremely satisfying stay here at the Hampton Inn.One complaint I do has is regarding the staff. Mainly, those who work at the front desk. They are obviously very (too) comfortable at their jobs, and all weekend we saw them with their family members and friends leaning against the counter having conversations and not giving their full attention to the customers. It also seemed like they sort of had an attitude problem and like they were annoyed with the customers whenever anyone ""interrupted"" the conversation they were having with their loitering friends. That is my only complaint though. Great room, great price, great breakfast, great location. Would recommend in a heartbeat.Great hotel, incredible location, and fantastic value.  Clean and friendly service and extremely nice lobby and overall location to everything you want to do in downtown Baltimore.  Would definitely recommend it to others and would stay here again myself.I came hear with my friend Pete last week on our baseball tour trip. I am a real fan of this hotel. It is right across the street from the ballpark. As soon as we got there they welcomed us with a warm smile. The room was comfortable. The pool was great with a lifeguard that is a big plus for families with kids. The breakfast was outstanding and it came with the room. I recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Baltimore.We had a fabulous stay! From the moment we pulled up we were met with a gracious welcome... It was very easy to be there. They accommodated all of our needs, even our unusual ones. The staff was not just gracious but personable and engaging. The proximity to the orioles game was unbelievable. Shuttled to a fabulous dinner at Moes. The room was perfect. Highly recommend staying here!Stayed here on 9/21 with my friend. We were in town to see an Orioles game and I loved how close it was to the stadium, could even see it from the room window! Very convenient.  I did overnight parking at the Hilton across the street (not sure if I was allowed since I wasn't a guest, but I did anyway...oops?) So that was convenient too. Everyone was kind, no loud people, and all very clean. Concierge guy out front ran across the street to hail me a cab which was nice. Good experience.This hotel was really very nice. The location across from the ballpark was very nice. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the amount of chlorine in the hot tub and the pool. Our eyes stung just being in the room. But overall the staff was great and the hotel was new and clean.I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn, Convention Center for about two weeks.  The room was spacious and clean but what really stood out was the friendly staff.  My husband had major cancer surgery at UMd Medical Center so this was no vacation.  The staff was so kind, always  smiling faces. One woman in particular who worked at the desk and always seemed to be there,  would ask how the day went and ask how my husband was. I really appreciated this.  I think I remember her name is Pearla. We hugged the day I left.My wedding reception was at M&amp;T Bank Stadium so my newly married husband and I stayed at this hotel after all the partying was done. We had stayed here once before a couple of years ago when a friend of ours had their reception at Camden Yards. Both stays were nice, the rooms were clean and the staff was courteous. Checkout is at noon, which is wonderful. I see people complaining about the FREE continental breakfast, but we thought it was great both times. You can make your own waffle and there is plenty of coffee, juice, fresh fruit, bagels and muffins, cereal, danishes and yogurt. They also had western omelets and hash browns that were served hot. I don't know what people are complaining about, it was delicious! It's not a 5 star hotel room, but you also aren't paying 5 star prices. All the hotels downtown are pretty pricey, but this was not a bad deal.Okay, guys, it's a Hampton Inn...you aren't going to the Ritz.With that said, I think this place really served up plenty of bang for the buck.I was in Baltimore (again) for a wedding (again - yes, wedding number 5 in the last 6 months!), and this place was the one suggested by the couple. The hotel also offered shuttle service to the ceremony and reception, so that was part of its draw.  Yes, I am totally down with being lazy and having door-to-door service. Total plus column wins:1) Affordable rooms.2) Well-located hotel.  The Inner Harbor area and Federal Hill are easily walkable, and Camden Yards is literally right across the street.3) Large rooms that are clean, well-maintained, and quiet.4) Really comfortable beds with big plushy pillows.5) Free wifi and free plug-in wired Internet.6) Free continental breakfast.  It's not super fancy, but it'll totally get the job done.  There's a make-your-own-waffle station, two hot trays (first morning was cheese omelettes and turkey sausages; second morning was scrambled eggs and some hash browns (I think?)), fruit, cereal, oatmeal, toast, yogurt pastries like muffins, etc., and the usual juice, milk, coffee, and tea.  You really can't beat it for the price.One questionable thing:The private driver service that took me to a destination that should have been ~$7-9 via taxi tried to charge me $15.  I asked the front desk lady beforehand how much a cab would typically cost to X destination, and she said ""no more than $10."" Tried calling for a cab, but then the valet guy instead suggested using the private driver guy. I was wary b/c those are usually expensive, but then they said the private driver guy (who I assume is contracted to service the hotel or something) would charge no more than a taxi's rate. So yeah...$15 is not what the taxi's rate would be. I know this because the next day, when I took a taxi to the train station (a destination that is FARTHER away than my X destination), the metered charge was $7.60. Yup. Note that there is a taxi stand across the street on the lefthand side.Of note (or maybe I'm just crazy b/c I couldn't find it):There IS a closet in that room. It's behind the mirror. Yes, the full-length mirror that looks like it's only a wall mirror.  Yup, there's a lip to the mirror that you can pull away to reveal - ta da! - a closet. I was baffled when I entered the room and couldn't find a closet, so here's hoping that little tip helps you. :)Overall, I thought this hotel was a fine choice for an easy, no hassle, clean and comfortable location to call our home base while in Baltimore.I needed a last minute hotel for a trip to Baltimore and this was the cheapest one I could find. I was ready for a bare-bones minimum room with pay-to-use wired internet and a musty room.My expectations could not have been exceeded any more than they were.The Hampton is by far the nicest hotel room I've ever stayed at. A giant King-size bed with the comfiest pillows on the East coast. Also a chair + ottoman, desk, flat-screen TV, refrigerator, microwave, and a bathroom that was almost as big as the room itself. The bathroom was insane - so much room in there and they even had dispensers on the shower wall with soap, shampoo and conditioner in it. Next time I'm not even going to bring shampoo!The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. From the valet who kept my bags since I couldn't check in early to the front desk clerk at 2 AM who printed off my boarding pass for me. Everyone was extremely nice and always had a smile on. The Hampton itself is a 5 minute walk from the harbor, so it's a perfect location that's not too far away from anything entertaining. My walk every day was to the former Sonar compound and it was a straightforward, easy walk each time.I will definitely be staying at this hotel many, many more times.these guys know what they're doing. we booked a room on Ravens game day.  we got in around 9:45. the valet took our car and told us to go in and check in. our room wasnt ready, of course its 6 hours before check in, but they took our luggage. the entire area was crazy with people getting ready for the game but the entire staff was super calm and friendly. I havent even seen my room yet and I love this place.Every year when Otakon comes around I have the daunting task of finding an affordable hotel, that not only doesn't mind a bunch of otaku filling its rooms with weird ass cosplay, lolita, and gaming materials; but also is comfortable enough to fit all of that crap and be a great refuge after a long day of standing in lines. This hotel is that place. We have stayed here three times. Last year being the most recent 7/26 - 7/29/2012.When you first come in you're always greeted by the most friendliest staff you will find at a hotel. They are so helpful and any questions you may have they go out of their way to make sure you have a satisfying answer. They also provide for their guest fresh baked chocolate chip cookies (or peanuts) while supplies last of course. The hotel is clean and the decor still looks as fresh as when they first opened.We always stay in one of queen suites. Which has two wonderfully comfortable queen beds with fluffy pillows and duvets that you just melt into at the end of the day. A sofa bed, a mini fridge, a small sink (separate from the sink in the bathroom), and a microwave. This hotel provides free Wifi which is always an automatic plus for me, and free breakfast for it's guest. There is also a pool, gym, business center, and laundry room. So basically if you need a home away from home this is place to go. The area it's centered in is perfect because you're within walking distance of loads of different bars, restaurants, and entertainment. As with any hotel the pricing depends heavily upon the date you go, but normally this place isn't too bad in comparison to the other surrounding hotels. Especially considering all of the things you get for free by staying here. (Just an example the Hilton Baltimore Convention Center hotel charges for Wifi per night, provides no free breakfast, rooms are smaller, and valet parking $40 a night)We will be back again this year in August for Otakon 2013 and I can't wait to stay here again.Stayed 4 nights and thought the hotel was great - the only negative I even remotely come up with is the lack of on-site parking ($29/night option for valet park available).  Even factoring in the valet costs, I still got a very good deal.The hotel was very clean and had nice, contemporary decor.  I found all of the staff to be exceptionally friendly and helpful - especially Tim at the front desk and the valet staff at the front door.  They have a nicely appointed business center where you can print your boarding pass, etc.The daily breakfast bar is easy to catch (6-10am) and the dining area is relatively large compared to most.  Food selection is good - always an egg dish along with a meat or potato side, fresh cut fruit, oatmeal, cold cereal, pastries, make your own waffles, coffee, juice, etc.  They also have some sort of 'treat' available later in the day and coffee available all day as near as I could tell.My room was spacious - king bed w/ a sofa - and very clean, contemporary, and well maintained.  The bathroom was especially nice - large, nice vanity, glass enclosure shower, tile, etc.  Despite being on the road, had some of my best sleep in ages because the bed was so comfy!Easy walk to the Inner Harbor and U of M campus, but you are on the western edge of the 'generally considered safe' area, so familiarize yourself with a map and don't stray too far west on foot.Overall, I was thoroughly impressed and my expectations were far exceeded.  I would definitely choose to stay here again.The best thing about this hotel is the location.It is within walking distance of the convention center - and this is what I was looking for. I typically stay at Sheraton's but I was a bit late on making reservations for this trip.free continental breakfast - I will say it was ediblefree wififree laundry (washer &amp; dryers in basement for guest use)No restaurant at hotel. I got in pretty late from my flight and all I wanted was room service. I could have gone next door to a bar or my other option was to walk a few blocks to go and find if anything was open. I was not a fan of that.The last day (I stayed for 5 nights)  I was in the shower and the fire alarm went off in my room. The desk called my room and asked if I was ok. It was only my room that the alarm was going off and it could not be turned off. It was on for 45 minutes! They tried to tell me it was the due to the hot water and the shower but then they admitted it was a malfunction.  The fire alarm sound was a horrible sound that left my ears ringing for hours and gave me a horrible headache. I had to quickly find clothes so I could let on of the staff in to take a look. I ended up being late for my conference and really out of it due to my headache. Next time I am in town I will make my reservations sooner!Great Hampton, I stay in a lot of hotels, this is a very roomy place, up to date, clean and great amenities.  Good price, great room.Yes, it is a Hampton Inn.  Don't expect room service or mints on the pillows.  But the people are great, the service is great (if something breaks or you need help finding something), and it is very close to the Inner Harbor, Convention Center, and both stadiums.  I was not out after 10 or 11 pm, but during that time and between the hotel and Little Italy it always felt safe.  And, of course, it is significantly cheaper than the HIlton, Hyatt, Marriott, etc.Staying at this Hampton Inn was a pleasure! Everything was nice &amp; clean. It was super convenient for going to the Camden Yards stadium just across the street. What made our stay special was the professionalism and courtesy of Tim at the reception desk and Lemwood who I met while he was making popcorn. They both made our stay special. I definitely recommend this place! Rick Thompson 6/7&amp;8/2014Great location would be an epic understatement.  Hotel is right across the street from Camden Yards.  Lots of places to eat, things to see and do.  Even as a business traveler here for work and not play the game night traffic was negotiable.  My only recommendations for improvement would be to increase the dining space and improve its layout.Great location, decent hotel.The ""free"" breakfast is horrible.  Beyond that, it's a decent hotel.  Really friendly staff, clean rooms, located next to the ballpark bars and across the street from Camden Yards.This place is sooooo nice- the staff is great, breakfast is good- conveniently located- and just about the ONLY hotel Ive been to (and Im on the road about 40% of my life for work)- that use of the laundry facilities are FREE- (they even have baskets for you to use)- I will DEFINITELY stay here again !","I came for a conference. The room was nice and the hotel is in a great location. 5 minutes from the harbor and from the mall. The free breakfast is really nice and it also has free wifi. I liked the pool as well.Has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed in! They are always prompt, courteous, clean, professional, and reasonably priced! I have stayed several other hotels before and will always choose a Hampton Inn over anything else!This hotel is immaculately clean, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, and the location is unbelievable for the price. I threw a party at Camden Yards and had guests come in from all over the country.  The rooms are sparkling clean, spacious, well appointed and have great views.  The sales team gave me regular updates on bookings before our stay, they reserved the best views in the house for my guests, and gave me access to a meeting room to use as a hospitality suite.  The manager sent a birthday card, champagne, and chocolate to my room, and made me feel extremely comfortable.  They had a nice dining area where my friends congregated for breakfast the day after the party and the sales manager came over to thank us for staying at the hotel.  They don't have parking but when you see the location, you understand why.  But valet was painless.  The immediate neighborhood is attractive and I felt safe walking around at night.  I will absolutely stay here again when I am in Baltimore, assuming that I get my room for around the same price.I booked Hampton Inn as my hotel for my business trip last minute because there was no room in Marriot / Sheraton, or other big name hotels, and I am really glad that happened!UNLIKE Marriot, Sheraton where the rooms design are outdated, and kind of dirty (yea, you know it!) Hampton Inn is still so clean and new!!  The beds were so comfortable.  I love that I can just go back to the hotel after a day of hard work, without worrying about the room hygiene, and sleep like a baby  =DThe price is a bit expensive (I would not have selected this place if the trip for personal), but I think that is only because there is constantly conventions 10 minutes away, so it is more suitable for business travellers.  As for the service, I lost something very valuable in the hotel room, they helped me to retrieve it very quickly.  When I found out, it was around checkout time, but despite how busy they were dealing with the convention attendees, the receptionist and his manager helped me to call the cleaning lady a few times, and I got the item back within 20 minutes, so I really appreciate their help!Additional Info:-there are good iron and iron board. -Free breakfast has fruits, sausage, egg, etc.  Many types of coffee, tea, juice.  There were a lot of people, so the food containers seem small, and it seemed overcrowded.  -The only thing that I wish Hampton Inn has is disposable slippers. (well, I did forget to bring mine...)I will book this hotel again next time!This is an excellent hotel. Not only is it in a great location at a great price, but the staff was very pleasant. The complimentary breakfast was great, plenty of hot options. The room size was extremely nice and the hotel and a well kept, clean feel. I would definitely stay at this Hampton Inn again.Staff was very friendly and helpful.  A stones throw away from Camden Yards.  Continental breakfast is pretty tasty.I stayed in this hotel for a visit to the University of Maryland, Baltimore and it's perfectly situated at a mere 5 min walk to the Admissions Office.The rooms are very nice since it's a brand new hotel and they offer plenty of towels and amenities. The bed is comfortable and the pillows are probably the softest that I've ever felt. There are ironing boards and irons in the rooms and a shoe cloth as well.The staff is relatively friendly too. You can approach them for just about anything and they're happy to help you.They offer free wi-fi internet throughout the hotel and will give you a PIN when you first check-in. You have free wired connection in your room, as well. If you don't have a laptop, there's a free business room on the main level with printers if you want to print your boarding passes or other documents that you need on your trip.The food options are limited around the hotel, however, but it comes to a decision whether you want to be close to campus or whether you want to be close to the food.The area around the hotel is also very safe.My first complaint is the breakfast, which is terrible! Then again, the hotel doesn't have its own restaurant so this is probably to be expected.  You'll be better off sticking to a bowl of cereal than eating their attempts at food.My other complaint is the price. It can be rather expensive, but if you make a reservation as a friend of the University of Maryland, you'll get a slight discount. I chose this hotel primarily because the other (cheaper) hotels close to campus were full.====Rubric: 5 = Mindblowing 4 = Excellent 3 = I see the charm 2 = Disappointing 1 = Never againI stayed at this hotel for one night at the beinning of December.  I was in town for the Monday Night Patriots Ravens football game.  This hotel is very close to the stadium - at check they ask why you are there - if you tell them for the game they make you sign a form saying you will not party in your room.  Ok.  So everything was just fine got pretty drunk at the game and dont really recall much.  Well, the following morning attempted to call valet to have my car brought up - no answer - great.  So, I manage to fit my pounding head into the elevator to check out and retrieve my car for the 5 hour ride home - what was I thinking.  So,  there are plenty of valet employees standing around when we get down there - I had over my ticket to one guy - he opens the cabinet that holds the keys and the following conversation takes palceVALET ""Yo, your keys aint here""ME ""Excuse Me?VALET ""Heres your ticket back.  I dont know what to tell you""ME ""Are you EFFEN kidding me?""VALET ""Sorry""Mind you I have this car for about 10 days at this point.  So, at this point another valet comes over and takes the ticket and begins to look for the keys.  I end up pointing out my own keys hanging in the cabinet.  So,  I assume they drama is over - oh no.Valet #1 takes the keys and says he will be back in 10 minutes - this hotel doesnt have its own garage and the park in a few different garages in the area. Ok Dude just please get my car I am starting to sweat out the booze from the night before.Valet #1 returns with the keys.  ""yo, your car aint there""and he hands me the keys.  I am about to freak out when Valet #2 appears again and says he will find it.Valet #2 returns with the keys - no car Valet #3 steps in - in attempt to avert my nuclear meltdown and after another 30 minutes he finally finds my car.This process took over an hour...",,,"['great', 'hotel', 'unbeatable', 'price', 'robin', 'hands', 'best', 'staff', 'encountered', 'hotel', 'traveling', 'years',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-baltimore-downtown-inner-harbor-baltimore,Courtyard Baltimore Downtown/Inner Harbor,3.0,$$,37,"Stayed here for a family weekend away. Staff was amazing.  Room was great with a good view.  I would fully recommend.Only worth two stars.  It will do for families or business trips but they offer nothing that would make you seek this place out.  Gym is 3Treadmills In a room. Downstairs bar and restaurant is airport quality.  Front desk girls couldn't get my bill right, I had to call corporate.  Likely won't be back.Stayed here for a recent Saturday &amp; Sunday night. A little pricey, but the area is worth it.Walking distance to the inner harbor or fells point! Pros: The lobby is very pretty, functional &amp; modern. The bed was amazingly comfortable. Small, but very efficient. A ton of HBO channels. Paul Mitchell bath products.Cons: No fridge or micro. I don't know if this is standard for Courtyards, but I definitely missed them. The inly big issue happened on the day I was checking out. I locked myself out of my room, and had left my wallet in the car. The guy at the front desk required me to show ID to have a new key made. I've NEVER experienced this before. I offered him my business card, and to recite ANY information associated with the account, but he wouldn't budge. I had to walk all the way back to my car to get ID.I don't know why anyone gives this place more than 2 stars. Being clean and nice aren't ""pluses"" they're givens. Here for work and wifi is weak and horrible; not strong enough to hold outlook. I literally have to go to Starbucks to try and get some work done. (!!!) and the ""cable"" or whatever this is goes on the fritz every 2-3 minutes. There's not even room service. You have to go downstairs and pick it up yourself. If I'm ordering room service it's because I don't want to leave my room; it's not because I think the overpriced food is so great. Wished I would have booked the Hilton. And THIS place was even MORE expensive. Stupid. Courtyards suck. I'll never return.Due to a blizzard a few years ago, my job put us up here to ensure that we'd be safe and get to work in the morning. The staff was awesome, and tried to assist as much as possible due to the storm. The room was clean and the bed was comfy.Downstairs, there's a cafe. Great wings!I've stayed here about 5 times for work so far and I love it. The staff is AWESOME! I think it's a policy never to say 'no' to a request from a customer service standpoint. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The gym could be bigger but they offer you free workouts at a local gym during your stay if you want. Breakfast in the morning is pretty good and Internet is FREE. Walkable to many attractions and restaurants.We had our Family Reunion based here and the staff were extra polite and accommodating. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was to firm for me but good for my wife. The walls a bit thin in my view. But nothing interrupted us really. Super close to shopping and #7 water taxi stop.Firstly this hotel is in a great location.. Conveniently located to restaurants, shops and the harbor. The place is clean and the staff are friendly. Will definitely stay here again.Visited this hotel while in town for a wedding.  This is in a good location, if you want to check out the Inner Harbor or Fells Point.  We had a wedding discount, but the price was still high (and parking was $23 a day... yikes).  The room itself was decent- nothing special.  It seems like a good place to go if you have a family- safe neighborhood, walkable to the attractions, and has a little snack stand/Starbucks to get breakfast in the morning.Classic Courtyard inside; the great thing is the location in Fells Point as well as the staff. Just some of the finest staffers I've ever seen in all my years of traveling.The hotel itself is 3 stars, but the staff there are super awesome which lands them a 5 star for service ! Always helpful and really made our stay pleasant. We had to go to the Fair Field Inn down the street for a couple days due to the the boiler being repaired and that place was crap compared to this place.Thanks everyone for the nice East Coast welcome!Now to start off I was using a free night certificate which I waited until the day before it was to expire to use it. What was I thinking? Really didn't have much of a choice. I was a little disappointed when I was informed that the other Marriott that I stayed in before that was a category 4 was now a category 5. However this Marriott that was once a 5 was now a 4. Anyway That was the first of disappointments. Second of all I was informed before I actually booked that this Marriott was going through renovations. Ok............And the pool and exercise room would be closed. So not good for me. Oh and I was also informed that NO King beds were available. So, I had to stay in a room with double beds when I was the only one in the room. So not fun. So, I arrive to the hotel at check in time. The front desk person was very friendly.I checked to see if just by luck they would have the king bed availble but, the didn't. I get my key and off to my room. The room was clean. However when you have stayed at higher category Marriott Hotels this one was disappointing. Don't get me wrong it was clean but, small in space. I felt like I was turning around in a box. I couldn't just stay in the room and relax like I had plan. I had to get out.I did like that there was not a lot of in going and out going traffic going on to the hotel. I returned when it was time to go to bed. I slept well because the Marriott mattress is the best. Woke up on time just as I planned.Because they were doing renovations they did offer a complimentary breakfast in which they don't normally offer. This room too was also small. Everything felt so compact to be a Marriott Hotel. I was glad to have good choices available to eat for my healthy choice of eating. Grapefruit, hot tea, Special K with splenda,water and skim milk. The eating area was clean also and the attendant in that room was very friendly also. I checked out this morning right after breakfast so that I could head out to work. Check out was pretty easy. I was gonna purchase a yogurt but, the person at the front desk said that yogurt was availble in the dining area complimentary. However, I took the yogurt with me but, when I went to open it when I got to work I found that the yogurt had expired.This was not a terrible experience at the Marriott However, I have to say that If I had paid to stay the night here I would not have been satisfied considering the Marriott's high standards.Awful hotel! Go anywhere else and pay through the nose if you have toThe MAIN REASON I gave 1 star is because the walls are paper thin in the room and I could pretty much hear everything such as the elevator dinging, people coughing, rude guests talking at 3 a.m. -- absolutely paper thin! There is nothing the staff can do to correct the problem as this is a structural issue. The shower must have been designed by a corrections officer. It needs a total remodel. The TV had grainy analog picture on most of its channels.The mattress was uncomfortable. I never had this, but it gave me severe leg cramps. I didn't get one restful nights sleep.Fitness center: A DISGRACE. It consists of a tiny room about 150 sq ft, with aerobic machines, bench and weight set. Its a very small space that can barely accommodate 3 people. If 2 people need to do yoga, you might as well come back later.The windows look out on some apartment building over. The buildings are so close together that you can see them and they can see you.So.... I would recommend this if you're a VERY heavy sleeper and don't care to stay in shape.For all others, check yourself into anywhere but this place.Nice night at the Courtyard last night. The staff was very accommodating and the bed and pillows were wonderful.I called the day before to see if I could change to a king sized bed instead of 2 dobles as our child was no longer accompanying us. That was done with out a problem.Parking was not my favorite thing here, but the staff apologized for the lack of valet and as this is a very walk-able location, it was really a none issue. As others have commented, the walls are pretty thin, and there was a couple of times during the night that I heard vacuuming. we had to jet out in the morning, so not sure about the breakfast ect.Place was overall decent, but I might pass the next time. For the money, I would rather not be staring into someone's living room as I was last night. They seemed nice enough though.We stayed here in April while we were in town for a conference.  First of all, the positives: GREAT location.  Walking distance to shopping and restaurants, close-by parking, etc.  Good food options in the actual Marriott itself, which we utlized since we were starving and it was too early for dinner :-)  Great service, minues the incident below.The negative, which brought this down 3 stars: I wasn't aware we booked a DJ for our club.  I mean our hotel room.  I'm sure our neighbors had a great time, but we did not.  Pretty sure our walls were actually thumping.  We called the front desk to handle the problem multiple times, which was really disappointing.  It should have been handled immediately, and potentially with the offer of something comped!I stayed overnight at the Courtyard Baltimore Downtown overnight with my husband using his Marriott points.  He travels extensively for work and always stays at Marriotts.  Reading the reviews on Yelp, we were a little concerened but luckily we were pleasantly surprised.   He said that although the hotel was nothing special, it was comparable to other Courtyards he has stayed at in the past.The front dest staff was phenomenal and provided excellent service.  Our room was clean and the bed was super comfortable.  The pool area was nothing special but we only used it for a short amount of time during our stay. If the pool is something that is very important to you, this could be a downside.  The location was great and within walking distance to tons of restaurants, bars and shops.  The main downside as others have pointed out was the thin walls.  We could hear everything the people in the room next to us were saying at one point during our stay. To be fair, we were in a room with an adjoining door to the room next to us, so I don't know if that factored into things.Overall, we had a really positive experience and would absolutely stay here again!Just stayed one night and my favorite thing about the hotel was the location.  Walking distance to the Harbor and Fells Point.  Had a Whole Foods in the same complex.  A nice location to stumble back from Fells Point.  Clean hotel, most of the staff was friendly.  A nice area where they have computers for surfing the Internet but I really don't use them, never log into your email or facebook or anything else for that matter.  You never know what someone has put on them.  My only issue was our room was right near the elevator, we heard everyone getting on and off all night long.  The room next to ours had an issue with the door some they had someone drilling at 10:30 at night fixing it.*3.5 Stars*Not your usually priced Courtyard but very nice nonetheless. Located in a great area of Baltimore and down the st from plenty of restaurants, bars and nightlife. Walking distance to Power Plant and Fells Point. It's a great place to stay if you are in Baltimore and don't want to worry about your safety. The check in area is small as well as their eating area. Elevators are a bit slow and they have an elevator that goes to the parking deck so you don't have to be outside for the walk. It's a bit pricey but you are paying for convenience. Their rooms are nice and and clean. Bathrooms are decent size with roomy shower area. Towels are eh. I don't expect much but I also am pleased with my stays at a Courtyard. This one no difference. ENJOY!Not writing about the hotel.. Writing about the marriott courtyard ""bistro"".. Hotel package came with an app and a couple cocktails from the bistro. Now, I've eaten at many a courtyard bistro so I am very familiar with their food and simple menu. As simple as it is, the BBQ chicken flatbread I ordered would be better eaten with a spoon. Undercooked flatbread, sopping with BBQ sauce led to it being Non edible. Sadly, the barkeep Marti was so blissfully ignorant as to customer service that when she asked me how it was a good 10 min after it was served  and I told her it was soggy.. She just said sorry and walked away. Maybe she was in the weeds from the other 3 people in the bar (sarcasm) that she couldn't speak. Or more likely, she is just poorly trained on customer service. Either way, boo for marriott. Such a simple dumbed down menu should require barely more than a heartbeat to execute. Congrats.... You found how to make simple a complete f up.  Thank god she knows how to tilt a bottle of wine to clearly marked lines on impossibly small wine glasses to avoid over pours. Your Food and Beverage costs must be legendary. Only reason for the second star above is that it was part of a package I paid an additional 20$ for upon checking in and the wine was worth 20$. Let me get back to my BBQ flatbread soup. Cheers.I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, but the parking is WAYYYY too expensive.  Also, it seems the towels are thread-bare and the walls are very thin.  I could hear people traipsing down the hallway at all hours of the night.On a positive note, my room had a balcony with a lovely view if I craned my neck.  It's close to the harbor, and the neighborhood seemed safe and fun.  The bed was UNBELIEVABLY COMFORTABLE.  I'd go back again but make sure I bring ear plugs.","Major downside to this hotel, and I'm surprised how much it does show up in all of the reviews-- the walls are paper thin. I've actually never experienced anything like this in any large chain hotel, only boutiques or even hostels. In the morning we could hear everything in the room next door-- they were up with their child and talking about their weekend, playing games with the kid, etc. We felt terribly knocking on the wall and asking them to keep it down, because they were using regular voices and enjoying their room as a hotel guest should. We could also hear all the details of anyone's conversation in the hallway, as well as any opening and closing doors of rooms around ours. We were really looking forward to a Sunday morning sleep in, the bed was comfortable and we were exhausted from a long week and a great wedding the night before. But at 8am we just game up. It was impossible to sleep with the noise anymore.Everything else about this hotel is above average for a Marriott and really quite lovely. But, the main thing you're looking for a hotel room is some peace and quiet. Not found here.Although I did not stay here, I had to make some arrangements for delivery of a gift to this hotel for a guest.THANK YOU EMMA, for your amazing service and attention to detail.  You made everything so easy and simple.  Outstanding service!Rooms are Clean and Quiet. Hotel is right in the middle of everything. Had a package to stay here for the weekend and enjoyed the weekend getaway away from home. Would love to visit again soon.Stayed in this Courtyard for a couple of nights while in Baltimore for a weekend away. The hotel is one where it's part of an overall building that also encompasses stores, offices and a parking garage. Personally I prefer my hotels to be just hotels and not mixed use. The Room was pretty average, nothing bad but certainly nothing great and the price was ok. The location is very good, it's just off the Inner Harbor and walking distance from Fells Point.All in all it was an OK hotel experience. Although I will probably try one of the other hotels in the area next time to see if I can do better.I am a Marriott fan but this property is in need of an update.  Old Courtyard decor, but great location on inner harbor.Location was great, I could walk to the harbor and to many of the nearby restaurants.Room was nice, it was clean and it had everything I needed, including a small fridge.  Pool and Jacuzzi were okay, maybe a little smaller than the photo made them look and it tended to get crowded even if it was only less than 50% of capacity of 45 people.  Parking was $25/night but I was only there for 2 nights so the price did not bother me. There is lots to do in this area and I had a fantastic time.  The girls at the front desk were kind and genuinely interested in helping me make the most of my stay, I even got a coupon for free Lobster Pot Stickers at Roy's (worth $16).  I did end up leaving early and even though It was already 10pm when I checked out I was not charged for the parking ($25) and the room rate was reduced by about $30 (their weekday rate). I never even asked for the deductions and that is the sort of thing that makes this place stand out. I loved Baltimore and I will definitely return to this hotel and stay a bit longerI agree with the previous reviewer. I've been to some bordering on luxurious Courtyards, but this is not one of them. I picked this place for the value and location, which is very good--smack dab in Harbor East (lots of great eats, movie theater), easy walk to Fells and the Inner Harbor. If you want to really enjoy your accomodations, go further in towards the other Marriott or the Renaissance. But if you want to be able to enjoy everything else around you, this should do.The front desk staff was a bit busy, which was slightly annoying (had to stand and wait for check-in while the staff was manning the phones, which kept ringing). The room was standard and clean. Nothing luxurious. There was even a little cube fridge, which is nice if you're staying around. The parking is $23 a day, but you can go in and out w/your room card.Stayed here for one night for a wedding in town, better than having to drive home or taxi it. All i can say is that my stay was great. The staff was friendly and cordial. The room was comfortable and clean. My requests were all taken care of. And the breakfast sandwich i order was fantastic. Parking is a bit expensive, as is the case for most of the hotels in the city, but the easy in and out access was nice (would recommend that if you do park in their garage you do so on the upper level, more open spaces and less of a fight for the spaces with the other tenants in the complex). Also the location can't be beat, located in harbor east (which has plenty to offer its self), you're a short walk from the Inner Harbor, Fells Point, and related attractions. Needless to say when and if i need an overnight in the city, assuming the courtyard has a room, it's defiantly i hotel i would take under consideration.Clean spacious rooms, a small gym, and free breakfast.  Unfortunately I never woke up early enough to partake.  Oh well, next time.Hotel is close to a bunch of restaurants and shops at the Inner Harbor so it is quite convenient...if I came back, I'd stay here again!Good hotel for the price. The walk to the Inner Harbor is very short and it's in a cool area itself. The pool and hot tub are nice as well, and the room was good. We were on the 14th floor and the view was awesome. The workers here were very courteous and nice, so it was overall a great stay.As most of the folks here will tell you, there's nothing super special about this Courtyard, but there's really nothing bad about it, either.  If you frequent Courtyard's you're probably familiar with this place already.The rooms are nice, new, and clean.  The location is great.  There are plenty of restaurants and shops around to walk to.The restaurant is typical Courtyard.  I ate breakfast one day.  Nothing to write home about.  It might be more beneficial to head over to the Whole Foods and pick something up there....Parking is a bit expensive in the garage, and they have no valet.  Often the key they give you doesn't work the garage anyway....The staff is friendly and helpful.  No complaints here!I've also stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn around the corner, and for the price, that may be a better bet.  Plus it's connected to the MAC, so you can walk right over to the gym.  But if you're tied to Marriott rewards, this will do the trick just fine.It was so noisy at night in the hallway. Awful.Do not stay here. They put charges on your account that you have not authorized. Hotel is going through remodel also so it is very noisy.work puts me up here for 8 days every other month. some staff are courteous, professional, and helpful. others would do better as unpaid doorstops. only stay here if you're saving money.Good, clean, &amp; comfortable.  Looking foward to my upcoming stay for the Fell's Point Fest!If you are going to use the pool, call ahead of time and make sure you are knowledgable about their limited hours, especially during the week.The front desk people won't tell you, but there are cheaper places to park.  Try the lot on Eastern &amp; President for $7 a day instead of $22.Don't order a movie.  The TVs only go up to a certain volume, and you'll have to starin to hear throughout the entire movie.Also, there are no lakeview rooms at this hotel.There's nothing special about this Courtyard Marriott. But there's nothing bad about it either. They fulfilled the standard work-travel lodging expectation. Nothing too cool. However, they get points for location (great restaurants all around). It also shares the building with Whole Foods. That's pretty cool.",,,,"['family', 'weekend', 'away', 'staff', 'amazing', 'room', 'great', 'good', 'view', 'fully', 'recommend', 'worth', 'stars', 'families', 'business', 'trips', 'offer', 'nothing',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-baltimore-downtown-inner-harbor-baltimore-2,SpringHill Suites Baltimore Downtown/Inner Harbor,3.5,$$,38,"Came here for a quick visit. Nothing really negative to say here. Yes, it's an older building and has been renovated...but this place is clean and simple. And when it comes to hotel rooms, cleaniness is most important to me. Customer service was pleasant. And what else could I ask for? I didn't get a chance to see the gym which is one of the reasons why I booked this place. So yeah, decent pricing considering the harbor, clean, simple, and good customer service...a Marriott fan? Then why not give this place a shot.We stayed three nights here.  I'ts a really old hotel that used to be a bank.  I'm not usually a fan of these older hotels.  This place is different.  They can't help that it is old.  The remodeling job is great.  The only place you really notice it is in the size of the hallways and the old elevators.  The rooms are great.  We had a suite, one of the nicer places I've stayed.  Refrigerator and microwave in the room, great coffee choices. The room had two televisions, one for the bedroom and one for the separate living room.  I own a cleaning company.  I know clean when I see it.  I travel a lot and am mostly disappointed  with the level of cleanliness at most hotels. They have a great staff here.  From the front desk to the cleaning staff all are very professional.  Great valet parking attendants too.  I was walking around the downtown area looking for a Chinese place late at night so I called the front desk.  The woman knew just where to send me and even knew when it closed.  She gave me directions over the phone so I could walk right to it.  I'll go back..Very nice place to stay. Very reasonable price for downtown Baltimore. Half as much as the other hotels around. Room was spacious. Had two separate areas. One had a couch, desk, kitchenette and a tv. The other had the bed and bathroom. Very nice. Only stayed one night so I paid four dollar to park out on the street. There is street parking out front from 8-6 Monday -Saturday. Free Sunday. $2 an hour. The breakfast is good to. Waffles eggs cereal fruit. Would definitely recommend itQuite a comfortable hotel and from the ninth floor, very little street noise made it up to here. The occasional slammed door made it through the walls but otherwise, it was very quiet.The room had the same layout as other SpringHills where I have stayed. Two beds on one side of a half wall with a fold-out sofa and work desk on the other side. Small fridge and microwave with coffee service. Clean bathroom with tub/shower plus a separate vanity area. Armoire rather than closet, with a folding ironing table. Two TV's in the room (one for each side of the half-wall). Internet was easy to access and worked quite well.Market in the lobby has snacks and drinks. Breakfast is served in the morning with the usual scrambled eggs, meat, bread/bagels for toasting, fruit, yogurt, etc.$32/day for valet parking. Yikes!I recently stayed at this location. The staff was helpful. The rooms are nice with plenty of places to eat and shop within walking distance.Our water went out again - the damned polar vortex, same as last year, only our plumber was unfortunately out of town on vacation.  Gah!  So we had no choice but to stay in a hotel for a couple of days, and I went on Priceline in desperation to try and get something of a good rate.  This was the hotel it picked, and I must say that, for the money I paid (61 a night), it was WELL worth the price.  It's a Marriott, first of all, which I've always had a bit of luck with.  The room (204) was VERY spacious - a separate ""sitting room/office"" combined with the bedroom made for a LOT of room.  Two flat screen TVs?  Well, I don't know what one would do with that, especially when they're right next to one another, but it was a help when my husband wanted to sleep and not be disturbed, so I was okay with that.The Wifi is complimentary and runs VERY nicely.  I had a paper for grad school due this weekend, so that came in VERY handy.  No interruptions, and plenty fast enough.  I was very pleased.Complimentary continental breakfast in the mornings (7:30 to 10am on weekends).  The offerings were actually quite generous, much more so than most other hotels.  They had a choice of hot oatmeal, make-your-own waffles (with toppings, yet), eggs, sausage/potato/pepper medley, all types of pastries, plenty of juice and coffee available, yogurt, cereal... really, it was much more than I'd expected, and it was all pretty good.  I don't know what people are expecting from a hotel-provided breakfast - this isn't going to be Miss Shirley's quality.  It was good enough for me.Laundry facilities here, and that was REALLY handy for me, since we weren't able to wash clothes at home.  2 bucks a shot for a big washer or dryer, and they're efficient.  Laundry supplies are available at the front desk for a buck a pop.  Worth it to me, I want clean clothes.Exercise room/gym available.  Weight room is a bit skimpy - ONE machine! - but it's multi-functional and gets the job done.  Cardio room is equipped a little better, though if it's busy you won't get a machine.  I went at 3:45am to exercise and it was blissfully silent.  Well, except for the horrible squeaking from the elliptical that I could hear through my headphones, but hey - it's there, it works, it's available.  I won't complain.A couple of negatives, though they're minor:- I don't know what it's like on other floors, but the 2nd floor is extremely close to the street and therefore you can hear people yelling quite clearly.  I was woken on Sunday morning by the people shoveling the snow off the sidewalks outside.  I know they have to get it done, but for Pete's sake, it's Sunday morning.  Be aware of the noise factor - if you wake up when a pin hits the floor, you may want to avoid the lower floors altogether.- It was a little loud in the ""office"".  Some kind of rhythmic humming going on in there that, quite frankly, drove me batshit.  (Although it's oddly soothing at night, like white noise.  Put me right out.)- Walls are paper-thin.  You WILL hear people talking/yelling/arguing next door if they're particularly loud/inconsiderate.- No direct way to the basement where the exercise room/laundry/conference rooms are but for one elevator, and it doesn't always come.  You have to take the stairs the rest of the way down, which was okay by me, but if you're disabled or have limited mobility it may be a pain in the neck/impossible to navigate.The bank vault/conference room is AWESOME, by the way.  Beautiful architecture.  They just don't make 'em like that anymore.We had a good stay here.  Don't know if I'd pay full rate (120 a night?  Ehhh...), but for 61 a night in dire circumstances, unbeatable.I stayed here for an entire weekend and for the three days I was a tenant in this hotel, there was no hot water available. The benefit of staying in a hotel is the ability to shower (obviously) and this hotel did not even have the courtesy to inform me of this ongoing issue upon check-in. I was appalled at how the situation was handled not only during my stay, but after my stay. The hotel provided me with a minimal refund despite the huge inconvenience of not having the ability to shower. I would never stay in this establishment again. The management is shaky at best and the front desk people are clueless.I really enjoyed my stay here at the Marriott Springhill Suites. My room was spacious - and I mean spacious (compared to NYC ""suites"") It was clean , comfortable and cozy. The architecture of the hotel is gorgeous. It was an old postal office/bank and I love the fact they kept some of those vintage pieces like the mail chute and vault. I didn't make it to the continental breakfast they serve so I can't review that but overall it was an awesome stay.This hotel is both historic and in a great location. The building is lovely (check out the vault gone conference room in the basement), the breakfast is plenteous (though not as much as an Embassy Suites or other upscale locations), and the cleanliness is good on the first night but the maids skip tasks and leave visible gaps in their cleaning if you stay more than one night. There is NO parking apart from Valet unless you're willing to use public garages a block over in either direction (and those will be full if it's a game night/weekend), so expect to spend an additional $35+ per night in Valet fees and have a 30 minute wait to pick up your car upon request. If you're walking to attractions, this is a 4 star; otherwise, it's a 3.A little pricey, but clean and with a nice open lobby and dining area. Full breakfast (yogurt, sausage, eggs, coffee, etc) and free wifi. Places nearby didn't have that. I enjoyed my stay and would return.Cleanliness is not capitalized. If the first what you see when you step in the  bath room a dirty towel that hangs over the shower rod, then you has to ask yourself  here the rooms are not controlled by the housekeeper supervisor. If someone had checked the rooms, he also would  notice  the totally smeared mirror and   that the front door had a similarly looked like the mirror.Obviously, the Hauskeeper use a swab for everything.Disgusting!!!Remnants of the guest he stayed before at this room was found at the moderately vacuumed carpet.Positive is, the hotel is close to port and is centrally locatedNegative is, there are homeless people everywhere. What however is not the fault of the hotel.Stayed there for one night. Long time since I was in a hotel that allowed smoking, and on top of that it would appear that I got bitten by bedbugs or similar creatures - any bare skin was covered in bite marks the following day. However, there was free WiFi and OK breakfast, but I will think twice before I go back to this place.Room was excellent, the staff was friendly and accommodating. The location was convenient to my conference and the amenities were far superior to my colleagues at the host hotel. Also, the room was cheaper than the blocked rooms at the host hotel. Overall I would recommend this hotel again and will stay there again if/when I return to BaltimoreThe room - excellent. We had a nice corner suite on a high floor. There was plenty of space. The location was also convenient, and within walking distance of many nice venues. The breakfast... it is what it is. Bad enough to make this place lose a star. No excuses, but they need to be able to handle the late Sunday AM rush a little better.SMALL BUT CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS INCREDIBLE: Stayed here this weekend for a bachelor party. There were some pros and cons but the customer service we received was the tipping point. LOCATION: (Grade: B) - Hotel is in a fairly nice neighborhood.. About 3 blocks from some of the filth. The location is about 2 blocks from the inner harbor which is close to The Gallery, Cheesecake Factory, Hooters, Phillips, etc. Close to nightlife with bars and POWERPLANT Live within blocks. Also about 10 blocks from Camden Yards. There is a valet park overnight option for $30 which seems steep - or you can walk 5 blocks and pay $25 for overnight. HOTEL AND AMENITIES : (Grade B-) - The room was somewhat spacious but on the smaller side. The building itself is smaller. Beds were comfy. Clean. Neat. Free continental breakfast with eggs and some waffles - eggs were runny - I'd clean that up to make it better. EXPERIENCE : (Grade A+) - After eating we wanted to watch the O's game but when talking with the manager Bryan MASN wasn't offered. No Orioles game in Baltimore? However, he asked if he could make it up to us (5guys) and offered us 10 beers of our choice from the lobby convenience nook. WOW! IF I OWNED A HOTEL.. I WOULD STEAL THIS GUY AND HIRE HIM! Overall for $120 a night it was worth it and I would stay again.I've stayed at many of the hotels in the Baltimore area and most of the chain hotels downtown. I checked in for several days with three coworkers and stayed a few nights here at the Spring Hill suites. We found the rooms very spacious and clean.The front desk staff, the valets, and the other staff that we ran into in the hotel were very friendly and helpful.This is a chain hotel with a little bit of character. My traveling companions and all I all have decided that we had an excellent stay here and will stay here again in the future. This is an incredible bargain - and bargains are harder and harder to find in Baltimore.I stay at a whole lot of Marriotts, and this hotel is one of the better facilities that I've stayed at under the Courtyard/SpringHill/Residence Inn/Fairfield banners.The first, and probably the best, reason which sets it apart is that it's unique - it's not a cookie cutter hotel.  The building was converted from an old bank to this Springhill Suites and it looks like it.  They kept all of the charm and look and it all comes together nicely.  You can even see the old bank vault if you walk downstairs (from the lobby).  I posted a picture of it in case you want to check it out.The second is the fact that it is a five minute walk from the Inner Harbor - FIVE MINUTES!  Believe you me, I try not to patronize the chain restaurants there, but I sure love walking around the water, checking out the skyline, and visiting the aquarium.  It's beautiful.The third takes into account the first two - the price.  This hotel is cheap for what you get in the location get it in.  Last year when I stayed there I paid $115/night, and this year I paid $145/night.  C'mon now, those prices are awesome for only being two blocks from the Inner Harbor and staying at an attractive hotel.The staff is very friendly and helpful, the happy hour specials at the bar cannot be beat (see my ""tip""), the rooms are nice - two wall mounted flat screens, mini fridge, and microwave.I have been staying here, and will continue to stay here on every trip to Baltimore.I have stayed here a few times on work trips in the king suite.  The suites have a fridge and a microwave and are overall very well decorated.  The front desk staff has always been friendly and helpful.  There is no hotel-specific parking, so they encourage valet parking which is over $30 per day.  I usually choose to park on the street. My one pet peeve is that they do not provide lotion with the toiletries.  The breakfast buffet  has a good selection of average food.  It is not impressive but it gets the job done. If you are on the lower floors, noise can be an issue.  Overall, the hotel is great.Had a quick trip to BWI and had a 6am flight out. Picked this hotel and was ok with the pick. I prefer full service hotel, but ended up here. Nice peopleStayed June 2011I came a few weekends ago to celebrate my anniversary with my boyfriend. Every person we encountered from the staff was very nice and helpful. The room was great and very comfortable. The location was also ideal as it was just a 10-15 minute walk from the restaurants and attractions we wanted to visit. We took full advantage of the valet service which really comes in handy when we wanted to travel a little farther out of the inner harbor for restaurants or shops. Otherwise, we stayed local and walked. The only thing that really interfered with my ability to give this place a 4 or 5 rating was that every night between 2 and 3 AM, a bar nearby would let out and loud obnoxious people would be screaming up and down the street. We were on the 6th floor and found it unbearable. We considered calling down to the front desk but what could anyone really do? I wish I could say that I'd stay here again as the staff was really very lovely but being woken up every night, unable to fall back asleep for a few hours negatively impacted our trip as we tended to sleep a bit later than expected and were a little grumpier. If we come back to Baltimore in the future, which I'm sure we will, I think we'd have to stay somewhere that's not as densely populated.","We stayed here because we needed a hotel in Baltimore close to Federal Hill and Fells Point (where our friends live) and M&amp;T Bank stadium.  So this was it.  We got a great deal through Travelocity and had no problem finding the hotel.  Valet parking is a little steep at $32/night but you do have unlimited in/out privileges and when all is considered, it beats hoofing it to a garage only to schlep all your stuff back to the hotel.  At any rate, the staff at this particular hotel is so friendly.  From everyone from the valet, to the front desk, to the housekeeping staff and everyone inbetween, they were so friendly.  No question was unanswered and no request too small.  This particular building is an old bank - I believe it was the bank that became the First Mariner bank.  The Marriott bought the building in 2007 and began the conversion.  It is important to note that the building and all of its charm was totally preserved throughout the entire process.  First off, the chandeliers are still the original ones, the ceiling in the lobby is in great shape, the tables in the lobby are the old tables where you'd find bank deposit slips, there are gorgeous marble floors and stairs, there is a mail chute on every floor, but the creme de la creme is the bank vault.  From the lobby, go downstairs and you'll see the bank vault that was converted to conference rooms.  Really cool and definitely worth it.With that said, yes the building is rather old.  However, we found our room to be spacious with a tiny ""kitchenette"" (sink and fridge), living room area, spacious bedroom, and an ample bathroom area.  All in all, for the price we paid, it couldn't be beat.  But the only downside were the walls that were practically paper-thin.  We could hear full conversations from our neighbors -- including the music, despite the waiver signed upon checking in refraining from ""partying.""  Especially on game day weekend, I can understand.There is a small continental breakfast served each morning.  Take it or leave it, but if you're looking to grab some cereal, yogurt, milk, and coffee (in 16oz cups!), this is your best bet.  There are also various breads, muffins, and croissants available.  Eggs and sausage, too; but I skipped that.  The proximity to major attractions and the stadiums are great.  The area around the hotel can be a little dicey, but we had no problem finding cabs and feeling secure.Overall, I would certainly recommend staying here and will certainly keep this on my list for hotels to stay in next year.I came here for Otakon 2014. While the walk was a bit more of a hike than I would have preferred,  the customer service was simply amazing. Because this hotel is small the employees go out of their way for you. I would absolutely stay here again if given the opportunityI really enjoyed my stay at the Marriott Springhill Suites. The front desk was very friendly and helpful, from the moment I went in to the moment I checked out. Parking can be a mess, but they do offer valet parking which was $32 a day. The hotel also served a breakfast in the morning, which was perfect because you didn't need to walk around to find food. The hotel is in a great location to the inner harbor, it's about 2 blocks walking. There is also a CVS,  711, and Dunkin Doughnuts around the corner which was good to know. I would definitely book with Springhill againI prefer the Residence Inn or the Marriott at Camden Yards... for what was paid here, we could have gotten one of the others for the same price, in a less dingy and dirty setting.The location of this hotel was nice since it was in downtown Inner Harbor, but the accommodations were not as nice.  The elevators were extremely loud, so every time someone requested an elevator you could hear it beep when it arrived on the floor.  This woke me up EVERY morning.  The breakfast was not that good, and I'm pretty sure I got sick from something.  I'm guessing it was either the eggs made from some powder mix or the sausage that had a weird taste to it.  The room was a decent size, but our toilet made a weird high pitched noise every time we flushed.What really bugged me is that when we asked for a taxi the morning we checked out, they reserved us an executive car which was much more expensive and we couldn't get out of it so we ended up paying much more.  I probably wouldn't stay here again, since there are lots of hotels in the downtown area.Spectacular! Five minute walk from Baltimore Convention Center and Inner Harbor. Suite had two nice double beds and a sleeper sofa, and they brought in a cot upon request. Help was exceptionally friendly and forthcoming. Complementary breakfast was large and tasty. 24 hour complementary coffee. Free in-room wifi. Cannot recommend this place enough--if you're coming to Baltimore, stay here.We got the 2 bedroom on the 11th floor. The room is huge!!! I will always stay here when in town. The front desk lady was very nice and professional. She made sure that i got the best rate possible. We have two micro waves and two fridges.  The valet parking folks are wonderful.Proximity to Inner Harbor was great and within walking distance (2 blocks).  The whole place looks like an old bank.The valets here were nice... BUT they mixed up keys/cars/tickets, which was NOT good whe they offered us the wrong car, scrambled asking each other where are car was, then finally found ours and brought it out with a ""here ya go.""The corridor to get to the elevators was really small and the room, despite 'non-smoking', of course smelled a bit ashy.The room itself was fine; odd nooks and angles to the room and bathroom, but overall fine (i'm ignoring the a/c vent that looked pretty ominous). The worst part was a blinking light coming from the cable box that we could not get to turn off.  Second worst was another bright light coming from the building next door.For the same price as other Inner Harbor hotels, you get a large suite with updated furnishings, &amp; free breakast.  It is somewhat walkable to attractions, depending on who you are (age, fitness level, etc.).  While there are a few metered parking spots on the street (2 hour max), all other parking was ridiculous in price (but in all fairness about the same as other inner harbor hotels).  Elevator was fast, place was clean, rooms were spacious (though I was in a corner room, may have been bigger and/or brighter with the extra windows).  Definitely recommend this hotel.After reading some of the reviews up to this point, I honestly believe people should go to a place maybe more than once before popping off negative comments left and right (plus how come the Springhill at the 16 Calvert address which is the SAME HOTEL as this one got better ratings??). I mean; seriously if its that close to the stuff you want to do and the people are nice; unless the freaking bed was made of nails; why can't you either give it another try or try not to give ONE star for heaven's sake. But I digressI loved this place. While it was 3200 to valet here; that is the norm for the area; it is walking distance from so many cool things. I'm a traveler so I wasn't just staying here to be closer to the baseball fields So as a traveler, this place was excellent HUGE rooms with fridge and microwave, two flat panel tvs, a bar downstairs and a super helpful and friendly staff. I will be staying here on my travels to Baltimore over the next month or so and ditching the car in favor of the short taxi ride from the airport and enjoying the convenience and comfort this facility providesBy the way it WAS an old bank back in the day and it has a cool Vault conference room downstairs and I almost forgot; complimentary breakfast in the AM with actual eggs and a meat instead of heat and eat biscuits to go :-)This hotel is beautiful, well at least to me (I love historical buildings). It used to be an old bank back in the early 1900's, I believe the Maryland Trust Bank is what the desk manager told me. Anyway, the original vault is still in the basement and you can actually have meetings inside of it which I think is super rad...oh and the original mail chute and ceiling/chandeliers are also still in place.The suite was huge - ours was on the very top floor (10th) on the corner so we could actually see a bit of the harbor. We had two separate rooms - one with the traditional king bed/TV and another with a pullout couch/chairs/TV. The bathroom was also pretty large but the space was a bit odd - you can tell that they had trouble remodeling the place into a hotel.The staff is friendly and accommodating, and they were willing to extend our check-out to 1pm which I think is pretty generous for a Sunday morning.My only complaint is that this hotel is right next to two or three nightclubs. So be warned - if you want any sleep on a weekend I'd recommend not staying anywhere close to this street. People wait in line to get into the clubs and then spill out loud and drunk when it closes. Not fun for sleeping :[Stayed here last night and was impressed with the size of the suites, the history behind the hotel (there's a meeting room in the basement that is in an old vault), and the service. I'm giving it three stars given the property is a bit older, the fitness room sucks and the bed was not really that comfortable.We originally booked another hotel that did not meet out expectations. Luckily SpringHill Suites had availability. From the moment we walked in, the staff was courteous and helpful. This was our first trip to the Baltimore area and the staff was very helpful in helping us find our way around. We will be staying at SpringHill Suites from now on!I don't mean to go off on a rant here, but this hotel was not what it claims to be...at all. The rooms are tiny. The workout room was not available to use. There are LOUD clubs on the same block so a good nights sleep on weekends is rare. The parking, though while we all knew going in was expensive, is unarguably egregious. I'm not one to rail on a business for their shortcomings like this, but when you pay nearly $200.00 bucks a night and have to shell out an additional $35.00 a night for parking, well, I think it's valid with all the others issues we had. Speaking of other issues, I came down with congestion in my chest every morning while staying here. I'm not one to get sick. I don't smoke. I don't have seasonal allergies. The next morning I was fine and have been since our departure. Oh, yes, our departure. We checked out on Sunday morning to head to yet another Reds v Orioles game at Camden Yards, and as I stated before, the rooms are not what the pictures show them to be so we moved some furniture around to make our stay more comfortable. As we left we didn't move the furniture back and quickly realized we left our ipod in the room. Needless to say they denied finding said ipod even after hearing that we moved stuff around, etc. They never called us back and it took repeated calls to get the answer we knew we would hear in, no. This is our fault for not realizing until after we left the room, but we realized it quickly and to get the ""ehh, that's a shame. come again"" shtick was off-putting. I feel bad for leaving a review that is this harsh. We had an AMAZING time in Baltimore and will absolutely come back, just not here. EDITORS NOTE: After reading this back to myself I came to realize that I sound as if I am 72 years old ""that hippity hop music bruised my ears all night long at those doo-wop dance halls below our room..."". Let me make this clear, I'm 32. Oh yeah, if you're visiting Baltimore you must go to Joe Squared Pizza. Nacho Mama's. Mama's On The Half Shell. They will make you forget you have to pay $35 for parking and will be waking up every morning in B'more with SARS.Just arrived and everyone was friendly. The room smelled old, like no one's been in it awhile. We went to the window to check out the view. We have a view of an abandoned building. Oh well, we fixed that by closing the drapes. Valet parking was $30 but everywhere else is about the same. Breakfast was same as other SpringHills by Marriott.I actually signed up for Yelp in order to write this review because I had such a poor experience at this hotel.  First, I booked the room through a 3rd party site that does not mention that valet is the only option for parking and valet costs $32/night. The photos exaggerated the condition of this hotel - it's a 2 star AT BEST.  The walls are paper thin.  When I first arrived I could hear 2 men yelling off-and-on for an hour.  Then, at 1am, the couple staying next to me arrived back at their room and got into an extremely violent fight.  It sounded as if the man was choking the women and then they screamed at each other for over 30 minutes.  I called the front desk (out of concern for the woman) and no one ever came to check on things.  It was the worst night sleep I have ever had.  I don't blame the hotel for the couple's fight, but I do blame them for the paper thin walls and I did not feel safe there at all.  DO NOT STAY HERE.Most of this review is based on my room location; I never asked to move because I arrived late the first night of my stay and had to be up early the next morning only to get back late that night.  I was in the room above the check in desk so I could hear everything going on In the lobby, it was loud and annoying.Ehhh ok hotel..looks like it used to be an old bank...room was big with a kitchenette and relativly clean except for the a/c vent falling off the wall and there's no pool...close to the aquarium and inner harbor...if it's cheaper stay at the Fairfield inn (see my yelp review)...it's a way newer hotel...Oh the parking...they only have valet for $32 a day...but there's plenty of street parking if you can find a spot!",,,,"['came', 'quick', 'visit', 'nothing',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/lord-baltimore-hotel-baltimore,Lord Baltimore Hotel,3.0,$$,81,"I booked this hotel for a 2-night stay during a soccer convention (at the Baltimore Convention Center located nearby). I booked through my credit card rewards program and got a great deal...I think it was about $180 total for both nights. I liked that it was a boutique hotel and not some corporate chain.The staff here were pretty bad, but I'm still giving 4 stars since we really liked the hotel itself. The night before we were coming, my husband called to ask if there was any way we could do an early check-in, as we were getting in around 7am from a redeye and would love to get some sleep. The lady on the phone was super unhelpful and didn't even look up our reservation or place a note on our reservation, just refused to help us out. When we arrived the next morning and were super exhausted from not much sleep on the plane (the hotel was easy to get to from the airport via the light rail which was only $1.70), the guy at check-in was pretty much as helpful as the lady on the phone the night prior. He insisted that there was not a single room available in the entire hotel, and that we would have to wait until at least noon. We were too exhausted to argue and had nowhere else to go, so we plopped down on the couches in the lobby. I think that did the trick, and once the guy realized we weren't going anywhere and didn't want us to ruin the look of the hotel by having us bum on the couches all day, a room suddenly, magically became available even though we were right next to the front desk and no one checked out. We went right up to our room, which was miraculously completely cleaned and ready for us as well. The lobby was very nice looking, and there is a nice bakery attached to the hotel that has some good sandwiches and salads, and a bar/kitchen in the lobby which had great food for fair prices. The elevators were nice, and our room was great. The king bed was super comfortable and we slept great during our stay. The bathroom was clean and had everything we needed. Internet was also complimentary, although very slow. The location was great for us and a quick walk to the convention center and to shopping and restaurants. When we went to check out the morning that we were leaving, the guy at the front desk was again unhelpful and was unable to give us a receipt since we booked through a third party. I had never heard of that, but whatever. Despite the staff being very unhelpful, we really liked the look and feel of the hotel, the location, and the great value we had gotten.Pretty decent stay for the price; wouldn't recommend for long stays, or if you plan on staying in your room often, but if you just need a comfortable bed, decent water pressure and a TV - this is a nice place to fit your needs.I'd definitely come back.it is ok.   Not the best hotel I have ever experiended.......but ok..   Lots of what appears to be touristy stuff.....but it is ok.   A friend of mine who's husband is being treated by Johns Hopkins for an issue that is not mine to share.   However I can be there for her, and her husband as a friend.  Tough time for them.Despite its fancy name, this is an okay place to stay, but maybe should be called Mr. Baltimore. It's pricey, but you're downtown. So that is to be expected. The folks at the front desk are friendly. The room is fine. The housekeeping....I was able to check in early at 11am, which was impressive. The next morning when housekeeping knocked at 8:50am it made sense. She came back at 10 while I was still in my room. I felt bad for messing up her schedule, but I was working online in the room. So the next morning, I woke up at 8 and hung a do not disturb sign on the door. I made myself some surprisingly decent coffee - it's one of those single serve machines where you insert a little packet of coffee - ironed my clothes, got ready and finished my conference calls. At 11 I left for my conference, but first I left a tip and a thank you note for the housekeeper (important to tip housekeeping!). I came back to the room mid afternoon to make more phone calls. And that's when I noticed that the toilet seat was up, the toilet was clogged and my used coffee packet was floating in the bowl. Also, the staff had ignored my request not to leave any more towels, because I care about the environment, but let's focus for now on the coffee floating in my clogged toilet. When I told the woman at the front desk, she was bewildered. I showed her a picture and she said she would send an engineer. I left the hotel 2 hours later having seen no engineer. When I got home at 9, the toilet was still unloved. This time, the guy at the desk radioed engineering in front of me and a very friendly engineer came promptly and fixed the problem. But nobody at the front desk seemed concerned that housekeeping had left my bathroom that way (or tried to flush coffee???). So, no harm done; but what the heck?!? Housekeeping didn't get a tip the next day...Outstanding stay. There are three places to eat with the hotel, a nice bar, adequate gym, and walking distance to most of the places you come here to see. The staff is extremely polite and all the renovations appear to be complete. The first impressions are lasting and this hotel does a great job at setting the tone for the rest of your stay. The rooms are nice and like others  have reviewed, the shower is small and old but gets you clean!I have been staying at this hotel for literally 20 years on and off for business; long before it was the Lord Baltimore.  It was a Hilton, then Radisson, and I believe a Hilton again before ""going boutique"".  I like the location and price - this is why it's one of my ""go to"" hotels in this city I frequent.My most recent stay was on 8/19/2015 and I was in town for pleasure this time; my son's 18th birthday and we came to see the Mets VS Orioles.  There were 3 teenagers + myself and we had 2 connecting rooms.  Check in was super quick, and the employees at front desk and curbside were all super friendly and helpful as I have come to expect here.  Rooms had 2 queen beds each and were recently renovated, clean and comfortable.  VERY good size I should add.  Free internet was crawling slow, but I didn't feel like paying to upgrade.  Hey, it was just 1 night and I survived.  Everything about our stay was pleasant and we booked through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> for $120 per room.  For a clean and decent hotel with 2 queen beds that's a very fair rate in my book.  So, recently updated, friendly, efficient and inexpensive - that why they earned 4 stars!The down side; no free coffee in the lobby - need to hit the pastry shop ) I'm a coffee addict and the in-room Kureg doesn't cut it for me).  Also, at night the neighborhood can be a tad sketchy (which is why they close the front door at night) - 1 entrance only (side).  There's major construction across the street - building was demolished and not sure what will be going up but it's not a pretty site, and many homeless have set up shop in the courtyard across the street as well. Typical urban stuff though - everywhere in every city for the most part.Overall, one of my favorite hotels in town especially at this price point.I stayed at this hotel a couple night when I was in town for a job interview. I had a room on the second floor. First of all the room was nice and seemed very clean. The window was dirty and I had a terrible view (into an alleyway) which kind of sucked.  The light on the desk didn't work and would flicker if it wasn't unplugged which was a little creepy.I was a bit disappointed that this hotel didn't have any kind of room service. The bakery downstairs was fine, but I would've liked more than a croissant for breakfast. Their in-house restaurant didn't open until 11:30 so it was completely useless for breakfast. A few people mentioned noise from the city but I was on the 7th floor and didn't really notice it being noisier than any other hotel in a city! Overall, not a bad place to stay! I would recommend this hotel if you like historical hotels and don't mind no room-service!Great location, apparently built in 1928, nice, but a bit quirky, and rooms lack the finer amenities...no glass cups or glasses, but paper and plastic.The Lord Baltimore seemed like a great idea on paper. A historical spot with old-time charm and recently renovated. We thought it would be a great place to stay for a fun wedding weekend in Baltimore. We were however, very disappointed with our stay here.Before I get to the negative parts - there were a couple good things about this hotel. The beds were really comfortable and the room was decently sized. The lobby was nice and clean. That is about all the good things I can say about this place. First off they do not have room service available which was really annoying. Their showers were very outdated and looks like were not included in this ""renovation"". Not only were they outdated but they were pretty gross and I tried not to look around when I was showering. The maid service was very rude as well. We were getting ready around 2pm when they came to clean the room. We told the lady we had to get ready for a wedding and they could not clean at this time. The lady insisted that she come in to clean and when we told her no again, she then rolled her eyes at us. Very unprofessional in my opinion. Then on our last night of our stay, we lost power and water completely. It was like a furnace in our room and everything was out until our checkout the next day. Very miserable. All in all, I would not recommend staying here. There are plenty of other great options in this city.I stayed there Valentine's Day weekend and I had a terrible experience.the rooms was small and they had a cheerleading competition there that weekend and they decided to give a party right in the hallway outside of everyone room,they was loud throwing trash under people doors .so me and my husband decided to leave to go to the gallery shopping for a while but when we opened our doors they wouldn't move you had to step all over <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpeople.so&amp;s=b597d2af6e8b4be654aac7d7fe3308fc9911a21f262badba1a44a507cb1c8a9c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">people.so</a> we complained to the manager and he said he would take care of it but he didn't so I had to call down to the front desk 2 more times and he said our stay was free but it got so bad we didn't even stay we left the same night. We never got our money back on our card from the hotel and every time you call about it they tell you a bunch of lies. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody cause they don't care about their guest .Stayed here for a mini Valentine's Day vaca. Rooms were clean. Everything worked. Unfortunately, my car broke down a night before time to checkout. we checked out of the hotel and decided to wait in the lobby for a ride. Lobby was entirely TOO COLD. I don't even think they have heat in this area. But there was a downstairs area where they sold coffee, sandwiches and muffins. We decided to wait there. It was barely anybody in there. We ordered something, ate and sat there where it was warm. Not too long after security came down asking were we staying in the hotel. We told them ""yes we checked out this morning"". They said ""Okay"" and then left. 3 minutes later...a security lady came back telling us that we can not sit there any longer unless we buy something else because we were occupying that table ( MIND YOU THERE WERENT MANY PEOPLE IN THERE ). I just felt uncomfortable. For the price I paid for one night I should be able to sit wherever I wish especially if I'm not offending anybody. Was it offensive that my boyfriend and I were black and my boyfriend had dreads! Is that why we looked suspicious? Idk. But that will be my last experience staying at that hotel!Stayed here while dad was recovering from Pancreatic cancer surgery. This place was suggested to us by the accommodation line at John Hopkins. We were told over and over again that parking was covered. Come time to check out and were were charged 375 for parking. To make matters worse, the GM found it funny that the hotel is privately owned and the buck stopped with him. If you want to deal with rude managers and HORRIBLE customer service than stay here.Very nice, classic hotel that shows way above her listed star rating. I was not expecting the grand lobby or the excellent dining room in this reasonably priced hotel.Friendly staff that remembers your name, five star food, and a short walk to everything you want to see in Baltimore. Highly recommend!The Lord Baltimore hotel has old-timey charm and history (including a historical marker out front)--It seemed like a very appropriate place to stay for exploring a historic U.S. city. The room was smallish with contemporary decor and had obviously been freshly renovated--including the bathroom. The hotel has REAL, old-fashioned windows that actually OPEN. (I can't wait for the day when they begin building all hotels this way again. Sealed hotel rooms are an American phenomenon, I think, and an awful one.) The staff were very pleasant and welcoming and the bakery downstairs had excellent pastries.I'd definitely stay here again.The paneled ceiling, brass stairs, and other Lobby features give the initial feel of a higher rated hotel.  The rooms are just ok but a little small. The beds are comfortable. No fan in the bathroom. Although ok Overall the rooms just don't live up to the promise of the lobby so I was a little disappointed.I recently stayed at the Lord Baltimore, and had actually stayed there a few years ago in it's previous incarnation as a Radisson. This is a standard, middle of the road hotel room- a few steps up from something like Days Inn, but not anything luxurious like the grand lobby may suggest- but honestly, I don't think you could get a better bed for this price in this part of Baltimore. It was so, so comfortable, and I'm assuming pretty new since the hotel was recently renovated. Between the bed and large flat screen tv, I was pretty happy with my small room. The neighborhood of downtown Baltimore doesn't have a whole lot to offer, but you are geographically poised to easily access the fun places in Baltimore by car, taxi, even by foot or the metro station across the street. But, if you want to hang out close to ""home"", the hotel has a nice bar, restaurant, and bakery. If you need a nice place to rest your head at a reasonable rate, I'd definitely suggest giving Lord Baltimore a look.I had a wonderful stay at the Lord Baltimore. My first room wasn't exactly what I wanted and the issue was very quickly dealt with the issue. Elise Wilson was so incredibly helpful and even called to make sure that I enjoyed my experience. This will always be the hotel I use in Baltimore.We went to Baltimore for a very last minute, quick 4th of July getaway. We were looking for a hotel that was close enough for a walk to the inner harbor and was decently priced. Lord Baltimore Hotel met both of those. The pictures of the recently renovated  rooms helped as well. Overall, I was very pleased with this hotel. The staff i encountered were all kind and pleasant and very accommodating, specifically to my early check-in and late check-out requests. The hotel lobby was beautifully decorated and inviting. We stayed in a Deluxe King room where the over-sized bed was comfortable and the white linens looked clean and fresh. The newly painted gray walls, blackout curtains, and dark furniture were all wonderful touches to the fairly spacious room.One interesting thing I learned about this hotel AFTER we booked it was that it was believed to be haunted. I'm not sure I would have decided to stay here had I known this beforehand, but considering none of the reviews I read online were of terrified, screaming guests, I figured maybe it wouldn't quite be that scary. And overall, it wasn't. While I will admit to leaving every single one of the lights on and to sleeping no more than 30 minutes the entire night, this was all due to my overactive imagination. At no point in our stay did I see anything resembling a little girl in a cream colored dress bouncing a red ball nor did I see a well-dressed couple roaming the halls. I did, however, ask to stay in a room far away from the 19th floor where the sightings supposedly happen just in case. I will say that every time we waited for an elevator, we noticed that at least one was paused for an abnormally long time on the 19th floor. Strangely, upon checkout we learned that the entire 19th floor has been turned into meeting rooms and there were no meetings scheduled that entire weekend. I choose to not think about that too much..Is the hotel haunted? Probably. Did I see anything scary during my stay? No. Yes, I would recommend this hotel to others and yes, I actually would stay here again.Really nice lobby. Really boring room. This place looks like someone tried to put some nice finishes on a mid 2000s Marriott renovation.  Not a bad deal, just not a ""knock me out"" hotel experience. Front desk lady was bizarre, as well.We booked a room at the Lord Baltimore for when we came into town for a wedding. The location of the hotel is quite good, you are close to the Inner Harbor if that's your thing, you are also close to Camden Yards and a quick car or preferably Uber ride to Federal Hill or Fell's Point/Canton. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the rooms were very nice, the bathrooms are very bright even if they are a little dated. The maids are on top of you about whether you are leaving that day or not, they knock pretty much once a hour which is somewhat annoying and why this review isn't 5 stars. We will probably stay here again in the fall when we have another wedding that is in Baltimore.","Booked a king room through Hotels. comWe checked into a queen room with a leaky toilet. Called the front desk and they would do nothing.Had to call Hotels. com to get a new room. The front desk moved us to a king room with no AC. The rheostat would only blast hot air. We spent all night opening and closing the window.We will NEVER stay at the hotel again!We stayed at the Lord Baltimore Sept. 13th-17th and I give it a pretty solid thumbs up. We booked before reading many reviews and after reading some, I got a little nervous about our non-refundable stay. My fears were unfounded and we wound up being totally happy with our stay.The valet staff are very friendly, quick and really just seemed like good guys. They gave directions, made suggestions and were very personable.  You enter the hotel and there is a nicely designed, albeit dark lobby. The furniture is all nice, nice decor, all that good stuff. Artwork throughout is meh but who really gives a crap? My only real complaint about the place would be about the front desk staff. They were by no means rude or dismissive but they weren't exactly warm and inviting. As we traveled around Baltimore, that seemed to be the norm for service industry workers so I think maybe it's a fairly regional thing (I'm used to a certain Midwest politeness, I guess). Just sort of matter of fact about what they were doing and that was that. Considering that was about the extant of my interaction with them, who really cares? So I felt a little bit like a nuisance for 5 minutes instead of like a welcome guest.  Our hotel room was located on the corner of the 17th floor. It was a very nice room and very comfortable. We walked in and there is a certain posh feeling you get thanks to the nice monogrammed comforter on the bed. The room was again fairly dark (in decor) but the windows and spacious nature of the room kept it from feeling uninviting. The room had a small fridge, safe, ironing board, hair dryer, clothes line in the shower for drying things... All nice, handy touches. The bed and pillows were super comfortable. I mean, I love getting home to my bed after a trip but this time not so much. I slept great in the room.  You can hear some street noise through the windows during the day but I never really noticed it at night and it didn't keep me awake at all (the heavy curtains being drawn probably helped with that). The room also had a desk &amp; chair for working, a side chair &amp; table and bench at the end of the bed.  Everything was in very nice condition. The bathroom was nice enough.  The bathtub area was the only part of the room that felt a touch dated, but not like 70s-80s dated but more nostalgic of the age of the hotel. The shower head is a little low for a 6' tall guy but this is also a 100 year old building. Most modern hotels have the same problem without the excuse of age.The room had free wifi or you could pay to upgrade to faster connection. We went with the free and it was just fine. It got a little spotty a couple times but that seemed to coincide with when they were filming a TV show downstairs (Oh yeah, they were filming House of Cards on various floors while we were there which was kind of cool and interesting and thankfully not a nuisance) and there were a bunch of people working and presumably all on wireless devices at once. Generally I just disconnected and reconnected and that took care of the problem.The elevators... Everyone bitches about the elevators. I won't be one of them.  there are 5 elevators. the 2 on the right have clearly been renovated. The middle one I never once rode in 5 days so I think it might be out of commission (possibly being renovated?). The second from the left was not an updated cab and the door moves a bit slow but otherwise it was just fine. Interior a touch dated but I assume that will be renovated like the 2 updated ones. The 1 elevator that did prove a little tricky is the one on the far left. We dubbed it the Magical Mystery Elevator. Yes, it is a bit of an adventure with that elevator, but at no point was I put out or freaked out by it. Going down to the lobby, it tended to take you to the Lower Lobby (home of the gym and a meeting room) instead. The first time it did that might be a little startling cause you don't know where you are. But there is a stair around the corner that leads to the street and into the lobby. So worst case scenario, you just lost 10 seconds of your life. Big deal. Going up, the 17th floor where our room was, wasn't available for whatever reason. So we'd have to go to the 18th floor (which had an open stair to the 17th floor right outside the elevator) so again, 10 seconds extra to get where we were going. On 1 occasion instead of stopping at 18, it went to 19 which is meeting rooms (and supposedly haunted) but then took us to 18 when we pushed it again.  Honestly if the elevators were a big problem for you, you need to relax and enjoy life a little.We got food from the bar (truffle fries, burger, chicken) and it was excellent. The bakery is convenient and good.  Sideshow (gift shop) is awesome and you should go there, for real!!If I'm back in Baltimore someday, I'd absolutely stay here again.I don't usually come on the internet to complain, but I was severely disappointed in this hotel. It looked quaint and lovely online, and had some good reviews. I usually enjoy staying in Historic Hotels in the DMV area.However, while the lobby is lovely, our room was...no other way to put this, crappy. They stuck us in a handicapped room directly in front of the elevators, so we got to hear everyone coming and going. No bathtub, just a large shower--and if we wanted to shower, we would have had to use the handheld sprayer. The bathroom's cleanliness was questionable at best--obviously has not been updated in a long time, and some moldy-looking areas. Needless to say, as we stayed there only one night, we didn't bother using the shower.The beds and pillows were very soft, but almost too soft. Clearly the beds have been used a LOT.I didn't bother to go back down to the front desk to complain; it was my husband's birthday and I didn't want to waste time being persnickety and changing rooms. We were only there one night, so we dealt with it. We certainly had a lovely view...of the air conditioning unit and another building. Basically, what a letdown. Not to mention adding insult to injury when they mistakenly charged my card for one night's stay after I had prepaid.Only big plus for me--self-parking is only $15, cheaper than or comparable to most city parking garages. However, it is about 5 minutes away so you have to schlep your bags. Just...I was really disappointed and I won't bother coming back next time I'm in Baltimore.My husband and I were in town and in need of a place to stay last minute and found Lord Baltimore Hotel. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. Love the room and modern look they have. We stayed on the 14th floor and had a great view of the city. All thanks to Vawn who was an amazing employee that helped us. If you want quality in your customer service then ask for him. The down side is that parking is a bit difficult to find if you don't mind parking on the street. They have valet parking but they charge 20%....needless to say we parked at the meters across the hotel which is $1 every hour Monday-Friday from our understanding. We only needed to park for a few hrs so it wasn't a burden for us.Our stay here was super comfortable. This was a very modern, elegant hotel. Didn't have any glitches throughout our stay and got a more than reasonable late checkout. We checked in a little late but still ended up with our king sized bed, score! The front desk was very pleasant and peppy, qualities that should be standard but are hard to find these days. The room itself was very clean and spacious. I docked half a star because the bathroom was a little on the small, cramped side as well as the vanity table area was crowded with the coffee maker. I also docked another half star because breakfast should come standard with a hotel of this stature. I really like that it was right across from the Charleston Metro Station. I would come back here again. Cheers!Three years ago, Maryland Deathfest. Saturday night. I split from the group I'm rooming with and hang out with my friend around 3 AM. He meets up with his friend who is staying here. Said friend informs us that the door to the rooftop is unlocked. We steal said friends' roommate's beer and have a few until we run out. I state that my group has plenty of beer at the hotel I was staying at. Instead of coming back to a room of slumbering metalheads, the whole fucking room is awake and ready to rage. We lug a cooler full of beer a couple of blocks to this place, and party on the rooftop until sunrise. A very hammered Guy decides to seize the day and piss off the roof of a 20+ story hotel. Looking back, it's one of the most frightening things I've ever done. This hotel gets 4 stars for facilitating this crucial life experience.Beautiful hotel, friendly staff all the way around, awesome gift shop with lots of unique things, great food in the deli/bakery. The rooms were nice. Loved the old school charm of the bathrooms and showers. All though the hotel was renovated, it's kept it charm of being an older hotel. I'd definitely stay here again if I'm ever in Baltimore.Comfortable, king size bed!  Fridge!  Nice big flat screen TV, free water in my room.  And a Haunted ghost story to go with it!  Great location!  Walking distance to Little Italy and the Harbor.  Love this hotel!  Always happy to stay here!  Great, friendly staff, too!We were coming into town to meet up with friends for dinner and hit the casino and chose to stay here based on location and price.  I wasn't worried about having a ton of amenities since we weren't going to be in the room much and really just needed a bed and a place to shower.  The lobby was quite pretty, the room was clean but the bathroom was clearly not included in any of the renovations that have been done. The bed was comfortable so that requirement was met, but when we woke in the morning and attempted to shower we found there was no cold water.  Literally, the cold water wouldn't turn on making it impossible to shower with the added bonus of not being able to flush the toilet.  When we checked out shortly after this discovery we told the person at the front desk of our difficulty to which he replied ""Oh really?  Well I'm glad that I was able to get your check out taken care of for you"".  We couldn't even get a feigned ""I'm sorry for your incredible inconvenience""?  The customer service response stunk as much as we did...We decided to stay there because we had a family member going to John Hopkins Hospital and it was the same week that the riots and National Guard took over baltimore.  Easy to get back and forth since the hotel provides a taxi (Arrow Taxi). The problem is with the hotel itself. It ""looks"" like they did remake, but a closer look,  they did a cheaply and unsafe makeover...The ice machine wasnt on every floor and the area that used to have it was old and nasty. The eleavator signal area above one of them had a hole and just left there. The first night we got there, the TV and the mini fridge didnt work, so we called the front desk that told us they'll call maintance which never showed up. I took a look and found that they had 4 plugs into 1 wall outlet and you had to ""play"" with it to get anything to work. Huge fire hazard if you ask me! The next day, my wife takes a shower and the soap dish falls off the wall, almost falling on her foot! It hit the tub and peices went everywhere. We went downstairs and told the front desk about it and we got the ""sorry, we'll call maintance"" and we left to go to the hospital.  We got back later that night, tired and went to bed till we got a knock on the door at 11:35 PM and they tried to come in. Lucky, I put the hook on the door before going to be and found out it was the maintance guy, come to fix the soap dish! He wasnt told that someone was staying in the room nor was told to fix it during the day! We left the next day and glad we did! Oh and we ate at the hotel bar. Over priced and the cooking was all over the place. I wouldnt eat there again nor stay there no matter what the cost!Price was not bad bad. Toilet overflowed came to fix and left dirty towels on the ground. The restaurant for breakfast they tuned us away Bc they said they were backed up. She was rude about it too.Standard hotel quality, clean, simple and with some french accents. The food was not particularly spectacular that was catered for an event at the hotel nor the French Kitchen. It was just ok, and not as exquisite as the interior looks. The service was efficient and courteous, I'd be more than happy to stay at this hotel again--but most likely not for dining.Stayed here for a wedding. Was put in a newly renovated corner room. Pretty nice - the decor reminded me of Scandanavia hotel room - sparely and simply furnished. No frills but a good room. Location good - easy 10 minute walk to the harbor area.Wedding reception was held here. Very nice - seemed like they allowed outside caters which generally means you'll get better food (and we did have good food).If I was to stay in downtown Baltimore again, if the price was good, I would stay here.i stayed at the Lord Baltimore after attending the Gold Cup quarterfinals. It was a great stay.  To begin, the check in was swift and very pleasant (and I checked out by phone so there was no wait)  Also, the hotel is very close to downtown.  We were able to walk to the stadium in about 10 minutes. The Deluxe King room is great,  It is very spacious and the bed was incredible-so comfortable.  Also, our room was on the  10th floor and  was exceptionally quiet.  It is a little pricey, but I felt like I got my money's worth.  There are many other hotels in that area and many are less expensive, but I doubt they are as comfortable and quiet.I stayed here one night for the Baltimore Improv Festival.  This hotel has a lot of old charm.  Keep in mind this isn't a modern hotel, so hedge your expectations. With that said, our rooms were clean and we had plenty of hot water.  The front desk was extremely helpful with our reservations and assisting us with finding where we needed to go.   The valet service was also very speedy.The free wifi can be spotty.   Don't expect to stream movies but it's good enough.  I wish I had more time to hang out in the lobby.  They had a piano player there an relaxing there in the evening with a drink watching people move in and out would have been fun.**all the positives***The staff was WONDERFUL. From the valet, to the concierge, to the people working at the cafe downstairs. Every single person I interacted with was warm and friendly and seemed to have my best interests in mind. I am a customer service oriented person so this is the first thing I look for. The place was very clean. I have no complaints at all. A lot of older buildings can smell musty, but not here. The room smelled good, the bathroom was clean as a whistle and the bed linens were in excellent condition. It had a ton of historic charm, so much better than I would have gotten at some huge chain hotel. And also the location was perfect and made most of the city walkable. *what I would correct*Nothing here is a true complaint. I also noticed that other reviewers mentioned renovations. It was not evident that the Reno is still going on, but if it is, then the below comments may not matter. 1-bathtub surround needed new tile and grout. The rest of the room appeared up to date, so the inside of the shower sort of stood out as outdated. 2-the exhaust in the bathroom was not operable. If the work done to date in the bathroom is to last awhile, this needs to be corrected. 3-the heat and a/c kept fighting. We did not touch any of the controls in the room, but it seemed to waffle between overly warm and too chilly. We could hear the heater kick on and then the a/c a little while later. Temperature control needs to be worked out. Overall, however I cannot speak well enough of this place. THANK YOU to all of the staff for a wonderful experience. I would stay again if I get down the Baltimore way.We stayed here 3 nights at the beginning of August for a convention.Area:  The hotel has no direct control of these but are important to know.  These aren't included in the rating.PROS:  It's a very short walk to the convention center and harbor.CONS:  I didn't feel completely safe walking around outside the hotel especially during the evening.  I stayed on the 15th floor and could hear the traffic below at all times of the day.  This was annoying with trying to sleep.Hotel:  Relating directly to the staff, restaurants, building, etc.PROS:  The renovation does make the hotel feel nicer.  I liked the proximity locks on the doors as opposed to traditional sliding method.  I put the staff as both a pro and con.  One guy was nice, the other was dismissive.  Free standard WiFi was one of the selling points for me.CONS:  By far my biggest complaint is related to the dining options.  Specifically, I was looking for any sort of food - bar food would have been sufficient - at 10:30pm.  I asked the front desk what was open and I received a couple of delivery menus (this is the dismissive employee).  Upon further inquiry, I was instructed that there was nothing open near by and the hotel had no dining options this late.  Let me reiterate that it was only 10:30pm.  This alone will cause me to choose a different hotel next year.  Despite the renovation, there was a stain on the carpet in our room and our faucet wasn't secured completely.  It appears as if the windows were not included in the renovation which is likely why so much noise made it into the room.  I thought maybe the website didn't list a pool as an amenity but there was actually one.  Sadly, no pool here.Stayed here for a night a few days ago.  Love the historical charm this has!  Room was clean, updated and comfortable. Bathroom could use some updating, but other than that, it was great!Stayed at Lord Baltimore hotel for 2 nights during end of April and was very disappointed. Pictures of room that I've seen on website are EXTREMELY deceiving. Our ""king superior"" room was very small, door opened and you stumble right into the bed. Bathroom was tiny and outdated, shower was stained. The only thing I loved about this hotel was it is walking distance to absolutely everything in the city (Camden Yards, Inner Harbor, etc) great location but for the price I expected more.This hotel is so beautiful, and the staff was superb. It is close to the inner harbor and perfect for other sight seeing. The decor was beautiful and tasteful, and the rooms were super clean and the beds were very comfortable. I will come back again and stay here for every Baltimore trip!","Just stayed 1 night here.Despite some of the previous review this place is pretty nice.I needed a place close to Baltimore Arena. Everything in the area for the day was super expensive. I found this place on one of those last minute places for a reasonable price. No room choice was available on the last minute website. Upon checking in I asked if I could have a room with 2 beds. Request granted without issue.Lobby was nice, room was very nice. Elevators could use some fixing up.I did not eat at the restaurants.Location is very close to Baltimore Arena and not far from Inner Harbor.My room was on the 11th floor. Despite being on the 11th floor there was a bit of noise from the road below. Specifically there was a manhole cover in the middle of Baltimore Ave that was loose, so when cars would drive over them it would make a sound like a cymbal on a drum set. So all night long it was klank klank from the road.Also I was not a big fan of their garage, it's $15 per night there, but when you pull into the garage they want to park your car for you. I guess watching that Ferris Bueller movie makes me a little suspicious of people that park your car for you. I was able to park on Baltimore Ave directly across from the arena for the same price of $15.So all in all I would not mind coming back here I would just request a room facing the other way because of the manhole cover. I would hope they could get the city to fix the loose one.Not at all impressed with this hotel for the money. Rooms were OK but, very drafty. Old windows in the room. You could feel the cold air rolling in from outside. The shower, from the time we got there was acting up. You would get burnt and then froze from the hot and cold water cutting on and off. Then the next morning the cold water cut off all together. No working toilets and only a shower w hot water. I had to drag my things to another room just to shower. What did we get for the inconvenience, 15% off our bill of $150. Not to mention, if you don't pay $37 for the valet parking, your lugging all your bags over a city block to get back to the hotel as parking is the next block and half over and not on site. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!Time for a gut renovation. This hotel is old as sin. Priced right for what what it is.The staff at the front desk and valet were great. Extremely nice and helpful. The bellhop was good but he recommended a terrible place to eat. I'm literally writing this review from the toilet. I probably would not stay here again until a renovation is completed.Faded glory, a short walk from the Inner Harbor.I recently stayed here on a business trip.  The hotel is very grand, and the valet &amp; check-in staff were friendly and efficient.  However, the elevators took you on a mystery trip (ala Roald Dahl) stopping at random floors!  The rooms were a little dated, but wifi reception was good.Worn and weary, but undergoing a renovation.Stayed here last weekend as we were in town for the Jets v Ravens game.The room we had was big and clean, The bed frame was a little suspect though. If you sat at the foot of the bed on the right side, the bed would tilt up. Pretty hilarious after a couple of cocktails.  The fitness center was closed for renovation and the business center consisted of one computer.The hotel bar poured a stiff drink.You can see this once was a pretty nice hotel (built in the 1920's), with all the accents of that era. Now it's worn and weary, with black electrical tape holding down the carpeting by the elevator bank on our floor.If they do the renovations right, this will be a nice spot to stay. They were filming an episode of HBO's VEEP while we were here. You might see me checking in in the background. I had my Jets jersey on.Not a bad experience, but not amazing. The room was clean and spacious, and the bed was comfortable! However, the temperature regulation in the room wasn't great, we felt suffocated at night even with the thermostat set low. The decor of the room was nice but there was no view, and the color of the room was kind of dreary. The service wasn't great, always felt like I was bothering someone to help me. Overall, the hotel was nice and I would recommended for cleanliness and location.Horrible customer service from the night staff (not the valet - but front desk), especially the females. Also the breakfast staff will not wait on you if you don't ""wear your money"" on your sleeve, so to speak. I was in scrubs and i never got waited on like the older, richer-looking couples did. And no matter how much you eat, it's a 10.55 charge regards of their lack of customer service and to-go boxes. The night staff will also not answer the phone for a number of rings with the hopes that the customer will hang up. They also lack room service or courteous to help you with your bags once you've checked out (or to be nice to you). Randomly they will also have their ""Monday and Tuesday"" rate go up about 30$ for no reason. DO NOT RECOMMEND.Went here tonight for Charm City Countdown. The worst NYE party ever!!! The layout did not work for the amount of people that were in attendance. They ran out of beer at multiple bars.The end of the night was the worst. We knew that there would be a long line for coat check, so we tried to hang back and chill until things calmed down. Unfortunately, they forces everybody out at 1:45. We finally got our coats at 3:30 after almost getting into multiple fights. The hotel and the promoters should have known of the problems that could of happened since they have held this party in past years. Do not come here!!!A group of us from my company stayed here to prepare for an important sales presentation. We chose it because its location was only a block away from where we had to do the presentation. I would NOT stay here again under any circumstances.First: the few positives:1. The staff were very friendly and helpful, except for one bartender (a man) who ignored us for 30 minutes to help new arrivals when all I wanted was to pay my check. The front desk clerk was cheerful and friendly, and the people who worked on our meeting room were professional and courteous. The doormen were very helpful and polite.2. Most of the food  was good in the bar and meeting room (catered from meeting services). The only thing that was mediocre was the hamburger I had in the bar.3. The bed was comfortable.4. The lobby is historic and attractive, except for the unpolished brass (see negative #8 below).Now the negatives:1. No room service. I can't remember the last time I was in a supposedly full-service urban hotel that didn't have room service.2. The elevators from hell. They got stuck or went to wrong floors. There are five (which they don't need) and the one on the extreme left should be removed. My colleagues got stuck at least three times, and it would stop about a foot or two away from the floor so you had to climb up or hop down. The one on the extreme right worked fine.3. Rooms that are TINY. No desk!! Who ever heard of a modern business hotel with no desk?4. Bathroom so small that you can't open the door without going on the side of the toilet. And, with a bathroom so small, they chose to use a sink that has no surface area. I'm a man and I only had a few things to lay out, but there was no room. I can't imagine how a woman would deal with it with makeup, cosmetics, hair dryer, etc.5. No place to charge electronics. There was a single socket on the bedside lamp, but the shape of the lamp blocked the socket for  iPhone or iPad chargers, or my computer charger. The only socket was behind the heavy dresser.6. My window was so dirty on the outside I literally could not see through it. The view was terrible anyway.7. When I checked in, there were dirty towels on the floor behind the bathroom door, apparently from the previous resident.8. The old hotel had a lot of brass doors and walls ... coming in from the street, the revolving doors were brass and glass, and all the elevator doors were brass as were part of the elevator wall. It appeared that the brass hadn't been polished in months, maybe years. It was literally disgusting.9. The carpets in the three old elevators were filthy and grimy. When the elevator doors were open, you could see major crud and grime in the slots where the doors open and close.10. The temperature controls were faulty. My room, and our meeting room, never got to the temperature set on the thermostat.11. Check out time is 11 am. I cannot remember the last time I stayed in a hotel with a checkout before noon, especially in a big city. I think the last time was 1977.I will never stay at the Lord Baltimore again, and I highly recommend others avoid it.Don't waste your money. We came here using the Valentines Day package and I should've stayed home. The valet was horrible. It took 10 minutes to get someone to even acknowledge we were waiting. We ate at the LB Tavern... Took two hours. Most of that was slow wait service as they were behind the bar chatting. We were able to bond with our fellow diners over the horrible time. To top off the trip, when we went to leave, Valet told us it would take 45 minutes to get my car... Turns out it was right up the road and they were using it as a runner car because it's 4wheel drive and it had snowed that night. Terrible staff and overall experience and many others felt the same way.Surprised by the review regarding customer service. When I showed up at 2 a.m., I was warmly greeted by the night watchman who was more than eager to show me around the hotel and give me a history lesson. This is a historic hotel, which means you might encounter lingering elevators and amenities that aren't as readily accessible as the Hyatt or Hilton, but isn't that the point of staying here? Character. The Lord Baltimore has plenty. I had heard ghost stories, but this is not the Chelsea. The hotel was inviting and comfortable. The bed was fabulously soft and the floor quiet. I had a great night's rest. My only disappointment was that visiting on a Monday meant that the French Kitchen was not open. If you happen to arrive on a Sunday or Monday, make your way to Sotto Sopra. It is a great little Italian place around the corner.Booked a room a lil last minute for a night in town for a wedding. All the main necessities of a hotel we're covered and we were overall satisfied with our stay. The rooms, beds, linens and decor was nice and well done. Everything was clean and in great shape. The thermostat was easy to use, which helped as the summer humidity had arrived just in time for our visit.The little inconveniences that made our stay less than stellar include: 1) unavailable room key at check in due to a technical glitch2) inadequate staff at the front desk, which left us a long wait at check in, further waits when checking on the status of our keys, and unanswered phone calls to the front desk. 3) lack of hair dryer for the lady (likely important to some lords as well)4) it's a little inconvenient to have the parking garage down the street but understandable for a downtown area. Would help If the location and process could be better described on the website and when asked on the phone.For me, this hotel rates Higher for facilities, presentation and comfort. Average to Low for amenities (e.g. lack of hair dryer, budget coffee maker and grind)Low for services and staff. Everyone was nice and courteous, but just not up to game, and not delivering top quality hotel service.I booked a stay at this hotel and paid in full in advance thru Priceline.  I was asked for my credit card for ""incidentals"" which is a normal practice; HOWEVER, the hotel instead charged my card for the entire stay and has refused to return the money.We stayed here for a night while we were in town to go to the Do Or Die Mystery Dinner Theater at the Grand Historic Venue, because their ""go-to"" hotel next door (Embassy Suites) was booked up. Very short walk to the GHV (like barely 2 blocks) and also a reasonable walk (or quick cab ride/drive) to all the stadiums, centers and the harbor.This hotel is very beautiful and they have done a good job with the restoration. The room we had was just renovated, with nice decor and a comfortable bed. It was nice that our room come with complimentary wi-fi and ""reduced rate"" parking at a nearby garage (213 W. Fayette St). BTW - The Lord Baltimore does not have a garage, so plan accordingly if you are driving. Extremely friendly and helpful staff - The next time we visit Baltimore, this place will be on our list.We enjoyed our stay. Everyone was super friendly and helpful, the place was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the location was convenient. The biggest downside was that we booked a king and got a double (way different, and while the two of us can sleep in a double just fine, not every couple can).But this was kind of evened out by the fact that they let us check in super early (around 11am). I chose the hotel because it was close to UMD Law, which I was visiting, AND not far from the aquarium (which is awesome by the way). So the location was perfect for that.We're from DC and we're used to the city: I had to laugh at everyone that complained about the neighborhood. This is downtown Baltimore guys, not the suburbs. The neighborhood was just fine for walking through, and a couple blocks from the sanitized tourist area where the aquarium and all the suburban shopping is. Also, a longer walk to Fells Point, but doable (although we took a cab back).Okay experience... The staff was friendly and the bakery had delicious soup and sandwiches. Unfortunately, the bathroom was dirty and the bed sheets had hair all over them... Got the room at a low rate so can't complain... But it was gross seeing that hair...So... I decided to book a last minute trip to Baltimore and used hotel tonight to find a location.The reviews are on point for this hotel and they deserve a three star rating... Definitely nothing more.The gentleman at the front door were extremely helpful and exceptionally nice... A+ for customer service!The lobby is nice... dark but cozy! They have a TV, nice decor, fireplace and bar. I can't give my opinion on the restaurant because I didn't eat here. The elevators... Oh my goodness... Where do I begin! They are old... Skip floors and should be renovated. Actually they do have ONE that has been upgraded but the other ones are questionable! Truly... They need to put at least three of them out of service and use the space for something else! Do not.. I repeat use the one to the far left!The bed was nice... Comfortable but there are NO extras! My room had no lotion.. But did have shampoo and conditioner. You can clearly hear ALL that goes on outside through the windows but then again... It is in the middle of the city! The internet is clearly questionable... Intermittent... Not suggested if you have important deadlines to meet for work ....the thermoset did not work properly. We set it on 64 degrees and it was still not comfortable... Slept without covers! So if you are looking for the bare minimum...  This place will work. Take the stairs... Bring your own lotion... Wear light clothes to bed in the summer months... Bring earplugs and you will be just fine.I say all that to say... It was an an experience  and I will not stay here again! Not even worth the hotel tonight price!So...are you like me and have joined the 21st century?  By that I mean do you like technology and all the things it's meant to give you?  Well I do.  This hotel doesn't do any of those things. My employer has opted to put me and many of my coworkers up here for 6 weeks.  I'm on week 5.  I checked in the end of June 2014.  I was ready to be done with this travesty of a hotel by 4th of July weekend.  Hot running water?  Well...in the shower I can have hot running water once I figure out what time it's hot...because it apparently can't keep up with the number of guests it can support.  Like hot water in the sink to shave with?  I do.  Sadly most days it takes 10 minutes for that water to actually get hot.  Oh...but it doesn't stay hot in my sink long enough for me to shave...so I decided to get that done at the barber shop....because finishing a shave with cold water is enough to piss a person off.  Elevators that work?  Nah...that's no good either.  They stop on random floors, they don't stop on the floors you want to get to, and heaven forbid you need to get somewhere when they're busy.  I've seen people wait more than 20 minutes to get an elevator.   So I bet you'd opt to take the stairs.  Well as far as I can tell, beyond the 3rd floor the only stairs I can find are the fire exit stairs.  Well...on the 4th of July weekend, my wife came out to spend the weekend with me, and we were getting up and getting ready to go out.  Suddenly the fire alarm goes off.  Now I don't blame them because some random idiot pulled the fire alarm.  However, my wife and I opted to take the fire stairs down (because we didn't know it was a false alarm).  Imagine our surprise when we get to the fire exit going outside only to find out that the door was locked.  Had it been a real fire, we'd have died here.  So we go back up looking for a door to get out.  The one we found was in the kitchen...it was open.  Sadly that might've been one of the most likely places for a fire to start.  Needless to say the kitchen staff was quite surprised to see us.  Why you ask?  Because the fire alarm only went off on a couple of floors...so they had no idea why we were there.  As we walk out of the kitchen we got to walk through the restaurant, full of guests, also blissfully unaware of the fire alarm.  Hazardous much?  I would already have left here if I had an option.  I wish I'd thought to call the fire marshal that day.  Alas I didn't.  Oh...and to top it all off, the manager working was not only unapologetic, but downright insulting to my wife.  We complained later to another manager, but we got platitudes, but no offer of any sort to attempt to make it up to us.  They could've offered to buy us a drink.  They could have offered to buy us breakfast, lunch, dinner...nothing.Let me get back to the 21st century for a bit.  If you've joined me in the modern era, I bet you'd like WIFI.  Well, as it happens they have wifi.  I guess.  AT&amp;T's 4g whatever is better than their WIFI most times.  They have free wifi.  I averaged about .25gb down, and 8gb up.  The heck do I need so much up and no down for?  So they also have wifi to pay for.  it's like $10 a day or some such.  Since I'll have been here for 40 days or so once I'm done, I thought this was exorbitant.  So naturally I asked if their was anything they could do.  They gave me a code for their pay for WIFI.  Yay I thought.  Sadly it ranges between .5gb down and 1.5gb down with a rare spike of 2-3gb down (presumably when no one else is on.).  If I had paid for their wireless, I'd be livid.  Instead I'm merely disgusted.I won't even get into how when I called to check on my reservation, I was in a king room, and when I got here to check in (and I was almost certainly the first out of more than 100 or so coworkers...perhaps more...by several hours) I got stuck in a queen room, even though some of us are in queens and some kings, because of the large number of rooms given.  On the first day, I wanted to lock up my laptops.  Alas, I had to get someone to come fix the safe as it wasn't working.  My alarm clock?  well...it keeps time I guess, but the alarm doesn't work. Thankfully I use my own cell phone for that.  Aside from all those problems, the majority of the staff was friendly enough.  The place seems clean.  I just wouldn't want to stay here again.  I'd rate it lower, because I'm still pissed about the fire alarm and the fire stairs.  If they actually ever have a fire here, I expect that plenty of people will die.  Hopefully it won't happen until after I leave.I got the skinny on this place.They have been purchased by some folks with an amazing vision for what will be.So disregard everything you may have read/seen.The facelift will be done by next Spring.This place will be transformed into a modern art mecca.Oh, BTW, there are legit ghosts here (in case you want to have some extra fun).This hotel feels like it *used* to be 4-5 star back in the good old days... but has not seen renovation in a while.  Its got a nice lobby with paintings, marble floors / staircases, and beautiful light fixtures, but everything just feels old and outdated (for example the CRT TVs in the rooms).  With a small cosmetic face-lift, this hotel could easily return to its glory days, but I understand why its not worth the investment to the owners - there are a lot of large newer hotels neighboring it, and Baltimore is not the most popular destination... so the general mood around here is that of a sleepy fly (not much business).In any case, I came here for a meeting, and the hotel is just two blocks (less than 5 minute walk) from the Conference Center where the meeting was taking place.  Considering the alternatives (double the price, but one block away instead of two), I went with this one. And, in retrospect, I believe I had made the right choice!The room was fine, everything clean, nobody bothered me, had plenty of clean towels, soaps and shampoos, iron and board, etc.  Downstairs there is a bar and a gift shop, and I believe the hotel has some kind of free shuttle service.  The only bad thing I can think of is the wifi.  Sometimes it would kick you off, or would be slow... but I found that there are other hotel's wifis in range that you could get on to, when this happened, lol.","Spent the night at The Lord Baltimore for an Os game. Clean and friendly. We thought the beds were very comfortable. Yes, the elevators are a little wonky. But, it's an old hotel. Part of the charm!Stayed at the Lord Baltimore Hotel over the weekend.Pros: Nice lobby, especially compared to some in the area.Friendly and helpful front desk staff.Free wifi worked good enough (a bit slow). Location is convenient to stadiums.Cons:There was a massive hairball in the room upon arrival. Other evidence of shoddy cleaning existed as well.The TVs are from the 80s. We don't really watch TV but they gave the room an antique roadshow vibe that wasn't pleasant.Phone in our room didn't work. Beds are very uncomfortable, the rolling bed we requested was much more comfortable.Overall if you plan on going to Baltimore, don't go. But if you have to go, and you find a deal for the Lord Baltimore hotel it isn't a completely unpleasant choice.Take a bullet proof vest.Worst management ever! 1) I arrived late and they overbooked. so I slept in a ""room"" that had a pull out couch.2) I came down in the morning as instructed to get a new room and the front desk guy who looked about 12 years old rudely told me I had to wait till 11 when people had checked out. 3)when I finally got my room the key maker was not functioning so I had to stay in my room once they let me in. instead of delivering my key I had to wait in line again to get the key. 4) my room was not cleaned today. housekeeping came by but I was still in the room. They did not speak English I told them to come back and they did not. 5) The elevators broke today and when I took the stairs the end on the first floor was in the kitchen of the bakery! when I got to the lobby I walked by the elevator a staff member bit my head off as I looked at the elevator telling me It was broken.My stay is not over...what will happen next. Go to the Hilton don't stay here!!!!Prrrrt Prrrrt Prrrrrrt!! (royal horn sounds) Welcome to The Lord Baltimore! Hotel is old and the architecture of the lobby is beautiful,this is actually the 2nd time I have stayed there &amp; the rooms were updated since my last visit a few years back, but the elevators weren't....straight wacky...one wouldn't stop on our floor 5,another that would jus pass us right by...missing floor indicators &amp; wires hanging (see picture)...really a shame because it's a nice old building! Staff was freindly &amp; coffee shop in lobby was great &amp; had fresh pastry &amp; coffee! Parking...there's another star gone,they have a valet but I don't like people parking my car...I jus don't trust strangers with my car....sorry,but I don't...front desk directed me to a wayyyy diffrent lot then my last visit &amp; we pull up &amp; sit there...and sit there....the mindless attendant has no green tickets,I guess they are magical and needed to park my car...after 5 good minutes I had to get out &amp; go to the window where mr.mindless had a giant ass stack of magical green tickets BUT told me that the desk doesn't tell people but there isn't any self parking &amp; he has to park my car for me...ok then WHY did they make me drive 2 block away when I could have had my car valet at the lobby....what a bunch of crap &amp; scam....I left &amp; found the old garage from my last visit &amp; $15 a day too...wayyyy cheaper then the magical green ticket lot....only gripe is walking back to the car they expect you to go all the way around the block to enter the garage because the staircase coming out from the garage locks behind you....hint: pull the glass door hard &amp; it opens,just watch out for the massive pile of bum feces infront of the door that was there when we left....I love Baltimore but the vagrants need to be delt with....hey stay at the hotel,grab some joe &amp; a scone but watch the poo poo on your shoe shoe!Not great .The best staff were the valetTo be fair they in Baltimore which is kinda dirty ( check CDC data)they say they are about to remodel, but dicey hotels always say thatits a messStaying at this hotel was not a positive experience. I realize they are planning to modernize, but it can't happen soon enough!  The beds are hard as wooden planks. There is no room service. The carpeting is worn and filthy. The ceilings are buckled and creepy. The elevator takes you to the lower level which is off limits. Oh and the elevators are not clean, just gross and scary. The only positives were most of the people, specifically housekeeping and wait staff. We also met the chef. She was lovely and the food she prepared was delicious.Beautiful renovation. The dining area reminds me of Louisiana more than Paris, but this place was really restored with love and an appreciation of its history in mind.So, I have booked a club room. I am in it right now. Turns out, the club room really isn't a club room as the ""club"" isn't in service right now. Some sort of ""Autocon"" or something like that conference is here now. When I checked in with valet parking, the guy had no idea what to do. Check in was a disaster...I was not told that the ""club room"" was not in operation due to the convention in town, but after I walked away, I asked what time the club breakfast was, and they said, ""Oh"" and handed me an envelope. I read the letter in the elevator that said it was not open this weekend and to accept gift CARDS (note the S) worth 10$ to use at the bakery or French Kitchen. I called downstairs (I had paid for the club which advertised club privileges, wine and cheese, breakfast for two, and valet parking. Reception told me they would give me 2 more cards, as they inadvertently only gave me one and to come down. Went down, they said one card was enough - I asked, for two? After much debate, they gave me one more card...after further debate and for the manager who said, ""This isn't my section"" and a trip to the bar to confirm, I was given two more cards. Went back upstairs to look for info about the restaurants...none...no book, no info, no nothing. Went down and asked and they said they don't give information out about the hotel or the restaurants in the hotel. I went to the restaurant --- instead of the advertised special that the reception pointed out to me was available that night (turns out, it was only lunch, not dinner), I was told by the lovely restaurant manager that he would give me the lunch special, and would make sure breakfast fit within their limit (it otherwise would not -- the 10$ cards would not cover the breakfast, let alone the drinks promised). After dinner, sure enough, the bill was not as it was promised. The dinner itself -- apparently the first night they offered the menu -- head's up, you need to test out the food! -- the French Onion Soup was cold -- cheese not melted, and just cold. Sent it back to get warm, it was warmed, but no cheese apparent... I was told the cheese must have made the soup cold?! My daughter's crab cake was good. The beef bourguignon was cold as well. I gave up. I guess tomorrow the eggs will be cold too. Bagged the rest of the dinner, brought up to the bedroom, decided to watch a movie and eat the cold soup...and well, no movie channels. A fail all around.  So, if you are going to close the club level, then you really need to advertise that BEFORE people buy the club package. Your staff needs to know what is going on, and for goodness sake, why don't you have a book in your room that has the menus, operating hours and hotel information in it? Can you not have movies available? I should have gone with the cheaper hotel...I thought that by including breakfast, the club mark up would make it worthwhile. Never again.The Lord Baltimore is located strategically between the more uptown (north) areas of Mt. Vernon and Mt. Washington, where there are wonderful Industry-Age landmark buildings, and The Inner Harbor area.  It was definitely to our taste as we appreciate older-style beauty and good value, but some may quibble as there is no room service (not an issue for us), and some quirks with the rooms (at least our room)--poor lighting-- we are a couple and there was only a nightstand on ONE side of the bed and no lighting or nightstand on the other--and the lighting in general was odd (no lights anywhere near a full-length mirror?).  The elevators can also be problematic during high-traffic hours--we were there for a convention and it sometimes took a while and by the time it got to the 4th floor where we were the elevators were already full, and there was no way I could see to walk downstairs.  Wi-fi is free which is a great pleasure to still find although I can't say it was the fastest I have ever encountered.  Fine for us though.  I really enjoyed the location--I am a big walker and it was easy to get anywhere--and the staff was very helpful.  Bonus points for the great LB Bakery/coffee place in the lower level; the pastries were fabulous and they had homemade gelato in great flavors.  And it was open late!  There's also a very quirky, fun gift shop that echoes the Visionary Museum in FedHill (a must-see).Here we go:First room was facing a building that was no more 40 feet away or so. The lights were on  that building all night and shining through the windows. This was probably west facing. There are curtain sheers but they are translucent, there are decorative end curtains but they don't actually extend across the windows so you won't be getting any darkness to sleep in. The water comes out of the sink brown right away.The tv is super old and does not fit the picture.The tv remote was missing it's backing and had duct tape holding the batteries in place. The door would not close on its own you had to use the key.The elevator often takes you to the lower lobby which is currently under construction. This has happened to me on at least 5 occasions. You have to ride the elevator to the lower lobby then go back up to the main lobby.Changed rooms which solved the window and the tv remote. Now the bed.Climb in and all the stuffing slides away. One side of the bed is massively firm and sits about 3"" higher than the right side of the bed. I pulled the sheets aside and there is a queen mattress with a giant foam cutout fitted around it to make it queen size. On further review it doesn't even look like a mattress just a bunch of pads foams and egg crates...I am stuck here because of a conference reservation. Do not make the same most ask as me. Go elsewhere. I am getting worse sleep than I have ever had.Internet not workingFront desk not answering the phoneElevators not workingand NOW A PULL OUT COUCH BED......NO WAY       REALLYI would give it 2 and 3/4 but not quite 3 stars. Place is ok but not great. While I did not have a problem with the elevators like everyone else who reviewed seem to have, they were slow in the morning around checkout time.. Bed was pretty good, tv was nice. Where it fell short was, there was no view and the window was dirty on outside .. The shower head was way too low so anyone over 5'6"" will struggle washing their hair.. We were on the 11th floor and I was woken up by sirens outside at 2:30 am.. Valet was expensive, but car was there when I called 10 minutes ahead like they said it would.Honestly, if you need a hotel within walking distance to the convention center or stadium then this is a good choice. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating but that doesn't override the bad quality of the hotel. The elevators do not work well (takes you to the wrong floor and the outside door closes before the inside door) my bed was slanted in the middle and I had to sleep on one side, my coworkers bed broke in the middle of the night, and no hot water in the morning since everyone showers around the same time. The restaurant food was eh. But the staff at the coffee bar are so nice and the doormen were very sweet. Like I said, not terrible but not worth more than a hundred a night.I really enjoyed my stay at The Lord Baltimore Hotel. They are doing an amazing renovation and have done a great job keeping the integrity of the history, with the a modern/ boutique touch. The staff is wonderful at helping you feel welcome and attending to your needs. The owner is an amazing woman. I was very impressed with the restaurant and good quality and ingenuity. The fitness room is also quite nice.I imagine that after the renovations are complete, this will be one of the most spectacular hotels/ restaurant to be at.Nice folks who were helpful and kind. They are renovating it which will make is a snazzy place to stay. It's central and easy to move around. The bed was super comfortable and the shower was strong. I was very glad to stay in this hotel my whole family has stayed in. FREE WIFI!!!! See you next year.Went here last night for an event but got to see the hotel after the renovation. I was thoroughly impressed with the new decor, it was clean, classic, the customer service was top notch. I also toured the new rooms and they looked great. I strongly recommend this hotel. Best kept secret in Baltimore and I will def be staying here in the future!!!!Haven't seen a recent review and I'm really bored so I'll give my 2 cents.  I HATE hotels a lot...like maybe even more then the average person, but I kinda like it here.  The rooms are freshly renovated.  You can tell the place is old, but carpets, walls etc look really fresh.  I'm a ghost hunters fan so the appeal of the haunted 19th floor kinda got me interested as well.  Just a quick update the 19th floor is office space now and has no hotel rooms.  Bummer.  The only thing stopping me from giving 4 stars is the lack of vending machines and parking.  $30 to valet...ehhh.  Other then that it's pretty nice, I'd come back here.There is nothing good about this place. A black eye for the name Radisson for sure. Don't stay here, don't eat here, and enter the elevators at your own risk.Nice rooms and friendly staff but under renovation.  Some rooms no water, no workout room (they give a pass to a nearby gym but inconvenient in bad weather. Small bar. Wait for them to finish and could be ok.Booked a room for my daughter, who was there to check out a college and an inexperienced traveler. She arrived to find that the coffee bar closed for renovation and the restaurant closing before 9 pm! Oh, and there's no snack bar either although there was one advertised. She had to beg the restaurant to feed her and when the fish came (fish and chips) it was full of bones, so she ate the fries and went to find a vending machine. No machines anywhere in the building!! No other food available. The front desk told her to walk to 7-11 (really?!) She'd already seen a street fight break out below her window -- cops were called -- and rightly decided not to walk around Baltimore at night. The desk was unhelpful and huffy. Apparently, there was no clock in the room, no wash cloths or hand towels. The next morning, since there was no coffee bar, she had to go to the restaurant to order breakfast even  though she was pressed for time. It took the staff more than 10 minutes to get her a simple yogurt parfait.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-baltimore-inner-harbor-baltimore,Holiday Inn Baltimore-Inner Harbor,3.0,$$,75,"Rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful. I booked with Groupon and had no problems at all with the reservation. The location was the best part. This hotel is within a short walk of many great restaurants and plenty of things to do. The light rail station is close by as are many bus stops. We only drove out car one time during our entire stay. The only negative things were the price of parking ($25 per day is outrageous for self parking) and no free breakfast. Every Holiday Inn Express I have ever stayed in had a free breakfast.  I also wish there had been a microwave in the rooms. We often had dinner leftovers that would have made good midnight snacks had we been able to reheat them.The location is perfect and so is the customer service but that is as good as it gets.  It was our first trip to Baltimore so we wanted to be close to everything because we had no idea what the layout would actually be like.  The room furnishings were nice and updated. I appreciated the desk with the mirror at it that I used as a vanity and the couch and table came in handy to eat at. The little single up coffee maker with to-go cups and actual mugs was a nice touch. The hotel is so old! It says it was renovated so I cringe to think of what it was like before. Every elevator literally shook as you went up and down, I have never experienced this before! Our room had a really funky smell to it when you walk in, I have no idea what it was. At first I thought the room might just need to air out. And honestly, after a 5 hr drive, I was not interested in having to change rooms.  The bed was very firm and high off the ground, not a big fan of either. The thermostat was off, it would get really hot or cold in the room. The fridge never got cold. The ceilings are very low, especially in the bathroom. The wifi was awful. I actually turned it off and used my data because it was so slow and spotty.  I would not stay here again because there are so many other hotels to stay at in the area that would have better accommodations.I was in town for a conference taking place at a hotel down the block.  This hotel was in the perfect location and proximity the conference and a few places to eat.  The staff are extremely helpful and professional from check-in, to room service, to the cafe.  The west tower room I stayed in appeared to be recently remodeled, but the quality of the remodel was lacking quality.  The bed and pillows were comfortable and the heating/air work great!  The Wifi is free; however, I had access issues several times over the course of my stay that eventually led to my postponed usage.While staying at this location I ate at the Eden West, the restaurant within the hotel, one evening.  I found the place to be average in food quality but over-priced.  I ordered room service one evening and the call line was not familiar with the items listed in the menu.  Once I ordered, it took more than and hour and a half to receive my plate.  They were gracious to give me my room service order for free and to comp my breakfast the next morning (great customer service idea).I would stay here again if I was in the Inner Harbor area.Neither good or bad really..... Mediocre Hotel, not typical of what I have experienced at other Holiday Inn's though. Room was pretty dated, Beds were wayyyy too soft, the mini-fridge didn't keep anything cold at all, west tower only had soda machines on every other floor so I was stuck going one floor down anytime I wanted a drink. The bathroom was SO Small! Practically had to stand in the bathtub to close the door. Friday was $180 dollars, Saturday was $315. What a HUGE difference 1 day makes. They sold microwave stuff in the dotties coffee place, but we had no microwave. The Wings were good that we had at the bar that evening at Eden West, but the Crabcake sandwich was too much bread. I ate none of the pretzel roll, just the crabcake, which was okay. The breakfast buffet next morning was cold, the sausage looked as if it had been sitting all morning, the bacon was swimming in a sea of grease, the scrambled eggs were cold, the french toast was cold and only had some kind of strawberry sauce to put on top, had to get ketchup and syrup from another table as we were not offered any. As we sat and ate, a server, not the one who seated us, not the one who took our order, and not the one who took our drink order, came over and promptly handed us 2 coffee to go cups and our bill even before we were done eating.... we figured it was probably best to just leave. The front desk employees were helpful, and called us a cab when we needed one. $10 including tip is about all a cab ride down to the power station costed so not that bad. The hotel was clean, but for a holiday inn, I have stayed at better ones.I was in town for a meeting taking place at another hotel but wanted to collect the points.  I was able to get a better price than the meeting hotel by contacting the HI management, so thanks to them for working with me. And the meeting was only a few blocks away and not a challenge to walk to.Overall a decent hotel for an older downtown location.  I was on the 11th floor and so used the elevators more than normal - I like to take the stairs, but eleven flights with a heavy computer bag is a bit much.  However, there was never a long wait for an elevator because there are three of them. Much better than some hotels where the lone elevator is overwhelmed.You have to pay $25 per day to use the parking garage.  That gives you in and out privileges, but you most likely will leave the car and walk.  The Inner Harbor area is only a few blocks away.  You are better off walking than dealing with the traffic and then having to pay again to park elsewhere.  The convention center is also close.One point about urban hotels is that you can go from a good neighborhood to a sketchy one very quickly. As long as you stay by the hotel and the area toward and including the Inner Harbor, you should be fine.  There are a lot of people in those areas.  However, I headed north to Baltimore Street to grab some snacks from a 7-11 and found the area to be a bit challenging.  I bought more stuff and got out of there, and I later found another convenience store on Lombard Street near the hotel.Overall a decent place to stay.The one thing that almost saves this hotel is the friendly staff, but even they aren't enough.  It is a shabby, stuffy and smelly place that has no ventilation in the bathrooms nor windows that open. The indoor restaurant, Eden West, served a great shrimp salad that was prepared for takeout. We had just arrived after a long flight and just wanted to sleep. The next day however we went down to dine in, and found that its about 40 feet away from the lobby front doors, but since the hotel allows people to smoke outside, it just blows all through the lobby and the restaurant. The restaurant's bar/lounge is upholstered in a brown, dull fabric that hasn't been aired out in decades. The odor was so offensive we just turned around and left. The elevators are nearly deathtraps, and the rooms would have been comfortable were it not for the musty odor. I turned on the AC to clear it out, but it began to smell like body odor more than anything else. The beds are large enough, and there is a frig and microwave included, but the frig's cooling system was iffy. The bath tub was dingy and lack of a fan in the bathroom was puzzling. The rooms have flat screen tvs, but no DVR/TiVO and only a few channels are HD. We stayed in February, but  I couldn't recommend this place. Certainly wouldn't come here in the summer.This should be a quaint, historic hotel. It wants to be that. Instead, it's just a bit shabby, a bit uncomfortable, and seriously overpriced. Any character it once had has been overwritten by modern upgrades that didn't add to the charm - in fact, they erased the charm in search of the modern. The only reason to recommend this hotel is the location. Even that isn't enough to warrant $175 a night.Stayed here April 4-5 for a conference held at the convention center (located 1 block away)Fantastic location for the convention center. Inner harbor is a 15 minute walk away, Power Plant (bar/club scene) is a $10 taxi ride away. Parking at the hotel is $25 per night. Restaurant and bar located inside, but did not have a chance to experience either. Convenience/gift store/bakery located in the lobby -- baked goods are divine and the lattes aren't so bad. Skip the bagels--they were cold and hard (and $4!). They also have a good selection of souvenirs (mugs, plush toys, magnets, and even old bay seasoned pickles!)Room was great. Newly updated faucets and showers. Pillows and beds were a bit small but comfortable nonetheless. No in-room safe or hairdryer, but the room did have an iron and coffee maker. Bath and Body works toiletries were a nice touch. Special shout out: Hubert was amazing-- he was friendly and quick to check us in, sent maintenance (who was also very courteous) to our room within 5 minutes of our call (our bathroom light was out) and even helped us with our overpacked, oversized bags when we checked out. He has a genuine warmth about him that's hard to find in the service industry. Overall a great hotel, would definitely recommend.We encountered quite a few house keeping problems during our week-long stay. After several complaints and my initial very negative review, the housekeeping manager and hotel managers both made efforts to apologize and fix the problems. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, good location, decent price, etc. I'd give it 4 stars if house keeping had it together before the numerous complaints.Stayed here for five days and picked it based on the location. I will never stay in this hotel again until they fix their wifi. It was the most frustrating experience trying to get some light work done which normally would have taken an hour, but ended up taking several hours! If you are going to serve people that attend conventions, then you should have better wifi service?Overall, it's a mediocre hotel and not memorable, and the close proximity to the Convention Center is the only plus.Nice hotel close to government buildings. Room was clean. Pillows were soft. The curtains blacked out the sun to help me adjust to the time zone difference. Server Bryant was excellent. Morning buffet is ok (eggs, fruit, yogurt, potatoes). The bar/restaurant servers don't seem very motivated to help people seated at tables. The menu could do with some variety.Great location, super convenient, but definitely not holiday inn standard. The rooms are clean but old. The receptionist people are friendly but not very professional. I asked the receptionist if she can send a plumber in an hour to fix our leaky shower head and she asked me call the front desk again in an hour so she ""doesn't forget"". The bathroom smells moldy and the wall papers are peeling off very badly. The housekeeping staff is not very good at replenishing our supplies such as toilet paper, tissue, and toiletries, and they seem to be incredibly unhappy when we call to ask for these to be brought up. We have four people listed for our room but somehow we keep on getting only 3 sets of clean towels. And here is what I don't understand, when they give us toilet paper or facial tissue, it's never a full roll or box! It's always half!! WHERE IS THE FIRST HALF?!?!So bottom line, it's a good place if you want convenience. It's one block away from the convention center. The light rail stops one block away from the hotel. And there are plenty of restaurant, shopping, convenient stores within one mile radius (or easily reachable with the downtown free orange route bus). But if you want comfort, you should try somewhere else. At the end of our 7-day stay, I couldn't wait to get out of here.Stayed here as part of a convention that spanned 7-8 hotels around the convention center.  In previous reviews, there is a real swing of positive and negative, and I can tell you that that is largely driven by which ""tower"" you stay in.  The rooms in the main tower are quite a bit larger than the West Tower.  And the West Tower guests have to use a key to get from the West Tower to the lobby, restaurant, and meeting rooms.  I was actually in the main tower - so my room was one of the better ones; however, there were still a number of issues - none so major as to warrant a pow-wow with the manager, but taken as a whole it was not a great hotel.The bathroom was laughably small--- almost had to stand in the tub to close the door and use the toilet.  nice.The maid service was bizarre to me.  They knocked on the door at 8am - and we said we'd be out in about 10 minutes. Even waved to them when we left.  But when we returned at 4pm the room had not been serviced.  The front desk said service was usually 6pm -- huh?  So there's something about their schedule I don't get. But more importantly, there was a huge swing in the quality of the service - one day great, the next no wash clothes, two bath towels short, only a quarter roll of toilet paper, etc.  Even MORE bizarre was the restaurant.  7 of us went there for breakfast-- the bored hostess said she could not put us at one table. We said no problem, we can be at two tables. She said all tables were dirty and they had no bus boy -- ""give me a minute"" -- and she NEVER came back.  neat. we found other places to eat.  In fact, in an 8 day stay, I never ate there, nor did my friends.  I can't believe how much business they lost by not being ready for our group.Also want to warn you that the little convenient store in the lobby has crazy prizes.  My friend bought 2 purse packs of Kleenex -- $4.50!!?!?  excuse me?  I wanted a latte and the clerk had no idea how to make one. ""I could out some flavor in plain coffee."" (yeah, that's how they do it at Starbucks).  My friend asked for hot chocolate -- plain water and a pack of Swiss Miss for $2.80  Try the nearby CVS if you need to buy something.Bottom-line, not horrible, not even memorably bad....but not good enough to return or recommend.PLUSES: Free wifi, fridge and microwave in roomOkay I understand why you don't have certain rooms available.  But putting someone that stays 50+ nights with your brand on the 3rd floor, next to the ice machine and across from a fire station is beyond belief.  IHG is a loyalty program- I don't care I am paying whatever a night, but if I am a loyal guest then put me in a better room.  Told there were no other rooms available- but coworker with no status got high floor and bay facing (no fire station).Franchise as all HI, so it makes me question one of my loyalties.I was a bit disappointed in this Holiday Inn.  The rooms were ok, but a little dated. There was only one person at the desk at a time, so check-in took quite a bit. And breakfast in the hotel's restaurant was slow and cold. The manager should work on improving customer service and the hotel restaurant.I can not speak to the price of this lovely establishment because I was there for a trade show and on someone else's dime. That being said, I really enjoyed my stay at this location.  It was close (translation: walking distance) to everything that we needed to be close to -- Convention Center, Camden yards (and the Red Sox were playing to boot!), all the inner harbor fun. I had an issue with printing my boarding pass the night before my departure and a polite young man helped me get it printed. He did not leave my side until it was done correctly.I would totally recommend this location to anyone needing to be in this part of town.I really enjoyed my stay here.Pros:-Location, location, location. It's close to the hospital and within a 10-min or so walk to Harborplace Mall.  -My room (king size bed) was quite spacious.  I love that it had a little sitting area - small sofa, easy chair, desk - and microwave and mini-fridge.-As a ""Priority Reward"" member, I got a little welcome gift bag.  It contained 2 bottles of water, a bag of chips, and two pieces of chocolate.  I love utility in gifts, so I definitely appreciated the free water and I popped a piece of chocolate right away.  You can also save 2 bucks from the steep parking cost as a Priority Reward member.-My room was on the 11th floor right across from the elevators and next to the soda and ice machine.  I was afraid it would be noisy but I didn't hear a peep and slept like a rock.Cons:-$25/night for parking.  I know this is due to the hotel's great location but it's still a bit much to swallow.  TIP: Sign up to be a Priority Rewards on the hotel website.  It's free to sign up -- akin to signing up for a CVS card, there are no fees, just perks -- and parking is $23/night.  But regardless, at least you can drive in and out and you do have access to the garage until 3 PM the day of your check-out.-Breakfast is NOT included, though there's a restaurant within the Holiday Inn and a store where you can buy food. However, thanks to there being a mini-fridge and microwave in the room, I bought a chicken sandwich elsewhere for under  3 bucks and stashed it in the mini-fridge and had that for breakfast.Neither pro/con: When I first checked out the bathroom/sink area, it looked like someone had urinated in the toilet.  Maybe the housekeeper?  I didn't think too much of it, but later I got a letter under my door that there were piping problems throughout the city, so the water may be tinted brown.  That explained things, and I was glad to know the reason for the urine-tinted water.All in all, I had a good visit here. The location and room were great. The only downside is the steep price of parking, but I guess that's to be expected in this part of town.Noise level at 3am is horrible. I was woke up at 3am still up now till 5am with loud people next to me. In the morning I will be requesting a refund or a free night at a different property. I have never seen an IHG property so nutty. Microwave is trashy. Washer and dryer is 1.75 per wash or dry. Quarters or Credit card required. Have your own quarters or they may have them at front desk but they do not have a change machine in laundry room. Gym is unattended and has clean towels. The ONLY reason they have 2 stars from me is the gym and the fact they have washers. Other than that, this place is a dump.Clean room.  Super friendly staff.  Amenities are about two star though.  Bad lighting.  No makeup mirror for her.  Oh boy.Not the best but far from the worst hotel I've stayed at. The good:  Clean, good service, price wasn't too crazy for downtown Baltimore and it's in a good location.The bad: I know check out and check in times have being changing but this place has to be the worst. Check in at 4pm and Check out at 11am.  I'm paying a good amount of money to stay less than a day already with the normal check out times not this just shortens my stay even more and cause more agrvation as far as preparations for my travels. Another big con about this place is the parking situation. $25 for parking $2 off if you are a Holiday Inn member. Again this just seems a little steep esp. when you can go around the block and find cheaper garages. I'm just glad I'm not a tourist and don't live that far that I knew where the free parking was in the city.","Stayed Mon - Thurs...Pros: Staff was very friendly &amp; helpful, location was near to points in the inner harbor area, good access to highways to go south out of the city Cons: $25 per day for parking, bathtub in the room wouldn't drain &amp; by day 3 it was as if you were taking a shower but in a full bathtub...Stayed at this Holiday Inn for a business trip a few weeks back. It was a prime spot in regards to the Baltimore Convention Center except that there was construction going on at the hotel (no notice of it while booking...) so the front entryway was closed off and guests had to walk around to the other exit....The hotel is walking distance to touristy inner harbor and Oriole park which was convenient since we did attend a game and passed by the tailgaters leading up to the stadium. There's also a good amount of restaurants, pubs and coffee shops nearby. Front desk personnel were personable which made up for them taking forever to check us in, i hate waiting!!I travel about 10 months of the year for work, and all of that time is spent in hotels. Recently I spent two weeks in Baltimore at this Holiday Inn. Comparatively to others of the same chain I would call this one middle of the road. It has a great location, close to the harbor/convention  center/ stadium/ theatre district. But there wasn't anything specifically to make this place stand above the rest to give a hotel that ""WOW factor."" This property is actually two budding a the main one with the lobby and all other accommodations.   And the ""west tower"" while separated by a covered outdoor walkway, is only guest rooms.  And as a warning the house keeping staff have different hours or just don't check your room. Lobby/ public spaces:Clean, spacious, the pool was nice, located in the basement but plenty of windows. And the adjacent fitness center was fairly well equipped. It did seam fairly evident that the West tower was not as well maintained/cleaned as the main building. Room:Was well laid out, and spacious. They have plenty of outlets near the bed located in the lamps both night stands. The mattress was nice and pillows were full, not over used.  My single king room was also furnished with a couch/lounger thing, as well as a fridge and microwave (a small piece of Heaven when doing extended hotel stays). The bathroom as a bit small, having to step out of the way to close the door past the front of the stool. But for me staying alone, needing to close the bathroom door was a mute point.  Bar/restaurant:I did not eat on property, I do know there was a restaurant and what looked like a bar past the lobby both of which I never saw people in (staff OR guests). As well there is also a small coffee shop. I was never able to figure out when it was open. But heard rumor it dose open daily with VERY odd hoursInternet speeds:SLOW!  Summery:Was a decent place, would stay here again. The only real downside I would have to say is the few days I actually wanted my room freshened up by the cleaning staff they skipped over my room.True 3-star hotel. Don't expect luxury or wide spaces, bathroom is really small. This HI is a 3-star done right. Good bed, nice pillows, real cold A/C, and great, Great, GREAT location. We recommend to include breakfast in your rate. Breakfast buffet has good offerings for the rate differential. Besides, there are no restaurants around hotel. Must walk couple blocks and more to get to restaurants and convenience stores. One plus: this hotel does have a pool and fitness center. Some others don't in this area.The room was very clean but there were some issues regarding a worn out chair and chipped paint, which made the room look undesirable.  I sent a comment to the staff and it was all taken care of the same day.  I was very pleased with their prompt response.  The hotel is in a great location.  Highly recommended. They have a good pool and gym sauna, and the wifi is free. Breakfast ins not include. Great staff.Worst experience I have ever had at a Holiday Inn. Was paying an exorbitant amount of money for a room that had dirty furniture and bed bugs. Left a day early and when I went to the front desk to check out and I told him of my experience with the bedbugs, they indicated to me ""sorry"".  Didn't offer a discount or have the manager come over to apologize. I will never stay at another holiday and ever again.The room was on the 8th floor and facing the fire station. The road noise even at this height was too loud all night. The room charge does not include breakfast. For a few dollars more and hot breakfast included there are much better other choices. I do not much care for the self parking at 25 dollars per day either.Stayed 1 night for an o's game.  Just over a block from Camden Yards and a lot cheaper than the hotels closer. We had the king room that ended up being upgraded to a suit which was really really nice. Everything was super clean and everyone on the staff was super nice. The room was surprisingly quiet as well. The only reason not giving 5 stars is no hot water for a shower in the morning. It was 10:30 am so I'm sure it was just from the heavy morning use.Definitely a fan of this hotel. Solid 3.5 stars. Again, the price really can't be beat for the location. I know the parking is pricey - but honestly, it's the best city-hotel-parking I've had to deal with. I've never had trouble finding a spot. I like that I take the little pass inside to the front desk and they just charge my room and I keep the same pass until I'm leaving. No valet, no paying every time I need to leave, and I'm not required to park in a creepy garage. Was put on the other side of the building this time - definitely quieter. Will be back!Great Service!  Justin at the front desk was extremely helpful.  Everyone at this hotel has been extremely polite and helpful. Very different experience from my last hotel in Baltimore.  I would stay here again.Update: hotel staff promptly corrected most items i brought up, upgrading them to 3 stars.Checked in after a long day of travel. Justin was amazing. He was professional, friendly, and has excellent customer service skills. Great room, great customer service! Thank you Justin!I stayed at this Holiday Inn during Otakon 2012 for 3 nights with 4 other friends in a 2-queen bed room. The prices were really reasonable for us, and the location is attractive, with it being literally minutes (walking distance) from all the major attractions of the Inner Harbor area. The staff stayed very strong under the pressure/insanity that coordinating hundreds of guests in costumes / with crazy luggage for Otakon entails, and even were supportive of the festivities, by providing free drinks, accurate directions, and taking photos of con-goers.The room was standard, and got the job done. We were provided with enough towels/blankets for all of us, and our room came with a convenient mini-fridge and microwave. It was typical Holiday Inn-quality.The only major downside was the lack of air conditioning in the lobby / other public areas of the hotel. The weekend was averaging temperatures of over 100 degrees Farenheit, and that coupled with hundreds of people in costumes made for an unpleasant experience when waiting to check in / lounging in the lobby. Other than that, though, I was content with my experience here.This was my first time attending the Firehouse Expo. I arrived early to attend the morning conferences and wanted to check in early so that I could get settled in before going to the conference and then so I could head out to the Inner Harbor after. This was not the case. I was told that I had to wait until 4pm and that if I was lucky, I may be able to check in by 3pm. I was alright with this, brought by baggage back to my car and got ready for the conference in my car. However, just an hour or so later while I just sat down in the conference, the other people in my group arrived and were able to check in early and got their room. Why was this? What special exception was made for them?When I was finally able to check in, we were given a room in the main building facing the firehouse. When we got to our room, we noticed that the cot we had requested and paid for was not in the room. Surprisingly, the manager who had checked us in called us within an hour of checking in to make sure everything in our room was alright. I advised him of the cot situation and one was immediately sent up. This was great service, but then I was also informed by my other group that the cot we had paid for their room was also not given to them. So thus far, I have not figured out why when I booked the room a few months in advance that I requested a cot and early check in for each room because those requests were not granted as I thought they would.The room was actually not bad overall. It was pretty spacious and modern. However, our refrigerator and blow dryer did not operate at all. When we attempted to take a nap after classes, we noticed that the shades in the room did not close all the way, allowing light to enter the room creating an uncomfortable environment to sleep in. These were some minor things, but they were definitely noted. As for the housekeeping, they were extremely slow. They were by far the slowest I have ever experienced at any stay I have had in any hotel. We came back for a nap after classes and were awoken at 4pm by housekeeping staff asking if they could come clean our room. 4pm?! A little ridiculous if you ask me. Yet the next morning, they were banging on our door at 9am trying to clean our room when we were not even awake yet. They did not even give us time to get up out of bed and answer the door because she attempted to key into our room. It would have been nice if this hotel offered the ""Do Not Disturb"" signs that every other hotel offers. I was never advised by the staff about the noise from the firehouse just across the street. Although I was quite fine with it, I still would have liked to be warned or maybe given the option to be away from that if needed. I was also never given the courtesy to pardon their appearance while they were renovating. I had to read signs and ask staff why they were giving out free chips, popcorn, water, and even beer to be given this memo. I did not know what noise or inconveniences there would be with this construction. Overall, there was not much inconvenience made by the construction nor noise made except for having to walk through the parking lot to get to the entrance in the breezeway (the main entrance was under construction), and it was nice to see the staff actually try to compensate for any inconveniences faced. To conclude this experience, my biggest disappointment came from the parking and breakfast amenities offered. First, this is not a Holiday Inn Express, so there is no free continental breakfast. This is understandable, but their ""restaurant"" is not very welcoming to Holiday Inn patrons. They did not offer their menu to us and served us right to the breakfast ""buffet"" that consisted of eggs, french toast, bacon, and potatoes (All of which took forever to be replenished fresh) and also included a limited amount of fruit and cereal. Figuring that this restaurant was apart of the Holiday Inn that they would offer some sort of discount, but they did not. $15 for this lousy breakfast buffet. $15! That is insane for what was offered.Second, you have to park in a parking deck in between the two hotel towers. You have to hold on to your parking ticket for the duration of your stay. When I checked in, I asked for my card to be validated, figuring that parking was free for valued customers of Holiday Inn. Wrong. I was charged on my hotel bill at my surprise at a ""discounted"" rate of $23 a night, $2 cheaper than the normal rate. To add a few bucks to that, since I arrived earlier than expected, I was charged an additional $6 because I came too early and then an additional $9 when I left cause I stayed 2 hours after 3pm while attending the Orioles game. Thus, a total of $84 was spent solely on parking in 3 nights. This to me is insane. Never have I had to pay for parking at a hotel I was staying at. I am not sure how other hotels operate in the immediate area, but I know I will at be taking my business elsewhere to see if I am treated as poorly.The hotel was clean and close to the stadium.  Those were the priorities for us!  Everything was in walking distance and the hotel staff was extremely helpful.  We will be back to Baltimore and we wouldn't stay anywhere besides the Holiday Inn in the Baltimore Inner Harbor.I will definitely choose the Holiday Inn Express-Inner Harbor in the future.  The front desk staff were friendly and accommodating, as well as the other staff, including the restaurant and Dottie's workers.  A huge bottled water, popcorn, oat &amp; honey granola bar, chocolate chip cookies, and crackers with nutella were waiting on me in my room. The room also has a microwave and refrigerator which is just great. The hotel has a restaurant and coffee shop/convenience store on the lobby level.  It also has a nice-sized workout room, pool, and sauna.  The doorman was also helpful in explaining various parts of the city. The Holiday-Inn Express is walking distance to the Baltimore Convention Center and Harbor West where there is plenty of music, shopping, and food.  I received my wake-up call on time and never had to request cleaning service like some hotels who inadvertently forget to stop by your room.The only reason I did not give this place five stars is because when I made the reservation the reservationists assured me there would be complimentary continental breakfast, the hot water in the shower took a few minutes to kick in, and the bed wasn't up to my standards - I like pillow top and thick comfortable blankets.Horrifying, however the front desk was smiling and friendly through the whole experience.Eutaw street is a half block away from the hotel. Avoid it at all costs...especially if you're a woman traveling alone. I was yelled at on the street by locals who made it quiet clear that we stood out and weren't really welcome. The hotel was under construction in the main lobby when I arrived. I stayed 3 nights for business. I was given a Priority Rewards welcome bag with a bag of BBQ chips and water...gee thanks.Night one there was a domestic disturbance in the room next to mine. Think lots of screaming about who hurt my baby's daddy...Morning two we found baby roaches in a folder we had left on the floor next to the bed. WTF?And finally our last morning there, a fire alarm went off at 9am. No indications that it was a false alarm until we clammered down 11 flights of stairs only to see the front desk at ease like nothing was happening. No note under the door to warn us? It was just a scheduled test? Thanks...I stayed here with 3 friends during the WFTDA Eastern Regionals. The hotel was conveniently located (walking distance to the harbor and to many restaurants). We were staying in part of the hotel that is in a different tower from the main lobby. It seemed like the hotel had been remodeled in the somewhat recent past so we didn't mind. We investigated the pool but were sad to discover that there wasn't a hot tub, so we didn't spend any time there. Our room was clean and seemingly bedbug-free (being paranoid New Yorkers, we just had to check).Parking is not included in the price of your room and neither is the continental breakfast. I didn't think the dry goods at the continental breakfast were worth the price so I would suggest going elsewhere to eat in the mornings. Overall, I would stay here again the next time I'm in Baltimore.Stayed here for 4 nights. The staff were always welcoming, and quick to address any request we had. The hotel is clean, easy to navigate, and a great price. Great location, close to the convention center, the inner harbor shops &amp; restaurants, airport, etc. The food in the restaurant and room service was great tasting and did not cost you an arm and a leg. I would definitely stay here again!nice, clean, friendly staff, and the best price in the inner harbor.I recommend it! - See and O's game and the National Aquarium, Great restaurants close by. SOunds great to me  (and it was!!!)","Great location and a very clean hotel.It is just a few blocks from Camden Yards, M&amp;T Bank Stadium and the Inner Harbor in a very safe area.The staff is very friendly even late at night and the pool is nice.I recently stayed here with a group of friends for the Otakon convention. The only thing keeping this from being a 2-star review is the incredible staff. The front desk staff were phenomenal. They were very friendly and helpful and made us feel very welcomed even though it was crazy busy in there with all of the guests for the convention checking in. The onsite parking was expensive but convenient. I just wish they wouldn't have tried cramming more cars into the tiny surface lot during the baseball games. My car was blocked in several times throughout the weekend and when I left on Sunday I was blocked in again (luckily the person blocking me in was leaving at the same time as me, but if he hadn't been I would not have been able to leave). People were just making up their own parking spaces with zero regard for anyone else.The rooms were sized right for the price, not very big, but big enough to comfortably fit the three of us for the weekend. The AC worked fine and the beds were hard, but not too uncomfortable. However, the rooms did have a certain ""old"" feel. You could tell they had redone them at some point, but there were still giant old, loud AC units in the room, lazily painted trim, and no vents or fans in the bathroom. We stayed in the west tower and the elevators were hot, stuffy, and uncomfortable. Not to mention with only two of them to service all the rooms in that tower, they were crowded and we ended up just taking the stairs (also hot and stuffy) because there was no room for us in the elevator. Now the worst part: the NOISE level. The walls seemed to be paper thin. And we had a non-functional connecting door between our room and the one next to us and we could hear EVERYTHING our neighbors were saying even though they weren't even talking loudly. It was awful. We didn't want to knock on their door and ask them to be quiet because even though it was 3 am, they really were talking at a normal level. If this had been any other hotel I've stayed at, we wouldn't have been able to hear them. We tried stuffing towels and blankets under the crack of that stupid fake door thing, but it didn't work. It was like a group of people were sitting right there in our room talking and laughing. We barely got any sleep that night and it made our convention experience the next day a tired, unpleasant one. If I am paying $160/night, I expect to actually be able to rest and sleep in my room at night.I've stayed in many hotels and this was a delight. The price was extremely reasonable, $99, and it was attractive, clean, friendly, and unbelievably convenient to downtown and the inner harbor. There was also a microwave, a mini fridge, a large, well equipped workout room, a restaurant (I didn't get to try it), and a little convenience store in the lobby---not to mention an indoor pool! I will be looking for an event in order to have a reason to stay here.We arrived late from the West Coast so I was already kind of agitated, but upon checking in I was given 2 goodie bags with bottled water, chips and a couple mints. I thought that was a pretty nice touch. Oh, and their fitness center is pretty top notch as far as hotel fitness centers go.. they also had a nice dry sauna. I like to swing through those when I'm on vacation and get some of the booze and bullshit.. Downstairs they had a little coffee shop, bakery that seems to get the job done. I never had any issues with the business center either.. the only small complaint I have was the tub got clogged after only the 2nd day. The housekeeping staff should be a little more on top of that, but other than that, this place was serviceable.Nice enough old hotel.  Was quiet with good firm beds.  Wished the windows opened because room was musty from lots of air conditioning and inadequate air flow.  Also, hot water availability was an issue 2 out of 4 mornings.  So early birds get the hot water, others -- maybe not.  Very convenient location.The rooms here weren't horrible; however, I asked on two separate occasions for a toothbrush and some toothpaste and they never came. There was a sign in the bathroom that stated that they would supply these items upon request. Both times I was told ""Sure, Ma'am."" . And nobody ever came. I ended up purchasing these items instead. The bar was a little entertaining - as there was a lady who fell off her bar stool onto the floor...TWICE...and yet they continued to serve her. There was a free happy hour offered one of the nights we were there..but it left a lot to be desired. We walked out...even though there was a free open bar. The food was horrible and the crowd was shady.Had to come to Baltimore for a Facilities Conference and when my boss booked us at the Holiday Inn I cringed. I try to stay at a Hyatt or Marriott when I travel and just the thought of switching up made me hella nervous. So I arrived at the hotel and the staff was exceptionally courteous. Was told that we would be in the upgraded side so I was hyped. Well....the upgraded side looked decrepit. I really would have hated to see what the non-upgraded side looked like. Small rooms, dingy looking hallways, creaky elevator. Soooo not a top notch establishment. Continental breakfast was kinda crappy as well; id have been better off eating leftovers. Only saving grace for me again was the customer service. Definitely much better places to stay at in the area.I recently stayed here and had a good time. This hotel is perfect if your visiting the Inner Harbor or going to an Orioles game. Both are within walking distance. A lot of the previous reviews mentioned the fire station across the road. It was never an issue. It did not go off every hour as some of the reviews have said and the one time it did go off it really wasn't that loud. There are ice machines and soda machines on every floor. The room was clean and the service was fine. My only complaint was the coffee in the coffee shop was kinda crappy/watery/weak, but I'm a bit of a coffee snob. I also wish the pool was open later because it would have been nice to relax in the pool after the baseball games at night. I understand its their policy but it still would have been nice. Be prepared to pay $25 a day to park but otherwise I'd stay here again.I would never stay here again, check in was at 4pm ok I arrive at 245pm and was told no rooms available so I was told I would be notified when it was ready I waited and hour and half  and decided to ask if they had a room ready they said yes, the front desk couldn't care less that peopleStayed here for a fun filled night in charm city!  The check in was a quick process and the desk staff was friendly.  The room was ready as soon as I got there which was at least an hour before check in. I wasn't the largest room I have ever been in but it was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The window actually opened and the room had a mini fridge, which in my book is a HUGE plus! I love the bath and body products they provide in the bathroom.  The only con was the paid parking, I know it's the city and you pretty much have to pay for parking everywhere I just think it should be assumed that if you are staying in a hotel you will also need parking for your stay. But all and all it was a pleasant expereience and I will be back!I stayed here for 3 weeks as part of military/hospital training. The neighborhood is not the safest, but is IS Maryland. The staff was always nice and helpful. My calls to the front desk for clean up, food, or supplies were always answered in a timely manner. It was always clean. I cannot speak about the price compared to the room because I did noto pay for it (military provided the room). The food at the restaurant was ok. I never had a problem with the service from the restaurant. The bar is a nice little addition when you don't want to walk elsewhere for a drink.Stayed here for our Family Reunion and I was really impressed with the facility and our accomodations. The Holiday Inn Inner Harbor was about 9 blocks from the Inner Harbor and within walking distance to pretty much everything. Check in took us a total of 6 minutes and I was pleased with the 2 bed guest room we had for just 1 night. The room smelled a bit like cigarette smoke but, after turning on the a/c and spraying some Febreeze, all was well. This hotel was a great location to hold an event....the staff was very accomodating to our needs and very friendly. The only issue I had was with parking. We had to pay $23 to park our car in the ""city"" parking garage and the garage was always full. The garage was like a damn maze too! I hate that....Otherwise, I had a great time...the staff was awesome...and the hotel is even awesomeer :)Yes you'll be attracted by the cheap price and convenient location to the convention center and Camden Yards but what distinguishes the Baltimore Holiday Inn is the aroma of nicotine wafts through the halls.The place has a cheap feel to it, thin walls and being located on the first floor make for a recipe for a long night.I stayed at this Holiday Inn for one night. The walls are thin and you can easily hear through them, kind of annoying but not a big deal if you are able to sleep easily.The room I stayed in had a bathroom that was separated into two different parts. The toilet and shower were in an inclosed area while the sink was visible to anyone in the room. Make sure you request a room with a private bathroom if your looking for privacy. I'm a Priority Club member and I saved $2 on parking, not that big of a deal. The parking is orginally $23 but $21 for us Priority Club members. I also want to point out that they do not give free breakfast coupons away to the Priority Club.  Breakfast is around $16.99 per person, not including the tip.horrific. Unorganized staff, rude as hell manager. I checked out early because I didn't like the way the manager treated me. They are really shady about telling you the entire price of your stay. I booked a room for Friday night till Sunday morning, I was told it would cost about 160$ that was fine. HOWEVER none ever told me that was per night. I'm not stupid, I practically lived in dozens of hotels all over the country. And everytime you get the room they ask how long you will be staying, then give you the price....FOR YOUR ENTIRE STAY. Not a misleading nightly quote, and then wake up to a 480$ pending charge on my debit card. It's bad business, and the manager is obviously a bad manager, letting it continue in the fashion it is. Place was clean. Ghetto ass people everywhere, but it's downtown in a big city..you'll have that, just typically not in the parking lot bumming cigarettes and chatting with the ""security"". So that stuff, and make sure you bring a bucket to put the pieces of your skull in after they bash it in with their insane parking rates. It's clean, convenient, fairly quiet...if you enjoy being rushed by the rude incompetent staff this is the place for you.No Attitude of Gratitude here!We spent two nights at this hotel getting poor service, bad attitude and definitely NOT 3-star-hotel sharp accommodations.  We checked in but had to wait 4 hours for a room to become available...because we had been assigned a handicapped-accessible room.  Neither of us is handicapped; we didn't reserve a handicapped accessible room; we didn't want a handicapped accessible room; and we sure didn't want to wait 4 hours because that's what Holiday Inn assigned us!   There was absolutely no persuading the steely faced young woman at the counter to help us out in any way.  Not a smile or apology in sight.  Not a soothing word was spoken to alleviate our unhappiness, and absolutely no explanations about why we had been assigned a ""special needs"" room.When the (caucasian) man next to us checked right in, we started to wonder if the problem was that we're an interracial couple.  Now...I'm not sayin'...just tellin' the question that ran through our minds.The dining room food was awful; the lounge doesn't open 'til 5:00 p.m.; the snack shop is outrageously overpriced for simple fare &amp; has disgusting coffee; the carpeting throughout is dirty and old and, of course, worst of all was the bad attitude of the check-in staff.Hi.  A few years ago, I spent one night at this fascinating hotel in the heart of downtown Baltimore's Inner Harbor district.  Boy is this one lucky find!  Not only is this hotel as close to the major harbor attractions but it is also right directly across from Camden Yards, and from some rooms in the one tower you can see the outer parts of Camden Yards clearly from your room's window.But the picture that marks this hotel here on Yelp, isn't the only portion of this hotel that is part of this Holiday Inn's property.  They also have another tower(of a slightly smaller size in width, not height) that they use daily in the summer.  A better picture of this portion can be found at: <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QXmD7V37XdidJ1ggRnnQfQ?select=Z7NZJuebd7KZT52ajPqIxg"">yelp.com/biz_photos/QXmD...</a>The hotel is also next to/across the street from Baltimore's light rail system.  The tracks lay right outside the hotel directly across from the check-in area, car overpass and in front of the entrance to the parking garage.Be very careful near this hotel, although the streets that mark the corners of this hotel aren't marked as such, all the streets nearby are all unmarked One-Way Streets.I was stunned when I used their free wifi at this hotel from my room-fast and effective, and, even when I had become a Priority Rewards card member, I received a free pack of 3 baseball cards with my purchase of a night of one of their rooms-a valuable plus in my book-all for free.  But be prepared to buy your room on cyber Monday, as the rooms in the one tower are pricey and the other one not quite/but close to pricey.  But for the amount of stuff I got in this hotel, it was well worth it, as I got to walk several times back and forth to do some sightseeing in the city without needing a car-you need to walk about 10 blocks to get to the Inner Harbor district-where the temps are comparatively cooler.  A few problems exist with this hotel:1.)I couldn't find the parking garage system right next door.  2.)I had another problem with this place, upon checkout from the parking lot: the parking attendant is required to take your ticket and KEEP your ticket(unlike all other hotel chains) and the attendant is the only one that is allowed to scan your ticket to exit the lot.3.)Be prepared to veer to the left is want underground-inside parking.  Spots on upper level tend to become very hot on the asphalt.4.) Parking isn't free for the guest, but you can pay for parking upon check-in at this hotel at the front desk.Although he front desk line moves slowly at the time when I checked in, the issues people were having were respectable, and the employees value your time as you are their paying customer.(contact me for details).If I was ever in Baltimore again, I'd choose this hotel over all the others for both price and quality/quantity of services they offer.I travel to Baltimore every year to watch the Yankees play the O's, and this is where I always stay. It's not fancy and the rooms aren't  big..BUT...it's clean, cheap and only two blocks away from the stadium and four blocks away from the inner harbor. Its in a perfect spot. If you require more, try the Hilton or Marriott which are right next door. But prepare to pay for it.  For me the holiday inn is exactly what I need.This is a great place to stay when visiting Inner Harbor. Walking distance to EVERYTHING. If you don't want to get a car when in baltimore, its really no problem when staying here. The ball park is literally two blocks away. And the inner harbor is probably half a mile away. They have a heated pool, a coffee shop, free parking, a gym, restaurants, a really nice staff, and the coldest air conditioners. Stay here, its great.Great location ~ stones throw to the convention center, the stadium and 4 blocks to the Inner Harbor.  Hotel was very accommodating to our soccer team.  The rooms were clean and certainly large enough.  Great pillows ~ towels need to be thrown out!  Too old to recover.  Other than that, loved the hotel.  Better than average gym and very nice pool.","One of the better Holiday Inns that I have stayed at, and I have been to many over the years. With that beign said, my three days and two nights spent here o nthe 4 th of July holiady weekend went very well. A very friendly staff, accompanied by a spacious/clean room, for a great value. The hotel is located at the Westren end of the Inner Harbor, but a block and a half from the water front areas. Room service was fast and efficent, the hotel food was very good, above par on my filet mijon. There is a nice indoor pool, located  on the first level. Parking is a bit pricey at the hotel, but after all, this is the Inner Harbor district, everything comes for a price, particuarly convience.    The down side is if you are tall, their showers are too damn low if you are over six feet. The hallway noise with the maid service starts by 7 or 8 AM, not fun after arrivign at your hotel room in the wee hours of the morning. The cleanign staff was nice, and again, the room was very clean and modern. Their flat screen HD TVs really had awful reception for some unkown reason, but I could make out enough viisuals to get the jist of things. The rooms offer an ipod dock, which was nice...Queen size beds, no smoking policies, just a decent spot while in Baltimore on buisness or pleasure, or both. Nearby is the Poe grave site, besides the standard aquarium, et al..The hotel offers a very nice breakfast buffet, in a above average resturant. There is also a small convience store within the hotel, with fresh baked goodies. If you stay here, tell them I sent ya.I stayed here in August.  It was 100 degrees in Baltimore so that goodness they had air conditioning.I, too, ended up in the west wing.  Not my favorite walk but I just avoided the rest of the hotel the entire time.The rooms are a bit tired.  I looked out the window at the Marriott and wondered if I had made the right choice.  Hmmm.It was close to Camdem yards and the Convention Center so that was great.It was also a short walk to Inner Harbor and such.  I think if I go back I'd try the Marriott.I did try the room service and that was fine but my dishes sat outside my room for about 3 or 4 days.Not the best. There was a stain on the bed sheets &amp; when we walked in our room barefoot we noticed the bottom of our feet were BLACK.Very disappointed in their customer service.Otherwise known as the  Holiday Inn Inner Harbor, or the Holiday Inn Downtown - this is a short distance from the inner harbor (5 blocks) and maybe four to Camden Yard. Rooms are clean and well appointed although the maintenance could be kicked up another notch (wallpaper just starting to peel in the bathroom) - but it does look like they are trying to improve that. Staff is friendly and helpful. We were in a room on  firehouse side (opposite Camden yard side) - but fortunately they never got called last night. Highly recommend a higher floor for that reason and to get away from the street noise. Penthouse dining area does have great views of Baltimore, and the conference rooms are well appointed. Also, the breakfast is good in the hotel restaurant. Make sure to have your ""Holiday Inn"" priority card with you, you'll save money and get a better room for the same rate.Bottom Line: Good for convention goers to the convention center. Some better hotels closer to the inner harbor exist, but if they are all booked - this is an a-ok alternative.The hotel stay was fine, except for the noise from semis crossing over the train tracks outside.  My problem with this hotel is the extra $525 in charges that showed up on my debit card with no explanation.  Long story short, my company credit card was declined, so I had to use my debit card to check in (last resort) and my boss faxed her card info over the next day.  The staff assured me that the charges for the room would not show up on my debit card.  When I checked out, I got a receipt for the total amount showing it was charged to my boss's card, as promised.  After I flew home, I found out that $525 in pending charges was being held against my checking account from the Holiday Inn (this was on top of the amount charged to my boss's card).  When I finally got to talk to someone about it, there was no apology or explanation.  They just ""took care of it.""  There was absolutely no warning at check-in that this might happen and I still don't know why the pending charges were much more than the total cost of my stay.  I'm sure they probably have some policy about using debit cards, but it was not explained to me when I checked in, even when I clarified that I was using a debit card and stressed that I could not have the room charged to that card.  Will not stay there again.Great place! right in the heart of the city. Clean, cozy and has everything you need!If you're looking for a great place to stay that is reasonably price, I think this Holiday inn is it. The hotel a block away from oriole stadium, and a 5 minute drive to the harbor. This is probably one of the best holiday inn's I been too. I really like the pool, because the water is warm and it's right next to the gym. The food in their market is kinda expensive, but that didn't really surprise me. The room was also pretty nice, and our's comfortably fit 4 people.I chose this place due to it's close proximity to the Convention Center.  I did get a halfway decent rate of 174, then 127 and 127/night.  However it still did not seem worth it.First of all I had to run the shower for a good 10 minutes before I got hot water.  Then it became so hot is nearly scalded me.  On Saturday morning at about 8:30 a.m., I was awakened by men out on my balcany doing construction work.  Who the hell does this?The bed was almost comfortable, but the pillows were horribly overstuffed cheap foam pillows.  Therefore I got pretty poor sleep every night.  There was no in-room safe.The room was clean and in good condition and there was free wireless internet.  But was it worth over $500 for 3 nights stay?  I don't think so.  At least they are doing some updating on the outside of the building, but to do it on a weekend early morning is just plain inconsiderate.If it hadn't been a block from the convention center I would not have stayed.  Their rack rate was $246 a night for a double.  The pool needs serious rehab and painting - also concrete work because it is crumbling.  The fitness room needs to be cleaned - the equipment is a breeding ground of germs (which I believe is why I am sick currently) and they could use some updated cardio pieces.  Not a family friendly place - lots of drunk businessmen and it truly seemed like a few call girls in the elevator.  The housekeeping staff was very efficient though.Got a room on Priceline for a reasonable price.  Great location if you'll be at the Inner Harbor/Camden Yards...about a 5 block walk.  You can definitely book a room closer, but not for this price.  Room was clean and recently redone.  Bathroom was small, but the vanity was outside the door and very nice.  The only noticeable thing in the redone room was that the bathroom door was still a yucky old brown color.  We were on the firehouse side and weren't too bothered by it.  There's a great little convenience shop in the lobby to get a quick bite (bagels, yogurt, fruit, breakfast sandwiches, packaged snacks, and great coffee!)  I was pretty pleased with our stay.  Be advised, parking is not included in the room rate.  You can park int he adjacent lot for about $15 until midday the day after you check in.The most disgusting hotel that I have ever been to.  I came here for a conference with 10 other people, and we spent one of the worst weekends of our lives here.  After flying for over 7 hours to get to this place, the front desk informed us that they had only SMOKING rooms available for us despite our reservation for NON-SMOKING rooms.  The receptionist seemed bored and annoyed with us and did not offer any sort of compensation except a pathetic attempt to use an air purifier in the rooms for several hours and a promise of NON SMOKING rooms for the remainder of our stay.  So we waited for them to ""purify"" the air for about 4 hours.  We called the front desk again to ask for an air freshener but were greeted by an idiotic receptionist who clearly knew nothing about customer service or hospitality.  The air purifier and the lack of air fresheners failed in all ways and all of us suffered through a first terrifying stinky night.Called the manager first thing in the morning and arranged for the room switch.  The manager was very helpful and offered complimentary breakfast.  Still did not fully compensate for the suffering of the previous night but much better than the losers we dealt with the previous night.One of the girls woke up next night with bed bugs.  Another room switch.  And we are going onto our last (thank the lord) night.  Let's see what goes wrong this time!Never coming here again, or any Holiday Inn.P.S.  This place wasn't even cheap.My friends and I decided to make it a weekend after attending a conference at the convention center.  After the conference, we checked in and lounged around the room for awhile.  One friend climbed into the bed and found a dirty sock under the sheets!  She screamed and we immediately called the front desk.  They didn't seem very sympathetic, but after having to explain how disgusting that was they offered a room change.  We declined and stated we wanted to watch the sheets being changed (obviously they hadn't been changed the first time).  The housekeeping manager came up and was incredibly bubbly and apologetic.  She offered us free breakfast the next morning  - the buffet wasn't so great but the menu wasn't bad.  The rest of the stay was fine, with the exception of the fact that they charge for $1.50 for local calls.free breakfast for gold and platinum members, close to the convention center and good restaurants.Too expensive for what you get. The best part about the hotel is that it has a great location (close to the convention center, baseball field, etc). I'd give this one star if it wasn't for the location. Found a used condom in my room on the 1st night. Had to call the front desk each day to get the room cleaned. Hotel restaurant serves expensive horrible food. At least a hotel should serve good breakfast. Eggs were too dry, bacon had no taste, coffee tasted old and burnt, sausage was also very dry, waffles had no taste. Even a motel 6 gives you more for a much cheaper price.",,"['rooms', 'clean', 'comfortable', 'staff', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'booked', 'problems', 'reservation', 'location', 'best', 'part', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-baltimore-3,Hilton Garden Inn,4.0,$$,38,"The Hubs and I had a beautiful view of Baltimore from our 12th floor room. We were a short walk to our favorite spots in Fell's Point. So, location is good. The front desk staff couldn't have been friendlier. Rooms were clean and mostly comfy, except for the bed. The Hubs hated the bed.Self-parking is $20+ with no in &amp; out privileges. The beautiful large Starbucks located in the lobby is a big bonus for me.The HIlton Garden is located in the upscale, gentrified section of Baltimore, surrounded by hoity-toity shops and overpriced restaurants.  And this hotel maintains the standards of the surrounding area.  It is lovely, everyone is very friendly but a bit formal. There are warm cookies for the guests in the lobby at tea time.  The rooms are clean but very generic, and the hallways can be loud... you can hear every door slam as you are trying to fall asleep.  What I really liked about this place was the location... it is a easy walk to Fells Point and the Little Italy section of Baltimore, and it is very accessible to the Green Line City Bus.  Who knew that the bus system was FREE! Awesome!Hilton Garden Inn is located in the heart of the Inner Harbor and about 15 minutes away from the Greyhound bus terminal if using public transportation. The cab ride is roughly $14 with tips depending on traffic.Just a lovely and clean hotel with friendly staff and convenient to pretty much everything within the Inner Harbor. We had a beautiful view from our room and totally love their beds....super comfy...There is a bar/restaurant on the second floor in the hotel in case you want to grab a bite.However, keep in mind there are lots of restaurants walking distance, a movie theater and Starbuck next door as well. Highly recommended if planning to stay within the Inner Harbor.The service here is top notch. Everyone from the receptionist to the manager to the bel hop to the housekeepers were wonderfully friendly and accommodating! Rooms were great, amenities were awesome (don't sleep on the pool and gym!), and the food was great, too! A great location and a kid-friendly option, we would definitely stay here again!If this was just based on the staff and the location, it would be 5 stars. The staff were helpful and always very sweet yet professional. The 2 star loss is due entirely to 2 things. 1) The beds are awful. And not just for me. My husband and I have different tastes in beds but we both hated the bed. I kept needing to flip sleeping positions every 15 minutes because staying in the same position caused my back to seize up. This one is a first for us.2) We had free WiFi, which was great but while I have low standards for free WiFi, this network managed to lower my expectations even further. I figured it would be slow and spotty but the network would disappear every 5-7 minutes. Poof, gone, into the ether. We liked our time at the Hilton Garden inn, mainly due to the staff but would we stay at this one again? No, probably not.This hotel is in a great location in the Inner Harbor area. There are stores and restaurants even a movie theater right next door. It is about 1 block from the harbor. So for me this hotel was just okay. The front desk staff was pretty nice but when i arrived to check in there was no defined line so I saw a lady jump another just because there was no line or rope to create one. The same thing happened to me when I was checking out some lady just came from the side and jumped me and they continued to work with her instead of making her wait in line. So I love to swim and the pool is normally my main area but here is where I got annoyed. The pool is located where the gym is and because it is huge awesome gym it looks like a baby LA Fitness there are staff everywhere telling you what to do and what not to do. This is my vacation guys if I wanted rules and constraints I would go to work. The lady at the front desk of the gym was like you must sign in to swim because you have to go through the gym and that is a liability. I stay at tons of hotels I have never heard of signing a liability waiver to walk through a gym. They have to buzz you in and there is absolutely no sight seeing. One of the guys at the gyms front desk was like yelling at us ""where are you going! the pool is that way"" and I am like Your point would be. A lady told my father who was eith me to come to the conference room to get a cookie and he was trying to that but they act like they are at fort KnoxOnce we got to the pool area the guy managing that .area was like ""hi are you coming to swim"" we were like ""yes""  then he rattles  off all these does and odn'ts. about the temperatures of the pool, how long we have to swim, how we should be dressed to come to the pool, who can swim where, he got an attitude when we asked for clarification on the temperatures and got smart with my father because he was surprised about the temp of the hot tub talking about ""thats why its called a hot tub"" his tone was very wrong and I was offended. Would I recommend this hotel? Probably not the people are too up tights and they don't know how to talk to customers.I've stayed at a handful of hotels in the Baltimore area, and the Hilton Garden Inn has been my favorite so far. I travel for business frequently, so the free WiFi to keep my mobile office running is so very necessary and helpful. The room was clean, the bed comfy and the staff friendly. I was even greeted by a delicious granola bar cookie situation upon arrival. Yum!The location of this hotel is superb too - in the heart of Baltimore's charming Inner Harbor, near the freeway and in walking distance to solid dinner options. Did I mention there is a Haagen-Dazs and Starbucks in the same building? Perfection, I tell you. Perfection.Just a tip: The attached parking garage is not associated with the hotel, so you can't charge parking to your room. But the price to park isn't terrible - $14 for overnight.Awesome!  Great location, service, hospitality and room was ready for check in.  Highly recommend to anyone looking to enjoy the inner harbor.The hotel is fabulous. It has a nice view of the water and centrally located in Harbor East within walking distance of a lot of shops and dining options, not to mention only a 10 minute walk from the Inner Harbor itself. Room was clean, sleek, and very well kept. 12 stories with a view from every angle. We stayed on the 7th floor in 2 doubles bedroom. This hotel doesn't offer the HGI bed adjustment system in the beds like some HGIs do. Regardless the beds are comfy as is. They're not too firm and not too soft with a nice middle ground. IT comes with a small fridge and microwave next to the desk. The bathroom has french doors to it. I know see the practicality to that, but I guess it could offer a cute fix to the room. All in all a great stay. I would come here for sure.Stayed here for four days and three nights. The bed was super comfy, and room was very clean. A little smaller than I'm used to. I stayed on the top floor, 12th level and wish I would've had a better view. But I did have a view overlooking the garden terrace and city. The terrace is on the 8th floor with benches and a huge fountain. Condos are attached to the hotel, and share the terrace. The hotel staff made my checking in and out as painless as possible. Was disappointed that the hotel didn't have a spa thoughGreat location at a good price. Very clean. Staff was nice. Loves being able to walk to the restaurants or bars in the area. Great view from the hotel room. Would definetly recommend it.I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn - Inner Harbor for one night in July 2013.  The hotel is in a perfect location and within walking distance of all of the Inner Harbor attractions and Fell's Point.  The rooms are very modern, clean, and well-maintained.  There are many shops, restaurants, bars, and even a movie theater within walking distance too.  I would definitely stay here again if I find myself in the Baltimore area.  Tip: Ask for a room on a higher floor with views of the harbor!I recently stayed at this awesome hotel for a baseball weekend with my brother and we had a fantastic time.First off, my bro was the one who booked the room.  When we went to check in, I simply asked if they would honor the government rate while showing them my military ID.  I made sure to tell them I was not on official business so there would be no ethical infractions.  Even knowing this, the receptionist agreed to honor the government rate with a smile on her face.  That alone saved us over $200, which meant we had more beer money.  Hilton rocks, Baby!The location of this hotel is superb.  It is less than two miles from Camden Yards, which is an easy walk when you are bar hopping your way there.  Also, there is a movie theater right next door which gave us a good place to kill time before the Saturday afternoon game.The room was also spacious and spotlessly clean.  We were up on the 12th floor which provided an amazing view of the harbor.  I have no complaints about any aspect of our stay.  It was fantastic.This Hilton Garden Inn will always be my first choice for future Baltimore visits.If we go back to the Inner Harbor, I would definitely stay here again.  It was a short cab ride from Penn Station and a great location for the harbor.  We don't mind walking a lot because we're New Yorkers, so to me this was in walking distance of everything.  It's located about a lock off the water-we walked along the water to Fells Point, the water taxi and pier 5.  The front desk staff was helpful, friendly and efficient.  As were the housekeeping staff.  They are apparently attached to a sports club with a pool and Jacuzzi but we did not check that out.  The hotel was clean and quiet, the room was sufficient on the 12th floor and had a nice view of the roundabout, water and four seasons.  It's on the same block as a CVS, movie theater, whole foods, shops and next store is a starbucks.  It was an overall great experience.  I enjoy a place where I don't need anything and can rely on a comfortable nights sleep.  The Hilton does it again!Amazing location!Staff was friendly, accommodating, and informative. Room was clean and comfy, and couldn't hear any hallway noise except occasionally the room next to us slamming the door to their room. We were on the 11th floor above the Katyn Memorial Circle thing, but couldn't hear any street noise.Self parking can be a little tricky because it is a shared lot. We had a free breakfast from our HHonors benefits, but I would take the points next time instead. Cold items weren't great looking, tiny pastry collection, hot items seemed good but had been sitting out for a while. They do make fresh omelettes and such, but I didn't try.Overall it was a great room for the price and we had a wonderful staycation!Will definitely stay here again &amp; recommend to friends!DO NOT USE VALET WITHOUT TAKING PICTURES OF YOUR VEHICLE: I stayed here last weekend and the room was great. But the valet was another story. I dropped my car off the night I checked in and had them bring it around the next morning and they hit my side bumper on something. I noticed it as soon as they pulled my car around. The valet had me fill out a claim form and said they would take care of everything and that the reason they have insurance is for incidents like this. Yesterday I got an email saying they were denying my claim because there was no proof that they were at fault for any damages. I got an estimate and the damages are around $700 with a rental included. Why would I pay $230 to stay at their hotel to only make a false claim for $700? It's sad that employees won't admit to wrongdoing, but I'm sure they would get fired if they did damage a vehicle. I am never staying at this hotel again and I will be taking them to small claims court. I know it's only $700, I could pay out of pocket or go through my insurance company but it's just morally wrong, they will pay me for the damages they did. And it will end up costing them for than $700 in the end!!!Forget what Expose said years ago*, what you don't know CAN hurt you.The point being, if you didn't know about this great hotel, you could be staying in the wrong place in Baltimore.  This Hilton Garden Inn has it all...it's clean, quiet and has a great staff.  The location is great!  It's a bit of a walk (maybe 20 minutes) to the ballpark but Harbor Place and Aquarium are very close and you can also easily walk to Fells Point and Little Italy.The best thing is that you get use of the Maryland Athletic Club if you stay here and that's a really nice facility.  During my recent stay, I visited frequently to keep my awesome physique in top notch form!Big fan of this place.__________________________________________*Awesome video <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FO4ViqQkpcqE&amp;s=8ec7548eeb614f5329f5f49b0e068459543028ac949d3be8a62bef7cc2e50d0c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">youtu.be/O4ViqQkpcqE</a>Excellent experience.  The front desk staff were cheerful, efficient and remembered us in the morning (enough to wish us well on the next leg of our journey).  The room was attractive, modern and well appointed.  The air conditioning was not working properly but as we were too tired to request assistance, I'm not sure if they would have been able to fix it for us.  We were on the top floor and our room was very, very quiet.Breakfast was wonderful--fresh and delicious with a lot of choices.  We took an after breakfast walk around the harbor and it was nice to be so close to the water.For a ""discount"" hotel in Baltimore, ran me over $200 weekend, with taxes, so I can't give 5 stars. Also, valet parking is pricey at $35 a night. But the place has new car smell and everything works great. Staff was very accomodating from the moment I checked in until I left. The breakfast buffet had a lot of choices and ran only $13 with tip. The best part though, is that you gain free access to a huge gym that is connected to the hotel - you dont need to step outside. The gym opens at 5 AM and has everything you would ever need. Awesome! Coming back again in January 14 and can't wait...The suite was very clean and contained an incredibly comfortable king size bed that didn't shake, jiggle and wake up the other person every time someone moved. In addition, the sheets were crisp and fresh. The room was in good shape, no worn rugs, wall scuffs and peeling wallpaper. We were located on the eighth floor next to a large courtyard that is quite attractive. Initially we were worried about having so much window area next to a courtyard would not be advantageous, but, no one was peering in and, of course there are sheers and blackout curtains. The hotel noise level was relatively quiet especially considering that we stayed on New Years Eve. (The hotel did make people sign a pledge to no partying and maybe that worked. Or maybe our room was isolated enough to avoid the cacophony of slamming doors and loud voices.)The hotel is in a great location with a many points of interest within walking distance. The lobby is nice looking but the seating is a bit worn and stained, (though in working order). Finally, all staff that we encountered were very friendly and courteous.","I stayed here on my recent business trip to Baltimore and it was the best hotel I've stayed at in recent months. Great location, walking distance to the few cool spots in town, and the room was just what I needed. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J9ARGRc_SDTuL1qyRcwzBg?select=ObaV0jaHIu8pVVV3ehrpbQ"">yelp.com/biz_photos/J9AR...</a>TV - Finally an HDTV with HD programmingBed - Above averagePillows - Various levels of fluffiness were provided, not sure it that was intentional Bathroom - Served its purposeView - Another hotelInternet - Not needed as Baltimore has great 4g that I tethered with my phone (15MB down)On Site Food - Not tested<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J9ARGRc_SDTuL1qyRcwzBg?select=-twNvmst3Janxgy0-4HqHw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/J9AR...</a>If you can get over the heat, humidity, crime, tourists, tiny blue crabs, and all the rest of Baltimore's failings, it's a great city to visit!My home away from home! First off Baltimore is the best kept secret in it's waterfront property,little neighborhoods like Fell's Point, Little Italy and Inner Harbor make for a romantic feel the grittyness of the city.I've stayed at this location on several occassions and loved it everytime.Convienience of nearby restaurants like Roy's, just a hop away from the Baltimore Aquarium and PowerPlant LIVE for the party animals.The Baltimore Charm Orange line bus line runs ouside the door.You can get a FREE ride to adjacent lines (also FREE)along with nearby bars and hot spots.Also, directly next door is a Starbucks and Movie Theater.Looking for a place to work out? You get a FREE pass to the upscale MAC gym.There is two sides to this hotel.Garden Inn, and the more spacious Homewood Suites.The Garden Inn is the sister to big brother Homewood Suites but in a good way.Each view I have had has been amazing! Front desk staff  are professional and check-in is speedy.Downside is paying for parking UGH!!!,but at least parking is in a lot that has ample parking and is monitored.As far as ameneties go, it's up to date decor that is calm and relaxing.The bed is awesome (wink wink), Sheets are crisp and pillow are perfect.HDTV (not that you will need it) ,showerhead has three setting with great pressure.Room size is small compared to the Homewood Suites, but there is so much to do here you won't notice.Best part overall is the breakfast! The Great American Grill, takes up the whole  second floor,overlooking the front of President's Street with a beautiful view.Made to order breakfast is the best.My typical egg white omlette and a variety of fruits,cereal and meat makes me want to stay another night.Price is great for location, even better with my Military discount.Just make sure you book ahead some weekends I have had to stay elsewhere.Also, make sure you check-in at exactly 3, or you risk being downgraded from your queen sized bed.I stay here everytime I am in town for work, mainly because my office is in the same building, and I get to wake up, get ready, and walk through a parking garage and voila, I am at the office. Convenient or not, this hotel is superb for many reasons, which I will share with you:1. Location - awesome. Harbor East is a booming new area in downtown, and there are a lot of new shops and restaurants with in seconds of the hotel. Little Italy is also right down the street...go to Amici's...you will thank me. Whole Foods is also around the corner, which is great if you are in town for awhile and want some food in your room. There is also a wine shop next to WF, and they sell beer and wine. Fells Point is also in walking distance, and they have great bars. Overall, if you are looking for fancy, casual, expensive, midlevel, cheap....all of the above in restaurants and bars are in walking distance.2. The warm cookies at check in. 3. The beds. High quality mattresses, pillows, and linens that will ensure a great night sleep.4. Fridge and microwave in room. 5. Room Service - very good food.6. Gym - you have access to the MAC, which is a huge full service gym. I cannot comment on price, as the bill is on my company everytime I stay, but I think it is comparable to all other hotels in the area, and the quality here is above most, especially for the great location.Location is great.  Right on Presidents street on waterfront and a walk away from most everything else.  Bed was very comfortable.  Temperature needed initial adjustment, them remained comfortable my next 4 days there.  There is a small fridge and microwave.  There is a Whole Foods Market and wine stop 1 block away.  There is a Starbucks and cinema right next door and an irish pub across the street.Flat screen TV was fine, but to find a channel and watch a show you have to go through a cumbersome 4-5 step menu every time you turn on the TV.  Small business center with printers and other office supplies available and free of charge.The hotel is connected to a MAC gym.  Blows any other gym i've been to out of the water.  Next time i go to Baltimore, will definitely go here for my stay.An extra star, or two, lost to poor service.  My significant otter phoned the desk to request foam pillows (side rant: feather pillows are completely useless! why must all hotels, inns, etc. default to these?! they may as well not provide pillows 'cause the feather kind are equivalent to sleeping without.) at 5 pm as we left our room. He informed them we would be out and the pillows could be left in our room. Upon return, around 11 pm, we discover one of our original pillows was missing. WTH went wrong? How do you get to the guest room, presumably carrying two foam pillows, forget to leave pillows and instead remove a pillow from the room? The otter, tired and not amused, called the desk only to have the phone ring, and ring, and ring. He finally gets an automated voice system and waits and waits. He eventually speaks w/someone and informs them of the situation and they say they'll correct the situation immediately. At least 10 minutes later (granted it was a long walk from the elevator to our room - the hall reminded us both of The Shining), someone arrives with two feather pillows. The otter was angry but tired and for the time defeated by feathers. Several minutes later there's a knock on our door. The otter goes to answer it and I remind him he's not wearing pants. Pants wearing otter opens the door to discover the same staff person with two foam pillows. As the staff member begins to ask for the return of the incorrect pillows, the otter shuts the door. I've never seen the otter get that upset. It's the little things that really do matter.Not sure why Anna chose a Hilton Garden Inn for a romantic weekend...  This place is nice and new and clean.  All things I love in a hotel I frequent.The front desk staff is friendly, but a little slow to greet.  But I'll let it slide.  I didn't have to wait long...The rooms are comfortable.  Bed is great.  Pillows are not those stiff hotel pillows.  Desk is good for working and eating.The neighborhood is nice.  Not like it used to be...  Great to have a Whole Foods around the corner, along with some convenient restaurants to walk to.  And just a short walk to Inner Harbor and the ball field.You get access to the gym in the building- like a regular gym, not a hotel gym.  It's nice.  A little crowded after work, considering they have poenty of open space they could put more equipment into.  But it's good.  It is only open until 6 on Sunday, which was a bummer.  I had nothing to do when I got there, and would have worked out...Room service menu was pretty limited, and unappealing, so I decided not to order any.  Breakfast buffet is standard, and does the job.  I'll come back here...Great location in swanky Harbor East, an easy walk to the Inner Harbor in one direction and Fells Point in the other, and super close to all the great food in Little Italy. One star was knocked off for the weird bathroom double-doors with the big gap in the middle, and because I wish it had a free breakfast.Right off the bat, I was inforned that the king bed room I booked was not available, and offered two breakfast vouchers for a room with two double beds. Not quite ideal for the romantic weekend trip my husband and I were planning.When we got to our room, it was sweltering! The room temperature was 79!! The coldest the thermostat goes is 65, with no air conditioning function. After returning to our room, the temp was bumped up to 81. Not exactly the most comfortable for a 45 degree day. I was shocked the room service, and restaurant closed at 9pm. Not exactly convenient, as the ""vending"" machines on each floor are only equipped with an ice machine.The beds were pretty comfy, and I appreciate Neutrogena toiletries, so it wasn't a total bust, but I believe I'll be looking elsewhere to stay next time in Baltimore.As a traveler, I'm a fan of HGI in general; Hilton seems to do a much better job with both the property and the service than their head to head competition, like Courtyard Marriott.This is also a favorite of mine due to the location right on the Harbor and one of my favorite restaurants (Roy's) right across the street. Also, the property did a good job for us with a small meeting and lunches, etc.**4.5** My bed fetish has always been true to The Westin's ""Sweet Sleeper"" but must admit that the beds here were almost comparable which is what bumped them up from 4 to 4.5 stars. Located in a newly renovated (or so it seems) area of Baltimore, I felt safe walking near the hotel. Around the corner you'll find a Whole Foods and a variety of upscale shopping and restaurants (including my favorite, Roy's). The whole area was just beautiful! The food featured all of the upscale necessities one would need while staying at a hotel. We had trouble with our AC and the tech came up within five minutes and had it fixed in a jiffy. Even the small view of the harbor was beautiful. And of course my favorite... Black out curtains. Some other points were the convenient store which boasted a few odds and ends. Moderately priced so you didn't feel ripped off. Parking was also fairly inexpensive although it was a pain in the ass to get in and out of the garage because our card would ALWAYS get demagnetized. The staff was friendly although they could brush up on their knowledge of good places to dine. They were quite ignorant. Overall a great stay. It's so well located and in such a quiet location I can't wait to go back!!Great location, very nice rooms and close to everything.  You can walk to the harbor, little Italy, and many great restaurants and bars.  James Joyce is a great Irish bar/restaurant and it's right across the street.  You will not be disappointed!This was only the second HGI that I've stayed in and it was head and shoulders above the quality and service I experienced at the other HGI location (Washington DC). The staff were friendly, competent, and attentive; and on par with the kind of service I've received at hotels with more stars and higher rates. The room I was in was relatively new, felt modern, clean, and quiet. The location is close to the waterfront, Little Italy, a CVS, and a Whole Foods -- very convenient. A Starbucks and movie theater are right next door. Also, since I was on a business trip I greatly appreciated the free hotel wifi which provided excellent and consistent connection. The only glitch I encountered was trying to print docs remotely to the hotel's business center, which didn't seem to work (wouldn't release my docs). I didn't eat at the hotel and didn't use the connected Maryland Athletic Center gym, but heard from other guests that it had a lot of equipment. Highly recommend this HGI location as it provided good value for the room rate.Ohmigod!  The beds here were WONDERFUL!  Loved my bed!  Loved the duvet!  Loved the pillows!  Soooooo comfy!  I may have slept better there than at home.The room is nice - modern and sleek.  Flat screen TV on the wall.  Mini-fridge and microwave.  Decent size bathroom.  Decent towels.  Neutrogena bath products.Had a conference at the Marriott Waterfront - it sold out before we could get a room there.  I thought it might be a pain staying here, but it was actually maybe even better.  Super close.  Very close to the Inner Harbor, Little Italy and Fell's Point.  I thought the price was a little steep (~$180 + tax) so I was happy I wasn't paying.  Maybe that's going rate around the area, but it's more than I'd usually pay, even for a place like this.Great location! Great price! Beautiful rooms with views and amazing amenities! There's a really good theater attached to hotel and surrounded by restaurants only problem we had with was this yellow pipe attached to a sewer grate that stunk up the entire block we stayed there Feb. 12-14 but besides the great place.Overall I was very pleased with the hotel.  The beds, were very comfortable.  I stayed five nights and slept very well. The hotel doesn't have its own gym facilities, but they give you a guest pass for the MAC club attached - there is a dedicated entrance from the second floor of the hotel.  The fitness facilities alone will make me come back here whenever I need to come to Baltimore.Breakfast is very good; better than most other 3 star hotels.  Watch out though, it costs $11.The main complaints I have were:*Price - I paid between $189-219 per night which seemed highish.*Lack of comedy central on TV (but they do have new flatscreen HDs with local HD channels*Towels smelled like maple syrup or molasses... weird.The hotel was immaculate. The room was new and modern. Tried to grab a late lunch at resturant and they would have tried to accomodate us but we went across street to Irish pub (great btw). The gym is awesome!! Indoor pool that my kids loved! Note gym closed early on Sat nite like 6??!! But seriouly the gym facility is really great. Passed by a pretty intense spin class in progressOur second night here. When arrived yesterday, were told we couldn't get our room at Homewood Suites as reserved. Instead got 2 double beds in a Hilton Garden room.  Small room and bathroom. Screen on window is so dirty it might as well be a wall. Kleenex box was wet like it had been dipped in a sink of water. Left the room at 10:30am and got back at 8:00pm. The room hadn't been serviced. This is the worst experience we've had as Hilton Honors members.really wonderful location!  if you are here to visit the inner harbor and the tourist spots in baltimore this is the best central location. short walks to all of the neighborhoods.  the hotel is clean and the staff are very nice.  there are multiple stores, shops and restaurants near by.  next door to starbucks, ice cream and a movie theater!  what more can you ask for.",,,,"['hubs', 'beautiful', 'view', '12th', 'floor', 'room', 'short', 'walk', 'favorite', 'spots', 'fell', 'point', 'location', 'good', 'front', 'desk',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/admiral-fell-inn-an-ascend-hotel-collection-member-baltimore,"Admiral Fell Inn, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3.5,$$,61,"We stayed here over Labor Day Weekend. We loved our stay and would definitely book here again. All of the staff were great, and dog friendly! Staff even greeted my dog. We did the rooftop ""tour"" and the guide was very informative, pointed out historical sites and gave us dinner recommendations. No problems bringing the dog at all! Room was big, cutely decorated, and had large windows. The hotel is centrally located and is walking distance to shops, restaurants, and the waterfront.The hotel was very clean, and nicely decorated. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The reason it get 2 stars is the extremely uncomfortable bed, the noise from outside and the drains were all clogged. If you want to sleep bring ear pluggs, which the staff was nice enugh to bring me. This area is very active way into the night, and all noise gets into the room.1* for the hotel bar ""Tavern at Admiral Fells Inn"" beneath the building (Broadway side entrance) and open W-Sa (Su ?)Walk inn to Tavern and a wave of 6hr old fish flaps into your nose. Pinch it off and waltz up to the abnormally well-lit bar that's decorated like it's still Christmas 1978. Asked the bartender for the cocktail list and..""Eh, what do you want?"" A diamondback. ""What's that?"" Uh.. rye, chartreuse.. ""I don't have chartreuse."" Ok, how about a brown derby?""What's that?"" Uh.. It has grapefruit. One moment..""I have grapefruit""I fumble for my phone, already planning my exit as I look up a brown derby recipe for him. My eyes float past <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmixology.com&amp;s=f041ce5210d43784937c9ad5c7ddd431bc96e759498e10abefe653718a7d7654"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">mixology.com</a> as it loads and down to the chartreuse green rugs. Why don't they have the liquor?Fuck this. ""Hey man, gonna go somewhere else instead"" and I walked out. Tavern recommendations came from a few local bartenders, so my visit must've been a wrong-time thing. I'll be back on a non-Thursday night.This review is strictly for the hotel bar, the Tavern at the Admiral... since they don't have their own yelp page I need to get this off my chest here.Nowhere in the entire city of Baltimore is it ok to charge anyone, locals or tourists, $7 for a bottle of Natty Boh... I could have gone to literally ANY other bar in the city and got a Boh for $2... $3 max! This is the cheap ""local"" beer that is known for being CHEAP and this place is taking advantage of tourists not knowing any better (and locals like me who never thought this was possible). So... TOURISTS BEWARE! Try a Boh elsewhere... maybe avoid this bar all together, I can't imagine how much a GOOD local craft brew is priced here... Also, the only reason I ordered a Boh is because I did't want to spend $10 on a cocktail... if I only knew then what I know now. And the bartender was not friendly or understanding about it either, we confronted him about it because we thought there had been a mistake... but no no, that was the price! Very unfortunate. I felt robbed, I will not be back.I booked this room through groupon for $99 a king bed, reservation was a breeze you are able to upgrade  for an additonal fee.  When we arrived at the hotel I was greeted by Emily at the front desk who was extremly nice,upgrading at the desk was breeze, the room was clean, balcony very enjoyable  especially with the nice weather on that day, hotel staff attended to every need in a timely matter.  Paking Valet is $30.00 a day, their are nearby parking garages with paking $23.00 a day after 5pm $9.00It's too bad you have to give a star to write a review because this hotel does not deserve a star at all.  Actually, that's not true, the only reason they deserve a star is that they cater to patients and families that are receiving care at Johns Hopkins which is admirable. The stay started with a hotel room that was painted so pink it looked like pepto bismal.  We also only had two hangers as well as only two open plugs for 5 electronic devices. After the first day we came back to find that our towels had been exchanged but they were exchanged for dirty towels, gross!!  Thankfully housekeeping quickly brought us new towels. As I was placing the towels on the towel rack I looked up and realized there was hair all over two walls in the bathroom above eye level. There is also mold in the bathroom tiles. The hotel staff are nice enough but come the third day of our stay in the middle of what felt like a monsoon, we had to call for a shuttle to pick us up from Johns Hopkins 6 times and had to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes to be picked up. Every time we called they said 10 more min. It wasn't until the 6th time when we were completely fed up that the lady at the front desk said we could take a cab and they would reimburse us, would have been nice to know earlier!We are here with a group from work and there are three rooms of us.  Each one of us has had to deal with the incredibly loud outside noise, whether it's people cl screaming and fighting on the streets after the bars let out or the loud talking that you can hear from the halls. One of the nights two men knocked on our co-workers door, if that doesn't make you feel unsafe, I don't know what would. Two of their rooms had holes for what looked like a fridge but there was no fridge, not sure if it was stolen or in the shop for repair!  I was here on business and I travel a decent amount for work and pleasure and I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.We just had our wedding at the Admiral Fell on May 30, 2015.  All I can say is that the entire event was such a massive success and all employees/staff of this hotel did a fantastic job.  Mario, the General Manager is without quest, the best in the business.  Not only did he treat us with the utmost respect, but did the same with every guest at that hotel.  Any request was met without confrontation, any question was answered immediately, and any concern was addressed instantly.He also has a staff member, Donna, who was equally amazing.  Every time we turned around, she had a drink ready for us, was there to lend a helping hand however she saw fit, and was just an absolute gem.  She was there to help my wife with her dress and walking to and from the pier (where the ceremony took place,)  to the cake cutting, drink preparation, and literally anything in between.If I could have given this place more than 5 stars, it would have gotten them.  Highly recommend, and hats off to Mario, Donna, and the rest of the Admiral Fell staff.  Cheers for making our big day a day that we will never forget.So I was a little nervous when I realized how old this hotel is. I like when my expectations are exceeded. Hotel staff is great. Location is great. My room was huge. The bed was an older king sized bed,but was comfortable. If you wanted to nit pick details you could. I understand the theme of the hotel and accepted things not to be 100%. There was free WiFi, free coffee in the lobby, and the decor was awesome. Being in Fed hill everything is right there. We plan on staying again maybe in the spring so we can check out the rest of the area. Overall, I was satisfied with everything.I have been on two separate occasions, as a plus one to a friend's work party. I liked it. The rooms are cute - large bed, comfy pillows although I only got ready in the room, didn't stay the night - each room has a famous name attached to the door, the ""Poe"" room for example. Nice size rooms. Clean. Very nice overall.Haven't gone down to the tavern, so I cannot speak on that, but I know its expensive and quite frankly I'm not sure why... maybe just because its Fells??I have gone up to the 5th floor, where parties and gatherings are held and it was nice up there. Nice view of the water. Open bar was nice, but I'm sure not always the case, and i hear it can be expensive, around $150 per plate when there are banquets, but not completely sure about that. Bartenders and staff were great, food was ok...nothing to write home about in my opinion. Although they did have these wonderful crab puffs that I adored... about 5 times over. Delicious!The staff at the greeting desk are very nice. The room was clean no problems there. Bed was king size and comfy. The room was small and good for 1 or 2 people only. The room was a little musty, bring some febreze. The air conditioner worked perfectly. We had rm 233, was great,especcially, if can sleep through loud noise. I was up like a zombie. But we were there for the 4th, I don't know if it's noisy in that area all the time. If you're a drunk, this place is excellent for you. Bars were north, south, East and west. The hotel and the whole fell's area is dog friendly. All in all the hotel was cool and the room was clean, it is located in a great spot for bar lovers. We ate and drank on the haborside, we took the water taxi $14 for the whole day. We didn't go to their bar or $15 buffet in the basement..  They had a greeting card in the room with a complimentary bottle of wine, lol the greeting card had the wrong name on it, but thanks for the free wine!We had a wedding at the Admiral Fell Inn and everything was very good. The Hotel GM, Mario, was amazing. He did everything possible to make things happen--from overseeing the rehearsal at the Bond Street Pier and the reception at the inn, to making drinks and helping to deliver dinners along with his staff . He is one of the best and 'hands on' GMs I have come across. The wedding venue is perfect for 120 people or less, with a nice balcony and harbor views for pre-dinner cocktails. The Bridal Suite is charming. Thank you, Mario and your professional staff, for making the day so special. I would definitely recommend the inn for a wedding.GREAT PLACE! GREAT LOCATION! WONDERFUL STAFF!PostedJuly 21, 2015Stayed there for art scape weekend. 5 min drive to any where in downtown area. Love that it sits in fells point district next to all the fun spots. Was able to party at local bars and fall right in to our wonderful room with a view at the Admril Fell Inn. No cab needed.Very clean and extremely friendly staff was very helpful in making our stay even better.Mario was great. Will defiantly be back.Just stayed in this hotel last night. It is a beautiful old historical bldg conveniently located at the shore, near all kinds of shops, restaurants and bars. All within walking distance.  If you want to do a pub crawl with some friends, and don't want to drive, definitely stay here.  Otherwise than that, I really felt that I did not get a great value for my money. I paid $129 for my room (2 double beds), and with the taxes I as looking at $158. And then I had to pay $24 to park my car overnight! They do not have their own private lot! And no free breakfast! Continental breakfast was offered for $9.95. Believe me they could have sprung for a muffin or two! Geez....My room was opposite the elevator, so I heard it ring every once in a while. Not a big deal, but another visitor next door created a racket starting at like 4:30 AM. How rude! Beds were comfy, room was clean. Kind of a strange furniture setup.  Had a floral wingback in a corner, and a black recliner that was butted up against the bed. The chairs didn't match and they did not make sense for TV viewing with the flat screen housed in a TV armoire across the room. The cabinet that should have housed the fridge and the microwave had a big empty spot since there was no microwave, and the front of the mini fridge was scratched and dented.  We pushed the desk chair to the side, and that was beat too. Arms were frayed.  Coffee machine in room, but only enough condiments for 1 cup. And only 1 bottle of water left for a 2-4 person room. A second one would have been nice because the tap water did not taste good at all. A bottle of water costs about 19 cents. Shower was nice and hot but no water pressure and the tub dripped all night. Bathroom setup was junkyard.  Open, rough hewn plywood shelves very roughly painted, and a old curtain covering an ironing board. Weird! There was magic marker on the sheets on one of the beds.  All in all, too much money for what we received.The staff is courteous, knowledgeable, and they care. We are lifelong fans of this establishment, and Mario is the man!I - and the rest of my party - came away pretty disappointed with the Admiral Fell Inn.  Here's what we experienced:* Parking is a nightmare.  While that was obviously not the fault of the hotel, it was incredibly frustrating not to have an easy to see spot to pull up to use the valet parking.  The person who looks like they're the valet parking for the hotel ended up being one for the restaurant next door.  In order to get the valet for the hotel, you had to park and then go inside - which is highly problematic if there are no spots in front of it.  Having someone outside the hotel would have made it much less stressful.* With seven of us coming into Baltimore for a bachelorette party, the maid of honor had booked two rooms with two beds in each so we could easily accommodate everyone.  When we got to the rooms, we were shocked to find that both of them had one bed each - how on earth were we supposed to sleep all of us?  We immediately trekked back downstairs and the concierge realized that the person who took the reservations over the phone made a huge mistake.  With the hotel completely booked, he offered to have us potentially move to a sister hotel - that was out of the question as we had an hour to get ready for dinner reservations.We asked about cots and he agreed to give us two cots, one for each room, and when we asked if it would be free of charge - considering it was the hotel's fault we needed them - he immediately said yes.Fast forward to the next morning at check-out.  Not only was there vast confusion with the concierge about cards to charge for the valet parking (more on that in a bit), it turned out they were trying to charge us for the cots!  Upon seeing this, we immediately had an issue with it and it took at least 20 minutes before they finally relented.  It was outrageous - they were trying to say that they had ""upgraded"" us to the rooms with the larger, one bed; without, of course, our permission.  They finally, grudgingly, credited us for the cots.* Housekeeping was knocking on all the doors at 9 a.m. sharp - we had the do not disturb sign up.* Regarding the valet parking: we had three cars parked through the valet parking.  On Saturday, as we checked in, we had given several different credit cards (we didn't want the cars to all go to the person who made the reservation) and were told it was no issue.  It took the guy behind the counter nearly 20 minutes of explaining and going back and forth that, no, it was NOT going to be charged to the card on file; that we had given the guy the previous day instructions and cards; and yes, this needed to be done correctly so as not to force one person to pay over $80 in parking fees.* The walls are apparently made out of rice paper - I could plainly hear things coming from the rooms around, below and above us.The hotel itself is pretty nice.  You can't beat how walkable it is to all the bars, restaurants and the rest of Fells Point and the bar staff downstairs was fantastic but, honestly, there's got to be better hotels in the area.  It's not worth the parking stress or the inability of the staff to get it together.  It was the one sour note to an amazing weekend.What a shame... had high expectations for this old historic hotel however keys have not worked since we've gotten here staff is friendly but light.  We only had a two night stay and there is really nothing to boast about I would've much rather stayed at the Pier 5 or anywhere else.Fell's Point is like Bourbon Street all grown up and clean! And the Admiral Fell Inn is the place where the grown ups stay in that Harbor area.If you must stay where the tourists are packed in and kids run crazy please stay over on the other side of the Harbor. If you want a quaint, boutique hotel with fantastic service and the best crab cakes &amp; most interesting bars within walking distance, stay here. Our airline got our luggage on the wrong flight and the car service at the airport was late and we were ready to just get checked in and figure out how to salvage our vacation if we never saw our luggage again. When we told Hakeem at the desk of our adventures so far he put us in what everyone tells us is the coolest room in the place - room 487. Ask for it if you can. You have windows on 3 sides, LOTS of room to relax and privacy since the room is on the end of the hall. We liked the place from there on out. If you think the rooms are gonna be small because it's an old hotel, they are not. Katherine has the largest suitcase in the history of suitcases and we have had to walk over it at some other historical hotels on our travels. We had plenty of room for her to open it up on the floor here.They made reservations for us at local restaurants, got car and shuttle services to them and other places the water taxi didn't go and stored our luggage after a noon check out so we could continue to enjoy the area. No one on the staff was less than fantastic! The water taxi is directly across the street and will take you to about anywhere in the Harbor. Don't bother with the free ghost tour of the hotel unless you just want the free drink afterward. There's not much information and few ghost stories involved in it really. You just kinda walk around the hotel.Yes it's even close enough to enjoy Camden Yards or the Ravens' games if you don't mind a short cab ride.Why 4 and not 5 stars? I asked twice for regular coffee for the in room coffee maker and was told they were out. In 5 days they couldn't get regular coffee for the rooms? Really? They do have coffee and muffins in the lobby in the mornings. But if you just want to roll out and stay in your jammies and have a cup...well, you'd be out of luck unless you drink decaf.While we were in Baltimore the weather changed from 90 degrees to 50 (even chillier at night). We walked into a very cold room the afternoon the front came through. We were told they were having the heat ""changed over"" from AC and it would be fixed in a while. So we went to eat and have a few beers. A few beers and Monday Nigh Football later we came back to a colder room. They did move us to another room - the honeymoon suite - with a gas fireplace. But it took forever to get that to a temp where we could sleep comfortably. A local woman we ran into told us the Inn has a reputation of not having decent heat.Look, I know those are picky things but heat in a hotel is kinda important and regular coffee doesn't seem like a special order.We'll stay here everytime and would tell friends it's the only place to stay in the Baltimore area.

It'll save you enough to enjoy the fantastic crab cakes a few times at Duda's down the street.This place is great. Especially the bar - Steve and christian took great care of us. Amazong drinks and awesome service. This is my second time staying at the AFI. The only downfall was that I could not watch the ball game when Baltimore was doing so well!I have mixed feelings about this hotel. The location is perfect for a weekend getaway in Fells Point. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean. And the price was reasonable. But the rooms leave a bit to be desired. Bathrooms could use an upgrade. The unique beds in each room certainly weren't traditional. Our room had beds that were nearly bunk height. I had to ask for towels each day bc we only got one in the room. I'd stay here again especially because of the location, but I'd balance expectations.Great historical hotel!!! Staff were super friendly and very helpful!! Amazing that its really pet friendly - our daughters cat was very comfy for the three days we were there. Its right in the thick of all the action so it is a bit noisy sometimes - but it was built in the 1700's and is really authentic, which means no double paned windows:-)  I thought the breakfast was a bit basic for the $10 they charge, but there are other great options close by. They provide valet parking that is also a bit pricey, but no more expensive than most of the other hotels close by.  I look forward to staying here again at the earliest possibility!!","I stayed here for one night. It's in a great location relative to dining and drinking, is a quick cab ride or a twenty/twenty-five minute walk to downtown. Another review here talked negatively about a Pepto-Bismol pink room - I stayed in one with a very pink bathroom and very pink bedroom accents and loved that it had such a vibrant color. It was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the staff were helpful and friendly. I think it's a bit expensive for what you get, but I did have a very short stay.Nice historic hotel. Clean rooms although there's no grab bars or anything if someone would need assistance. LOVE the stairs to get up into the bed! The bartender was awesome but his manager left a lot to be desired. I ordered a dink and was told by the manager that it was a shot so I ordered something else. My friend ordered the the drink from the bartender and it was not a shot, but the drink I had expected originally. We're still excited to continue our stay, more shopping, Irish music for breakfast, and more celebrating to come.We stayed at the Admiral Fell Inn with a group of friends this weekend.My fiance and I were pleased to learn that this is a dog-friendly hotel, so we brought ours along. Upon check in they gave us a gift bag for our pup (treats and a toy) which was very thoughtful. Although we are 'dog people' we didn't want to stay in a hotel that felt like dogs were there - we are happy to report that our room (and the hotel) was very clean and odor free - you'd never know if any pets had stayed there.They also gave us a bottle of wine upon check in and vouchers for breakfast, which was really nice; omelet station, pastries, fresh fruit, coffee, etc.The staff at breakfast were also very courteous and polite, I was impressed that they took our name when we ordered our omelet and brought it to our table.The hotel is in the perfect location, a quick walk to all of the restaurants, bars and shops that we wanted to check out. Though it is a little loud at night, that's a trade off  when you are staying in the 'heart' of the activity, and in my opinion completely worth it.All of the staff were extremely polite and helpful. Definitely check out the bar downstairs, the bartender that was working on Saturday night was a really nice guy and told us some of the ghost stories and history of the hotel.We are planning on taking another trip to Fells Point when the weather is warmer and plan on returning to the Admiral Fell Inn.Quite possibly the WORST night I've ever had in a hotel!  Room 219 just above nightclub..impossible to sleep!  Room vibrated from the music..cars honking all night &amp; loudstreet noise just below my window.  Tried to change rooms completely sold out.  Sunday early am street cleaners going up &amp;down!Superb location in a historic hotel if you are a single traveller or couple without kids.  This part of Fells Point is right across from the Water Taxi port and a short walk from Pitango Gelato.  I was here in late October for a conference and stayed in Room 118 (first floor).  The check-in process and valet parking ($24 per night) at 9pm were fast and professional.  It's worth requesting the free MAC fitness center pass when you check-in to save time. The gym is about a 15 minute walk away in the Harbor East neighborhood (located in the same building as the Homewood Suites, about a block from the Whole Foods).  PROS:  The high ceilings, splash of pink, and Federalist-style furniture were nice. The free Wi-FI was also a big plus.  The location and convenience of valet parking were also great (if you don't mind the $24 charge, otherwise there's a DIY lot for $14). The conference meeting space on the 5th floor with its view of downtown Baltimore was spectacular and convenient for guests staying at the hotel. CONS:  Room 118 had a faint mechanical noise (elevator?) that ran in the evening, but stopped by midnight.  Having a closet in the bathroom was a bit strange.  Walking 15 minutes to get to an indoor gym (MAC) or the CVS/Whole Foods in Harbor East was inconvenient.  Check-out was slow because Hakeem had disappeared for 10 minutes ""to pickup lunch at his home"".  Leaving the front desk on a Saturday without requesting backup is unprofessional.  BOTTOM LINE:  If you have kids, I would strongly recommend the Homewood Suites at Harbor East instead - which is closer to the Aquarium.  If you prefer historic inns, the Admiral Fell Inn is your place.If you want a clean, comfortable hotel or a good night of sleep, don't stay here. Many of the other reviewers complained of the noise from the street outside, but we were on the back side of the hotel and did not experience that. However, the walls of the hotel are paper thin and we could hear everything going on in the hallway and the nearby rooms clearly. We are very heavy sleepers and can sleep through nearly everything, but noisy people in the halls talking and shouting loudly and slamming doors woke us up many times in the night. When we complained, they apologized and were very nice but did nothing. To make matters worse, the room was dingy and had seen better days. It was also freezing cold with a draft from outside so strong that it moved the curtains, but if we turned on the heat the room got suffocatingly hot. There was no ability to heat the room to a normal temperature, nor was there a comforter on the bed -- just sort of a thin decorative coverlet or maybe it was an empty duvet cover. The shower had mold in the grout and there were hairs stuck to the bathroom walls. Disgusting. The only redeeming quality is that the location is good, but we will not be staying here again.Two-night stay: rehearsal dinner and wedding night. The staff are very friendly, the inn has great character and the location is just unbeatable, but I feel that this B&amp;B is very overpriced -- just not a good value.Our stay added up to almost $700 for two nights with parking for only one night (despite originally being told when making the reservation that parking was included and that our stay would only be $500), and our room was just not nearly as nice as you would expect for paying that much money. It was a bi-level suite with only four chairs downstairs, no couch. Many of the doors and cabinets were either extremely creaky or broken. There was no body wash provided, only facial/hand soap and shampoo/conditioner. The TV was bizarrely slow to respond to the remote control. The toilet was incredibly slow to flush and you had to hold down the handle for upward of 10 seconds to get it moving. The breakfast was just pastries and cereal, no hot food. There was a stain on the sheets and the staff did not turn over our room after the first night. Obviously none of these things on their own are a big deal, it's just that for the amount of money we paid we expected a much nicer stay with more attention to detail. For two nights total at $700 we could have stayed at Celie's or Henderson's and had an overall much nicer experience.We just left the Admiral Fell and Thank God!  It is 95 degrees and no air-conditioning!  Yes, that's right, no air. My husband and I were up all night. The air was so thick you couldn't breath. We called down to the desk and they informed us that they were working on it. We asked if they had a room fan and they said the did not. I was livid. The next morning I called the manager and he agreed to knock off 50 dollars from our room. Big deal,  our room was $275. We thought we would spring for a more expensive room to make the stay more special and it turned out to be a nightmare. The room itself was ok. Two wing chairs in the sitting room which were very uncomfortable. Should be a sofa in there. Also stains on the carpeting to the second floor and cheap laminate flooring in the bedroom.  I would expect a little more luxurious setting for the price I paid.If I could give zero stars, I would. We booked a room here on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a>. I always use that website &amp; have never had a problem through them. I travel frequently for work &amp; have stayed in hotels all over the country. I had always wanted to stay here as well. First, they charged me a $30 incidental fee, which they informed me would be credited back after my stay. They explained it well &amp; I had no problem with it. However, it definitely made me wonder what kind of place I was staying in that I was basically paying a security deposit...My booking online was supposed to be for $149 for the night, which was including the taxes &amp; hotel fees. They told me it was to be $182 for the night with the taxes &amp; fees. This was aggravating, but I agreed to it. Five minutes later I get to my room &amp; something told me to check my bank account &amp; low &amp; behold...a charge of $212 &amp; separately the $30 fee were charged. I called down &amp; they tried to give me some BS about the incidental fee. I went down to the lobby &amp; none of them knew what to do. They were not helpful &amp; just tried to talk in circles to get rid of me. Finally, the manager came over &amp; offered us $30 off of the room &amp; was honestly unsure of what had happened. I was just fed up &amp; no longer wanted to stay there. He said he would credit my money back &amp; I left. About 20 minutes later, I felt the need to look at my account again &amp; again they had taken out $30 &amp; $212! I called them, got put through to the manager's VM, then called back &amp; was informed there was no MOD &amp; I would have to call back tomorrow! So now I have paid $484 for a room that I am not even staying in &amp; I still have to find another room! Unbelievable! If this place wants to be on the same level as even a Motel 6, they really need to work on their customer service &amp; management. I will NEVER recommend anyone to stay here. Such a major disappointment. And I really hope for their sake that they return my money promptly.This is a charming hotel. We really enjoyed our stay here! The location couldn't be better. It's right in the middle of Fell's Point, within walking distance to tons of shops and restaurants. The exterior is beautiful and the interior is cozy and comfortable. The staff at the concierge desk were friendly and helpful, as were the valets. The room was really nice. It was very well-decorated - no cheesy artwork or ugly, heavy drapes. It was very clean and the bed was really comfy. There are three restaurants attached to the hotel. One of them, Meli, was closed for renovations when we were there. There is also a tapas restaurant called Adela, as well as a more casual restaurant where you can get breakfast if you don't want to eat the free continental breakfast they serve in the lobby. We didn't eat at any of them this time, but the menus looked decent, and I like the convenience factor of having so many dining options available right in the hotel. There are three things keeping me from giving the hotel 5 stars: the continental breakfast, the parking price, and the nightly noise. They serve complimentary fruit, ""homemade"" muffins, and coffee for breakfast in the lobby each morning. The muffins were cold and tasted like they were just made from a boxed mix. And there was barely any fruit - just a couple of oranges. The coffee was good, though. The valet parking offered by the hotel is a rip-off. Don't bother with it. There's a public parking lot a block and a half away, where you can park all day/night for a reasonable price. As for the noise - I know it's hard to drown out the noise of people on the street, but I think the hotel could make a bigger effort to do so. Our room was on the corner of two streets with lots of bars and restaurants on them and there were tons of people outside making lots of noise both nights we were there. I have no problem with the people being loud outside. It's the hotel's responsibility to ensure the comfort of their guests by doing something to soundproof the rooms a bit better.All-in-all, the experience was very nice and I would return to this hotel!How I love this hotel! Or,  should I say WE love it? My daughter and I took a long weekend trip to Baltimore. Our destination? Fells Point. Why? Because we love the shops and restaurants and bars there and have such an amazingly fun time every time we hit that city AND Fells Point. For the last couple years of this annual trip, every time we passed by the Admiral Fell Inn, we'd say, ""Next time we're staying there."" And now that we finally did, we wouldn't stay anywhere else!Why? From the few steps up into the lobby, the staff is extraordinarily friendly and accommodating - actually, even before we got there we were contacted by the hotel staff to see what more they could do to make our stay more comfortable, more interesting and more convenient. I like that!The room was gorgeous! Two beautiful mahogany, four poster canopy beds dripping with cotton lace awaited as we entered the room. Everything about the room suited the quirky, historic twists, turns and narrow hallways of the history contained within the hotel. Every room even has a name! Ours was Forbes.  Did I mention it's haunted?!  Even better!We did have a little noise outside of the windows around 3:00 a.m. on Friday night, but I rolled right over and went back to sleep. After all, if you want to stay in the midst of where it's happening in Baltimore, what else do you expect? I'd rather have that than have to take a cab back to someplace quiet and boring. And Saturday night was quiet as could be...or else I just slept through it.We can't wait to go back and repeat our experience all over again! Oh, and don't you love the name?! (And, yes, there really was an Admiral Fell...they didn't just invent the name for the pun.)Location: greatParking situation: a little confusing (street parking was marked in a confusing way, and the garage that is closer to the hotel is closed during what would seem like peak hours - try the one just a little farther away to bypass this issue)Room: surprisingly large, clean, lots of character.Service: decentHubs and I booked through hotwire so we didn't really know what to expect, based on the reviews here and other places online. We were in town for the Baltimore Marathon and were pleased with its relative proximity to the Inner Harbor touristy area.We arrived kind of late (9ish) after a long drive from Charlottesville and we had to wait a pretty long time to check in (there was only one attendant and he was assisting guests with valet parking charges or something) - but once we finally did, finding our room was quick (just one floor up) and I was glad that we had the room next to the ice dispenser (for post-marathon icing)!It was definitely a lively area to stay in - people were outside til late in the evening/early in the AM having a good ol' time, but hubs and I were so sleepy it didn't phase us.Definitely a disappointment.  I love historic hotels but Admiral Fell Inn is just plain shabby.  Offered $25 meal voucher but breakfast consisted of cold cereal and yogurt.  No in room hospitality features.  TV was on the wall to the side of the bed, so you had to lay sideways in the bed to watch. Uncomfortable mattress and pillows.  Bathroom floor was damp and toilet was stained.   Hotel staff were talking loudly outside my window, apparently on a break, at 11:38 PM.  Very overpriced. Uncomfortable. Unpleasant.  One redeeming feature was that front desk staff were polite.Second time I've stayed here.  Nice historic hotel.  Right in the heart of Fells Point.  Excellent location for partying in Fells.  This is a very well kept, professional, and elegant hotel.  That said, it is very old so the floors creek, walls are thin, beds noisy but very comfy. The tv's are up to date flat screens. Staff is super friendly &amp;very helpful. Very clean.     DOWN SIDE - A bar opened up down stairs directly under the second floor rooms. They play Loud techno music till 1:30 am. Fortunately I travel with ear plugs, but it was really bad &amp;the whole room was shaking. The hotel never mentioned that was an ongoing problem when I booked, nor when I checked in. They apologized saying they weren't affiliated &amp; were in the process of trying to sound proof the ceilings of the bar &amp; 2nd floor floors.  Tip: 1) bring water &amp; ear plugs, problem solved.  2) the valet service is nice, convenient but $24. They park it a few yards away in the public parking garage.  Save the money &amp; park it there yourself for only $3/day.  3) the buffet under the hotel is $15, not worth it. Not a big deal because there are plenty of restaurants around.  4) do the hotel's ghost tour, it's pretty quick, free, and full of some really cool history stuff.   I'll definitely keep coming back.I spent a weekend here with two friends and was really surprised at how great this hotel is.  I was concerned that the room would be small based on the photos online but to my surprise, our room was huge. Plenty of space for the three of us and 2 king beds. The room was super clean, had free wifi and the standard amenities: coffee maker, tv, hair dryer, iron, etc. We parked at the lot 2 blocks away for $14/night. You can't beat the location of this place. You're within walking distance to a ton of bars/restaurants. Inner Harbor is about 2 miles away making it a nice walk as well plus there's lots to see/do on the way. Staff were friendly and helpful. This place was less than $100/night and I would definitely stay here again.We had our wedding here in November 2013, using the top floor ballroom for the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception.  The wedding packages are very customizable, inclusive (linens, cake, centerpieces, musicians, transportation, etc) and we had a great experience. The best part is that at no additional cost you're provided with a coordinator - in our case Kristina Yepes- who did an absolutely amazing job.  We really couldn't have asked for a better venue.  Kristina made it so easy for us!!  Our guests loved staying there as well - the only complaint was that the front desk staff was not extremely helpful when they called for reservations.  In person the front desk staff was friendly and helpful, but I never talked to them on the phone.There is also some street noise - you're in the heart of Fells Point, to be expected, but totally worth it for the photos on the cobblestone streets and dock and tons of bar and restaurant choices for guests - a great part of Baltimore to introduce guests to!My wife and I booked a room at the Admiral Fell Inn for the first weekend in May to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The hotel is centrally located on the corner of Thames and Broadway in Fells Point. The lobby is nicely appointed, and our room was gorgeously laid out with hardwood floors and a large jacuzzi tub/shower. Our room had a shared balcony that overlooks Thames Street (sort of- to look down requires standing on a chair.) The small hotel bar had a local Heavy Seas beer on a cask pour system and made for a lovely space to watch the Kentucky Derby. Fells Point is a popular bar district, but we did not notice any noise from the street, in large part due to the large amount of noise from the wedding reception in the ballroom directly overhead. It got noisy when the dance floor was full, but we knew what we were getting into and the noise did not go obnoxiously long into the night. There were the little things, though, that made me raise my eyebrows. We paid for a Harbor Magic package, which included a few extra perks, such as a bottle of wine in the room. It was there upon arrival, but I found it odd we were never asked a preference, not even of red or white. When we were checking out, I asked if the Harbor Magic package came with anything else, and was presented with a $25 gift card off a future stay, as well as a $25 dining certificate for one of several local restaurants. The latter sure would have come in handy the night before when we went out to dinner, especially with the (hand-written) expiration date of that night. Fortunately we were locals and not rushing for a plane so we did make a point to use it. Our room was very clean, but there was litter on the balcony for the duration of our stay. The staff might be due some exra training perhaps, such as on not having conversations across the desk while guests are standing right there. There were many welcoming and friendly members of staff, although the man who checked us in was particularly quiet and reserved (he certainly didn't ask or check if we had, say, booked a Harbor magic package.) Overall, it's a lovely hotel and we look forward to staying there again.""Admiral Fell Inn""Say it aloud.  ""Admiral Fell Inn""I swear I laugh every time I say it aloud or hear someone else say the name.  I feel compelled to say, ""Where?"" and I have said it.  The front desk stare at me and say, ""Excuse me?""  Enough of my touristy bantering, though. This is a historical hotel located in Fells Point within Baltimore.  You have a great street that you can walk on with a plaza to the the left as you look out the front entrance.  I only wish there were more people in the area.  As close as Fells Point is to Downtown, it is still quite far due to the larger thoroughfares that are present.  You can try to walk, but it is not recommended.The interior has been redone and looks rather tasteful in the rooms as well as in the common areas.  Where the design falls short is in the mediation between the rooms and the lobby.  One must traverse a dark and winding passage way that goes left, right, left, up and down to get to your room.  I think this may have something to do with the fact that several older buildings have been combined under one use.All-in-all, I enjoyed my stay and will try this Inn again.  I hope that the stone streets become more lively.Great, hidden tavern downstairs with amazingly crafted cocktails and knowledgeable mixologists on staff.Ok, before you book you must remember you are staying at an old historic hotel. Its not the hilton. Of course the walls are thin. You are staying in Fells Point which has the greatest concentration of bars in probably all Amuurrrka. With that said, if you are looking for quiet, fluff, pampering, free big continental breakfast, spa, then go somewhere else, this is not the place for you.But. If you are looking to experience something old and special. A bit of history. Closeness to some great night life (and in my opinion, even better and more mature than temple bar Ireland), great food, great drinks, and lots of great cool people, then this is for you. I really enjoyed my stay. Honestly, the customer service was great to me. If you are lucky enough to meet Hakeem, send my regards. He is fantastic and if I was a business owner I'd steal him away.","Fabulous hotel in the most perfect location.  The bedding is cozy and the rooms are clean. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful.  We will absolutely be return guests !!  Thank you admiral fell inn for an amazing weekend !!I was planning a quick romantic get-away and needed a hotel. I did have reservations somewhere else and I was feeling ok about them. But then, the Groupon Gods smiled on me and offered this beauty of a hotel for all of $62 a night. Score! So I bought the Groupon and cancelled my other reservations. Looking on Yelp, I was a bit apprehensive. But I also know that some people just don't Yelp nicely because they're jerks. My good experience with this place started even BEFORE we got there. Kimber, my Experience Specialist, was very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to planning my trip. She recommended restaurants, told us about parking and was very prompt in getting back to me when I had questions about anything. We arrived at the hotel. Its in the heart of Fell's Point, near the bars, but not close enough to where you'd hear any riff raff. We don't like riff raff. We were greeted by Dorian, a very professional front desk person. He took care of us, ensuring that the feather pillows I wanted were in the room when I arrived. We got to the room and it was so nice! This hotel has so much charm and character. Each of the rooms has a name and a story behind it. It was a spacious room with a very comfy bed. The bathroom had its requisite soaps and shampoos and such and they were actually good products. Kimber had sold me on a gift certificate to go to one of their restaurants. $40 for $50 worth of food. Not a bad deal. So I did it. We went to Pizzazz. Bad deal. Experience was so terrible that we only got $29 worth of food, making the certificate pointless. I called back to the hotel and told them about that so they could take the certificate off my bill. They were all so nice! Dorian handled the situation like a pro! Wait, it gets better. Because of my situation with the restaurant (see my Pizzazz review next), Dorian and Hakeem gave me a $50 certificate to the hotel for the next time I wanted to come back.I was impressed with the professionalism of the staff and the overall look and feel of the hotel. Because we enjoyed our stay so much, we're now looking for reasons to go to Baltimore for an overnight stay. Thank you, Admiral Fell Inn staff, for making my experience so good!This is a nice old hotel in the pretty and historic neighborhood of Fells Point.   Everything was great except for the booming noise coming from the nightclub downstairs late at night.  It appears to be a new club that is not good news for this hotel.   Calling reception at midnight, I was given the option of changing rooms, which would have been a big hassle, but was then told the loud music would soon finish, which jt did.  However, I was told that it would be open until 2am the following night, which would have been a big problem had I been staying longer.  I strongly suggest you get a room much higher than the second floor and not on the side street where the club is located.   It's a pity.I read all of the other Yelp reviews before I booked our weekend getaway using their Wonderful Winter Weekend package.  The package, as listed on their website, is supposed to include: 1.  First night, full price, second night for 50% Off  2. Free Valet Parking 3.  Two half bottles of wine 4.  $25 Harbor Magic Gift Card to use on your next visit5.  $25 Dining and Spa VoucherWe arrived after they stopped offering valet for the night (around 10) so we had to find parking, on a Friday night, in the heart of Fells Point, a place where every other business is a bar.  We found a spot as someone was pulling out, about a block and a half from the hotel.  A block and a half is pretty far when you're hauling luggage.  Upon check in we were given the $25 Harbor Magic gift card.  The wine was waiting in our room.  We never received the $25 dining card and it was never mentioned.  When we woke up on Sunday morning, the slip under the door indicated they were going to charge us $29 for valet parking and I brought it to the attention of the front desk and the charge was removed.  I don't know if they're shady or just disorganized. Our room was pretty nice.  It was clean with a little wear around the edged.  We had the Vane Room on the 4th floor, one of the King rooms with a jacuzzi tub and balcony access.  I think we were told when we called that we had our own balcony, but it was shared between our room and the room next door to us.  The jacuzzi tub was great and it was clean but I felt like I needed a stepladder to climb in and out of it.  Also, the soap that was in the room was rather bizarre.  It was a full-sized bar but with a big hole in the middle.  The box said something about removing the often wasted middle part of the soap.  I don't think I've ever used the edges only and thrown away the middle.  If they're concerned about waste, just provide a smaller bar. Based on appearance and features, I don't really feel like it was worth $300 a night to sleep here.  I guess you pay for the location, which was incredible.  It's right in the middle of everything in Fells Point.It is very, very small.  The pictures of the lobby area is pretty accurate but still not as big as the pictures look.  The room, I'm sure if we shelled out a lot more money we could have had a bigger room but the one we stayed in way way, way too small.  The only reason I didn't give it a one star is because it was very clean, staff was very helpful, and it is within walking distance of pretty much everything: entertainment, food, shops, etc..Great service, paper thin walls so sound isn't great if you have loud neighbors.  If you are a light sleeper, request the back side of the hotel not facing the street so you don't get all of the street noise from the bars closing. The staff was great the entire time, and accommodated several of our requests. We had extremely  loud neighbors who carried on with their door wide open . They had friends down the hall who yelled through the hallway when they wanted to communicate at 1am and it was so loud that it felt like they were inside our room. We called the front desk and they solved the problem for us which was great. The location was awesome, as it's right in the middle of everything in Fells Point. One thing that was also annoying was that the TV didn't have clear channels, it was fuzzy channels - about 60% visibility which  was strange because it was just basic cable. All in all it's not fancy but has a quaint charm and great staff.I spent two nights here with my husband and our yorkie, Stewie.  We really enjoyed our time there!About a week before our arrival, a representative from Harbor Magic Hotels emailed me, which was really impressive.  He was able to have our National Aquarium tickets ready for us when we checked in - if you are staying at this hotel, this is a great option.  The tickets are the same price as they would be at the Aquarium itself, but you can skip the line when you get there, and it also allows you entry at any time (as opposed to the timed tickets that the aquarium offers).  I don't know if I would have given the hotel 4 stars if it wasn't pet friendly; there were a few stains on the carpet in our room, but I was more lenient in looking the other way given that we could bring our dog, and there was no additional fee.  If you are expecting a Hilton or Marriott level of hotel, this may not be the place for you.  Each room is different, and the style is a bit old fashioned.  For me, this added to the charm.  The location is great - right by tons of bars, restaurants, and unique little shops.  The price for the room is also very reasonable.The Admiral Fell Inn has a unique charm. When I walked through the doors I remember thinking that I wished the walls could talk. The Inn reminds me  of some of the historical homes I have toured.  The staff was gracious and attentive. The bar downstairs is well stocked and drinks are poured generously. You can't beat the location. You are a short walk to dozens of excellent places for food, drink, or sightseeing. Why only 3 stars?  The rooms are very small and uncomfortable.  My room was no bigger than a walk-in closet in your average McMansion.  I was with a group of people, they all had the same complaint.We are local but were looking for someplace special to stay for a weekend and celebrate our birthdays together, that wouldn't require a long trip as we travel a lot for our jobs .  We chose the Admiral Fell Inn because we like historic places to stay.  While I'd say our experience  came out overall positive, it was definitely mixed.  The Admiral Fell is a nice place with friendly staff but it needs to get its act together and live up to its ""no surprises"" guarantee. First, the good things:  The location of this Inn is wonderful, especially if you're looking to stay in a historic setting near good restaurants and interesting bars.  Shopping in Fells Point is meh, but you can hop on a Water Taxi just steps from the hotel's door and jet over to Baltimore's Inner Harbor for more shops, or just ride the Water Taxi around the harbor for a nice view of the night lights.  (We did this - very romantic for nine dollars a person.) The Inn staff are friendly, nice and polite.  Our bed was comfortable and had a ""romantic"" canopy, and the room/furniture was in OK repair for a historic hotel (except for the bathroom sink - more on that later).   The elevator and public rooms are well kept and elegant.  Since we know parking in Fells Point is a hassle, we opted for the valet parking at 29 dollars a day.  Our weekend package included one night accommodations, chocolates (yummy), free breakfast in the morning, and some other stuff like coupon books and a CD which we did not really use. The room price we were quoted on the booking website was slightly underquoted as it did not include various taxes and fees, particularly a $9.95 ""convenience fee"" that was supposed to cover a bunch of stuff like long distance but in our case just covered bottled water and Internet - we didn't even get a Sunday paper.  Still, the room price was OK for the area and season.  So far, so good.  Now, the not-so-great stuff...We booked online and were contacted the next day by a ""Harbor Magic specialist"" who asked if there was anything more she could do for us to help with our stay.  I had been meaning to make a dinner reservation, but I thought I'd let her do it as I wasn't super familiar with good Fells Point restaurants.  I asked her if ""the hotel had any restaurants"" and she replied there were two, Fin's and Meli's, and that she would be glad to make us a reservation.  I asked which restaurant was nicer and she said they were both very nice but Fin's was more ""traditional"" and served steak.  As we were going for the traditional/ historic I asked her to please make the reservation there for 6:30 pm.  When we checked in, I confirmed with the desk clerk that the reservation at Fin's for 6:30 had been made.  I was told all was in order.We were not offered the ""king upgrade subject to availability"" we had been promised and were put in a room with two double beds.  The bathroom, while huge, had a big crack in the sink and a tub that wasn't particularly deep or nice - so much for a ""romantic"" bath.  We decided not to complain about the room because it had a decent view of Thames Street and the harbor and there was a wedding in the hotel that we figured probably took a lot of rooms. When we went down for our 6:30 dinner at Fin, we discovered that neither the dowdy hostess or the very snooty manager there had any knowledge of the reservation that the hotel supposedly made.  They were very rude to us, told us that the restaurant was separate from the hotel (different story than what we got from the hotel), claimed they were fully booked and offered to seat us in a backroom near the kitchen with nothing comped.  Because they were so nasty, plus their decor was not very ""traditional"", we declined.  We were later told that Fin and the hotel had been having strained relations as the hotel was working more with Meli's and apparently Fin took out their frustrations on us.  Phooey on them, as I said we are local and will never eat there now and will warn others away also.The hotel clerk apologized to us, booked us into Kalis' Court up the street and gave us a 50 dollar voucher,  so they did fix things, but would have been better if it didn't happen at all. At about 1:30 am we were awakened by a large crowd of people screaming in the street under our window for about 15 minutes- the hazards of staying in a bar area.  When we went to have our free breakfast at Meli's (our letter in our reservation specifically stated ""Melis"") we were told by the (nice) manager there that they weren' t offering the hotel breakfast until tomorrow.  Back to the desk clerk who directed us to another part of the hotel where breakfast was being served - yet another ""surprise"".  Finally, we had a late checkout of 2 pm with our package, but no one told housekeeping, who came beating down our door at 12:15 pm when we weren't dressed AND had a do not disturb sign up. By that time I was relieved to get out of there before anything else happened.My favorite place to stay in Baltimore.  I love it because:-  Neat, historic, great old photos of Baltimore history on walls, no two rooms alike, farthest thing from the chains you can get, totally functional, no ridiculous contrivances.-  Location is awesome, feel safe walking alone at night, close to everything (including my office)-  Has the things I need:  comfortable bed, good bathroom, no bad smells, safe, friendly.Things to know that may mean it's not good for you:-  A little noisy.  I don't ever have a problem, but I could see how some folks might.  The cobbled streets make the cars rumble as they go by, and the nightlife can include some enthusiastic outside discussions that are audible from some rooms.  Never kept me awake, though.- Rooms are sometimes pretty small, and many have an unusual shape (like a triangle, for instance).  I travel alone mostly, so that is totally fine with me.  -  Really not the typical hotel; if you're more comfortable with the standard Hilton/Marriot/whatever experience, and it bugs you when things aren't consistent in the way commercial hotels are (which is totally understandable!), this might not be a good spot for you.-  Steep steps in the entry,  several sets of steps that punctuate the halls to the rooms, and other odd angles make this a potential challenge for people with little kids or mobility trouble.Well, booked the hotel for a quick night away from Washington, looking to spend the evening in Fell's Point. The location of this hotel is perfect, right on the wharf, in the heart of this historic part of Baltimore.Entered the hotel shortly after 4, the posted check in time, and was told, ""Oh, I am sorry, I have some bad news. We had some guests from Johns Hopkins stay beyond their reservation and so we do not have a room for you. We can give you a room in one of our sister hotels. It is only a ten minute drive away."" I asked why I had not been called about this and he just looked at me. I asked for the manager, demanded a room, and within ten minutes had the key in my hand. It seemed oddly like something they had done many many times. Do they just overbook all the time, or are they that poorly managed?Despite the problem, the room was large and comfy. The hotel is charming in a sort of rundown historic hotel way. There were some stains on one of the chairs and some cracks in the plaster in the room. The hotel could use a pretty big overhaul. BUT, if you are looking to spend a few days in Fell's Point (which I do recommend), this place would do, just make sure to keep your expectations low, very low.The Admiral Fell is ok.  I stayed here each of the last two years after my Company's Christmas party, which was held downstairs.   I believe there was a $20 discount as a result.Anyways,Pros:1) Location.  You could not be more downtown in Fells Point.   If you walk out of your room you are near everything.2) Each room is named after a famous Baltimore man or woman.  For example this year I stayed in the Babe Ruth suite.  While it did not come with beers and hot dogs, its cool to read a little back story about a famous Baltimoreon.(?).  3)  Valet parking.   While not free, still a nice service to offer in Fells Point.Cons:1) Both this year and last The Admiral Fell has mischarged me.   Last year they did not give me the discount I was quoted over the phone.   This year they charged my girlfriend's card (who booked the room), even though upon check-in, gave my card and asked any and all charges to go to me.  They also tried to charge without discount again.  I was told my other co-workers similar things happened to them.   Poor business practice here really.2)  If I was being a nit, I'd complain about the size of the rooms, but that is the case anywhere in this historic built region.  Deal with it.3) The ""ghost"".  A guy who I suppose is an employee of the hotel came into our party and told the story of how he ""haunted the building for over 200 years"" etc etc.   While at least he dressed the part, he was awkward, unfunny and long-winded.   I think the long winded part was him waiting for a tip (which mercifully one of the bosses gave him and he finally left).  Hey ghost, your act blows.   Take it out to the streets of Fells Points and entertain the drunks or something.   You were a proverbial turd in the punchbowl at our office party.The Fell is ok on the whole.   Double check your bill, and tell the ghost to beat it.Loved this hotel and the super friendly staff!  They were awesome.  The rooms are a bit worn down, but enjoy the history and a fun, eclectic environment.  The hotel and area Is very dog friendly and the pubs were great.  Enjoy!I've stayed here and their sister hotel(Pier 5). Location is key, and The Admiral Fell in is in a great location.  You have access to tons of bars, boutiques and restaurants, $5 cab ride to the inner harbor, $7 to Johns Hopkins, and an option for the water taxi across the street($9, and is good for use from 9am-11pm)The staff tries really hard, and is helpful, although sometimes they seemed confused.  The shuttle service is mediocre, I often found myself taking one of the cabs waiting across the street instead of waiting for the shuttle(The shuttle drives for both Pier 5, and the Admiral Fell Inn, and is often a 10-20 minute wait).  I should mention that if the shuttle is unavailable, the hotel will reimburse cab fare, in the form of a deduction from your room bill.I was there for about 10 days, and had 3 different rooms.  Each of those rooms was noisy in some form or fashion, loud ventilation, street noise, etc.  The noise is in no way a deal breaker, but if you are sensitive to that sort of thing, or are planning on bringing an infant, you may want to take that in to consideration. (The street noise is BAD on the weekends after the bars close.)The rooms are sort of expensive, but you're better off forking out the $$$ than staying in other less expensive hotels in the area, you might find yourself being robbed, sold crack, or in the middle of a gunfight elsewhere in Baltimore.I would recommend this location for a weekend getaway during the summer for people in the NY/NJ area.  I would also recommend staying here if you're a patient/visiting Johns Hopkins hospital.  After research, this is in my opinion, the closest, and more importantly, safest place to stay that is in the vicinity of the hospital.If you're staying there, I'd recommend ""Mezze""(2 minute walk) for dinner, and ""Liquid Earth""(5 minute walk, vegetarian) for lunch.  The free breakfast in the hotel is pretty good, and the people that prepare/serve the breakfast are really on their game.1.5 stars for admiral fell inn, but i'll be generous and round up since the location is great.  (right in the middle of fell's point and just a short taxi ride - water or auto - to the inner harbor.)  i had high hopes for this hotel, but they fell pretty short.  (no pun intended.) i heard about admiral fell first from my boss, then from a couple of friends.  when a friend was in town for a conference and wound up staying @ this property, i decided i'd give it a try based on seeing her room.  it was lovely with big, fluffy canopy beds and gorgeous decor.  the bathroom was on the small side but very cute w/ a claw foot tub.  everyone (staff) seemed very nice and i really liked the vibe of the place w/ all its old/historic charm.  up it went to the top of my list for places to stay in baltimore.  FF to my weekend there.  ugh.  the room was TINY and horribly laid out.  i mean, HORRIBLY.  less than 2 feet from the door when you walk in is a queen-sized sleigh bed right in the middle of everything.  cute bed, but very out of place and cumbersome in that small room. (you know a room is small if a queen-sized bed takes up, well, almost the whole room.)  the curving head and footboards were just not a good look b/c they cut into the very little walking space there was.  the armoire - another piece of furniture too big for the room - housed the TV and had empty drawers below.  good thing, too, b/c there was NO CLOSET in the room.  (WTH?!  where are you supposed to hang your clothes/coats?)  behind the bed was a small side chair and they somehow managed to also wedge a desk and chair, too.  very small.  the window next to the desk looked out to a brick wall with some suspicious looking liquid oozing down its side.  gross.  after taking in this tightly packed room i was prepared for a broom closet of a bathroom.  surprisingly, it wasn't that tight.  yes, the bathroom was sort of small, but i actually felt more comfortable in there than in the room.  there were nice glass shelves under the mirrors and i really liked the tile job.  plus, the window in the bathroom had a partial view of the harbor instead of that icky wall.  points for that and the super fluffy towels.  i was all ready to fall in love with the bathroom when i drew back the curtain for the tub/shower - major FAIL.  the tub was one of those large jacuzzi tubs w/ the jets and everything.  nice, right?  no.  NO.you ever, as a kid, build some great lego scene and there's just this one part you want just so, but the lego piece won't fit?  like, the little pegs don't line up, but you jam it in somehow anyway?  that's how this tub was in the bathroom.  it was so awkwardly placed and horribly installed that it looked like something that could be on one of those contractor horror stories you sometimes see on the news w/ the guy who's ""on your side"" and humiliates the contractor into paying up to the wronged homeowner.  tiles that didn't line up and/or needed to be recaulked (including some mismatched ones that had been replaced), a big, gross lime stain where the faucet leaked continuously, the actual tub basin part that was probably white at some point was completely yellowing and had a few cracks, and so on.  i don't even know if the jets worked b/c no way in hell was i taking a BATH in that thing.  and taking a shower was challenge.  i wish i could explain the angle at which this tub was placed, but all i can really say is that it was so awkwardly placed that getting in and out was an exercise in balance and flexibility.  really, the only redeeming quality was that the shower had the removable head w/ multiple spray/flow settings.  it was like they were going to get a jacuzzi tub into that bathroom no matter what, just so they could advertise having one.  it was really bad, and i felt really misled/pissed off.  the rest of the hotel was still cute, i guess, but my opinion and experience was jaded by our room.  the best thing about staying there was when we stepped outside, b/c it is literally in the middle of fell's point w/ all it's restaurants, shopping, adorable cobblestone streets, diverse people and harbor.  IDK that there are any other properties to stay in, right in fell's point.  however, AFI sucked enough that i wouldn't stay there again just to have a fell's point experience.  i'd stay just a little ways up the road by the inner harbor, or just suck it up and make the drive back to DC at the end of the night.    i realize it's likely hit or miss based on my friend's room and experience, but the miss was so far off that i'm not willing to try for a hit.  admiral fell inn has fallen OFF my list.I traveled to the Admiral Fell Inn for a business meeting with about 80 business colleagues from all across the country. The views I am expressing are my own, but I heard many similar comments from my colleagues, so I know it isn't just me. I made my reservation at the Admiral Fell at least a month in advance. I asked for a large room with a king bed, in a quiet location, on an upper floor. After all, the Admiral Fell's website shows large, elegant, ornate rooms with huge beds. What they put me in was anything but. I asked to be relocated to another room but was told they were fully booked. My tiny, oddly shaped room was barely big enough for one double bed and two night stands (not king, not queen, but double). The windows looked out over the air conditioning system in the light well. The room was inconvenient in every possible way, from a very narrow entry corridor, to no place to put a suitcase, to an absurd ""desk"" (little more than a shelf hanging on the wall), to an air conditioning system that was impossible to regulate - it either ran way too cold or too warm, to a bathroom where the toilet was crammed into a corner that made it difficult to use. But it gets worse. The ""closet"" was an odd ""armoire"" style cabinet, but it appeared to be homemade of plywood. It had a real cheap quality. The drawers didn't open properly and the door had to be tied open with the phone cord in order to watch television. All of these things were inconvenient signs of a lower-end hotel. But what I found intolerable was how dirty the place was. Truthfully, I cringed when I had to walk barefoot on the carpet in my room. It was so dirty, with big grease and oil stains and dark smudges. I asked the housekeeping staff to shampoo the carpet. What did they do? Brought in a squirt bottle of some sort of carpet cleaning liquid and wet down the dirty spots. No scrubbing, no steaming, no vacuuming. It was no better when they finished than when they started. I found garbage from prior tenants under the night stands and strange hairs in the bathroom. Shudder. Then there's the internet. They offered free wifi. For the first couple of days, it worked okay, but then it suddenly went on the fritz, and the hotel staff couldn't seem to get it working again. Inconvenient.We held our group meeting in the large conference rooms on the fifth floor. Those were nice rooms, if you don't mind an occasional rat running around. The hotel provided a ""continental breakfast"" for our group, which consisted of inedible, rancid pastries and supermarket-quality bagels. The Admiral Fell does get my vote for courteous service. The front desk staff was nice, helpful and really tried to make things work out. But they're facing a tidal wave of deferred maintenance and repairs, and the place needs a thorough cleaning, stem to stern. And oh yes, they should wall off the miserable little room they gave me. It's unfit for habitation.Admiral Fell would be proud of his native city, Baltimore, and all ithas to offer (crab cakes, health care, gonorrhea, etc...). However, hemight not be quite as proud of the service provided in the hotel thatbears his name.I was in Baltimore for a meeting at Hopkins. I got the room throughPriceline, and had high expectations because apparently this is whereHopkins puts their prospective students and faculty candidates up whileinterviewing in Baltimore. My expectations were met, but only sort of.The room: 3.5 starsI was very pleased by the overall room quality. Usually when I get aroom through Priceline, they give you the worst room in the hotel, e.g.the room next to the elevator, a room on the second floor, or thejanitor's closet. However, they provided me a nice room on the 4thfloor away from the elevator with a nice view of Fells Point (which, bythe way, is actually kind of pretty [for Baltimore]).  The bathroom was accessible by a strange long hallway, but once inside, was clean, although definitely well-worn.  There were a few loose floorboards in the bedroom, but I'll chalk that up to the ""charm"" of an old inn like the Fell.  The service: 2 starsAfter a whirlwind day of meetings and running around Baltimore, I just wanted to check in, call my wife, and go to sleep.  I arrived around 9 and there was one agent working the desk.  I had to wait to check in while she took not one, but two phone calls, each of which lasting several minutes.  Okay, so I had to wait maybe ten minutes.  Not a big deal.  She was perfectly polite.  I signed some papers, gave her my credit card, and she gave me the key to the room.  While I was in the room, I noticed in the fine print that there would be a daily fee of $9.95 assessed in addition to the rate.  I didn't think much of it, given that, supposedly, all the fees are paid for when I booked the room through Priceline.(Their policy: "" Depending on the property you stay at you may also be charged (i) certain mandatory hotel specific service fees, for example, resort fees (which typically apply to resort type destinations and, if applicable, may range from $10 to $40 per day), energy surcharges, newspaper delivery fees, in-room safe fees, tourism fees, or housekeeping fees and/or (ii) certain optional incidental fees, for example, parking charges, minibar charges, phone calls, room service and movie rentals, etc.."")The next morning, I got a bill for the $9.95 at the door.  I went down to the lobby to check out and inquire, quite politely, might I add, about the fee.  I told them quite honestly and courteously, that if I had signed something saying that I paid the fee, I'd be happy to pay it, but otherwise, I would have liked for them to remove it.  The first clerk I encountered was very nice and he said that they would gladly take the charge off, given the person who checked me in failed to explain the fee.  He asked the other clerk at the desk to check me out and remove the fee.  That's when the niceness ended.  The second clerk became extremely rude to me, told me that the next time I stay here, I'd have to pay the fee.  Her gestures and body language also suggested that she was not happy about deducting the fee.  She bluntly and curtly said, ""you're done.""  I (politely) proceeded to ask her whether I could get another copy of the bill, but before I could get the words out, she again stated, ""You're done!""  Being somewhat taken aback by her rudeness, I then handed over the keys, which she snatched from my hand.  Totally uncalled for.  I was extremely polite and her reaction was just ridiculous.  I'd probably stay here again, despite the little encounter with Miss Sunshine at check-out, but I would suggest that they hire slightly less rude agents to handle customers.  As for this review, as the agent would say, ""I'm done.""My husband and I were flying to Baltimore to meet family for a cruise that left from the Port. We wanted to stay in the area to see the Inner Harbor as my husband had never been there. I made reservations online after seeing multiple reviews. We were to arrive by 7:00 pm at the airport and were going to supper and cruise around the area for the evening. The Inn helped with transportation to the hotel from the airport . Needless to say our plane broke down and we did not get off the ground until 10:30 at night. We contacted the hotel and they were fantastic, as was our transportation service. When we arrived at the airport our transportation was waiting, took us to the hotel. The staff were extremely courteous and helpfull. Our room was perfect and even though we didn't get to see too much while we were there, we enjoyed it immensely.  The transportation service took us to the port, picked us up after our cruise and brought us back to the airport. The Admiral Fells Inn was a great place and hopefully we get to enjoy the area more the next timeI enjoyed my stay at the Admiral Fell Inn and, while there were a handful of (very) minor things to quibble over, the headline is that we are high maintenance hotel guests (we have a 15 month old daughter) and the staff really met our expectations and helped us out. To begin with, I wanted to arrange for a babysitter in the hotel. The concierge (nitpick #1: the title ""experience specialist"" must be a difficult burden for this young woman to bear; can we please just call it what it is? Also, the word ""magic"" is far too heavily used!) went back and forth numerous times. She put in a fair amount of effort trying to arrange for a hotel staff member to take the job. We ended up going with an outside agency, but I really appreciated her help.As another commenter has mentioned, the rooms aren't huge, and there's some cracked tiles and a patch of blackish mildew on the caulking in the shower. The crib was initially set up wrong (when brought to the desk's attention, it was fixed immediately). And there was a minor snafu with the bill. But if those facts are going to make your hair stand on end, then you probably aren't looking to stay in an old hotel in a historic district in the first place. The point here is that it's a cool old place perfectly located on the central square in the Fells Point area. If that's what you're looking for, then you've found it with this one.Next time you visit Charm City, stay here! It's a great hotel at the corner of Thames and South Broadway in Fell's Point. The hotel is comprised of eight adjoining buildings, some dating back to 1760. Each of the 80 rooms is different in size, shape and decor and each is named after a seafaring Baltimorean from the past. Cozy, warm, bright and haunted (or so they say) though we didn't see any ghosts and we were roaming the halls until 4am last night. Prices range depending on the season (obvs) and start anywhere from $159 a night (Saturday, 11/24/07) for a two double bed room to $229 for a king bed room and $289 for  a corner king suite with jacuzzi tub. Well worth the price, we stayed in a king bed room on the second floor that overlooked Thames (that's pronounced Thayms not Temz) Street and it was perfectly peaceful and quiet (and ghostless) at night, in the morning you hear the zen sound of cars driving over the cobblestones. The hotel also offers a Ghost Tour of the hotel, if your into that sort of thing. The room might be chilly when you first check-in but turn that heat on and you'll be toasty warm in no time. I'll be back here to hunt for ghosts for sure.","I came to Baltimore for an interview, and this is the hotel where I was ""put up"".  It is in an area of Fells Point central to just about everything, right across from the water.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The rooms are small, but comfy.  The room also had a whirlpool tub, a definite plus in my book.  The breakfast was average fare (oatmeal, scrambled eggs, fruit, etc.).

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-inner-harbour-baltimore,Hampton Inn & Suites Inner Harbour,4.0,$$,42,"Stayed for a night in 2014, and the room we had was spectacular.Hotel amenities Include: 06:00 - 10:00 am Complimentary Breakfast 24-hour Fitness Center Complimentary Wi-Fi (password given upon check-in)Parking by Towne Park ($32 for overnight parking) Pool (closes at 09:00 pm)The hotel was great. Very friendly staff (house keepers, desk, valet) and were all very helpful. They had complimentary coffee/tea all day and night long as well as a very nice continental breakfast each morning. Within walking distance to the waterfront (two blocks or so) and many other attractions and bars to go to. The upgraded room was worth the additional $15/20 or so as the standard room was a bit of a squeeze but they were nice and clean. The beds were super comfortable as well.The only downside we experienced was the lack of free parking. It was $32 to valet park overnight because there just isn't enough legal available parking around. So if you are lucky enough to get one of the few spots that's legal after 5pm fantastic... If not, prepare to pay another premium.I would definitely stay here again and probably will this winter.I had another guest enter my room, rob me.   Hotel reports I'm at fault for opening the door.  Unexplained why hotel security never contacted police after being told my belongs were gone through. I have filled a police report with Baltimore police; report # 1-15099139I have yet to even receive an apology from the hotel.Mediocre at best. Didn't sleep well due to other guests talking throughout the night as well as opening and closing doors practically all night. Elevator had a mind of its own. When we asked for late check out we were given a whole half hour. Pipes in the room rattled though out the night as well.Clean but my two main issues are 1 - no free parking.  $32 for valet parking 2- poor HVAC maintenance.  The lobby's AC was out all weekend - eating breakfast in 87 degree heat stinks, and it got worse as the day went on.  Our room never got below 77 degrees, as the AC could not keep up on a hot ( but not u usually hot) day if 92 degrees.  We slept poorly - do not recommend coming In the summerPros: Good location, great breakfast and coffee, comfortable beds, suites with sink, microwave, fridge and room for six people, secure - key card for everything including elevatorCons: This hotel handed me a bill for $787 but up-charged an extra $120 on my bank card for the ""potential"" of incidentals such as valet and movies which we did not use. I expect my bill upon check out to reflect what is charged to my card. My only explanation for these ""anticipated"" extra charges is that we were there for Maryland Deathfest and they expected the room to be trashed, which it was not. I am also a member of their Hilton Honors program, which makes me even more confused as to why I would be treated this way. Guess I will just find another hotel chain to give my money to. Not staying with them again if they will not explain upfront that there is a ""deposit"" on a room. This has never happened to me at a hotel before.It's a beautiful little hotel, very close to all the local attractions, really at a walking distance from everything.  Being its location the amenities in the surroundings are great.  Valet parking.  Rooms are spacious and service is great and staff is friendly.  Kids enjoyed it, loved my stay.A very welcome staff, valet parking only ($32 but you do get in/out privileges).   The room we got was huge with frig and micro.  It has the usual HI breakfast.  The hotel is a block plus from the Inner Harbor.  Lots of places to eat, harbor cruises galore. Great people watching as well. Huge lobby with lots of places to just sit and read.Great little hotel. This hotel was squeezed into an old historical  building and I thought this gave the hotel a lot of charm.A little on the pricey side, we had reward points to use luckily.The room was comfy and clean.Easy walk to the inner harbor as we walked everywhere during out visit.Highly suggest this hotel if you need one in the area! Free hot breakfast in the morning and it was all yummy foods! Unlike some other hotels that just have cereal and muffins.This hotel was a block from the inner harbor and easy to get to from the interstate. Valet  service also superb we arrived at 11 pm they got us in expeditiously .  The hotel staff was friendly and attentive during our stay. Also the breakfast was a pleasant surprise.  We will be back again.Great hotel! Clean, nice pool, awesome complimentary breakfast. Christian at the front desk was very very helpful. Only complaint was that we had to wait 45 minutes for our car from valet.Internet down right now and a little far from Camden yardsHotel staff was very friendly and room was clean.  If you are looking for a hotel a few blocks away from the inner harbor but close enough to walk then it is a good place to stay.Free breakfast was a nice touch and tastyI wasn't impressed with the check in but the room was WOW! Very spacious and clean. We had 2 queen suite so it had a bathroom area along with a sink, a kitchen area with microwave, refridge , counter space and sink. Our couch also turned into a bed and we also had a work station. We had a family of 4 and still had plenty of room. The things they should work on is having more kids channels. It says they have Nickelodeon but it's a direct TV movie channel. PBS was too baby &amp; Cartoon Network is too old for my kids. We requested a non smoking room and it is but all of the rooms around us are smoking so my hall smelled like cigarette smoke really bad!!!Great location, hotel was converted from an old historical building and had a lot of personality. Lobby is beautiful, staff was pleasant, breakfast was good (especially since it was FREE.) The gym was small and the shower didn't have the best water pressure, but the rooms were large, well taken care of and have great views. Walking distance to shopping, harbor, convention center, aquarium and really REALLY good restaurants. Will be staying here again!This hotel and service was absolutely perfect. Everyone was very friendly and very helpful. The hotel desk receptionist Dondrea, WAS ABSOLUTELY amazing for me and my family. Very friendly and very helpful. The valet service, I absolutely recommend, it is 32.oo a night but it is worth it. You can get your car as many times as you like.  The continental breakfast in the morning was delicious. The inner harbor is beautiful and I would highly recommend staying at this hotel.Stayed here for 2 nights.  We had asked for adjoining rooms, they just kept telling us ""it's not guaranteed"".  And indeed, when we arrived we didn't get adjoining rooms, but to try and satisfy our request, we had two rooms in a private end-of-hall area that basically served a similar purpose.  So that was good.Positives include quiet, dark rooms; good toiletries provided; the breakfast was satisfying with a lot of choice (although I didn't understand why the plates/cups/bowls were all Styrofoam and then they provided a microwave -- you can't microwave Styrofoam, so it was basically useless); check-out time is noon; Wifi was included in the price and was always easy to connect to and a strong connection at that.My room key never worked; I had to change it 6 times.  And although the front desk guy suggested it was my fault (keeping it close to something magnetic), one time he gave me the key, I went upstairs and it didn't work, so it was obviously the door.  I did appreciate he suggested I use the reception phone by the elevators so I didn't have to keep going up and down every time it happened.  Good customer service.Good area, valet parking expensive though.  I'd recommend it.This is my second Hampton Inn stay recently and the room seemed cleaner than the last location. My room was huge and it had a King bed. As for the location, my window looks out to a ""coming soon"" hotel which is a little eerie but it had the opaque layer for privacy. The other window where the sink and entrance to bathroom is facing the Marriott across the street. Eerie again. Did I mention it only had a see through curtain?The microwave and fridge was a nice addition. The mesh chair for the desk is another favorite. The clean personal couch was nice also. The fluffy 4 pillows on the bed? Another plus! Outlets and wifi, Yes!Service was quick as far as check in and front desk calls. When there was an issue the maintenance staff came immediately. There was the snack shop and business center (with a mean monster fax/copier/printer) available. You are about 3 blocks from the Inner Harbor so you can always catch dinner there before retiring for the night.I can't say enough about this hotel.  We were staying there on a business trip and everything from check-in to check-out was perfect!  Staff was great, rooms were very nice and the breakfast that was offered was far above the norm for a continental breakfast!They have my business on my next scheduled visit to the area!!!!Decent hotel. I travel a lot, so the bar is already pretty high. Stayed there one night for a football game. Walls are pretty thin, kept hearing other people talking and doors slamming all night. Breakfast was great, if only for the waffles. :). Would stay again for one night, not more than that.With a budget, this place is as good as it gets! Clean rooms, hot breakfast in the morning, free wifi, minutes to the inner harbor and not unreasonable to Camden Yards (15-20 minute walk). Yes! Stay here!","I stayed here while in town for the Rebel Race. It's valet parking only and they're pretty efficient getting your car in and out. Just moments away from the inner harbor is a plus. One you leave your car with the valets, there is really no reason to pull it out again, unless you've got to leave the city limits. There are tons of cabs and busses to get you to where you need to go. The surrounding area can feel a little shady but you'll get past that. There are quite a bit of places to eat right around the corner if you don't feel like heading to the harbor. The customer service was very good. The front desk people were cheerful and extremely helpful. If you're hungry for a snack and don't feel like leaving the hotel, theres a food/snack pantry at the front desk. You'll find some microwavable meals like burritos and hot pockets, assorted drinks, ice cream, chips, candy and some fruit.Our room was comfortable. It had a gigantic mirror, refrigerator, microwave oven, desk, flat screen TV, and an extra chair. The bathroom had the usual toiletries. Oh, and don't let me forget about the free breakfast. Make sure you get up early. They have assorted dry cereals, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, bagels, muffins and assorted fruits and juices. Very convenient and very free. This hotel also seems to have a little bit more tables and seats than most.So great price, friendly service, and good location from the inner harbor. I would definitely stay here again.Everything was perfect. Good for families and couples.Stayed twice at the Hampton Inn and Suites Inner Harbor.  Location is great.  We were attending events at the Convention Center which is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  It is less than 10 minutes to walk to Inner Harbor or Camden Yards from this hotel.  In addition there is a small divey bar around the corner (Peter's) for any late night drink.Our last visit in August 2012, the hotel let me check in at 9:30 in the morning!  Valet was exceptional (at 32.00 per day) with in/out privileges.  Room was VERY clean.  Rooms are different sizes as the room we had in 2010 was larger (same type-studio suite).  Our room had a fridge and microwave.  Everyone was VERY nice and accommodating!Breakfast-its free.  One day was eggs and sausage.  Second day was sausage and french toast sticks.   There is a Dunkin Donuts a short walk if you aren't feeling the free breakfast.  We didn't visit the pool so no comment there, and the wi-fi is ok (also free).Overall, I would stay here (as I am a repeat customer).  Location is great and staff was very friendly!Great hotel for its class.  I have stayed here three times while attending an annual conference at the Convention Center.  It's within walking distance of the Convention Center and the Inner Harbor. The room is very clean and comfortable, with all the conveniences.  The hot breakfast is varied every day, although I only stayed two days each time so I don't know how soon they repeat the offerings, which include combinations of things like: different types of sausages, omelet, French toast, scrambled eggs, home fries, etc., with make-it-yourself waffles always available. Free Ethernet and WiFi are available in the room.  The last time I stayed, they have added one more convenience: USB chargers and outlet breakouts in the room.  I didn't even have to use the one I packed with me.I got everything I expected from the hotel for the week I was there. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and as for the breakfast, it was exactly what I've had at other Hamptons in the past. To those that complain about it, I would simply say: IT'S FREE! They don't have to offer it, plenty of mid grade hotels I've been at offer breakfast but charge an arm and a leg, but make the cost confusing.  My boyfriend enjoyed everything they had, ate plenty every morning, and if I couldn't decide on something I made a fresh waffle, a favorite feature at any Hampton.The reason that I am not giving this hotel five stars is for the one hiccup we experienced. I booked a nonsmoking room with a preference for a king bed and got a nonsmoking with a queen. Normally not a big deal, but my room was on a smoking floor. At night the smell wasn't an issue, but if I happened to go up to my room after housekeeping started opening the other doors in the corridors, the smell was a bit overwhelming for nonsmokers like us.We stayed on the second floor, so if you book nonsmoking and they place you on the second, ask if they can move you if you think the smell will bother you.The Hampton Inn and Suites on Redwood in the Inner Harbor is a great place to stay while in Baltimore.  The hotel itself occupies a mid-nineteenth Century multi-story building which is very appealing. The valet service greets you right away and voila, your vehicle Is tucked away in a secure garage.  Downside: valet services will cost you $32.00 per day. The check-in staff is very friendly and helpful.  The lobby makes a good first impression.  The rooms are surprisingly large.  The 12 foot ceilings help in this regard.  The room  we had was very well appointed.  The Queen beds were quite comfortable.  The countertops were all marble, spacious and functional.  A neat tidbit: there are soap, shampoo and conditioner dispensers on the shower wall..yes, I was impressed! There was a surprisingly nice complimentary.  breakfast buffet, complete with lots of fresh fruit, cereals, muffins, with make your own toast, waffles and pancakes.  Nice. All things considered, a great place to stay in Baltimore's Inner Harbor.We stayed at this hotel for 2 night while visiting the inner harbor.  The room was very nice and clean, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the staff was very helpful and friendly especially the valet parking attendants.  It was a very short walk to the the harbor and mall and the breakfast is free and awesome! We are going back again in September. Did I forget to mention that the have great coffee and tea 24/7. Can't wait to go back.Wonderful hotel.  Rooms were big, comfortable, and no smoke smell. Easy walk to the inner harbor and all the sights.OK rooms, terrible breakfast, but as we have found lately on our Hilton Hotel stays, GREAT PEOPLE and service!  I would stay here over the Marriott I last stayed at anyday - I can always walk somewhere for breakfast or grab one of their handy bags.  Service is great, which is one of the things I rate hotels on - cleanliness and service are first in my book (no bed bugs please!).  Everything else is just frosting on the cake.I was in town for a little eye surgery at Johns Hopkins. I was in the hospital at 0630am and out the door at 1030am. So my dilemma was getting an early check in. After parking right out front the Valet told my wife to go in and see if they can check us in.  Sure enough the nicest woman said sure no problem and checked us in! The room was nice, king bed with a couch ( I assume pullout). Average bathroom, very clean with microwave and small refrigerator.  Oh if the manager reads these and I believe you do the compressor in the frig in room 330 is dying! It groaned all night. It didn't bother me, I was zonked on pain pills but someone else may complain.  Breakfast was great, plentiful with lots of choices.  The hotel is a couple blocks from the harbor so it would be a short walk if we were vacationing.  On a whole, great experience, great hotel, nice people.  I would stay here again.I traveled to Baltimore for a conference and was slow in booking my room.  I found the best deal at Hampton Inn on Redwood.  The cost was $134/night without taxes for two nights if I paid in advance.  The room total was $330.As I arrived at the hotel I was pleasantly surprised by the public amenities, the staff's graciousness, and the fantastic condition of the bedroom.My king room was enormous.  Hampton Inn did a retrofit of an older building and the appointments could not be nicer for this level of hotel.  All of my questions and requests were answered quickly and courteously.  The gym, while smaller, was used only by me--loved it.  I didn't bring a swimsuit and regretted it.  The pool was never in use while I was around.The breakfast was what I expected.  The dining area had a very high ceiling so sound drifted away and made the dining experience very nice.  I really liked the all-day coffee and teas service.A very nice stay at Hampton Inn.  I am staying here whenever business or pleasure take me back to Baltimore.Loved staying in room 722. I believe you have to speak with the hotel staff on-site to reserve it. I second another reviewers take on the beds - super comfy. Walked to the the Rusty Scupper and the ballgame at Camden Yards and liked it very much. $32.00 for parking.I will say the location of this hotel was spot on for getting to the inner harbor and taking a quick cab to Fells Point.  The concierge/doorman guys were awesome.  They were very helpful and quick to help us with our car and baggage.   The hotel room was nice and clean, although a bit small, and had free WiFi.  The unfortunate downside to our hotel stay was the room.  I believe that since we received a ""deal"" through their website promotion, we were stuck in a back corner room, facing a run down building, and the walls made crazy loud noises starting shortly after arriving.  We didn't complain as it was just for the night, but it was disappointing since I had searched dilligently on Yelp and found this place to have pretty good reviews.I stayed at the end of last week. The Hampton seems to be a historical property with solid service and the mini gym that's a solid effort. However for a business traveler, the lame internet speed was a bit annoying (worse than dial-up). It was free, but there was no reliable premium option. Definitely a good low priced alternative if you need to roll down to Baltimore for a ball gameWe enjoyed this hotel during our recent family vacation to DC and Baltimore.  It's hard to find affordable accommodations for a family with 4 children, and the Hampton Inn was one of few close to the Harbor that allowed us to stay in one room/suite.  Just a few blocks off the Inner Harbor, our room had 2 beds and a pull-out couch.  The beds were comfy, and our suite had a wet bar and refrigerator.  This hotel has a decent breakfast selection in the morning: eggs, sausage, assorted breads and cereals, and a waffle station allowed our kids to fuel up with a variety of options before we went out sightseeing.  The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating at this hotel.  We enjoyed our stay here.The facilities and staff are pleasant and helpful but I can't say the same for the streets of Baltimore just a few feet from the sliding door.  I would also not say that the location of the hotel is in a family friendly part of town although one would think so considering its proximity to the harbor.  Just be prepared to be harangued by panhandlers at every corner and witness people screaming profanities at each other in the streets while cops do nothing.  Some situations reminded me of scenes from John Carpenters, ""Escape From New York.""We stayed at this hotel for 1 night while visiting the inner harbor.  The room was very nice and clean, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the staff was very helpful especially the valet parking attendants.  It was a very short walk to the aquarium and mall and the breakfast was awesome! We would definately stay here again if we are ever visit the inner harbor again.3 blocks away from Inner Harbor. Our room was very spacious, especially the bathroom. The only downside was our view, as our window was facing an empty, rundown building.  Seems like a pretty safe area, as long as you don't go to Baltimore Street (a block away) at night. There was a homeless guy pulling out Hustler magazines underneath his one-legged baggy jeans, and shady people yelling obscenities at one another.I had a pleasant experience in the one night I stayed here. The staff were very nice and because of my status and HHonors, I got upgraded to what was ""the nicest room"" in the entire hotel - room 722 - ask for it. According to the reviews that I read under mine, the building used to be offices and the decor in the rooms definitely reflected it - wood floors and wood panel walls - all beautifully done. There was a big whirpool tub in the bathroom as well as a big screen tv and several options for seating apart from the computer chair.The location is pretty good - it was a 5 dollar taxi ride to anywhere basically - parking is 29 a night so that is a bit of a chapper and for being a Hampton Inn - its kind of expensive - I paid 189 a night. The valets were nice and Hampton Inn breakfast didn't let me down.Great location in the Inner Harbour area.  This hotel is an old bank and Hilton has actually kept much of the architechtural integrity of the building.  The seventh floor was the executive floor of the bank.  The executive lobby is intact with it's stone pillars and terrazo floors.  The door jambs are actually the originals with the transem windows above the doors.  These rooms were originally executive offices.  Pretty cool.The staff was super nice and helpful.  The room was expensive at $259, but it was very last minute for a huge convention that was in town.I'll stay here again.","The hotel was very nice! Perfect if you're looking for something more upscale than a Best Western but cannot afford to stay at the Hilton. We stayed on the historic 7th floor. The rooms were not the typical square shaped room you find with most Hampton Inns. Service was great, the front desk people helped us out with directions and what there was to do.The valet parking was $30.00 a day but totally worth if you would rather your car be in a safe place rather than on the side of the road.The one thing we looked forward to from the hotel was the hot breakfast we were promised each morning. We went down at 9:30am to find NOTHING left. This was the only down fall of the hotel, they did not take in consideration that some people like to sleep in on vacation, and did not provide enough food for all their guests. Literally there were 4 bagels, but no cream cheese, an english muffin and my boyfriend was LUCKY to scrape up the last bit of has browns. They did provide coffee around the clock. But we were still hungry =[That was the only downfall of the hotel, all in all it was a relaxing stay. Even though we were let down with the breakfast deal, we would stay there again. Just remember to wake up early to get the grub!!!!!The hampton inn isn't normally my choice of accommodations, but due to other circumstances I found myself here for about 4 days.  When I arrived, the building was charming, and the desk clerk was overly friendly. Boasting he was from California too we talked about some common cali locals, and then he put me up in my room. He mentioned that at 5-8pm they have a happy hour. There are beers and wine for free in the lobby. It being right in that time, I walked over to find cans of keystone and bud in a big tin. classy. haha. The room was about $200, way to overpriced, but relative to the area. It was big and spacious, had a couch and the bed was super comfy. The internet was decent, and the room had a fridge and a microwave---always a plus. However, when I opened the window, there was left over towels and trash on the window sill. yes. I rate this place three stars.. for the service of the staff, and  the location. It was only a few blocks from the inner harbor and the room was big.",,,"['night', '2014', 'room', 'spectacular', 'hotel', 'amenities', 'include', 'complimentary', 'breakfast', 'hour', 'fitness',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/baltimore-marriott-inner-harbor-at-camden-yards-baltimore,Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards,3.5,$$$,82,"My boyfriend and I attended the Baltimore v Pittsburgh game and chose this hotel due to it being in walking distance of the stadium. Pros: friendly staff, nice spacious rooms, the beds are the softest I've ever slept in for a hotel, and the room was clean. Cons: parking is horrid (we used the hotel's) and hotel parking is pricy too ($28 for a day (I figured for the price we were paying parking would be free)) my only problem with the staff is when my boyfriend and I ordered food she called up to our room and was very rude about it. ""Did you order food?"" ""Yes ma'am"" ""well it's here and they are NOT allowed to come up"" then when I got down there she gave me a rude look and eye roll. (Besides that all my other staff encounters were great)Not what I've come to expect from a Marriott. This hotel is cheaply furnished complete with all polyester bedding and the rooms smell like they've been soaked in cheap artificial headache inducing air freshener to cover up the smell of mold.The staff seemed like they hate their jobs, and yelled at me and each other more like at a McDonald's than a hotel. The bar food was simply gross. Overall more akin to a red roof inn than a Marriott.Stayed here Saturday night ..What a disaster ..The bathroom shower almost flooded &amp; never did drain ..Room was very basic ..I won't be backI love the Marriott and wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in downtown Baltimore.I stay here during the week when I travel for work and it's a close walk to my office. My project has negotiated a lower rate and I get the perks of free Wi-Fi and access to the concierge lounge. There's great breakfast options (eggs, pastries, oatmeal, cereal, fruits, snacks). They also serve a dinnertime ""snack"" and dessert service, but it's a great dinner option (steak, salmon, dumplings, salads, cheesecake). The attendants at the concierge lounge are amazing! Shoutout to Rochelle who is so sweet and absolutely accommodating. She knows that members on my team often stay late and gave us her extension number for us to call ahead to ask for a saved plate of food. It can't get better than that!The gym is sub-par, but as long as they have a treadmill and a TV, I get what I need out of it. The rooms are so comfortable, spacious and include fridges. Service is great and I always come back to a room that is spick and span. Sometimes, when I leave in a hurry and my clothes are thrown on the floor, the cleaning attendants will even fold and lay out my clothes :OThe Marriott Inner Harbor hotel in Baltimore is the best in town!Very nice hotel in a not very nice area.  Really wouldn't walk around after dark outside.Convenient to Camden Yards and UMMC, but not much else.Very nice room, great beds and amenities, the executive lounge is fantastic, open all day but not Saturdays for some reason.Room service is friendly and the crab soup is great!Overall a great place to stay if you need to be in that area.This hotel is not good. And not just for the price. But extra concerning with the price because it's not cheap. It's seriously outdated. The customer service is bad for the most part - I could give a few examples but I'll leave it at that. I would never plan a conference here or stay here. The conference food was not good, the hotel staff could be heard in the back during sessions, the audio was horrible... My friend had to switch rooms be caused it reaked of smoke. New room had a broken toilet and a Murphy bed. Not a good one. My beds had hair in them. The toiletries were used. My other colleague's room had a giant wet spot on the carpet. Everything just seemed old and dirty. There was no at the concierge when needed. There was cockroaches in the gym. I did report it to the manager and I could tell he heard me and was concerned. I hope the Marriott chain puts some love into this location. Haven't had a bad experience to this degree in a while.From the initial greeting I was not impressed.  The outside decor looks beaten, dated, and weathered.  There is a very odd display of the Orioles gear placed inside of the revolving door, which I  originally mistook for janitorial equipment. The staff seemed very disconnected and gave us half-ass greetings. We go to check in and of course what should have been a room fully paid for by my company was again charged to my credit card, which was over $1000.00!  I told the lady behind the counter that my hotel was previously paid for on our company card and she basically looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language.  She did not make an attempt to rectify the situation or even apologize for the mix up or provide a  solution.  She kept repeating, ""the room is not paid for"". I go ahead and have her charge my card and will deal with the balance with my employer because it was obvious i was getting no where fast with this chic.I go to the restaurant and order dinner which was pretty decent.  Once done im standing at the bell desk to get my bags and theres no one anywhere to be found.  The one person helping at the front desk kept looking in our direction, but did nothing to assist. After several minutes a security guard (who wasnt manning his station ) comes out of nowhere asking if we want our bags. DUH! I politely tucked my tip back in my purse and went to my room, only to find more dated, worn down carpet, furniture,  just about everything. Im a stickler about cleanliness, especially carpet.  I dont want to stay in a hotel where I feel like I cant take my shoes off. NO BUENO. This place needs immediate renovations,  especially to carry the Marriott brand.Naturally I'm always inclined to seek out the Marriott brand because of many amazing past experiences. I was not familiar with this particular location, but decided of the two local Marriott hotels, this would be the better choice, based on my expected plans. Parking: $28 per day....no biggie, but if I'm paying that amount each day I'd think they'd invest in a valet system. For $28 I want to drive up, hand over my valet key and simply walk in. Check-In: Seamless. We were checked-in and given generic hotel information in under 5 minutes. Also taken into consideration was the fact that we were also the only customers in line. They also deserve kudos for allowing us a really early 12pm vs. 4pm standard check-in. Room Location: Totally sucked. On the 6th floor, alllll the way at the end of the hall. I get it, alot of the better rooms were being cleaned so this was definitely the bottom of the barrel at such an early timeframe. Room Amenities: The room was pretty accommodating, albeit much smaller than previous Marriott locations I've frequented. The television was a 40"" flat screen, a hidden refrigerator was located in the the dresser and they provided a microwave upon request. But the bed deserved the standing ovation.....it was freaking AMAZING. I have traveled this great world a few times over and luxuriated in many a fine beds, but this one has been placed in my top 5. I was floating on a cloud of fluffiness, wrapped in marshmallows on an air of Goose-down feathers. Devine....but au contraire my fellow Yelpers.....let us continue. Water Temperature: I usually conduct a function and cleanliness inspection upon arriving. All was well until I checked the water pressure and temperature of the hot water. The pressure was decent but the water temperature was lukewarm at best. I immediately phoned this in to the front desk. She said she'd send a technician up promptly. I had other matters to attend to so I wasn't present when the said technician arrived. Hours later I arrive back in my room, tired, weary and ready for ""that"" shower. Uggggg the water temperature was actually worst! I quickly took the fastest shower of my life and called the front desk again. She wanted to send another technician to my room but it was very late and I was drained....and upset. I was told that a manager would be emailed and would notify me the next morning. That sufficed for the time being. The next day after speaking with management, the hotel comped the daily parking charge for our inconvenience. Overall, decent hotel, convenient location and modern amenities. I'd recommend.The 3 stars is for the over use of security.  It was Baltimore after the riots, but come. on.  All the outer doors were locked and required your key to enter, unless you wanted to go around to the rotating doors around the drop off, where I was almost tagged by a cab.  The hotel itself is nice enough; it's a Marriott.  Nothing spectacular, but certainly nice.  Check in was a little slow and they had messed up our reservation (we were part of a group seminar); later they had charged incorrectly and also charged the group!  I likely wouldn't stay in this area again.  It's a little far from the places I wanted to walk to, but great if you are going to an Orioles game.My King Junior Suite was awesome.  This place is very nice.  The bar / restaurant is lively and has good drinks and food - something most hotels can't say.The staff is friendly and welcoming.  The temperature control was somewhat frustrating as it decided whether it was heat or A/c not yourself. Also a fridge would have been nice.  The parking is expensive, the rooms are expensive, and the internet is expensive.  But it's a Marriott.The hotel was nice but $28 a day for parking is a little absurd.  Parking in the hotel parking garage is the same as parking anywhere else in the city. The beds were nice and there was a mini fridge... Or I think the better term is mini freezer we had put lemons and limes in the fridge and they ended up being completely frozen when we came back from the baseball game.  The staff was super friendly and my only real complaint is the parking price I feel as if I am paying all the money to stay in the hotel I should get a discounted price on the parking.Sorry, Marriott that I didn't review this more timely and closer to the time I stayed. I really love this place. Great location, staff and amenities. Unfortunately I visited during wartime (Baltimore riots).  The staff was very friendly and willing to always help, but at the same time keep their guests protected and safe (it's wartime, remember?). They have this cool concept of serve your own craft brews in the lobby. Great concierge staff with excellent snacks, drinks and full breakfast for those who can access. The gym was very good with all the usual Marriott/ LifeFitness equipment. Very open lobby. Hotel has a protected parking garage. Very close to Camden Yards or the Convention Center.Stayed at the Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards over this past weekend (1 night); our check in was quick,  easy, and we were off to room 705. Nice room, view was of the top of the roof and some of downtown, but we weren't in the Caribbean so the view wasn't a major factor to me. The room was kept, the beds ridiculously comfortable and the shower was good! Later on that night our tv wasn't working so we called the front desk and within moments 2 technicians were there to fix it - unfortunately they could not get the tv to work, and offered us another room. We didn't feel like moving so  we simply hooked up our laptop and PS4 and watched tv that way. it really was no big deal for us,  we were about to head back out for a late dinner anyways. Upon our return (around midnight) we had a card slipped under the door  for complementary breakfast for us all to apologize for the inconvenience which I thought was a great touch. In the morning we were in need of  a microwave for leftovers, and literally within 5 minutes one was at our door - another plus! The $28 parking fee is a bummer, but its actually one of the cheaper rates I've paid when having to pay for parking so it was what it was-although those other times it was valet, so yeah $28 is a bit steep for self-parking. Oh and also, they had cucumber and fruit infused water in the lobby - yes its the little things that excite me. My only real concern is that after leaving my card was  charged an additional $17, but quickly refunded, and now my card has a $60.00 hold on it - which should be $50. Since the amounts are not crazy I will give it a few days to see what the final charge is before I panic.First off--the beds in this hotel are awesome!  Really comfortable and welcoming.  That's the best thing about the hotel as far as I'm concerned!Second best...location, if you are going to a Os game or if you want to walk over to Federal Hill.The service is somewhat impersonal, and the check in / out process feels longer than it should as the people behind the counters seem to constantly be called away or distracted by conversations.  One just odd thing; in the room, there is an envelop for gratuities for the people who clean the room.  Now, I know sometimes people leave money as tips for the cleaning staff, but it seems odd to me that the hotel would print and leave an envelop for that purpose.  Isn't that kind of an admission that they don't think they are paying their staff enough?  Even at a hotel that is charging $400+ per night, are they really saying that they are not giving enough of that rate to the cleaning people so they are asking the customers to dig out another $10 so that their staff is making a decent wage?Is it just me or do you agree this is a weird thing to ask?Why is parking $28 a day here? That's just overpriced. Rather half-hearted greetings from the staff, but a clean and spacious hotel room. The decor seemed dated and in need of remodeling. Little details take a star off or two: the deteriorating tile grout in the bathroom, the literal 7 minute walk from the elevator to my room (this hotel needs more elevator shafts). The bar in the lobby had some interesting beer choices (""Sweet Baby Jesus"" did NOT disappoint) and good food. If it hadn't been for a conference that was held in this hotel I would have checked out. This hotel is overpriced for what it offers in a very seemingly depressed area.If you are visiting Baltimore or just want a fabulous hotel to  stay in for an Orioles or Ravens game do not hesitate to book here.  I can't begin to express the amazing customer service this hotel gives to guests.  Every time I walk into the hotel I am greeted by the staff who genuinely are happy to help.  Also, the hotel has a cool beer wall with areas to to drink on the lobby floor and get out of your room, if needed.Never again. If I could give no star I would.One word: mice.I was staying at the Marriott for a month with a large group on business. Rooms are on the smaller side for such a long stay but typical of a standard hotel room. About 2 weeks into our stay people began complaining of seeing mice in their rooms and in the restaurant area. My third week in I saw a mouse .... YES A MOUSE .... run across my floor in my room and under 1 of the beds. After a few minutes of me completely freaking out it ran from under the bed and out of the room under the room door. NEVER in all of the hotels I have stayed in across the country have I ever had to deal with this. Sidebar: I keep my hotel rooms very tidy .... I'm the person who straightens up before room service comes. So the mouse was not attracted to anything left thrown around my room!When I contacted to front desk all they offered was to move me to another room ..lol ummm thanks but that's not really any help.1. I have a months worth of stuff with me to move so it's not really convenient 2. If there are mice in the restaurant and the 3rd floor they are more than likely running around the whole establishment! I told the woman at the front desk I was not the first person to have a complaint about mice and suggested they do something to set traps or poison around but they said they can't do that in occupied rooms. The woman at the front desk said she would ""let maintenance know.""As far as the staff outside of this incident everyone has been very friendly. Wifi is slow, tv channel options are slim to none, no free continental breakfast. The location is not so great ... Go a few blocks opposite of the harbor and you end up in a not so nice area. Can't comment on price as my stay was covered by my employer.We decided to spend the New Year downtown at the Baltimore Harbor. Although we only live about 25 minutes from Baltimore city we didn't want the hassle of driving home and staying at the harbor gave us a night out, so why not!  Arriving at the Camden Yards Marriott was pretty easy. We payed $27 for guest parking for the night. Arriving in the lobby we were greeted by a super festive atmosphere!  They provided complimentary glasses of champagne, Sangria and another beverage. The hotel staff was very friendly and warm. We were checked in very quickly and the attendant that helped us was great, we even got complimentary New Years party favors!  Quick stop at the bar provided great service and a free shot! The place was also decorated to the hilt for the Holidays. Our room had a great view of the city and was very clean with soft bedding. We ordered room service. Room service is always expensive so I won't knock them on the prices because that's always expected. We ordered eggs Benedict and a breakfast sandwich and both were good.  I think my only complaints would be that the walls are extremely thin and the room temperature is a bit hard to regulate. We heard EVERYTHING that was going on in the room next to us all hours of the night... no further details on that.  So needless to say my sleep was less than enjoyable.  All and all I would more than likely stay there again, but hope for quiet neighbors.Concierge was fantastic. Shower is awesome. Love the water pressure. The bed is ohh so fluffy. I wish there'd be more pillows! Smoking area is very comfortable and i love it coz i feel safe there. Well lit and the hotel has provided really nice furnitures there. Thumbs up for that. However, i am just not happy with the wifi. It's 2015. Wifi should be free! We paid for the high speed internet (12.95$ per day) is not worth it. Too slow. And oh, the hotel rooms are not really good with sound proofing. Walking down the quiet hall and hearing laughter from one of the rooms was spooky!What you expect from a Marriott and close to everything.A very nice hotel. Clean on the outside. Staff super friendly and courteous. Room was spacious and clean.  Sufficiently sized desk, TV, bathroom. AC worked excellently. Bathroom amenities plentiful, towels soft and huge, there's a bath robe in the closet. Water pressure more than adequate, temperature easily controlled. Fitness room includes elliptical machines, treadmills, stationary bikes for cardio and dumb-bells and a cable machine for weight training. Pool looked clean but I did not use it. There is a bar within and our bartender, Mike, treated us very well. There is a city-owned parking garage attached. It should be noted, there's a fire station across the street so you'll hear sirens during your stay. That being said, I did not hear a single siren at night, not saying the FD didn't respond, but they probably used the siren less than they would during the day. You won't be sorry staying here","nice place, clean and staff was very nice, great bloody Mary'sWe reserved a room in November of last year as part of a group. Over half a year later, and 8 days before an event, they cancelled our reservation, saying they had overbooked, and moved us several blocks away to a different hotel. Don't reserve a room here unless you don't wish to actually stay at this hotel.Hotel location is great for the convention center, games, and inner harbor area. The rooms are good and the beds are super comfortable although I wish there was an intermediate blanket. It was only sheet and comforter so I was either freezing or roasting depending on the room ac being on or off. Room was very clean and the maid service was very good.No free wi-fi except in the lobby. It's 2014 right? It was also pricey. I wouldn't be opposed to saying at this Marriott again but I also wouldn't seek it out either.I came up to this hotel during the weekend of BronyCon 2014 and was, at first, disappointed to not be staying at the hotel directly connected to the convention center, but of course, my mind was changed. Not only were the rooms clean and fresh, but the service was fantastic. The hotel staff went out of their way to make BronyCon attendees feel welcome. Not only did they open their Chesapeake room for bronies to sit in and relax, but they also donned pony merchandise, gave discounts to those with con badges, and looped pony episodes all day on an internal channel, at no cost. I will definitely be making an effort to get back at this hotel come next year! For those who can't stand the cold, you'll have to fiddle with your room thermostat. It seemed constantly cold in my room.This is my go-to hotel when going to my annual summer Orioles weekend. Love the location, love the Marriott beds, and the breakfast is spot-on. Parking garage can be a tad confusing, but aren't they all?Completely DISGUSTED with my entire experience at this property. From the rude reservationist at the front desk to the lack of professionalism when dealing with hotel staff. The deal breaker was when finally getting ready to retire for the night, we find our room (room 234) had a MOUSE running around in the room with us.  I repeat - a MOUSE!! Never in all my years of traveling have I had mice in a hotel room. I will never, ever stay at this hotel again and I will be sharing my experience over Yelp, Twitter and with all my friends and colleagues. Get your act together, Marriott. Unacceptable.I was happy enough with this Marriott!  Like several other Yelpers who wrote reviews, I had access to the Concierge Lounge on the tenth floor.  This lounge serves a pretty decent buffet breakfast, as well as evening ""snacks"" and dessert.  The room has a big screen TV that's usually blaring traffic, weather and crime reports.  Otherwise, the only other negative worth mentioning is the automatic ""espresso machine,"" which looks like a chemistry set when it's opened for restocking.  (I might be the Van Houtte ""Single-Cup"".)  My advice is to avoid it in favor of the normal drip coffee, which is A-OK.Speaking of coffee: The in-room coffee maker is an old-style drip.  Pod machines make better coffees these days.Here is some more information: I checked in at 1AM and got a warm and courteous reception from the night guy.  My room was comfortable and mostly quiet; there was occasional noise (especially TV noise) from the room next door, which was separated from my room by a double door (for use by families who need adjoining rooms).  The heater was not noisy, and the thermostat worked well.I liked the WiFi instructions (""Wired-for-Business"") in the room.  ""Step 1: Ensure that your device is WIFI ready.""  You can imagine the calls to tech support: ""How come my device won't connect to the network?""  Answer: ""It's not ready.""  The network, by the way, was pretty fast -- download 10.5 Mbps, upload 9.25 Mbps. Also, it was a bit unstable.The shower was fine, though it was counterintuitive to have to turn the knob clockwise for hotter water and counter-clockwise for colder water.The workout room was OK when it wasn't full.  I went down one morning at 5:30AM and found that the two stationary bikes were both taken!The rooms were clean and comfortable. The cleaning staff were kind. I am not one to give bad feedback but the fact that as a guest paying over 300 a night you are charged 30 a day parking is outrageous. There were some abrupt desk staff and miserable Starbucks employees. Next time I will stay at the days inn.I recently stayed at the Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards and when I checked in the attendant made a mistake and charge my credit card twice. I went back to the front desk later that evening and spoke with a manager who was not nice. I went back the next day and spoke with the Assistant Rooms Operation Manager, Dedre Blackmore who went over and beyond and got the problem corrected sending a  letter (fax) to the bank and made sure that the double charges were taken off the card that day. That is great customer service and I would recommend this Marriott property to anyone staying in Baltimore. The rooms were great the service was awesome!Thank you V. Robinson***This Marriott is very close to Oriole Park at Camden Yards, which makes it a decent option if you are just catching a ballgame; the hotel could use an update though to make it more enjoyable for a longer stay and more worth their high room rates***Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards has a great location if watching an Oriole game is your primary reason for visiting Baltimore.  This hotel is about one-to-two blocks away from the stadium's entrance.  It is very convenient.  It is also near the popular Inner Harbor waterfront area, which features great views and lots of touristy stuff (the stuff you would find at Santa Monica Pier or Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco...it seems touristy waterfront areas, regardless of the city, must feature a Bubba Gump Shrimp).The hotel itself is just okay.  This Marriott could probably use an update.  The rooms are pleasant enough, but they feel outdated.  Beds are comfortable though.  The same goes for the shower and the room temperature.Noise is kind of an issue.  The A/C unit is quite loud and this Marriott is located very close to a police station and a fire house and I heard quite a few sirens at night on my visit.The amenities are consistent with other Marriott hotels.  The fitness center is 24 hours and Wi-Fi Internet access requires an additional fee (complimentary for Marriott Gold and Platinum members).Marriott Gold and Platinum members also have access to the Concierge Lounge (on the 10th floor) and it is a decent one.  In terms of the layout, the biggest plus is the variety of seating options.  There are counter chairs and tables like most Marriott Concierge Lounges, but there are also couches for more relaxing near the flat screen television.The food at night features a good variety of items.  On my visit, there was crudite  (raw vegetables like celery, carrots and cherry tomatoes) and dip.  There was also packaged potato chips, crackers, and cheese.  The cheese was better than quite a few Marriott Concierge Lounges--brie was even available here.In terms of hot options, there was enough to make a meal.  There were chicken quesadilla cones, which were average at best (the bottle of hot sauce was really needed since the quesadillas lacked flavor).  There was also macaroni and cheese with ham and a crispy breadcrumb topping.  The macaroni and cheese was pretty decent--cheesy and creamy.Desserts included some decent gingerbread and two not-so-great desserts--a very dense chocolate chip bar and a kind of dry coffee cake.  This Concierge Lounge also had its own espresso / latte / hot chocolate machine, but the hot chocolate was lacking in chocolate flavor and was very watery.  It was nowhere near as good as the hot chocolate machine at JW Marriott LA LIVE's Executive / Concierge Lounge.Breakfast in the Concierge Lounge was decent.  There was good scrambled eggs and mediocre sausage (probably the breakfast would be better when they serve bacon).  Oatmeal, cheese and fresh fruit were available.  There was also a decent variety of breakfast pastries, breads, muffins, bagels, and breads.  I tried the croissant and it was okay, but it lacked the flakiness and light crispiness of the croissant in the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown's Concierge Lounge.Service was good and friendly.Room rates can be high here (weekdays and weekends) because of its prime location.Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards is an okay choice if you are catching a baseball game and are staying over for just one night.  It is expensive though.  I think the Fairfield Inn (a little farther away but still within walking distance) is a better choice.  That LEED-certified Fairfield Inn features much more modern decor as well as a more reasonable room rate than this Marriott.Parking is available via a pay parking structure that is attached to the hotel; it is a quick walk to get to your car from the hotel lobby (not always the case with hotel parking).  Parking is $26 per day.I have been staying here for 2 weeks, while some things work out okay, I dislike the fact that my AC squeaks and roar in the middle of the night, and that I can never get enough towels in the bathroom. I will not be staying here on my next trip.Pretty good hotel. My room was clean, my bed was comfy, but my pillows were almost too comfortable. Staff here is very friendly and easily approachable. My only gripe is the lack of a pool, and the gym is lackluster. May I suggest getting free weights less than 10lbs?I stayed here due to the snow storm.  The room was very clean, smelled wonderful.  Beds were comfortable.  The only thing I wasn't happy about was they charged me a day and a half fee instead of a day fee. I work nights and didn't check in until the morning and asked for a 6 pm checkout. So I had to pay the full fee and a four hour fee. I doubt the rooms were filled up and thought there should be a better understanding. Overall good experience. Would stay there again.OMG!!! Beautiful hotel and close to everything!!! We had a King size room and it was very spacious...Customer service could have been better...Great place love my king size bed. Top notch cleaning crew and attendance. Great place to stay.We had a wonderful experience at the Marriott Inner Harbor last weekend when we stayed for the Baltimore Marathon. The hotel is in the best area, easy walking distance to the start and finish areas, right by Camden Yards and Ravens stadium and the Expo.They provided welcome bags at check in with water, bananas, gu, and info and had a  runners' relaxation room off the lobby (cool towels, water, bananas). They even provided a large map in the lobby of the race and we encountered a staff person one time giving advice on the course - amazing!I also want to mention the biggest perk of all, the ability to have a 2pm check out and extended parking garage hours. This allowed the runners to return and shower before check out. This was awesome and such a wonderful advantage.We walked through some other big hotels in the same area and there was nothing like the Marriott provided.Lousy service and attitude.  Put my room service order for breakfast on the door before the printed deadline, but no breakfast the next morning.  I called and they simply said they often collect orders earlier in the evening and must have missed it as if this were my fault.  How am I supposed to know this when the menu states ""before midnight""?  Then I asked about the ""it's on time or it's on us"" printed guarantee.  Their response was ""that's only if an order is more than an hour late"" - note that they have 15 minute windows for delivery printed on the menu.  I'm here for business - if it says that it will be delivered between 7:15-7:30 am but arrives at 8:30 am, that's too late as I'll be at my meeting.We went here for a wedding and unfortunately for us there was a playoff game going on. Needless to say the staff was unprofessional and overwhelmed. The receptionist was rude and had little information. Worst of all out room stank like smoke and we had to be moved. Overall I would have rather spent the night at a different hotel.We will not be back!Stayed recently for a conference and couldn't be more pleased.  Hotel staff was always friendly and ready to help.  We arrived early and our room was ready.  High praise to the housekeeping staff as our room was always neat and clean!One of the best views in the city.  Perfect if you are staying in town for a game.  Fantastic lobby, very upscale.  Rooms are clean and outstanding.","Stayed here many times.   This is my first Yelp review for this specific Marriott.  Nice rooms.  Actually pretty quiet for being downtown/inner harbor area.  Gets busy in the summer with the Orioles are winning.  Last time here I stayed in the suites on the second floor.  Larger rooms but right above the loading docks so at 5:30 am you going to hear them loading and unloading.  Rest of the rooms are great.   Concierge not open on weekends but they'll give you points or a continental breakfast to make up for it.  Bar and restaurant are small and get crowded very quickly.  Not a fan of the restaurant layout but the food is good.  Bottom line....it's my place to stay in Baltimore.Cons: room was small and had that sort-of-dirty-like-a-motel appearance and smell; tried to call the front desk 3 times, and the phone rang without ever being picked up -- I had to go down to the front desk to get any servicePro: good continental breakfast in the concierge loungeDepends on how you look at it: across the street from a strip clubConclusion: not what I expect from a MarriottWorst experience in a hotel. It is a old hotel with a dated heating system. First my room was too cold, then oven hot. The service person who came to look at it said he would check back with me and never did. I was going to let my stay slide but then after midnight when I was in bed, a man tried to get in my room. As a female traveling alone, it was unsettling to say the least. I told him someone was in the room. I tried to let it go but 15 minutes later he came back and tried to get in again. Through the door I told him again someone was in the room and he said he had been given that room. I called the front desk and they asked if I wanted to talk to Loss Prevention. At nearly 1 am I said no, send security to make sure this man gets to his room. In the morning I went down to share my stressful experience and was offered a free breakfast, not to talk to a manager. Nothing. Oh yes my co-worker had to get her key card fixed three times as she couldn't get in her room. So I don't recommend this place to anyone.We had a wonderful experience staying at this Marriott! Everyone on the staff was super nice and helpful upon our arrival, and the rooms were clean and offered all of the amenities you'd expect from such a nice hotel in the city. Since we were going to the O's game, the location couldn't have been much better, either. The beds were seriously comfortable enough that my wife and I walked away wanting to replace our own mattress with one of theirs. Haha.We also were lucky to land great prices on Priceline that only magnified the pleasant experience. $90/night for two weekend nights...during baseball season? Yeah...we'll be staying there again, for sure!I like the Marriott chain. You always know what you're going to get with one of their hotels -- nicely decorated and modern room with a comfortable bed, good service, and a relatively clean hotel. This isn't a five star place, but for the average traveler this has most of the amenities you could want (except a pool). They've got wireless internet in their rooms for about $12 a day. Parking is expensive at $24 a day, but that's to be expected since the location is two blocks north of Camden Yards. It's close to the convention center, football and baseball stadiums, and the Inner Harbor so it's ideal for tourists and business travelers. On the negative side, my room while nicely decorated, looked a little worn with pealing wallpaper, broken baseboards, and beat up furniture. The water in the shower didn't get very hot. Even after turning it up all the way it was lukewarm, at best. Still, I'd recommend this place to anyone staying in Baltimore.So, I've been travelling to Baltimore every week for work since beginning of May, and this has been my home for the entire time so far.I love the beds. Seriously. SOO COMFY!!Staff is always friendly especially the doormen.If you have elite access, you have access to the concierge lounge on the 10th floor, which means free breakfast.What else? Oh yea you gotta pay for WiFi. BUT, it's pretty awesome that there are free oranges and earphones downstairs at the gym for after your workout.Enjoy!Stayed here for a wedding in Baltimore last year.The hotel itself is pretty nice.  Limited bar, but solid placement right across the street from Camden Yards.  Room was accomodating and spacious.  Bathroom was clean and large.Only gripes are parking, which is a royal pain in get into.  Not to mention EXPENSIVE.  I'm already getting ripped off to stay at the hotel, and now I'm getting bled even more just for the priviledge to park at the same hotel.  If you pull up to the front of the hotel, you have to cut across traffic and make about 4 left hand turns, then search for the parking garage.Nice hotel, conveniently located near the Inner Harbor, walking distance the stadium, close to Johns Hopkins Hospital. Restaurant on site. Clean and well maintained rooms. Semi-attached garage...Customer service was superb ;)Other than that parking was $24/night with in and out privileges, no free breakfast, business center was like 50 cents minute which doesn't include the cost of printing, wifi in your room was an additional cost...I will not be backI'm such a Marriott girl. I love their hotels for their excellent service and comfortable rooms, and this Marriott in Baltimore is no exception. The staff here is incredibly kind. The employees in the lobby, from the security guards to the concierge, were all nice, accommodating, and friendly! The cleaning staff always greeted me whenever I passed by, and always offered extra amenities (towels, shampoo, etc.) without my asking.The employees at the bar were friendly and thoughtful when they kept refilling my coffee cup after I froze my pinstriped behind off at Camden Yards that evening.Oh, and speaking of, I love that it's right across the street from Camden Yards! Talk about convenient! The Inner Harbor is only a few blocks away ... but I came to see some baseball, and this was the perfect hotel for doing just that.I think that the Concierge Lounge fell short as compared to some of the other ones I've been to. Traditionally, the breakfast hours are usually spent quietly in the lounge, with a few businessmen reading WSJ or watching the news and eating a plate of eggs &amp; sausage. On every day of our stay, there were large, loud groups of families in the lounge, and the food couldn't be replenished quickly enough. My poor boyfriend wanted nothing more than a bowl of oatmeal, and every day of our 3-night stay they ran out (and yes, we got there with an hour to spare). Same goes for sausage, cereal, and coffee (!!). I can safely say that the state of the Concierge Lounge was the most disappointing part of our stay.But I mean, the room was great (very clean!) &amp; comfortable; the staff was excellent; the wifi, while not free, was strong &amp; reliable. I would love to stay here again the next time I come to Baltimore.What a pleasant experience... we knew we were coming to Baltimore awhile ago to see an Orioles game. so we just decided to see what Priceline would yield us near the Inner Harbour.   We couldn't have gotten luckier... For $90 a night, plus $26 for parking we got to stay at the Marriott Inner Harbor at Camden Yards.  So close to the stadium!  Nice, clean hotel, nice and updated.  Friendly staff too.  Convenient to a lot of things too. We were really surprised as I travel a decent amount for work and have paid over 200.00 and 300.00 a night for a crappier experience in a not updated hotel with bad service.  Rooms were really clean too (see my review of the Cincinnatti Marriott on Mason Montgomery Rd).  A+++++++I have stayed a bunch of hotels over the years and have stayed at plenty Marriott's.  I was there for a wedding over the weekend and I wasn't pleased how the hotel operated.  Rooms were fine, wedding was wonderful but some of the staff seemed grumpy and didn't want to help.  Comparing this Marriott to other Marriott's, it wasn't a good experience.    Don't get me wrong, there were some nice people but what you get for your money, this wouldn't be my first pick.The staff is so friendly, the rooms are comfortable and safe. The food is really good, in a convenient part of town. You should stay here when in Baltimore.This review is for the conference facilities only. I'm sure the rooms are nice. I know the doorman is super pleasant.The room was plenty big for the number of people that attended the conference (about 300+) since it was just seating in rows to listed to lecture style presenters with their PowerPoint. However, the audio visual part was abysmal. Even though the screen in front was very large it was still hard to see anything except the largest print.  Maybe I should have sat closer to the front but I'm thinking you should be able to see and hear from anywhere in the room.The sound was kind of muted, too. Yeah.  I could hear the presenter if I really listened hard and didn't get distracted by other people but if the volume had been a little louder (not much, just a little louder) it would have been perfect.The cookies and ice cream provided as part of the conference before the presentation and during the break were great. I know at things like this it is the hotel that provides everything from soup to nuts, so I was kinda surprised the audio-visual aspects weren't up to standards. Oh well.In short: this is a very mediocre Marriott property. I stayed here for about 3 months during an extended project in Baltimore and was continuously unimpressed. I generally stay about 100+ nights / year in Marriott hotels and was the least satisfied with my stay at the Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor. Overall it felt unpolished - the room service took forever, the rooms were musty and outdated, and the experience at the front desk was mixed. The location: incredible if you're heading to a game at Camden Yards. Otherwise, forget about it. None of the good restaurants are within walking distance and cabs in Baltimore are an experience reminiscent of visiting the dentist. Whether you're headed to Baltimore for vacation or business, I suggest one of the other hotels closer to the Harbor, namely the Renaissance or any of the newer hotels east of the Harbor.2/19/14 - I stayed here recently for 3 nights and found this to be a decent place.   It's over priced if you pay over $100 but I suppose it would depend on the season and the demand.  I was here when it snowed and the local area seemed shut down without too many good restaurants in the immediate area as someone has already pointed out.  But, the light rail, Camden Yards for Orioles fans, University of Maryland -Baltimore, Inner Harbor, Convention Center are all within walking distance.The Front desk was hospitable but I did feel slighted when another guest was telling me how he was treated.   Not sure why they ""mistreated"" me but it kept them from getting another star for the uneven treatment that ended costing me money.   The lobby was not very comfortable but felt cramped and just functional.  No points for the lobby, Marriott!  You must have bought this place on a fire sale years back because it evidently isn't one of your own designs.The gym was acceptable with perhaps 30 or more types of equipment -- all with television and earphones available and free oranges, small towels.The meeting rooms were acceptable but smaller than what we normally use but not as compact as I've been in a previous location.  We could hear through the moving partitions during our meetings however and it got to be a distraction. As our meetings don't end in the morning, I usually ask for a complimentary extension and they usually give me an hour.   THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE FRONT DESK CLERK SAID: ""HOW ABOUT 30 MINUTES!?""   My first reaction is that he is either kidding or just plain stingy with a resource that really doesn't cost Marriott anything but gives goodwill.   Evidently, they don't need much goodwill except that it provides me with a unique story for time immemorial -- do you get it now, Marriott?!  :)    But, I graciously accepted the 30 minutes without complaint.    Evidently our group is not spending enough here.  So, the bed was nice -- but too many damn pillows.   The walk to the room was down a long hall and so it was a tiring, long haul -- but I probably need the exercise.Our group will be back and I'll end up loving it for hotel management's minimalist attitude.    Oh, yes, the parking is $26 but that seems to be standard in Baltimore.  For the amount of time we spend outside our meetings, and the lack of interesting restaurants in the neighborhood, we should be going to a place that has free parking in the 'burbs or airport.    I'll see if i can make this happen.   :)I have stayed at this Marriott several times over the past few years and I have to admit it wasn't my first choice. Other properties seemed to provide better service. However on this trip, we booked a room for five nights and we have been very happy. The front desk staff was extremely helpful when we arrived and our room was very nice (10th floor Concierge Level). The redecorated lobby is very nice and the new restaurant decor is very pleasing. Food is not bed either. The Concierge lounge is nice. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food selection is above average. The fact that they close the place for cleaning from 10am until ?? is a bit annoying since I am used to being able to pop in to use the computer or get a beverage during the morning, especially if I sleep in past breakfast. Overall we had a great stay and this hotel moved up a couple notches. The location is a must if you are going to Camden Yards or the Convention Center.Wow! What an awesome hotel. I didn't realize what I had booked until the taxi cab driver dropped me off at the front door! Beautiful entrance and lobby and very nice rooms. Interestingly, I didn't think the main entrance was on the side you would expect it to be on. In fact, it faces one of the less busy streets which I guess is a good thing. The best part is that there is free wifi and that it is a 5 min WALK to the University of Maryland hospital. Two blocks down and 1 block over!Probably the worst Marriott I've ever stayed in. I've just spent 25 nights at this particular location, and I must say that my level of disappointment is extremely high. When I hear the name ""Marriott"" I think of terms like ""up scale"", ""modern"", and ""homey"". This hotel made me feel none of these things. The most appalling revelation of this hotels short comings were the rats in the hotel. On more than one occasion I had to personally chase a rat out of my room, only to watch it scurry into the room directly across the hall from my own. I would expect more cleanliness from a Motel 6, much less a Marriott. Apparently I'm not the only quest who experienced these furry little creatures in my room if you continue to read further reviews. Furthermore, the amenities of the hotel are lacking in more areas than just having a healthy rodent population. The TVs in the rooms have a grand total of roughly 12-15 channels to choose from, so if you're like me and prefer to relax by watching your favorite cable television shows, this is not the hotel for you. Thank goodness I was forward thinking enough to bring along my laptop so that at the very least I had Neflix, HBO Go, ect.. or I truly would have been in hell. The food in the hotels' bar/lounge/restaurant is mediocre to good at best. Certainly, it's way over priced for what it is. With the abundance of other hotels in close proximity to Camden Yards and M&amp;T Bank Stadium (home of the Ravens) you can certainly find something much more suitable to even the most modest of taste in terms of accommodations. The only reason I'm not demanding more from the hotel during my stay, is because my stay here is being paid for by the company for whom I work. I would not pay a dime to stay at this hotel when Baltimore has so much more to offer. I highly recommend the Hyatt Regency if you're looking for a place worthy of your money..I actually enjoyed my stay here.  It's a solid 3-3.5 start hotel done well.  Clean, courteous, super comfy beds.  I'd definitely stay here again.We had a great weekend staying at this Marriott. I wasn't sure what to expect, but we were immediately greeted by the friendly staff in the lobby -- they even offered us s'mores!  The staff was always super friendly, and the beautiful lobby always had fruit-flavored water for guests.  We got placed in a room on the 10th floor, which had a very nice view of the city. Room was immaculately clean and smelled fresh. Bed was amazingly comfortable. They let us check our luggage for free after we checked out so we could wander the city without heavy bags. Really great experience, and we were sad to leave! Would definitely stay again.","A bit pRicy but totttttally worth it !!! Beautiful, clean room ! Ridiculously comfortable bed- newly renovated lobby and some of the friendliest staff in the world ! Couldn't afford to do it every weekend but sometimes it's worth it to treat ureself rather than cheat ureself !!!Disclaimer: This review will only cover the conference facilities. I attended a three-day multi-room conference at the end of April, and did not stay in the hotel (too expensive!).For a large corporate hotel, this Marriott was NOT well-equipped for a conference. Yes, it has many rooms, with fancy-sounding names such as ""Ballroom"" and ""Stadium"", but fancy they are not. The audiovisual equipment is RUBBISH (although, the audiovisual guys are LOVELY and very capable and sweetly apologetic about the hotel facilities). The rooms are dismally lit (apparently there is no way to put the lights down up front near the projector screen without dimming the entire room), the microphone podiums are awkward (if you are using a laptop, you won't have room for anything else... not even your elbow), and sound clatters through the front and back doorways in EVERY room, with some rooms transmitting far too much sound from neighbouring rooms too.If you're going to offer up your hotel for a conference, you better make damn sure you realize how to accommodate professional presentations. In several of the rooms, the microphones were so placed that each time a speaker cleared their throat, there was enough feedback to deafen an entire pod of dolphins. In one room, despite the efforts of our AV assistants, we experienced feedback whenever a NEIGHBOURING room applauded.Efforts to move rooms or replace the AV equipment were shut down by upper management-types.Catering the event was a shit-show, too. Food ran out at every break. Requests to refill the water fountains (giving presentations is thirsty work!) were ignored. Spills and crumbs were vacuumed and cleaned loudly only during the conference sessions, much to the dismay of presenters already combatting the ill-equipped AV systems.Seriously, Marriott -- wtf?Of course, the location, the grandeur, the fact that the hotel was big enough to accommodate our 300+ strong crowd were all benefits, and the only reason this Marriott gets two stars instead of one.3.5 Stars!Pros: -Great location, easy to walk to the inner harbor, museums, aquarium and Lexington market.-SUPER comfortable beds, I got an extra 90mins of sleep because of the sheer comfort of the mattress.-Nice size gym with updated equipment (Not that I used it but I went to check it out so I could let you knowCons:-No safes in the room-You have to pay for wi-fi-Lacked Luster; and by this I mean that it was nice, clean, and functional but it wasn't anything to really experience within the hotel itself.  There was not much of a bar scene or chic feeling in the lobby.Walkable and convenient to Hilton and BCC (Baltimore Convention Center)Wifi is $13/day in the room.Comfortable room.I stayed here for a business trip.  I understand that the hotel is in the middle of a renovation, but I'm not sure that's even the reason I was so displeased.  The hotel is extremely dated.  I couldn't find vending machines or ice machines.  Signage says they are on every other floor (why not every floor?), but the staff pointed me to the lobby.  The bar area didn't sell bottled water - I had to go to the front desk for that.  So in the middle of the night if you're thirsty, you have to go to the front desk?  Bizarre.  One evening I had no hot water in my shower.  It returned in the morning luckily.  Since my company was paying for the hotel I didn't bother mentioning it to the staff.I was snowed in here all weekend due to a work conference. One awesome thing is that a crazy friend of mine drove up from southern Md. to be snowed in with me.Overall, 2.5-ish stars.This is one of the business-flavored Marriotts, but man they suck you dry. The business center nearly made me slit my wrists. You had to swipe your credit card to do anything, and on top of that I think it's ludicrous they don't offer free wifi throughout the hotel, but just in the lobby.The rooms were clean and we all know the Marriott bed is the next best thing to sleeping at the Westin. They know it too; you can even purchase the bed online at <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmarriott.com%2Fcategory.aspx%3F%26category1%3DMarriottBed%26category1Name%3DThe%2BMarriott%2BBed%26categoryLevel%3D0&amp;s=25f345dd475ebae35e62d5115af996b765f5025433a6f736d58ae4a6c91a6400"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">shopmarriott.com/categor...</a>The food here was the definition of mediocre, and when you're snowed in eating every meal here, it starts to feel like you're at an all-inclusive in Mexico or something--everything tastes the same and nothing's delicious. The staff were on point, and they went the extra mile this weekend to appease all the snowed in customers: bingo and a DJ dance party on Friday night, Wii bowling on Saturday night. I would return for sure--it's a decent stay--but would dine elsewhere in the city. Unfortunately we didn't have that option this weekend.Free wifi, a mini fridge in the room, a fan in the bathroom (for when drunk people sneak cigs) and two more creamers at the in-room coffee station would earn this establishment four stars.Great hotel if you're a baseball fan. It's walking distance to the Oriole Stadium and the Babe Ruth Museum. Parking is a whopping $26 per night. Thank goodness for Priceline the room was only $65 per night. The staff here is friendly and helpful! The rooms were clean and up to par with the star rating.First let me state that I did not stay in one of the rooms at the hotel, I just met my friend for drinks here. Now that we have moved past this let's get into the review!I must say that the decor inside the lobby of this hotel is completely spectacular and very modern. There are purple couches with gold pillows, leather white swivel chairs and fish tanks. Oh and let's not forget that wonderful staircase. As I waited for my friend to arrive I must say that I was immediately relaxed in the cozy atmosphere.The bar area was quite nice although our waiter was a little strange. He spoke so fast you could barely understand him. But who needs a rundown of the menu when you came to drink? LolOverall, I would definetely like to go back for another cocktail :)The Marriott Inner Harbor is a nice hotel for a fairly good value (comparatively to the other downtown Baltimore hotels).  The interior is modern and clean and the hotel is actually scheduled for a renovation soon.  Everything else is better than average, but not 5-star.  The hospitality staff are friendly and try, but it's just not quite there yet.  The concierge lounge is nice, with a good variety for breakfast (although no hot eggs/bacon), and happy hour/desserts.  Location is walking distance to the Inner Harbor area and across the street from the Orioles stadium, Camden Yard, but as a lone female traveler, I wouldn't want to be walking around the area much after dark.would NEVER stay here again. Came in from out of town to go to a baseball game and got their best room. it was awful...old, terrible view. But I can deal w/ that. What I can't deal w/ is how cheap they were. Not enough toiletries given. had to call up for EVERYTHING and they made us wait an hour to hour and a half every time. I can't say 1 good thing about our stay there.The Baltimore Marriott Inner Harbor is short walk from Camden Station and a slightly longer walk to the Inner Harbor. Check-in is usually speedy except when you're stuck behind a large group.The concierge lounge has cold cuts, sliced cheese, scrambled eggs, assorted pastries, cut fruit, cereal, bread, yogurt, and assorted drinks for breakfast. In the evening, they have two hot hors d'oeuvres, a cheese plate, and desserts.At the end of one stay, I'd forgotten a pair of tennis shoes in the closet. The following week, I called and within two hours, someone dropped by with my shoes in a Marriott plastic bag.TV reception wasn't the same quality in all the rooms. Sometimes, the TV would be fine, and other times, the TV would be snowy. While I was there, they were doing maintenance on the elevators so there were only two working elevators. During peak times, you could look forward to a packed elevator, long wait or both.The gym has three elliptical machines, five or so treadmills, and a weight machine. There's a water dispenser, cups, and hand towels but you might want to bring your own water bottle. My friend preferred the gym at one of the Sheratons.Always enjoy staying at Marriott brands but this one has a place in my heart for a few reasons.  It's close to Camden Yards, and being a baseball fan, the access is very convenient.  Don't be fooled though - the ""Inner Harbor"" brand is misleading.  It's easily a 10 minute walk to the shops and water taxi, things that make the inner harbor tick.  But the Camden Yards part isn't, that's for sure! You can see the lights on game nights!  It's a typical Marriott with top-notch customer service and accommodations.  However, I would  be remiss if I did not bring up one of the largest selling points and that is their BREAKFAST BUFFET!!!  Design your own omelet stations, make your own waffles, biscuits and gravy, sausage and bacon and pastries...oh my!  Considering I am from NY, their prices for a buffet are very reasonable (though if I lived in MD, truthfully, I  have no idea if they think that way).  If I stay in a different hotel, I always make it a point to hit the buffet, that's the truth!  I rarely drive to B-more anymore, but when I did I remember parking was over $20/day.  They screw you in the drive thru, that's for sure, but that's in most cities where you opt to park in a garage.  I haven't stayed here in a while, but I always make it a point to visit when I am there!Marriott standard.  That's what you expect, that's what you pay for. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Good air-conditioning in rooms.  ONE complaint: The nice, new LG flat screen was hooked up to an ANALOG signal. Pony up the extra $$$ Marriott,  come on.Soft bed, and expected Marriott service, I did want to express my shock with the poor concierge service...  The rest of the staff was very nice and helpful, and the chef left his post to offer samples of his bacon-almond brittle, which I may add, was pretty darn good.  But that concierge... short of making fun of me, was not interested (and seemingly bothered) in assisting me in finding a local Zumba class. From the ZUMBA?  WHAT IS THAT? To, well sir, is there a Gold Gym nearby?  ""NO, It closed, sorry I can't help you""  with a snort and a snicker, click.  Jerk.  I guess he was at the end of his shift.  Or maybe at the end of his career.  Or maybe unamused with the environment.  Whatever it was, this poor man should probably do something else.  I hope that at a minimum someone told him what Zumba is and how to find it... Or maybe to find something else to do than to be so... uninterested, and it showed...This is a great hotel, very clean. Little bit of construction around it but that should be finished soon. Good Staff, free internet in the lobby and easy to get around the city from here. Be careful on game nights you might have some trouble with traffic.Great location, nice room. Room service was pretty good. Wish I had a better view and free wi fi. 3.5 starGreat and accommodating service in the lobby.  Room service is very quick and has a decent selection, even late at night.  unlike other marriotts, this one charges for use of the computers/printers in the business center.Yard lobby restaurant is not a ""typical"" hotel restaurant/bar...that's a good thing.I really wanted to give this place NO stars when I first got there this past weekend.  We arrived in the ridiculous heat around 2:30pm, and just wanted to lay down for a while before the baseball game, and they said our room wouldn't be available for an hour to 1 1/2.  wtf?  Annoying.  Ended up being okay, room service food was actually really good, and pretty fast.  The room was clean, bright, and good sized.  They need more elevators, we had to wait every time.  VERY convenient to Camden Yards which was excellent since we were not about to rent a car.  A few restaurants near the hotel, but you have to walk at least 3-4 blocks or so to find shops and most eating options.  Not a long walk normally, but in the 100 degree heat, it was pretty unpleasant.Stayed here during Otakon. The room was clean and the hotel was nice. Only things I didn't like was lack of free wi-fi in your room.The hotel was very comfortable, even in the midst of renovation. Construction noise could be heard in the middle of the day, but ended well before evening. The cafe and bar are fine. The Starbucks/convenience store makes a sugary mocha. The concierge lounge breakfast is decent. The only major negative is that there is no free Wi-Fi, anywhere in the building. Hint: there's free Wi-Fi at the Holiday Inn across the street. I was in Baltimore for a convention and the hotel is just a short walk away. If I were in Baltimore for other reasons, I'd stay elsewhere as the immediate area doesn't have much to offer after nightfall and the neighborhood gets a little dodgy just a few blocks away in most directions.","This is a very nice hotel. The rooms are modern and beds are comfortable, not to many restaurants in the area but is convenient to the convention center. Concierge service was a plus. Also recommend if you are going to Camden Yards. Overall I would say they live up to the Marriott experience plus a little more.Went for International Microwave Symposium 2011 in June.  With so many engineers booked at the hotel, the WiFi network and DSL box can't handle the load.  My network connection kept dropping off.  Forget about working remotely.  You might as well go out to a bar and go drinking.  Mind you, you can only go to ones close to the hotel.  Go just 1 or 2 blocks away and you'll end up in the dodgy part of town.","['boyfriend', 'attended', 'game', 'chose', 'hotel', 'due', 'walking', 'distance', 'stadium', 'pros', 'friendly', 'staff',

From the magicians and singers performing in one corner to the Aquarium, Top of the World, Federal Hill there's all sorts of events to come and see. If you're too tired to walk all the way around - you can take the water taxi all around as well :) Here's a list of all the things in the area: - National Aquarium (A must visit) - Camden Yards - Watch the orioles play a baseball game!- Federal Hill - one of the best views of the city- Top of The World - View the city from a really tall building and see a piece of the 9/11 wreck outside. .- Historic Ships- Paddle Boating - Maryland Science Center- Visionary Art Museum - Quirky art museum - Little Italy - Fells Points - lots of food options here if you want to get away from all the touristy parts.I'm a Ravens fan, which is probably the only reason I've ended up at the Inner Harbor on multiple occasions. Overall, it's not really all that impressive. Almost every place to eat in the Harbor is a chain restaurant (Hooters, Hard Rock Cafe, Bubba Gump Shrimp). The only somewhat good place, if you ask me, is Phillips Seafood, but even that's a chain.There's a Ripley's Museum, which is a real eye sore and can't be any less of a tourist trap than the one in Time's Square.I can't speak for the aquarium, but I've heard it's good.One of the reasons I'm stuck at 2 stars is because the Harbor was completely dead on an early Sunday night ... after a Ravens home game. WTF?Its magical, its expensive, its got an allure that wants you to come back, its impossible to find a place to leave the car.Leave it to here. Baltimore Inner Harbor is all that, and more. I've been to the Inner Harbor several times, especially in the last 2 years. Whether its a walk around the harbor, visiting some of the exhibits on it, or eating at Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, it's always a fun memory. Seeing an Orioles game (Camden Yards is really close by), only tops off a memorable visit here. It's also not bad public transportation wise (the real way to get here), either you can take the Metro to the last stop, or take the Light Rail to Camden Yards from Penn Station. Either way, its a treat. You never want to take a place like this for granted. Its like Coney Island. There's a magical feel that comes over you while being on it, and you feel like you're 12 again, with the sights and sounds that overtake the northeast corner of your eye when you've heard cannon fire, or when you finally realize, you're at one of the major cornerstones of American history, the place where Francis Scott Key wrote the ""Star Spangled Banner"" and major industry was established. Its hard to not get romantic about the Inner Harbor. And its why you should go visit.Always a good time to be had here.  It does not matter if you are taking in some history, enjoying an event, or sampling one of the many restaurants that surround the harbor.  There are some that are hesitant about coming to the downtown area because of news reports or just second hand information from others.  There is plenty to see and enjoy so if this is keeping you from coming here then you are missing out on of the many jewels of Baltimore.I've been here a few times now and I enjoy my visit each time I am here. There is so much going on around the harbor. Whether it be the WW2 submarine or the ship where you can go on them for a small fee; dining at one of the many restaurants around the harbor; listening to live music or simply taking a relaxing stroll -- it offers a little bit of everything for everyone.  I am giving it 4 stars because I do feel some of the areas could be better maintained as far as trash overflow and what not. If that gets in the harbor that could affect a lot more than just the humans on shore, but also the life in the harbor itself.Other than that -- I make it a point to visit when ever I'm in town.My fiance and I visited Baltimore's Inner Harbor for New Year's Day yesterday and had a great time.  We visited primarily to explore the National Aquarium, which is my favorite aquarium of all time.  We also explored the waterfront area and got a seafood lunch at Phillips.  The inner harbor is a really fun place to spend a day. My only complaint is that there aren't that many great seafood restaurants around.  Phillips was our best choice and we were hoping for other choices.  Note that there is also parking near the Inner Harbor - Lockwood parking lot was great and only half a block away!I was last here in 2000, and 2010. It was 5 stars then, but I see it as 4 stars today.It is still beautiful with very scenic views of boats and ships big and small, street musicians to entertain you, shopping, restaurants, the cool water taxi fleet, and all sorts of attractions in close proximity. I noticed a distinct increase in things that cost the Inner Harbor that fifth star. A lot more vagrants, panhandlers, and poor souls who walk around muttering or talking to themselves. I understand this is a city, but here's a question. If the Inner Harbor is Baltimore's Crown Jewel of tourism, where is the effort to control things? I walked around here for 4 1/2 days and didn't see a cop once. That was disturbing to me.I guess I don't see the appeal. It's nice for walking around and looking at water. But the restaurants and shops are obviously chain and touristy. It has a little bit of a smell, as most places around water tend to do.I don't know. It's nice, but there's nothing really here.If I were visiting Baltimore, I'd come down to the inner harbor, but I wouldn't stay around for very long.If I lived in Baltimore, I'd use it on my running route. That's about it.Tourist trap or not, it is beautiful here!.    Historic big ships, WWII submarines, docked in the water, and you can check them out!!   So many shops, and places to check out, and the food choices are endless!!   We stopped and listened to a great trumpet player just hanging out by the water, and we met some nice people as we walked around.     So much more to see......My opinion only, not right or wrong... Areas that are made specially for tourist are just plain awful. The main goal is to offer travelers the comforts they may have back home in the form of terrible chain restaurants and over priced ""attractions"" that could be and are most likely available back home. Don't eat at the restaurants here, no Dicks, no Phillips, no Cheese Cake, and defiantly no Hard Rock Cafe! If you're reading this Yelp review I have the confidence that you will chose wisely and avoid the restaurants and weak over priced tourist attractions at the Inner Harbor. Simply walk past as you enjoy looking at the waterfront and use Yelp to find yourself an ""only in Baltimore"" eating establishment that excites your palate and opens your mind.   For fun you ask? Baltimore is the most acetic major city in the great U.S. of A... Throw on your adventurous pants and set off to take an urban hike through this historic and quirky gem that we call Charm City.Inner Harbor is one of the more beautiful and happening spots in Baltimore. It's a beautiful harbor and very scenic, but not a huge area. You can probably walk around and explore the area in about 1 hour unless you decide to go to the aquarium, hop aboard the USS Constellation or take part in some of the water activities. There are also plenty of gift/souvenir shops in the area. If you're looking for a bite, there's a Phillips Seafood, but for those real foodies out there, they'll love that there's a Shake Shack and Chick-Fil-A across the street --- and right next to each other! Also, if you're looking to get around, there's the Charm City Circulator where you can get a free bus ride on 4 different colored routes. Just look for the bus stop signs with a color on it and you'll see where it goes.I first came here for work-related training in June of 2009 (again in 2013 and 2014). On our first day of training our bus drove a few blocks off the Inner Harbor and we were stuck in traffic because three people were shot at four in the afternoon. Just let that settle in, because the harbor is in one of the nicer parts of Baltimore.The harbor is essentially a small strip of shops, a Barnes and Nobles, half a dozen restaurants, a small Aquarium and boats. That is all great, however, on hot summer nights there are a hell of a lot of rowdy teenagers and nowhere near enough cops around to babysit them. Going here during the day is fine, hanging out at night is not necessarily a good idea.Whether you're vacationing or in town for work this is a place to check out.  This place has really good restaurants and a couple of shopping malls and the scenery is awesome.In Baltimore for a weekend conference, I was prepared for this to be a seedy, tourist trap of an area, with overpriced restaurants and aggressive panhandlers. But I was pleasantly surprised by how safe and enjoyable the Inner Harbor actually was, with a variety of family-friendly restaurants and attractions. I didn't have time to visit the Aquarium, but the Historic Ships were terrific, and I'm looking forward to coming back in a couple of years with our kids. There are a number of first-rate hotels, and the delights of Little Italy and Fells Point are just a short walk away. One of America's greatest urban redevelopments, Baltimore's Inner Harbor is well worth a visit.An excellent area for family fun, date night or sight seeing. Plenty of options to entertain you and your guests while several amenities are within walking distance. The Harbor is host to paddle boats, The USS Constellation and water taxis as well as the National Aquarium.Make sure you stop by the Charm City Carousel to relive the kid in you. This could be an area where you can plan a staycation with one of the local hotels and take in all that Baltimore has to offer. Again, all within walking distance if the weather is amicable or just hop in a cab.I have been here a few times and upon each visit I discover something else I want to check out on my next visit to the area. There are indoor shops, restaurants that support sidewalk dining and of course plenty of watering holes to do a couple of 12oz arm curls and enjoy pub food.I recommend making a list of places and make a day of it. It's good for exercise, tourism and your bucket list. The only detractor I experienced was some homeless guy milking himself in public. Other than that keep a positive outlook and experience all the harbor holds.Came here again with the now 9 year old for food, fun and the Aquarium.Dragon Boats, street performers, touristy stuff.Like NY's South Street Seaport but even better!It's ok for half a day to see the waterfront on a beautiful day with a breeze coming from the water. Walking around in the sun is fun, as you can saunter along with friends and family having casual and lighthearted conversation while watching people from all around the area and the world touring about as well.For fun, take a ride in a dragon shaped boat, pirate ship, speed boat or cruise boat. The harbor is filled with buskers and performers at various times of the day at various locations with skills of the musical and juggling and circus tricks variety. The kids love it, and adults can find fun with the acts, too!There are plenty of commercial sins to tempt you from big names in clothing and food for your pleasure or displeasure. Nearby, you may partake in the science museum or aquarium, but beware the aquarium lines are ridiculously long!!  There's also a music venue right in the harbor, too near pier 5.Overall, if you can find parking just north of the area at a 'meter,' your wallet will be happiest. Then, just be ready I have a nice walk and enjoy that sightseeing of people watching!  If you get bored, walk east and north to Little Italy and Fells Point.Wow. Baltimore Inner Harbor, huh?  Maybe I'm missing something crucial, but I don't see what the big appeal is.  I've heard a lot of the complaints about New York's Times Square being ""Disneyfied,"" cleaned up and erased of anything identifiably New York-y, but I don't agree with that at all. Sure Times Square is an advertising wonderland, but it is unique in the world and still EXTREMELY idiosyncratic.  Say what you will about the Naked Cowboy and creepy Sesame Street knock-off characters, they were invented in Times Square's chaotic fabric.  If any nutcase wants to do anything and get noticed, Times Square is where they do it.  But those complaints about Times Square I believe in whole-heartedly about Baltimore's Inner Harbor.You can tell they spent a lot of money revitalizing the harbor, and unfortunately, it shows.  It's overdone.  It looks like it was all built at once so that everything is shiny, new and boring.  I get the feeling that the power plant is supposed to be a centerpiece, and I'm sure the building is pretty cool, but mostly it's now serving as a billboard for Barnes a&amp; Noble and the Hard Rock Cafe  I know, right?  Barnes &amp; Noble and Hard Rock Cafe!  Aren't they both bankrupt yet?  There's a Ripley's Believe It Or Not, a Bubba Gump Shrimp... basically every store that exists in every other tourist trap is here.  I even visited a McCormick's ""House of Flavor,"" a very Times Square-y McCormick's store which stocked every flavor of spice that you can already buy in every grocery store, and little else.There is very little about the Inner Harbor that screamed ""Baltimore"" to me.  Except for the ships.  But to learn anything about the ships, you need to pay and go into a museum.  There is nary an informational plaque to be found outdoors.  In fact, very little enjoyment can be had for free here. I came on a Sunday.  I've visited other similarly sized cities on Sundays and parking is always free. In Baltimore it was $27.  That's highway robbery, and I'm not kidding.  If you want to encourage people to spend money at your attractions, you don't charge them like that right off the top.  This is basic city planning.I did stroll around Little Italy and Fell's Point and those neighborhoods were nice and historic, so I suppose if the Inner Harbor drives more money into neighborhoods like that, it's a good thing.***Baltimore's Inner Harbor is incredibly touristy like other big city waterfront areas like Pier 39 in San Francisco and Santa Monica Pier, but I actually enjoyed Baltimore's Inner Harbor much more; it was much cleaner than those two spots; it was more spacious and there was an abundance of greenery, nice housing and attractive buildings***When it comes to retail and dining options, Baltimore's Inner Harbor is definitely very similar to other big city waterfront areas like San Francisco's Pier 39 and Santa Monica Pier.  This waterfront area features touristy chain restaurants like Dick's Last Resort, Hard Rock Cafe and Bubba Gump Shrimp (are waterfront areas required to have one of these?).  Shopping choices are mostly touristy options including several souvenir stores as well as a large candy store (IT'SUGAR).  One of the more interesting shops, which also felt touristy, was the McCormick spice shop.  It, of course, featured a wide variety of McCormick spices like you would find at your neighborhood grocery store, but many other things were available including a good selection of gourmet candy bars.One nice non-retail and dining attraction is this area's very good visitor center.  It includes an incredible variety of brochures for Baltimore as well as the surrounding cities and states.  The visitor center covers everything from hotels and city dining options to historical attractions, wineries and nature trips.While dining or shopping at Baltimore's Inner Harbor definitely feels like you could be at Pier 39 or Santa Monica Pier, this waterfront area had several advantages over those two touristy spots.  It felt much more spacious so it was easy walking around; it could just be that Baltimore does not draw the crowds that San Francisco and Los Angeles do.It was a great and picturesque walk too.  There was a lot of greenery as well as many nice looking buildings.  If you walk long enough along the water, you not only see great looking ships and great views of the city, but you also see a very nice and upscale residential area that is right on the water.Because of the history and picturesque views, Baltimore's Inner Harbor is a must visit.  And while you can probably skip the shopping and food, you can enjoy a nice, relaxing walk along the very clean brick-paved path that is right up next to the water (a lot closer than a lot of waterfront areas, which gives Baltimore's Inner Harbor a special feel).Parking around Baltimore's Inner Harbor is expensive.  You might be able to find metered street parking if you are willing to walk.The Inner Harbor is absolutely beautiful. It reminded me of my hometown San Francisco with the historic boats, the beautiful waterfront and shops. The guy playing music and singing along for tips, kids running around and touristy like shops. We were lucky enough to stay close to the Inner Harbor, it's an easy way to get around the city. Everything was within walking distance to the Inner Harbor area. Although I only heard about the Water Taxi on the last day, it's the best way to get around the Harbor and visit all the neighborhoods. It's also a great place to picnic with your sweetheart. Just pick up a few surprises for lunch and head down to watch the views, boats and people go by.","I'll just start by saying that to rate the Inner Harbor as five stars is completely whacked simply because while there are certainly a lot of interesting (touristy to the extreme) elements at play here but underneath it all is a complete lack of substance which is why I rate the area as one of my favorite places to visit for a day or two but then after that I'm good for another few years.What's to like:  Well, the Orioles and Ravens being close by is alright, the B&amp;O Railroad Museum is good if you can stomach the area that it's in, the historic ships are good, Federal Hill is a classic, Fort McHenry is legendary although not really in the Inner Harbor itself, Little Italy is a nice diversion and after that I'm stumped as to what else there really is that's worth while.What's not to like:  Chain shopping galore, absolute god-awful overpriced crap food at places like Hooters, Cheesecake Factory, The Hard Rock &amp; Phillips for starters.  The transportation situation is a dumpster fire with certain parking decks and lots now approaching $30 for a day, the CCC is also wretched because even though it's free the buses run on a ""loose schedule"" that is completely unreliable to get you somewhere in a timely manner and the water taxi is huge ripoff in terms of price.I mean if you've never done it then by all means give it a once over but after that, meh, it's kind of a been there, done that type of thing.  There are only so many broken displays at the Science Center that you can stomach just like there are only so many unruly kids at The Aquarium that can be tolerated all while paying premium pricing for everything.I know that other Yelpers talk about this being a city of vital neighborhoods and that you should go out and see them to experience Baltimore fully but within the context of this Yelp listing that's irrelevant because this is solely about the Inner Harbor and to me if you're one of those Happy Idiots that Jackson Browne is talking about in his classic song ""The Pretender"" then I'm sure this area and all that is has to offer will do it for you but if you've got an IQ larger than a ping pong ball and you like things with more depth to them than a shallow puddle you'll see really quick that once is enough or that once every few years is more than enough to get your fill of the Times Squaresque tourist trap crap hole that is the Inner Harbor.Baltimore Inner Harbor Offers Much to Visitors!!!The Inner Harbor has a special Maryland charm to offer the visitors. It is important to note that there is so much to do with many different types of activities that it can keep a family or couple very busy with everyone content for more than a day. We flew in for a wedding and did not need a rental car. If we had known for sure that we would not be going outside the immediate area, a cab would have worked fine. There is minimal parking and what there is, is expensive. We just left the car in the hotel and walked everywhere. We had been there two days before we were made aware of the water taxis that take you from one location in the harbor to the other. Oh well, after eating the great foods and caloric crabs, we needed the walking. The entertainment in the plaza square was a treat. From magicians, to jugglers, etc., every time we walked by, there was some other group. Beside the Visitors Welcome Center there is a water splash park for the kids and the grass area, they offer various activities in the morning for anyone FREE. We actually got up and did Yoga from our hotel room at the Royal Sonesta Hotel. That was Pretty cool! The Inner Harbor is a TREAT for all ages.1. A variety of shops2. Great for boat lovers3. A place to visit for anyone new to BaltimoreThis is my first time visiting Baltimore and I have to say that I really didn't expect much from the city. I almost didn't even visit this harbor, but I'm certainly glad that my friend took me here! It's a nice place to visit for sure! Probably even better if it was a nice summer day. Then again, a nice summer day makes almost anywhere nice. Yes, but Baltimore's Inner Harbor has a variety of shops along the water. There are many food options. The ships make for nice photograph backgrounds. There's an aquarium that looked like it would also be fun to visit.There were serpent/dragon boats for expensive rides. There's also a mini lighthouse with a mini museum for your leisure browsing. The area is generally much larger than I expected, so you can easily spend an afternoon exploring. I heard the water is poisonous though, so don't touch it. (heavy chemical pollution).Very pretty area with lots of shops and eateries.It's nice how everything is in convenient walking distance and you can pretty much walk all around the harbor. This is definitely a major tourist zone. I was there is January so it was quite a bit quieter than I imagine compared to warmer months. All the boats were docked and the dragon boat operators were closed. No street performers. Most of the people who were visiting the inner harbor were families and some couples.There are plenty of things to do to keep you occupied for a weekend but be warned that only parking lot or garage parking is available so be prepared to pay some $$$.I did not like that this area is so over-run by chain stores and restaurants. Based on all the other reviews on yelp, those chain restaurants are all pretty bad. We ate at Paneras, Uno's and Five Guys during the 2 days I was there, totally because of convenience, and every meal tasted incredibly greasy and too salty. Unfortunate there aren't any good food options in this district.I'm not really sure that I can write a review for anything in Baltimore without revealing the fact that most of my experience with the actual city of Baltimore comes from watching copious episodes of The Wire, and thus my opinion in its entirety may be slightly tainted by way of television. However, as long as you're willing not to hold that against me, I will happily talk about the wonders of Inner Harbor at length!Inner Harbor really is a beautiful slice of the city to roam. I've been here many times, for many different reasons -- celebrating a friend's birthday at Fogo de Chau, shooting a wedding at the Renaissance Inner Harbor, and, most recently, taking another trip to the Baltimore Aquarium. It's always nice to walk around a bit, take in the sights, play on the super fun xylophone art installations, and marvel at the giant Hard Rock sign on the old power plant. There is lots of variety in businesses here, though you'll probably find the majority of them to be chains.Minus one star because parking here is pretty much a nightmare, with every single garage in the area (or at least the ones that are readily apparent to us non-locals) charging an arm and a leg and being the super awkward, billion-story high, curving kind with broken elevators. Also, driving around Inner Harbor can be confusing with its labyrinth of one-way streets and double-turn lanes. And don't even get me started on that one time I got stuck in my car trying to leave Inner Harbor for 2 hours because my dinner happened to end at the same time that an Orioles game got out. Reeeeeegardless, if you're a DC or NoVA native and you haven't yet taken a trip up to Balmer to explore Inner Habor, I do recommend scheduling a day to do so!I saved the Inner Harbor for my 700th review. I think the charm of the small city is evident here because this is what most people know when they think of Baltimore. Either that or its the scary Wire show scenes (just stay away from those areas). Before I highlight my favorite parts of the harbor, I have to say, you must venture out from it. The Inner Harbor is the touristy part of the city. Everyone that lives in the city doesn't really hang out at the Inner Harbor and there is a reason. Don't go to the chain restaurants. Try a local place. Try another neighborhood. Once you start to experience the culture you'll see that Baltimore has so much more to offer.So here is what I love.- Running around by Opera's condo (heard she has one in the Ponta's Villas but not sure :-)- Climbing Federal Hill to the flag and canons to see the view of when they protected the Inner Harbor back in the day- The skyline of the buildings- Watching the ducks sunbathe by the dock- Trying to speak and hear the sound bounce back from your friend over by the Science Museum- Watching the volleyball games during the summer- Shopping at Urban Outfitters- Having a drink or watching a Raven's game &amp; being on TV as fans in Tir Na Nog- Going to the Aquarium- Watching the Christmas light show synchronized to music on the side of the Power Plant/Hard Rock Cafe bldg- Walking across the hanging bridge and feeling a little freaky cause it moves- Climbing the historic red light house- Looking at the iconic neon Domino Sugar lights across the water- Running towards Fell's Point and smelling the baking bread early in the morning- New Year's Eve fireworks - my favorite fireworks showAre you really going to give this mega-tourist attracting area a low rating?Of course not! Mainly because it's awesome. Also because it helps support our city.Between the independent street performers, the H&amp;M, Urban Outfitters, the odds and ends of touristy shops, the ginormous (and beautifully designed) Barnes &amp; Noble, the multitudes of generic (yet satisfying enough) restaurants, museums, the aquarium, and the boats, boats, boats, you've got yourself one successful location!Those who live in or around Baltimore really should take advantage of such a gem. Although there's so much more to the city than this, it's a great start for a weekend visit or a wonderful place to show off to visiting friends and family.Even though I'm a transplant that now considers herself a 'local', I still enjoy taking a stroll here. I'm also guilty of loving people-watching (a little too much). If you like either of those 2 things, then I'd suggest spending some time in one of Charm City's most popular destinations.Although the sights are pretty and there is a public restroom in the ""mall"", it is really a large tourist trap.  Please, vacationers, explore the real Baltimore outside of the Inner Harbor, it's not that bad. Really.  The restaurants are expensive and the food isn't that great (even the few non-chains).  I recommend taking a trek over to Federal Hill or even, if you have to stick in yuppy-ville, Fell's Point.  At least there is better offerings there.  I do admit, however, that Inner Harbor does at time offer some good people watching and the aquarium and science center are quite good.  It's just not a good representative of what the city is really like and yes, I think that is a bad thing.  I love Baltimore and have heard one too many people state that they wouldn't explore the city outside of the inner Harbor or Fell's Point which I think is rediculous.  So yes, visit the Inner Harbor.  It really is a must do when in Baltimore, but please don't let that be your main destination.if u ask the locals through inner Harbor is over priced and a tourist tap,  but I love it.  It is expensive so learn to use the water taxi and city bus to get around.Many decades ago, this was a blue collar harbor filled with crime. Then the clean up came.  Renovated harbor with lots of shops and restaurants, convention center, sport  stadiums for the Ravens and Orioles.  Sure changed the area.  It's now a safe clean place to visit.  It couldn't happen until the Inner Harbor changed first.  Glad it did  When I have friends visiting me, I always take them to Washington DC first, Annapolis next and Inner Harbor 3rd.  They like all the places.Nuts and bolts: I went once as a kid and now once as an adult. My how things have changed. I was so excited to show this off to boyfriend. After talking it up so much, it was rather disappointing when we got there. He said it was like a mini-mall. I remember all the local shops. And there was nice little food court. I remember my folks getting fresh seafood and one counter and my brother and I getting Chinese food. Man, memories.Verdict: Not what it used to be. Cool to have the ships around that you can take a tour of. Great architecture near by. Can sit and feed the birds. Or look into the water. As a kid, I remember staring at sting rays in the water. Loved it. Convenient mall across the street. I just don't want to spend as much time there as I expected to.Not sure what the big fuss is about here.  Maybe people have some low standards but here goes:The Inner Harbor is a great tourist spot, a good bit to see.  The main attraction is really because of its history and location on the water.  Also some retired ships are here that draws in all the tourists.  There are tons of restuarants and shops to visit. Pretty much everything is over priced due to tourism.  Inner Harbor is usually filled with screaming kids, out of towners who have no idea where anything is and stand in the middle of the intersection, rude cabbies that are looking to rip off tourists, the photo geek trying to get ""that pic"" at any cost, including standing in the middle of the road.  Also you'll find the occassional crab billy here - while living in the entire state his/her whole life; has never been to the Inner Harbor.  Parking is also a nightmare.  It averages out to around $7 for the first hour, then can go up to $16+  My TIP:  Park in little Italy and walk over.  It's not far.  Cut through the Pier 6 &amp; 5 areas by going through the Columbus Square on President St.  From there it will place you directly in the middle of Inner Harbor.Also do not take the Water Taxi unless you plan on going to all the stops and visting the areas.  A one way ticket is $7 a person while an all day pass is $12.  It's mainly there as a tourist trap.  You'll never see any locals on it. The Aquarium is expensive, small, and old.  The Science Center usually has more current exhibits and attractions.  As of right now it's some sort of Mummy exhibit.I really enjoyed Baltimore's Inner Harbor. The atmosphere on a nice sunny day was priceless (Labor Day weekend). The Grand Prix of Baltimore was going on while I was visiting the harbor. The cars were racing through the street which was cool but loud. There are some tourist attractions, restaurants, shops, and fun thing to do at the harbor. If your plan on doing multiple tourist attractions, consider getting the harbor pass. The parking is a hassle around the harbor especially on a Saturday (some decks are expensive).  Baltimore's Inner Harbor is a great place to relax on a warm day.Great layout, plenty of entertainment options, clean public restrooms, and excellent water-oriented attractions. Downside is that the food selections are mostly chains.So a fun day out! Lots to do and a great selection of food to tryAbsolutely gorgeous &amp; something for everyone! The views of the water &amp; all the boating activity is really nice. Plenty of shopping and places to eat. Yes, there's the aquarium, which as others mentioned, it's pretty pricey.Parking in &amp; around the Harbor can be pretty tricky &amp; pricey, so keep that in mind when visiting.While there's plenty of places to get your money, it's also a good place just to walk (or run) around.I love Baltimore--and I really love the Inner Harbor.  Since my first visit here in the early 90s the area just gets better and better.  Yeah, I know...My love of the area is limited mostly to the area around the Inner Harbor and Fells Point, so no, I'm not a native and maybe I'm a bit of a tourist, but I still love coming here with the family..Like I said, I've always loved the Inner Harbor, but sadly my last visit was a bit disconcerting.  We walked through the shopping galleria today and it was so different than just over a year ago. No more Vaccaro's, no more Phillips, no more of a lot of places. Looked like they've either priced out the little guys or the little guys just gave up (not Phillip's, they moved over to the old ESPN Zone by the Power Plant). Very sad...especially the loss of Vaccarro's...they make the best cannoli-seriously, I've travelled to Baltimore on a day trip so we could have lunch and have a Vaccarro's cannoli.  The Inner Harbor lost a star simply because they lost or drove Vaccarro's away...very sad.  Thankfully they are still located over in Little Italy.The bars and restaurants in the Inner Harbor can be touristy, but who cares.  The food is good, the bars are great, the people are cool, and it isn't as expensive as some other east coast cities. Camden Yards, M&amp;T Bank Stadium, the Baltimore Aquarium, great hotels and restaurants, and a great tourist await you around the Inner Harbor. Baltimore isn't everyone's first choice for a tourist visit on the east coast, but there is a TON to do here and it's been one of my favorite places to visit for a long time.  If you've never been to Baltimore...give it a shot.It is always fun to visit Inner Harbor in Baltimore, especially on good weather day. There is plenty to do - shop, eat, and enjoy the arts. They generally have a good band playing or other good performance going on at the harbor.The boat rentals are good too - to get my thigh muscles some workout :)The Aquarium is one of my favorite aquariums but be prepared to shell out some $$$The restaurants at the old Power Plant have a good party like atmosphere going all summer long!Parking can be a pain - too few street spots and parking garages are expensive!Nice place to spend a good day with family and friends!We were only in Batimore for a day, and after the disappointment of Poe's house, a cop directed us to come here, and boy are we glad to have come here. I definitely enjoy the obvious fact that this place is SAFE. haha. However, I have visited some areas and this place is nothing THAT impressive. I mean, the stores and restaurants they have around here is so generic and nothing too exciting. All in all, not bad.The Inner Harbor is really the only area I like to hangout n Baltimore, MD.  Plenty of restaurants and attractions to spend the day.  Must visit the National Aquarium and ride the ferry before leaving the Inner Harbor.","Great place for food drinks and fun.  There is a lot of energy and excitement there but still room to roam.  Take a walk around the whole harbor.  The brick sidewalk will give you amazing views of the downtown area and some space to relax away from the crowds.  It is a bit of a tourist trap but the prices for most things are surprisingly reasonable and comparable to any big city.Been coming here since I was little. The Harbor was always beautiful, but has drastically developed ! So many restaurants to choose from, places to shop ! I can't complain.Use to live in Baltimore for 3 years. I've been to the Inner Harbor countless times each being it's own unique experience. There's just so many things to do like visiting one of the 10+ museums, famous ships, dine at any dozens of restaurants, shop at any dozens of stores, or check out the many attractions in this major U.S. seaport. It can be quite romantic to walk around the harbor with your companion, catch a street performer at night entertain you and dozens of other onlookers while also being a fun place to take the family. Kids love going to the IH since there's big ships and subs to explore, exotic animals to see in one of the best aquariums in the country, spend an afternoon on the water with their dads in a dragon paddle boat, or walk a short distance to a professional baseball or football game.Getting from one place to another is easy whether you're walking, paying a small fee to catch a water taxi, or hopping a free ride on the Charm City Circulator (bus). Many hotels that are within walking distance. There is something to do for every age group.Lots to do here, for adults and kids. Port Discovery, Power Plant, Science Center, tons of restaurants, Aquarium...the list goes on and on. Some places are a bit pricey, but fun. Great comedy shows and the comedy factory in the power plant. Great food at Phillips. And the scenery can't be beat. Parking is plentiful, but pricey. My tip would be to see if any of the places you are visiting validate parking for a cheaper price. For example, if you are going to the science center or on a harbor cruise, park at Arrow garage on East Lee St. The science due center or harbor cruise will give you a voucher for a $9 flat rate at arrow. Saved us $9, because the amount of time we parked, we would have paid $18. Note: arrow garage takes cash only!Before going to this Harbor area, I was expecting this area to be crowded with people with and be disorganized, and with the temperatures in the area reaching near 100 degrees Farenheit, I was expecting humid conditions.  However, what I didn't factor into the equation, was the factor of cooler air coming off the Harbor water.  I absolutely loved looking back at the city from the edges of the cooler area nearby.  It just seemed so serene by the time I got away from here, that I wanted to go back and try again.  But the more I tried to go, the more worried I'd would have become addicted to this Harbor area.  It is so beautiful.However, most of the area around the Harbor, is shopping malls and buildings.  Not many non-shopping areas exist on the Inner Harbor area's landscape. Between all the lively people and events who meet here and all the lovely buildings, makes for one enjoyable afternoon.  A big retreat for me, if I ever find myself going back to the area.First off, I have lived around here my entire life. The inner harbor is alright of course i have been to all the attractions. The bums that stroll around asking people for money are rude and annoying, especially when you refuse. The aquarium has always been good, but the prices for attractions and parking keep me away today, not to mention the ambiance of the people who usually make up the majority. The food establishments are junk and over priced. The surveillance and police presents though necessary for the out of control youths is a bit much for a relaxed atmosphere. Today it more resembles a third world nation, not exactly what i would call fun...Populated with chain stores and restaruants by the water front; lots of things to do and option to eat. Happy place to relax, enjoy the weekends. So why drugged yourself to go to DC when Baltimoreans have its own.My favorite spot in America that tourists also like to visit. So indicative of Baltimore, though I think all of the city is amazing. There to be seen is the National Aquarium, Maryland Science Center, various-aged ships you can tour, the huge Hard Rock Cafe sign, World Trade Center, paddleboats in the harbor, the shops &amp; eateries in Harborplace, restaurants like Phillip's, Bubba Gump, Tir Na Nog Irish, M&amp;S Grill, Ruth's Chris &amp; Edo Sushi, Federal Hill, the Water Taxi &amp; plenty more. It always perks me up to go there.Baltimore's Inner Harbor is very picturesque and gorgeous area to go running; I've been working up to 3 miles, mostly downhill from Mount Vernon. On some days I'll get distracted by the Harbor Gallery Mall; Coach, Francesca's, and Aldos call out, and I'm very drawn to Urban Outfitters and H&amp;M as well (H&amp;M sports European sizes which works great for me). I'll cruise by the Inner Harbor on the way to Harbor East and Fell's Point; The USS Constellation, USCGC Taney, and USS Torsk have become familiar friends; the street performers are always fun as well :)Always have a nice time in the Inner Harbor shops. I do miss the Phillips buffet but the McCormick spice shop is a welcome addition.Tourist trap, yes.Beautiful scenery, yes.Lots of restaurants and shops, yes.Easy to maneuver with access to taxis, main thoroughfares and public transportation, yes!While I only visited Baltimore for a short while, this was a beautiful area to walk around. Able to see the harbor, World Trade Center of Baltimore, lots of shops and restaurants to choose and browse from.I feel like this is a convenient tourist/visitor location because it is convenient to shopping, Camden Yards, museums, restaurants and hotels. Lots of great spots like the Capital Grille and Phillip's are nearby...in addition to staples like Panera, Chipotle, etc...There seems to be something for everyone...and what a spectacular view!The inner harbor is pretty boring. I wasn't impressed. I took a trip to Baltimore when I visited DC. My friend was like ""why are you going there? It is ghetto."" Yea, I now agree after I went.Admiral Ackbar: ""It's a trap! A tourist trap!""It might be a tourist trap, but it is a pretty cool place to go during the Spring and Summer while you are in Baltimore.There are a slew of restaurants all around the Inner Harbor, my favorites being Lenny's and the Rusty Scupper, but even if you don't go down for the food there are a ton of things to do to keep yourself occupied.Here are some of the highlights, which everyone should check out on any given trip to the Inner Harbor:Aquarium - pricey, but hours of exploringScience Center - not as pricey, hours of funTorsk Tour - cheap; for history buffsFederal Hill - free exercisePaddle/Electric Boats - go with the electric if lazy (like me!)People Watching - free and hours of entertainment (watch out for the Mennonites trying to get you to give up all of your money)Things to watch out for:Expensive parkingLONG lines at Cheesecake FactoryBaltimore thuggery &amp; thieveryYou can spend an entire day at the Inner Harbor, if you have enough money, that is.  Many of the major to dos are located here - the only pay attraction we took part in was the aquarium (see separate review).  But there's plenty of other things to take your money - touring the submarine or the USS Constellation, the chinese drag paddle boats, the big fancy speed boats or cruises, plenty of shops &amp; restaurants, etc.  We enjoyed just walking around, looking at the boats &amp; people watching.  Yes, it is crowded and I'm sure the stores &amp; restaurants are overpriced, but hey, it is tourist land.  You can easily catch transportation from here to see the rest of town (via the CCC, public buses, taxis, water taxi, etc).Even if you don't go to any of the museums or restaurants scattered around the Inner Harbor, it's a nice place to just walk about and take in the sights.  It was overcast and a cold day so the Inner Harbor looked so dreary but I'm sure during the summer it comes alive with the paddle boats and more additional tourists.We didn't take advantage of any of the museums for the simple reason of cost and that Saturdays are usually crowds of people with their kids.  My patience and the patience of my husband probably would have been severely challenged.Early morning's the best time to enjoy Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Preferably a clear day at sunrise. Well before 10am when Harborplace and the Gallery open for business and generate the hubbub. I enjoy the peace when hardly anyone's home. Just a couple joggers infiltrating from Federal Hill bouncing about the promenade, old folks hand in hand on morning constitutionals, gulls finding treasure in trash bins overflowed by last night's restaurant goers and shopaholics at Light St Pavilion. But it's still just me on a bench by Baltimore Visitor's Center eyeing fancy yachts tied to docks bobbing on the same serene waters as the historically significant USS Constellation, and sunlight separated by the 30 story World Trade Center and it's Top of the World observation area as I recall the region's largest New Years Eve fireworks extravaganza exploded from barges. An event drawing an insanely huge crowd. A lesser midday every day crowd gets entertained by street musicians strumming for their supper at Harborplace Amphitheater as a parade of school buses bring children to nearby National Aquarium's dolphin show and indoor Amazon rainforest. But early morning's still the best time to enjoy Baltimore's Inner Harbor. After 10am area hotels spit out guests for their daily tourists' takeover of the promenade and manic explorations of Harborplace's brasseries &amp; boutiques. Much intimacy's lost. Sure I could shop 'til I drop like the rest. Been there, done that. Baltimore's Inner Harbor's backdrop of Harborplace and the Gallery's built to beckon. But I'd rather enjoy the early morning's soothing sights and sounds. They're necessary and they're free.Like others have said it is a tourist trap but it's such a nice place to hangout during the summer. From all the little shops in Harbor Place were you can grab some Baltimore souvenirs. (I collect shot glasses from everywhere I've been.) Tons of restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory, Five Guy's, Phillips Seafood, M &amp; S Grill and the famous Vaccaro's Italian Pastries.With a volley ball court with sand, the National Aquarium, Science Center, Power Plant Live and Port Discovery in the area there are plenty of attractions. Go up to the park in Federal Hill for great shots of the harbor. Be sure to rent one of the little boats and ride around the harbor. Don't get the paddle boat like we did. Pay the extra money and get the powered boat. I got a horrible cramp in my calves! I haven't worked those muscles since before my daughter was born!A favorite place in the summer. Lots of great shops and restaurants. Sitting on the crab deck at Phillips enjoying steamed blue crabs. I recommend taking a water taxi around the harbor to Fell's Point!On a nice sunny day this a great place to be which frankly didn't used to be true at all.  This was the last place anyone would want to go.  However, those days have passed into a faded memory and has become the tourist hot spot it is today.  There are an assortment of shops, restaurants and activities available if you want to do more than catch the view.  There are paddle boats and actual boats to keep people of any age entertained should they feel so inclined to get on the water.  I like that there are so many things to do in one area and that a couple of my favorite stores are there as well.  It tends to lean on the pricier side, especially if you are considering dining.  Don't be afraid to walk a couple of blocks away to find some of Baltimore's dining gems.I am in no way a harbor / port groupie, but the Inner Harbor is much better than the Seaport in New York City, Penn's Landing in Philadelphia, Old Port in Montreal, etc.  There is plenty of things to do and the area is full of museums, an aquarium, chain restaurants (The Cheesecake Factory, ESPNZone, Hard Rock, Hooters, PF Chang's), historical ships, amazing views from Federal Hill Park, and 2 nearby sporting venues: Camden Yards (Orioles) and M&amp;T Bank Stadium (Ravens).  In the words of Denzel, ""King Kong ain't got nothing on them!""","Definitely a unique, one-of-a-kind area. I love visiting here on my way through Balitmore. This past Labor Day weekend it was packed full of people and the weather was absolutely beautiful. Lots of things to do and places to eat.If you are staying overnight at a hotel nearby, try priceline. It's a gamble but it paid off well for us. We landed really cheap rooms at the Renaissance, and although we could have paid an extra $40 or so for harbor view rooms we decided to save the money for food.We hung out at the harbor for the 4th weekend. We had a great time. There are a lot of things to do. We hit the dragon boat in the middle of the harbor. We wanted to catch the taxi boat but never made it to it. We walked everywhere as you definitely need to bring your tennis shoes. Everything is in good walking distance from the hotels near the harbor. The fireworks were great. The ones at the harbor need some work. They only went halfway in the air... yea!! They had two going at the same time. The other firework show was out in the actual harbor away from the shops. This one was the best. The only thing was they had 2 displays going on at the same time. I thought I was watching a tennis match. We stood near McCormick and Schmidt restaurant. We were able to watch both of them and had a great view. We visited the Ripley's believe it or not, the national aquarium, the galleria mall and checked out many of the restaurants in the area. We had a great time. The harbor needs to step it up on the shops. There are more eateries then shops which takes away from being there for the tourist. We had a great time all in all. The weather was the bomb.... yes. The breeze was flowing every day we were there. The sun was definitely out but we had the breeze blowing therefore, it made it much better. The area itself was family friendly and safe. Now on our way out we drove through some other areas of b-more. OMG... stay close to the harbor. If you go over too many blocks you definitely see a different look. :-)Really a beautiful area in downtown Baltimore. However, it is in no way representative of the tough city that Baltimore is. Drive down Fayette, Vine, or Fremont streets and you will recognize very quickly that the IH is an over-touristy place that is totally disconnected from Real Baltimore life.Lots of chain food places, hotels, a science center, an aquarium, a few museums, a convention center, and two sports stadiumd. But what do you really expect? It is the tourist spot in Baltimore. That being said, it really is a nice little area, very pretty, and fun to walk around when the weather is nice. Yes, it can be a little sketchy, but compared to other parts of Baltimore you shouldn't really complain. Also, this place is a pain in the butt to drive through, no matter what time of the day it is.There's a lot do do here and everyone should be able to find something they like. For starters you have the big tourist attractions like the National Aquarium, Port Discovery, the USS Constellation and many others. They are open year around and are all kid friendly. There's plenty of shopping if that's your thing. The most obvious is The Gallery. (It's a 4 story mall) and there are all kinds of places scattered about to pick up souvenirs to.Want to party? You'll probably want to head over to the Power Plant Live. Restaurant Row...etc... It can get crazy... You've been warned. :) There's also an ESPN Zone, Hard Rock Cafe, etc. Stay in one of the hotels around the waterfront or just come into town and make a day of it. The options are endless and the experience is whatever you decide to make of it.Visiting the Baltimore Harbor isn't that great.  First of all parking is very expensive in the area and the parking lot pricing system is often very hard to see while driving by.  The range and parking fees varies but seems to average around $15-$19 in the blocks around the harbor although if you get your car Valet parked at a hotel expect to pay at least $30.  The attractions around the harbor are mainly tourist trap type stores.  There are some museums to visit and of course the aquarium.  One thing that made me not give it one star was that they are trying to create a little area of marshland for birds.  That showed some innovation but overall the area was pretty touristy.  Outside the aquarium they are also doing a few other things like having a little bit of wooded area and a little waterfall where birds take baths.  The one thing that bothered me about the inner Harbor where the amount of shady looking individuals hanging around some of which look like they were up to no good.  I definitely recommend watching your purse or bag because I'm sure that there is some amount of theft going on.  As far as I can see it is worth a visit but probably not a repeat visit.  Baltimore really Needs to fix up it's downtown area.  It's interesting how the streets near the harbor and downtown are pretty vacant and when you get to the harbor  there are lots of tourists.If you're just breezing through B-more and want a one-stop tourist haven, the Inner Harbor is it.  Let's see... Aquarium.Maritime museum with a submarine, Coast Guard ship, and frigate.Enclosed mega-mall replete with cookie-cutter shops and eateries.Hands-on museum with IMAX theater.Paddle-boats.Harbor taxi.Tourist fly-paper extraordinaire!Go for: the National Aquarium, the Baltimore Maritime Museum, the Maryland Science Center, and the lovely views as your stroll around the harbor.  All well worth a stop at the Inner Harbor.  Despite its trappishness, this *is* a place you should check out at some point.Otherwise, it's a pretty sterile Baltimore experience.  This is a vital city of neighborhoods, and truly to experience all it has to offer means getting out and exploring them.A great place to step outside and walk around. They've really cleaned this area up, although at night, be careful. Very much more expensive than the area should be, but plenty of parking on the edges, boats to watch and paddle on the water with, food and restaurants in the area, and plenty of expensive hotels.At least there are plenty of police in unmarked cars sitting all around, and there are the couples walking around, the Water Taxis in the day, and the tourists, too.The Aquarium, USS Constellation, Sugar Factory and more lie along its edge, plus the visitor's center and Science Center.4.5 stars...Yes it's touristy, a little bit more expensive then it probably should be, and has more chain stores then would be ideal, but the Inner Harbor is great. It's clean, safe, beautiful, with plenty to do, see, and eat. They've got lots of little shops, the National Aquarium, the USS Constellation, the USS Torsk submarine, the Seven Foot Knoll Lighthouse and the Inner Harbor is an easy walk to Camden Yards (where the Oriole and Raven's stadiums are) and Federal Hill. It's also a decent walk to Fells Point. Its centralized location alone makes Inner Harbor great. If you've never been to Baltimore start by exploring the Inner Harbor first and go out from there.super cool place to chill on a spring or summer day.  so much to see and do during the day time.  tourist place? id say so.  but im a tourist so woohoo! restaurants like cheesecake factory, uno grill, dicks last resort, hard rock cafe.  paddle boat rides for $11 for up to 4 people.  umm AQUARIUM! second biggest in the country. barnes and noble.  a few shops like h&amp;m and urban outfitters.  then the gallery is right across the street.  street performers doing their thang (juggling on unsteady things). this place is a lot safer than downtown baltimore.  id say that for sure.  maybe the safest area of the whole city? this is where you bring you family on a nice weekend. just take the orange circular!Do yourself a favor and spend a weekend in the Inner Harbor. I highly recommend booking a hotel in the area, so that you can walk everywhere and see all the amazing things Bmore has to offer!As a Baltimore native I can say that the Inner Harbor has changed quite a bit... and for the better (in my opinion). I'm not sure why my fellow Yelpers would be upset that it has become too commercialized because the new developments helped clean everything up. When I was a child my grandparents used to take me down here very often. I attended one of the very first games ever played at Camden Yards and I saw one of the first even IMAX films at the Maryland Science Center. It was always a little dirty and now most of that has changed. I like the Inner Harbor and the hotels are reflective of how desired the neighborhood has become. My grandmother tells stories of when she used to come down and see drunken bums fall into the water. The drunks are still around, but fortunately the chains have helped keep them safe from drowning. :)Fun place to walk around when the weather is good! Lots of shopping, places to eat, coffee and fun.Probably the safest part of Baltimore.  I think Ray Lewis has been banned here.Beautiful area to visit. Sunshine bouncing off the water as you walk in the breeze. There are shops and restaurants nearby, but many were not open. The aquarium is here along with the World Trade Center. A nice place to visit.Without anyone telling you that it's a tourist trap, you arrive in this area and it's evident. The crowd is mostly wearing sneakers and cameras around their necks, but it's a nice crowd all appreciative of the spectacular harbor views of Baltimore. During our stay here, we walked through the area both in the evening and day time. It was nice, but what I love most about this area is the great Dominos Sugar sign. It's a constant reminder of my beloved HBO series The Wire. Although, we spent most of our time here just walking, I didn't not mind the touristy vibe at all.This is the gem of this decrepit city!I think that there is something very romantic about this place (with the exception of the homeless dudes digging through the trash). When we visited after a friend's wedding a couple months ago, a police officer was kind enough to take a picture of us in front of the Hard Rock Cafe. The harbor always seems to be buzzing with life, and almost makes me want to end up living in Baltimore at some point.Dirty, small area with chain stores that can be found anywhere on cleaner areas. Baltimore is the armpit of the east coast. A big plus for the USS Constitution. So much history in that vessel. It's a shame that the city puts more emphasis on the mall on front of it.I adore Inner Harbor!  We went here every year as kids as part of our vacation and I have returned many times as an adult.  There's always something new to discover!","I used to leave work early, if I was having a stressful day and take the MARC to sit by the water and watch the activity.I love the harbor, I can't stress that enough.  It's dated, but that really adds to the charm.I have a routine.  I get a chicken dinner from the Chicken Shack, and sit outside and people watch.  Heaven.  It's the main reason I'm relocating to Baltimore.  So that I can visit anytime I want...Described by the Urban Land Institute in 2009 as ""the model for post-industrial waterfront redevelopment around the World."",the Inner Harbor is the gem in the crown of Baltimore tourism. But like any other crown only the king gets to wear it.  Paid for by tax payers and profited by private groups, the Inner Harbor was Baltimore's all out gamble in the 70's and 80's to bring tourists back to the city.  It worked...for the tourists and those who turn a profit from the Inner Harbor.  Whenever I have out of town guests visit I take them to the Inner Harbor on day 1 to show them the clean post card part of Baltimore, the side of our town that the city council wants tourists to see.  The rest of their stay is spent back in the neighborhood because that's where Baltimore lives and plays, eats and drinks.  In this way the Inner Harbor works for me much like Power Plant Live works for me: by penning all the tourists up in one central location and ensuring that I can still get a bar stool at my favorite corner bar in the hood.What's not to like here? You have a great view a chill place to relax and just 'be' as well as some store to shop and you're foot steps away from anywhere you'd want to be in downtown Baltimore.Nice area - very pretty and calm at night. Everything's pretty expensive (we're talking close to NY prices) but there are lots of places where you can rent paddle boats and go on short cruises and such. The surrounding buildings are all malls, shopping places, food places, aquariums, hotels, etc. Just be careful late at night because it's still a city and some of the surrounding sidewalks are under construction so it can look a tad shady.Not a huge fan of the Inner Harbor.  I really feel like that if I lived in Baltimore/the area, I would absolutely hate this place.  It's nothing more than a small harbor with a ton of different chain restaurants/cheesy stores.  Don't get me wrong, I do like some of the chain restaurants that are there, but I kind of wish this place was more a representation of the city of Baltimore and not just one big tourist trap.  If I lived in Baltimore, I couldn't see how I would ever come down and check this place out.  I guess I would only come here if I had guests visiting and they wanted to visit it.  As for the restaurants - like I said earlier, lots of chains (Hooters, Uno, Cheesecake Factory and a bunch of others).  I don't think every restaurant here is a chain but definitely a good portion.  There are also a number of stores - I remember an H&amp;M and a bunch of total tourist trap type places.  There used to be an ESPN zone here but now that's gone.  It's still a fine place to go down and walk around on a nice day, but I certainly wouldn't make this the main destination of any trip.  On the plus side, there are plenty of places to go for a drink - most of them get pretty packed, though.  Most of the restaurants do have a pretty good view of the harbor.The Inner Harbor is really what is Spearheading (that's a fancy government term that leads to more promotion credit) the transformation in Baltimore.  Yes, it can be a tourist trap, and I don't believe us locals actually eat there, but it is a great environment with lots to do.  Countless restaurants for people to pig out at (the American past time), but they are a little pricier than in the neighborhoods of Baltimore.  Lots of activities you can accomplish (Science Museum, Paddle Boats, Water Taxi, Aquarium, etc...), and even some sporting events with the Volleyball courts, and probably the best area around for jogging (or is it pronounced yogging?  Might be a soft J).  I am a huge fan of the Inner Harbor, and it is what is connecting the city, and leading the way for Baltimore to be a safe and friendly city.  If all you have heard about Baltimore is from the Wire, it's time to change your opinion and spend some safe quality time at the Harbor!Yes, this is a tourist trap - but its a great place to go and do some local shopping and eat at the water front restaurants.  The harbor area is very clean, safe and extremely friendly.  Every person I interacted with from wait staff, to employees at the stores to the police on the street were so friendly and helpful.  Where else do you have a police officer actualy stop you and ask if you are enjoying yourself?  Certainly not where I come from.. So enjoy this beautiful part of Charm City.. they have truly earned their name from the friendly experience I had.We went to Inner Harbor on a Thursday afternoon when it was very hot and humid.   Due to construction it was very hard to find a parking.  We parked by Rusty Scupper and walked all the way around.   The area was very clean.   The place was very quiet and empty.   It was an okay place to visit but nothing special.Nice. Lots to do lots to see.Maybe this was great before the 'boom, but any local flavor has been sucked away by the walls of hotels surrounding the harbor and the chain food restaurants within.  Even the rare relic (U.S. Constellation) is so faked out &amp; commercialized (c'mon, plastic cannons in front?!) that my two boys didn't want to go in!!The aquarium is pretty nice, although the dolphin show kinda sucked and it was wicked expensive.There are cool things in Baltimore.  You'll just have to look for them.My bike got stolen at the Inner Harbor  today around 4pm. I left it attached with a cable lock to the bike rack outside Barnes &amp; Noble, in a matter of 45 minutes, the time I spent in the bookstore, my bike was stolen. Such a disgrace I will never trust leaving a bike anywhere in the city. Beware of the thieves!!!Touristy, sure - but unlike many other areas in Baltimore it felt safe to walk around.  The aquarium is great, the stores nice, and the greenspace plentiful.  Parking prices are a bit excessive in the area, but I guess that is to be expected.The Inner Harbor is my favorite part of Baltimore City.  Sure, there are a lot of places in Baltimore that are very cool, but they're sprinkled randomly throughout the city and there are scary people between these interesting points.  And if you're scared of crackheads and other crazies, like I am, then you'll do best to stick to the three to four block radius of the Inner Harbor, lest you be snatched up and taken into a secret world of crackeries.  The aquarium is very expensive, I can't say it's worth it, either.  Maybe if you're bringing kids, they'll somehow enjoy it more than you will.  The Science center is very cool.  My favorite is the ESPN zone, because I'm a big kid at heart.  It's just a great place to walk around, maybe do a little shopping, paddle boating, etc.  Again, though, if you wander too far from the Inner Harbor and the sun is setting, you better get back home soon!  I mean it!Always a good time!My husband brought me here when I first moved to Maryland. It's actually just about the only part of the city that he's familiar with. We just went back with an out-of-town guest and she commented how clean the Inner Harbor area is, which is actually a reminder to myself San Francisco is really trashy. Inner Harbor is very tourist-oriented but it's good for a day trip for guests. On the other hand, I'd really like to explore more of the city based on my positive experience in the Inner Harbor.","['tourist', 'going', 'first', 'place', 'hear', 'nicest', 'areas', 'always',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/days-inn-baltimore-inner-harbor-hotel-baltimore,Days Inn Baltimore Inner Harbor Hotel,3.5,$$,59,"When I first saw the price of this hotel, I was skeptical at best, but I went for it as I just needed a bed for a few nights. I'm happy to say that this Days Inn far exceeded all of my expectations. The front desk staff were nothing short of a joy to work with. They answered all my questions and finished my check in process as fast as possible, which was very much appreciated. I was absolutely shocked at how nice the room was. My travel partner and I booked a single (king size) bed room, and the room was big enough for probably four or five people comfortably. The bed was absolutely huge, not to mention very comfy. The room also was equipped with a couch, coffee table, microwave, fridge, desk, chair, large flat screen TV, and spacious bathroom.The hotel is only blocks away from Camden Yards and the Inner Harbor, which I absolutely loved. Another plus of the hotel is the attached restaurant. I'm usually skeptical of attached restaurants. I ate breakfast one morning there and it was hot, delicious,  and very affordable. The breakfast was buffet style and run by hotel employees. I can't speak more highly of the restaurant staff. Everyone, our waiter included, was exceptionally nice. If they didn't have something on the buffet that you wanted, they would happily make it for you at no extra charge, if possible. (I especially enjoyed the french toast sticks, which were some of the best I've never had.) The only negative aspect to the hotel, is parking. Parking is a little pricey, but the hotel does not own the parking garage. All things considered, however, I suppose expensive parking is to be expected in the city.I had a pleasant stay here during a busy conference weekend. The staff is friendly and the rooms are clean, homey, and comfy.I flew in from a red eye and was hoping for a very early checkin, and I got it! The only room available was one on the first floor next to the employee rooms and business center (so at times, it got quite noisy outside), but it wasn't too bothersome. I'm just grateful to get a quick nap before the day started.The staff was really helpful in showing me around the area (on a map of course) and also helping me retrieve my bags from the hold room multiple times.Wifi is free and hassle free! It's right next to the convention center and super close to Camden Yards and public transportation. It's also a few blocks walk from Edgar Allan Poe's grave and Lexington Market. It's about a $10 cab ride to Fell's Point, although I hear public transportation is a better option.I was in town for some interviews recently and picked this hotel because of its proximity to one of my interviews. I love walking and this hotel is situated perfectly in a great location downtown - it is a mere couple of blocks from UMMC and about a mile or so from Johns Hopkins Metro. The staff at the front desk were very kind and helpful. The only thing that made me raise an eyebrow was an immediate charge of $60 (was there three nights) for ""incidentals."" Hmmmm...I just got there - how could I already have incidentals? No worries, though - it was never charged to my card, as it was just a fund hold. No problem with that.The room was spotless. Great view of the parking structure (again, no worries). A little loud at night, as I flew out very, very early on Saturday morning. Nice amenities - very clean room and very little noise given that I was on the 2nd floor. I would definitely stay here again or recommend it to someone coming into town.We have been here twice now. How to rate a hotel? Well, the staff is extremely friendly. One man at the front desk (wish I had got his name) will brighten your stay with his cheerful attitude.There is also public parking connected to the hotel, very nice. It's $28 a day though. Perhaps most importantly, is the location. Mickey Mouse always told me of the importance of location, location, location, amd this hotel is literally a 5 minute walk to Camden Yards, and 10 minutes to Inner Harbor. Can't beat that. The rooms are large, comfortable, and clean, with a  great king sized bed, and hallelujah free wifi. Reasonably priced, too, so even with the parking, it's a good deal.Great hotel.  Great location.  Greeted by Gerald whom I swear may be the nicest most helpful employee of any company I've ever met.     Recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Baltimore.  Especially if you need quick access to convention center or Camden yards area.The Days Inn is a coveted hotel for veteran Otakon attendees. This is due to their great rates, amenities, location and polite/helpful staff. We've stayed here twice, once in 2010 and again this past July. Overall our stay was very nice. Office staff are very welcoming of convention attendees and are quick to address any issues we may have. We had an issue with the card the room was booked on but the staff did their best to fix the issue. (the wrong card was charged) After a few phone calls and a bit of a wait everything went through fine. Had another issue with some shady characters lurking around the garage and pool area but the staff quickly called security and they were escorted away. Nothing more than scam artists but the staff's professionalism when dealing with them was greatly appreciated.Rooms are pretty basic but come with a mini fridge, free wifi and microwave which are nice to have and the pool is a decent size for relaxing. Hotel is a short 5 min walk to the BCC which is wonderful when you're in full cosplay attire. Parking is attached in the garage next door and rates are around $30 a day. Overall a nice place to stay if you're on a budget.Stayed here while attending a conference. Room service wasn't great, they didn't clean thoroughly. But also, on 11/7, a Saturday there was construction at the roof which started at 5 am, and woke me up. I called the front desk about this, they were aware, but the construction and extreme noise continued. It was ridiculous. I can't imagine of something that couldn't wait an hour or two to be repaired.I have booked 2 rooms for me and my friends and used only one room for couple hours. Had emergency and had to leave early. Haven't touch anything in second room. I asked staff and management if they can get at least partial refund for unused room, and answer was no. Also they gave wrong pricing for room and parking over the phone. So I've spent more then $400 within hour and half, and couldn't get anything back.Thank you Days Inn, you will never see me or my friends in your hotels anymore.Stayed here one night for Baltimore Comic Con. Great rate, great location. Parking garage is attached to the hotel which is very convenient. Hotel lobby was very clean and welcoming. The front desk staff are friendly and efficient. Check-in was very fast and they had my room ready at 9:30AM. I stayed in a standard 2 double bed room. Room was immaculate. Linens were clean and fresh. The room also has a microwave and a mini fridge and freezer. The sink is outside of the bathroom, which is great when more than one person needs to get ready in the morning. I ordered a pizza for dinner and the front desk called to confirm that I ordered it before they let the guy come up. I felt like this was very nice thing to do, especially as a female travelling without a male companion. The location is extremely convenient for both the convention center and the Inner Harbor. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.Had a bit of a rocky check in due to a glitch with Expedia however the hotel staff fixed it immediately.  The staff were all very nice and stopped to ask how your day was.We ate in the bar on site.  It is small but nice and quiet.  Perfect for a late evening cocktail.Great location if you have to be at the Baltimore Conference Center.  Perfectly adequate rooms and service, EXCEPT when sewage water started spewing out my sink the night shift concierge told me ""Maintenance isn't in yet."" When I told him it was something he should not disregard he told me he would leave them a note. When I returned and told him the situation was urgent, as the sink was overflowing and soaking the floor, he begrudgingly put down his cell phone a brought me a garbage pail. While attending to my room both he, and later, the maintenance guy complained about how gross it was and no one apologized or offered to relocate me.  Rude!When I heard the price of the room I was prepared for the worst, but I was so wrong. Everything is clean, the room is big with a working fridge and microwave, and its just across the street from all the action. Love it! (Security people are little sketchy which is why I took a star off)I've stayed at Days Inns since I was knee high to a grasshopper...well a long time. They were always roadside stops on long trips. Basic room and bed . I recently had a business trip to Baltimore and wanted cheap. I found it at The Days Inn Inner Harbor. For what I paid I wasn't expecting much! Well was I ever disappointed in my expectations. This place was gorgeously opulent. I'd give it A 5 Star rating, Immaculate, modern and a short walk from all the attractions of the Inner Harbor! Staff was top notch. went back the next week to stay again. This place is a great budget extender for a quick weekend away with the wife, kids if you must and they even take pets! WHAT A JOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Pretty decent hotel. Very convenient location to everything around the Inner Harbor. The rooms are pretty simple and the bed was ok at best.This was the least expensive hotel I could find in the Inner Harbor. Once I booked the room, my card was charged and it was non-refundable so be careful! Everyone at the concierge desk was really friendly and helpful. They took our phone number to call us when the casino shuttle was coming, which goes to and from the Horseshoe casino every half hour. We forgot some toiletries and Gerald was kind enough to give us a whole bag of all sorts of stuff. Our room had a funny smell to it, but I think it was just the air conditioning.Exceptionally friendly staff (especially Gerald) at the front desk.  Clean and great location.  Would stay again.Charged my CC full amount after previously paying in full. Took over a week to get corrected.  But the real issue was the elevators. Holy god, slower that watching molasses drip from the 80th floor of the Sears tower. If you are unable to walk up the stairs, I don't suggest staying here. Otherwise, when you check in, hit the ^ up button on elevator, go grab dinner somewhere in the inner harbor, and by the time you finish and get back, the door may be opening.The place I was supposed to stay at while I was in Baltimore for a few days fell through the last minute (literally about 15 mins before arriving there) so I had to make a last minute reservation at a hotel that was going to be close enough to the Baltimore Convention Center that fit within my budget and had a parking garage. Thanks goodness for Days Inn!I made the reservation 10 mins before checking in and was able to find the room for fairly cheap at $62/night + taxes and it was 4 mins walking distance from the convention center. Parking all day was $25/day which is more than the other hotels but when figuring out the total cost, it was still much cheaper to stay here than the Hilton (across the street) and the other hotels in the 2 block radius.The hotel itself seemed to be going under renovations so it was a little messy but it wasn't that bad. The hotel itself, in comparison to the other hotels in the area, is tiny. It almost has that middle of nowhere (not that Baltimore is anywhere... ZING!) feel to it. The room was spacious enough and the bed comfy. I got 4 pillows all to myself and it was awesome. The toilet and shower looked clean and updated. I had the view of the parking lot but I didn't get the room for the view. I was able to see my car parked in the garage on the second floor.I always forget my toothbrush when I'm traveling so when I went down to ask for one from the front desk, I was really surprised at the quality of the toothbrush I got. Made my bleeding gums happy.Even though there were a few things that bothered me, this has got to be one of the first hotels I've stayed in America in a very long time that I went away satisfied with it.A few things that were a bit bothersome to me.- I didn't bother turning the air on because that machine is one loud mother (I'm a light sleeper)- The fridge, also made a little noise but it wasn't that badIf I ever have to stay in a hotel in Baltimore again (and that's a huge ""if""), I'd stay here in a heart beat.Parking: $25/dayI was looking for a place to stay after an Orioles game during the week and this hotel was exactly what I needed for the night. It was not your typical Days Inn, it was a step up from the typical motel-like places they usually are.After researching online the possible places that were within walking distance to the game, the Days Inn was the best deal. It was around $120 for the night for two beds and was about one block away from the center field gates at Camden Yards. We came into town on the light rail from Penn Station and the Camden Yards stop is across the street from the hotel. In fact we flew out very early the following day and we hopped on the light rail again that brought us to the airport. After check in we walked down to the the inner harbor area to check out the city itself, which was about a ten minute walk.I highly recommend staying here if you are looking to spend the night after a game in a clean and comfortable hotel. BTW The air conditioner in our room worked great! Really important for June/July in Baltimore.Check in was easy. A lot of people were checking in, and they had 2 people at the front desk. They have a parking deck, and it is $28 per night, paid at the hotel. We received a ticket, so we could come and go. We were on the 7th floor, but the elevators were really slow. The hotel was sold out, which I don't think would have been a problem, but many of the rooms in our hotel had many many people staying in them. When we were checking out, we heard someone say they had 8 people in their room!?! This made the hallways, and the common areas miserable to negotiate. Someone kept trying to put his card in our door, which was scary and annoying. The room was good size, and the bed was comfortable. It was the on the edge of the inner harbor. It was a few more blocks then what I expected, but within walking distance. Search for a good rate. and enjoy!","I must say, I was surprisingly impressed. This past summer, at the last minute, I moved my daughter &amp; me from D.C. to the Inner Harbor &amp; this was the most reasonably priced place that wasn't booked for that weekend. When we arrived, the staff was jovial and welcoming. We were allowed an earlier check-in &amp; our room was expertly decorated &amp; comfortable. The ambiance of the hotel was satisfactory &amp; the overall structure of the hotel was visually appealing. We were within a minutes' walk to all the activities and establishments the Harbor had to offer. A great location and perfect price if you're looking to stay in this locale.This hotel is newly renovated and very nice, good staff and didn't have any problems with it. I would stay here again and definitely would recommend it to people who need a hotel to stay for a few days, that is right in the middle of the Inner Harbor. It is conveniently located within walking distance to the Aquarium, Convention Center, Camden Yards, etc. On the down side, the tub in the room leaked a little but it wasn't serious. The hotel took care of this matter. Also, when parking at the hotel you are directed to use an adjacent lot, which cost $25 per day since there are no parking spaces directly on premises. You can seek cheaper nearby alternatives if you don't mind walking a few blocks. Overall it was a satisfying experience.Don't let the name fool you!! I have stayed in Days Inns all over the place and it's normally just acceptable. Something very different about this place. The room his huge more like a small suite. Very clean the staff was very nice and helpful. I was impressed by the ihome alarm clock and the cool showers. It's the little details that count. Great job will come back next time I'm in B~TownOnly short one star because if under construction.I planned to write this review about the comfortable beds, great location and better than expected room, that was until it took over 20 minutes to find someone at the front desk. Calls (20+ rings) and 15 minutes waiting in the lobby. When staff member finally showed up, she did not care at all that we had been waiting. She honestly looked annoyed to be asked to do her job. All proving that a good review can easily be ruined by one uncaring employee.I was surprisingly impressed with my stay here! It is the best value hotel near the Harbor and across the street from the Convention Center. The lobby is gorgeous and newly renovated. Only one elevator worked during my stay, and considering I was on the ninth floor during a conference, we stopped on every floor for every trip. There is no ADA ramp at the front entrance, just a few stairs. My queen double bed room was outstanding. Bathroom was small, but the sink/mirror space is outside of the bathroom. Our AC unit was also broken, but it wasn't a big issue considering it was freezing outside during our time in Baltimore. Housekeeping and guest services were very courteous and supportive of our requests.  Definitely the best value near the Harbor (short walk), and especially for the Convention Center.The staff at the front desk is VERY rude and arrogant...the front desk supervisor... I think her name was Marion; not sure but I know her initials were M.M.  Was extremely snotty and inconsiderate considering they were the ones who messed up our reservation in the first place. Instead of working with us to rectify the situation she decided to blow us off and give us a horrible attitude. The dirty looks and rude body language she was giving us while talking to her made me EXREAMLY upset. When you are spending $200 a night on a room (even though our reservation was SUPPOSED to be $99 a night) at the very least I would expect alittle respect and kindness. We travel a lot for our business and we will never stay at a days inn again.I'm a bit of a hotel snob and I would normally never stay in a Days Inn. However, this was all that was available for a quick work trip and it's surprisingly nice (for a Days Inn). The 4 stars is for comparison with similarly priced hotels, not Hilton, etc. Very clean. Super friendly front desk staff, and convenient location and parking. A little surprised there was no free breakfast option, and the hotel is a tiny bit dated and has an ""older hotel smell"".Rooms are clean, staff is helpful &amp; friendly, beds are comfy, but walls are very thin.  The traffic outside is loud. At 4:10am I can hear a baby crying, a TV &amp; the elevators.  Security finally got the neighbors to stop arguing. Not a good hotel for the light sleeper.Great rates and clean!  Linens were clean and it was really very quiet.  I actually slept (which is something that I have a difficult time with in hotels).  What else can you really ask for from an inexpensive hotel in the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore?I was really not looking forward to staying here. I'm normally a Hampton inn guy, and thought days inn wouldn't be as nice. However, the location was perfect and my room was clean and well appointed. Parking was ridiculous ($27 a day) but I've heard that is normal for baltimore.Excellent location.  Easy walk to convention center and waterfront . Rooms are average.Staff is helpful and friendly but not enough of them - waitVery nice front desk and rooms are good. I don't like when bathrooms have the sink outside but it's ok. Elevators are kinda slow and rooms are small but well furnished. I wish the bathroom was a bit cleaner. Excellent location though, especially for the convention center. Parking is expensive but there are plenty of garages around.I stayed at a Days Inn, once, for one night only, after a 12 hour drive from Salem, MA to Dumfries, VA.  I vowed never to return to one.  So when I heard I had to stay in one for work, I was not happy.  Until I found out it was the Days Inn Inner Harbor, which was recently renovated and has the friendliest staff ever.  Seriously, the staff was fabulous - I was surprised.It is still a Days Inn, but this one is a bit nicer due to the renovations.  I am super picky about hotels, and would stay here again.   Dated decor, TV's are bad, lighting is poor, phones are old, elevators are slow, gym equipment is basic - you get the picture.  Parking is steep - $22 for 24 hours, but you are downtown.   However, everything was clean and comfortable, and if you only need a place to sleep and shower, this is absolutely fine.I stayed at the Days Inn in the Inner Harbor Baltimore for 1 night 12/31/2013. It was the most horrible hotel experience.Pros* Fast check-in* Free Wifi* Good locationCons* Long elevator wait, which was dirty and small and limited to 1. Stairways were dark and dirty; later in the evening the landings were littered with beer cans and liquid that I hoped was beer* The 3rd floor smelled of marijuana (through the whole stay; I am asthmatic)* Room was freezing! Turned the very loud and very outdated heater on high for 2 hours and still cold. Turned out there was a severe draft under the heating system* Tall lamp not functioning* Roundy guests in the lobby, men fighting (on the phone, with other guests, with staff), girls with exposed body parts (due to their level of intoxication); again, long elevator wait* Front desk, housekeeping/room service, and wake-up call buttons not working on phone (were busy for hours). Had to call the hotel's main number from my cell phone for service. Was told that the buttons sometimes don't work... after this I tested the button and it worked. I assumed that they left the phone off the hook* Paper thin walls; could hear neighbors laughing, yelling, throwing up, coughing until 5:30am. Called security and there was no sign of them* Bed and pillows too plush (may be a personal preference, but it kept us awake); weird small* Room faced parking lot and a car alarm was going off at all hours of the night* Awake until 5:30am! We contemplated packing up the car and leaving around 5:00am, but we didn't want to drive while exhausted* Checkout was fine (because we got there at 10:45; 11am the lobby was a mad house)* Complained to the manager about our stay. Because we booked through Kayak and paid for our parking, nothing could be discounted at that time. Promised a call back and it has been a week and I have not gotten a callI visit the Inner Harbor often and we usually stay at the Renaissance or Hilton. To save money, we tried the Days Inn and wish we never had! This was the worse hotel stay we have ever experienced! My fiance and I considered going back during a less busy evening (not New Years Eve), but the lack of follow-up from management has convinced me otherwise. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone I know.  Loud guests, thin walls, lack of sleep, no security in lobby, lack of attention from some staff, dirty/cramped/limited elevators, faulty AC/heat, etc. I just can't spend my hard earned money on service like that.This is a great place to stay in the middle of inner harbor. Everything is within walking distance. It's approximately 15 minutes away from the BWI airport by car / taxi. This will cost you approximately $42 with tip.The light rail to/from the airport to the Convention Center (this is the name of the stop right outside the hotel) is approximately a 40-minute ride for $1.60 per person one way.It's right down the street from the Baltimore Convention Center. The Washington Monument is approximately a 20-minute walk north of the hotel. You'll also pass by the Basilica of the Assumption too. We walked 2 miles south to the hotel on St. Charles street, past the gay bars, etc. at 2am!! It was pretty safe for two (little?) Chinese girls. The harbor is approximately a 10-minute walk south of the hotel. We were able to walk to the American Visionary Arts Museum, Federal Hill, The Harborplace and Gallery, etc.Enough about the awesome location in Inner Harbor. Let's talk about the room.We had a single room with two double beds. Our room faces a parking lot. Not much of a view, but that's okay. We came to Baltimore to spend time outside the hotel room. The beds were comfortable. They had more than enough available electrical outlets for our phones.The lights were a little weird though. Right when we came in through the door, we couldn't figure out what one of the switches turn on. The other two were for the fan and light in the bathroom. Speaking of the bathroom, this is a little funky too. The sink is OUTSIDE the bathroom. Interesting... The drain in the bathtub also doesn't work as well as we'd like. It'd take another 5 minutes for it to completely drain away after our showers. The staff at the Inn were really friendly and nice. We lost our luggage stub and they let us look for our luggages in the closet. That was really nice of them. I'd definitely stay here again, if I were to come back to Baltimore.The best choice for value oriented travelers. Two thirds the price of the nearby convention hotel. Great service. Friendly staff. A bit of street noise in my room. Also an annoying $1 per day ""safe fee"" that they quickly remove when asked. My room had a broken alarm clock which was finally replaced. And the floor lamp had no light bulb. Very convenient location. Near the light rail which is $1.60 to BWI. Be sure and check out the Charles Street area (Mt Vernon neighborhood). You can work out at the nearby Better Bodies gym and shop at the grocery store just beyond it (Fresh Fields?). This is the best Days Inn save for the one in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood.(Oh and I forgot to mention 3 free computers in the business center and guest laundry.)PS This is not the Ritz nor are you paying such room rates.You can do better.  Mediocre hotel with unhelpful staff (except for the wait staff in the restaurant who were friendly and helpful, regrettably the food was not great).  On the plus side my room had a small, but not very comfortable couch, and there were lots of power outlets.  Also the gym was decent.  On the down side, the parking fees are OUTRAGEOUS ($27/day and anything more than about 3 hours results in a $27 charge so an overnight stay can result in $54 in parking fees).  The elevator is also painfully slow.A great place to say right in the heart of it all. Very close to the harbor. Very clean and safe. I also like the fact that the parking garage can only be entered after you swipe your room key to lift the gate so you can pull in so your car will have a safe night as well.Had to go to Baltimore for a conference at the Baltimore Convention Center.  Being a resident, i booked the cheapest yet decently reviewed hotel that was close to the convention center.Pros:- GREATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT location! seriously less than 1 minute walk to the convention center. It was So nice especially since it was raining.- The service: the front desk along with the security guards were so accommodating and welcoming. I was in a suit for a presentation and it was raining. I had NO umbrella. While I stood out in front of the hotel just staring at the rain.. the security guard gave me an extra poncho that he had! He was SOOO nice. THANK YOU!!!!!-Forgot to bring a toothbrush so I asked the front desk for one. The quality of the toothbrush is probably the best toothbrush that any hotel has ever given me -- even compared to high end hotels in Vegas.-The hotel room has everything  you need --- coffee pot, refrigerator, iron, blowdryer-FREEEE WIFI!- The shuttle to the airport stops by the hotel every 45 of the hour. :)- Very friendly location for visitors allowing us to not rent a car but to walk to everything!Cons:- The bedding is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO itchy! Just really low thread count sheets.- The refrigerator kept buzzing off and on throughout the night. I'm a very very heavy sleeper.. but I kept waking up throughout the night.- it has a funny smellFor the price.... I got everything I needed. I just gave it 3 stars because of the itchy itchy sheetsThe quality of the accommodation was about what you'd expect from a hotel at the Days Inn price point; adequate-but-not-wonderful beds, simple rooms with entry-level appliances (including my personal dread of having to choose in midsummer heat between being awake because of the heat or because of the noise from the cheap AC). That's their business model and you know what you're getting. That said, this place goes above and beyond in just about every other way. The facilities (business center, restaurant and coffee shop, pool, etc.) were more than I was expecting, but the most pleasant surprise was the staff. They have some of the smartest, most pleasant, most accommodating staff I've ever seen at a budget-friendly hotels (well, actually, they were smarter and nicer than I've gotten at plenty of nicer hotels), from the desk clerks and concierge right down to the security guards.You need something? You have a problem? They find a solution - a normal, people-with-common sense solution right there on the spot and with a smile. No ""let me get a manager,"" no ""we don't do that,"" no ""I don't know, sorry."" It's so simple and yet it was such a pleasant surprise and made such a positive impression that I really came away with a good feeling here. Also - especially considering that downtown Baltimore is horrible to drive in - the excellent, convenient, walkable location was really a plus.","A great value for the price. Free Wifi, my room was immaculate, the room looked recently renovated as does much of the hotel. The staff is incredibly nice and helpful, from the front desk to the restaurant and everywhere in between. My only complaint is that 1 elevator was out of service which meant long waits.Ahhh the many ups and downs, mostly downs, but we can pretend....Ups: The location literally could not be better if you are staying at this hotel to attend an event at the convention center. You can see the convention center from the hotel and it is literally one block away! Also, a great location for walking around the buzzing area around the Aquarium with all the bars, restaurants, and shopping. The staff members were extremely friendly and upbeat. Downs: Only 2 elevators within the building. The hotel is 9 floors and we were on the 8th. This seems to be a very busy hotel, so waiting for the elevators could sometimes take nearly 10 minutes when the line was out the door each night. Why not just take the stairs you ask? They closed the stairway around 9 p.m. each night, I guess because people would smoke in there? Still, it really caused a jam. The beds and pillows were the worst I've ever attempted to sleep in. I'm a bit spoiled by my bed and pillows at home, but this was just out right bad. I woke up over 10 times a night and just could not find a comfy spot! I typically fall asleep within minutes, so this was not pleasant. The bathroom was teeny tiny! Also, the elevators and hallways reaked of weed! Everyone was talking about it. Where the party was, I couldn't tell ya, but it appeared to be everywhere!For the price and location, I didn't mind it, but I will either bring my own pillows or choose another hotel next visit!My group has been reserving two rooms at the Days Inn for over 10 years now for the Otakon convention. We absolutely love it there, and would be so disappointed to go anywhere else. This year at check-in on Thursday, the staff had a table set up with free cookies and iced tea. After spending several hours on trains to get there from DC when our flights got diverted, I couldn't have appreciated those more!When we got to our rooms, our toilet wasn't working right. I called the front desk and a maintenance guy was there within 5 minutes. We came to know this guy well (Hi Larry!). He was amazing and every time we passed him the halls, he was so excited to see us. XD I absolutely love the staff at the Days Inn, every year they go above and beyond to welcome us. They even had a banner hanging to welcome con-goers, and they offer specials in their restaurant since they tend to know everyone's on a budget.One other good plus is that they don't mind peeps using the stairwells, in fact they encourage it. This helps a ton in alleviating the elevator congestion. We were on the 5th floor this year, and had no problem getting to our rooms at all.Free wifi, fridges, microwave, hair dryer, super comfy beds and HD TVs with open jacks to hook up our game systems to make this our go to hotel every single year for Otakon.Absolutely awesome hotel. Relatively small rooms European style (it is an old brick building). Simplicity is key, but all was very well thought out. Rooms have a big flatscreen TV and free wi-fi. Excellent service, by all staff. Closest hotel to the conference center. Will definitely stay here again.The hotel the conference was located in offered a special rate of $189 a night. Being a starving graduate student, I hit <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>. At under $100, the Days Inn sounded good to me (and it was only about a mile away).OK... that's a mile of territory that can't be walked, safely. So I relied on a lot of cabs, at $5-$10 a ride. It still ended up cheaper than if I'd stayed at the conference hotel.Free wifi, a reasonably comfortable (if really, really small and cramped) room, a pool, and Seattle's Best coffee in the lobby. Important pluses, in my book.<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> doesn't warn you that parking is $20 extra a night. Parking ANYWHERE in the Inner Harbor, apparently, is that expensive. But how does one manage to plan and build a hotel -- a hotel, for godssake -- without offering guests any parking?The air conditioning was broken. So was the bathroom fan, so the room acquired a swamplike feel. The sink was clogged. I was irritated. I mentioned the issues, as I left for a day of lectures. They were fixed when I returned. Ah, better!One of the better chains.Comfy and charming value right near everything! Clean, good hotel with a spiffy little outdoor pool. Staffed by polite and helpful people. I was in a smallish but good room with two double beds. The hair dryer worked good, the TV was alittle outdated, but the room had a large mini fridge. Parking was not cheap but the location can't be beat. Tip for those doing their own driving in Baltimore as a newbie...make sure your car has GPS or plop down $12 a day to include one with a rental car. Charm city was way more charming with my GPS. I visited once before without one, and I spent as much time getting unlost as I did getting lost.Great location. Reasonably priced. The room was clean and smoke free. There are only two elevators and sometimes that can result in long waits, given the size of the place. Overall I am very happy with my stay at the Days Inn.Compared to many of the hotels in the area: prices were great.$119 a night wasn't bad at all. Staff @ the Front Desk were not the friendliest people in the world; but then I remembered that I was in Baltimore &amp; that must have been the A-Winning personality that I heard so much about.Room was nice; apparently, recently renovated.HD TVs in the room, but nothing in HD; all Standard Definition programming (that's always a little annoying).Parking was $20 a day.  Hotel Restaurant prices were real good too.We booked a room here based on price &amp; proximity to the Inner Harbor; we got a wheelchair-accessible room with a roll-in shower for about $150/night.  The room was nicely appointed with all sorts of free goodies (granola bars, water, popcorn).  The furniture was typical hotel,  but we didn't care so long as it was clean (it was).  What interactions we had with the staff were positive - they even held our bags when we arrived early so we could explore in the meantime.I see that someone wasn't thrilled with the elevator wait; I can understand that, but we didn't encounter problems.There is a restaurant on premises, but we decided to eat elsewhere to get a feel for the neighborhood.Quibbles:1. The bathroom sink didn't allow for us to rest toiletries there; the edges were too narrow &amp; what surfaces there were were sloped into said sink.  Annoying.2. It's wonderful &amp; helpful that they have a room with a roll-in shower &amp; attached, flip-up seat, but  said seat is hard as a rock - no padding whatever.  It's a bit hard (no pun intended) on the behind.Overall, I'd go back.Great place to stay.  Easy walk to most downtown attractions. Friendly staff.  Great price for it's location.  I will stay here  again.  Ohh. Ya. It was CLEAN.Staying here for the Baltimore tattoo convention. Second day in a row with no hot water. A hotel shouldn't run out of hot water every morning if they are hosting a convention. They should have enough hot water for multiple guests to shower at once. Extremely disappointed with this place.HAHAHA! OMG! I think I had this exact same room with the blood stain on the ceiling! Was it room 511 (I think that's was our room number...)? The rat must have changed residence in the three weeks between our stays and I had no problems with the Internet connection. The close proximity to the ballpark was enough for me and the price was more reasonable than most. I found it to be in a fairly safe spot in Baltimore... so that was a bonus... but we only stayed a night...and we were drinking... so Lei probably knows better than I do!!!I live about an hour away, but my wife and I got a room here to avoid any drinking and driving after attending the Chelsea vs AC Milan game at M&amp;T Field on Friday night with out breaking the bank. For that purpose, the hotel was perfect. The location could not have been much better to get to the stadium and entertainment on Pratt Street. Also when leaving town, there is not an easier place in the city to get going south bound on 95 (or 295 or 97). Finally the cost of $150 beat most of the other hotels in the Inner Harbor by half. That is where any convenience ends. Our overnight plans fell through late Thursday so we scrambled Thursday night to find a room. I did a basic Inner Harbor search by cost and came up with the Days Inn as one of the top options. I called the Days Inn and was told they they were booked before I could get my question out. I called all the other hotels in the area up to $200 and was told more politely they all were booked. I went to sleep to contemplate my options. When I woke my wife wanted to give it a try so took my list and was going to call them all again. The first one she called was Days Inn, and we got a room. Checking in was fine but we found out parking was not included and would cost $20 a night. This wasn't shocking, but it would have been nice to be told when you book. The whole building feels old. Carpet, wallpaper, furniture... all just gave me the feeling that the place probably has mold issues. Also, they have two elevators for 10 or so floors that had us waiting and waiting and waiting. Also, we got rejected when we called down at 10:30am to see if we could extend check-out to noon. Overall, the place was a place where we could sleep from 4am to 11pm. Besides that, the staff was not friendly, the place made me want to sleep with an extra layer of clothes, and wouldn't want to stay here again.Everything was fine until we noticed strange things in our room.There seem to be what looked like a splat of blood on the ceiling. Our heating unit would randomly make loud screeching sounds that woke us up in the middle of the night. The best part of our stay was the huge rat that lived under our beds. They moved us to another room that had a toilet that wouldn't flush and the front desk guy brought us a plunger and handed to my friend to fix the problem. In their computer room, the internet connection sucked because any page you tried to look up was blocked. Also, an employee on break was on a computer and didn't get up to let a hotel guest use it. WTF??The restaurant staff was pretty cool...although I couldn't stop thinking about the rat in our room...what about their kitchen??Staff is friendly and everything was in working order.  The fridge and microwave is a plus.  Best water pressure I've ever felt in a hotel shower!  Was amazed by that!  Great location for the convention center and the harbor.Eh. The location is great but the rest is just ok. They charge guests $20 bucks a day for parking I hate that. The rooms are ok a little cramped. It was clean though. The sink is outside of the bathroom which is weird when you have four people sharing on space. Also the air conditioner was so loud you could not hear each other talk. The elevator is another HUGE issue. There are only two and 8 floors of guests. Do the math it doesnt work. Sunday am when checking out the elevator stopped at every floor before finally getting to the bottom. There is also no force close button. They really should be a little more efficient. Use the money we are paying for parking to upgrade it! Thanks!My car broke down outside of this Days Inn. I went inside to ask for some help and the front desk help was amazingly kind and helpful. While I was waiting for the hotel's engineer to meet me in the lobby, the front desk staff told me (and my friend) to make ourselves comfortable in the lobby and use the restroom, etc. as needed. I heard them answer a phone call and they kindly explained to the person on the other end that they have a lost and found and could send the person their missing item (I've never ever heard of a hotel doing this for anyone). The engineer, Greg, helped me fix my car and I was on my way. I have never stayed at this hotel because I live nearby but based on this experience I would highly recommend it based on the courteousness of the staff. The lobby was also clean and bright and this hotel is right on the light rail line to BWI airport. I highly recommend Days Inn at Hopkins Place.We stayed at this hotel during the 2nd leg of your trip to Maryland.We were very pleased that we were able to get a hotel right in Inner Harbor for the price we booked through a travel vendor.This hotel was one of the highest rated within the price point I had searched.I had read that the rooms were small, but clean and comfortable.We weren't concerned with having alot of space as were were not going to spend alot of time in the room.We did want a pool,fitness room and a place to eat on premises if we needed too.We also wanted clean and comfortable rooms.The Days Inn Inner Harbor provided that.My only complaint is that the they charge $20 per day for parking.To be more competitive with area garages AND as a consideration for PAYING GUESTS they should offer a much lower price.With that being said,I will try to book there again.The staff we interacted with,The Doorman,the desk clerks,coffee barista and lifeguard were very pleasant and helpful.Got a room at a very decent rate prior to the marathon. Room decor was a little dated but room was spacious and had fridge/microwave. For this price and location on a busy weekend, I was very happy with the hotel.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-baltimore-baltimore,Hilton Baltimore,3.0,$$$,147,"I spent one night at the Hilton while in town to see Garth Brooks at Royal Farms Arena.  I was traveling with my 6 year old son.  We had room 2003 on the 20th floor (top floor).Pros:Located in nice, redeveloped area - Whereas most of the area between Penn Station and the waterfront has come upon hard times, the hotel is in a nice area.  While it is a little further from the waterfront activities, it is connected to the convention center via skywalk and right next door to Camden Yards.   Royal Farms Arena is 3 blocks away.View - Our room had an awesome view of Camden Yards and M&amp;T Bank Stadium.  The room - Standard 4 star Hilton room.  No over the top touches you would expect at a higher end property (Waldrop, St. Regis, etc.) but very solid for its class.  Although this hotel has been open a few years, everything in our room was still in good shape.   Water pressure in shower was good.   We were a good distance from the elevator and found the room to be very quiet.Food and beverage - We didn't try to the onsite restaurant (Diamond Tavern) but found the onsite Jimmy John's and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf locations to be very economical (normal prices) and convenient. Early check in - we were able to get into our room at 12:45pm.Business center in Lobby - Business center in lobby worked well to print a document.Cons:Layout of hotel - The hotel is located on both sides of S. Eutaw St.; the front desk could have done a better job explaining the sky walks.  It took some trial and error for us to find our way around.Room darkening curtains - The direct sun in morning really heated up our room and curtains were badly overmatched.  The windows probably need some type of glazing to supplement the curtains.BIG convention hotel - Expect heavy elevator traffic and long walks - probably 10 minutes to get from our room to Jimmy John's for lunch on Sunday morning.Lounge was unremarkable - I will admit that we did not make breakfast on Sunday morning, but the offerings during the day on Saturday afternoon were very average.  The selection of soft drinks was good but the only food offering was some cheap snack mix that set out in the open all day.  Having just left a very good lounge at the Grand Hyatt in Washington DC, this was a definite letdown.General:We felt extremely safe at the hotel and in the harbor area, however the rest of the area between Penn Station and the hotel was pretty run down.  There was a significant amount of loitering on the North Side of Royal Farms Arena.  After walking from the hotel to the other side of the harbor, we used the metro from the Shot Tower station and felt the same.  Uber was reliable but seemed to be perpetually on surge.Overall:I would definitely stay here again when returning to Baltimore.  We felt safe in and around the hotel and the room was the typical quality you expect from Hilton.Clean room.  Friendly staff.However, not worth the $400+ a night they charged me.  Not staying here again for this price!  Crazy.Very impressed with the staff located at all stations throughout the hotel, cleanliness of the room, and the hotel itself.  I wish the refrigerators were included with the room (instead of for a $25 fee).  I didn't see one speck of mold in the shower, which I feel is sometimes rare for hotels.Will stay again!I did not stay overnight here, but visited my in-laws' room, as well as had some drinks in the bar downstairs. It's your typical Hilton hotel, probably a little larger than other locations and it's attached to the Convention Center. The room itself was pretty standard, but my mother in law said it was really dusty. The drinks at the bar were fine...I'm not a huge Hilton fan, but it's definitely a convenient location to shopping and dining, and obviously the convention center, and can be accessed by the Light Rail easily as well.I'm an HHonors Diamond member so this is my go-to place to stay in Baltimore whenever I have to go there on business. Let's just say that if I didn't have business in Baltimore, I would really never have a reason to go there. The location of this place in the Inner Harbor area is a little deceiving since it is on the Orioles Stadium side, not the true Inner Harbor so don't expect to see any water from your room. Do expect to see the inside of the stadium if you stay in an odd numbered room from about 1-35 on floors higher than about 10. Pretty cool on game days. This hotel is modern, lots of glass and marble in the lobby, skyway connected to the convention center. Self parking is $30/day(!) and oddly enough, you have to go to a different area than check in to arrange this. Also beware that on game days, the garage fills to capacity immediately so if you take your car out, don't expect to get back in until the game is over. The staff is friendly, the exec lounge is what you would expect with a highlight being a nice view into the stadium. A couple shortfalls are that the rooms are not very soundproofed so on game days, you hear the cheers, the music, the fireworks, etc. Also, most of the touristy Inner Harbor things are a 10-15 min walk to the other end and if you walk the wrong way, you will quickly realize the true grittiness of urban Baltimore so beware. Overall, a perfectly serviceable hotel, offers everything you would expect from a Hilton property at a convention center.Meh...  Honestly if there was a shade under 3, I'd have used it.  It was good as a business facility, descent meeting rooms and the catering was top notch,  that was what saved this from a 2-star review.  As a place to stay it really needs some help.  For such a prime location right next to both Major League stadiums, and right by Inner Harbor, in my mind they need to really pay attention to staying up to date.  The furniture in my room was severely worn.  The bindings on the chair arms was cracked and peeling, the fabric was really faded and had some seriously ground in staining.  The desk, bedside table and TV stand were all dinged and chipped, showing age and in theory abuse.  The most offensive part was what I found in the bathroom. There was mold, or at least a seriously thick black line under the sink rim, directly under the faucet as well as cracked and dirty/moldy grout in the shower.  I think they need to have a real chat with the maintenance folks especially the cleaning group.  My company picked this place, I have no control,but if I ever do have an option, my vote will be fore somewhere else.My co-workers and I stayed here for a meeting a few weeks ago.  Great service and hotel except for the roaming homeless people all over town giving you each their sad stories about why they need money.  I had about 5 homeless people (including inside the hotel) ask me for money.  As much as I'd love to help each out, I'd be poor if I helped each one.  Tonya at the bar was a character, except we were a bit offended when she was talking to a group of people for about 5 minutes before she acknowledged us.  When we said, ""Excuse me, can we order?""  She mentioned she'll be there in a few....she was catching up with her sister.  Overall it was a good experience but I would hate to see Tonya REALLY annoyed :)Good, simple, clean hotel. I'm a huge fan of hotels that have duvets with *white cotton covers so that you know they wash them for every new guest and this place does that. About a 10 minute walk to the inner harbor and connected to the convention center.I came here for a conference and was impressed with the space throughout the 2nd floor.I can't say I agree with any of the naysayer reviews posted. Yes, parking is extra, but that is typical for a downtown hotel. I got free wifi, but I guess that could have been thanks to my silver (lowest) status with Hilton. I did need to wait a few minutes to check in, but they had my room ready for me and were very polite!I didn't get a fancy view, but the room was a fair size. The king bed was comfortable to watch tv on, but didn't seem to translate perfectly to a good nights sleep. Still more pros than cons with this Hilton and its location.This is the first year our group stayed here while attending Otakon. Our previous Otakon hotel, the Baltimore Harbor Hotel, really let us down at checkout in 2014 and our whole experience was less than acceptable, causing this move. The Hilton Baltimore is more expensive than many other Otakon hotels, but its location next to the Baltimore Convention Center makes it very attractive. Main entrance was not large but we got unloaded quickly. Valet parking was $42 per night, though expensive was worth it. Check in was smooth with no issues. Six elevators serve the main hotel floors. After arriving to our room we found a major issue, the reserved double was only a single. They had no more doubles but were able to get us a rollaway. Room was very basic with no mini-refrigerator or microwave. I noticed some minor wear and tear including scratches on the TV and some marks on the bedding, but nothing serious. Soundproofing was surprisingly good and we could not hear other rooms. The Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, located in the lobby, is a nice but not cheap place to grab a pastry. The Hilton's convention space and sky bridge to the Baltimore Convention Center is a major advantage to staying here. Convention space in the Hilton is nice and spread across two different buildings. The sky bridge to the Baltimore Convention Center has one major flaw. Directly before the convention center there is a choke point due to a narrow staircase and handicap elevator.Overall, even with some issues, our stay was good and we will be returning due to the Hilton's convenience.I  stayed for 2 nights, it was about 2 blocks from the National Harbor so there was plenty to do. I gave it 3 stars simply because I had to call 4 times for someone to give me fresh towels/wash cloths and the chair and bedding on the bottom looks as if a pets scratched on it for dear life!!! Ugggh the parking was expensive ( valet $42 a day) on top of their nightly rates. Ehh I may stay again in the near future maybe at another locationWe came here from DC on our way to NYC for a baseball game.  The hotel was average, clean and comfy.  It was about a 10 minute walk into the harbor where most of the shopping and restaurants were.  The room service food was nothing to write home about either... No bell hop to help with luggage and you had to pay for parking at a separate window, it wasn't included in your hotel fees.  The hotel seemed to lack service in the lobby area altogether.The best part of this hotel is the view of Camden Yards!I enjoyed my stay here and did not have any complaints. The rooms were clean and the staff is friendly. Nothing jumped out at me as truly exceptional, but then again I did not make use of the amenities they offered.As far as parking goes, it is all underground. I appreciated having the option to pay for a valet or self-park, so that was nice. The Cleveland Browns also happened to be staying there, not that they changed anything but it was still cool. All in all, I would be happy to stay here again.My union had our national convention at this hotel. Of all the hotels we've had conventions at that I've attended this one was the best. The reason is simple-- the staff. Friendly and helpful as hell from front desk to bellmen to bartenders/waitstaff/baristas to housekeeping. They gave us a very warm welcome and wore our union's (UE) buttons in solidarity with us. Other UE brothers and sisters attending the convention also raved about how great and friendly the staff is. Really blew us all away how genuinely friendly everyone who worked at this hotel were. Members of UNITE-HERE Local 7, they are presently in negotiations with the Hilton for a new contract so wish them luck as they certainly deserve everything they're asking for which isn't much.Also big plus are the beds, very comfy, nice duvets and sheets, as well as the room views, many of which have clear views of Camden Yards so you can essentially watch a live ball game for free.Only downside: insufficient outlets in the rooms-- they really need to get with the times on this. Also parking is pricey.But overall great experience at a great hotel with great staff.The Hilton is always a favorite among my group of friends as we attend 2 conventions in the attached BCC each year. Never had a problem with checking in early and the front desk staff are quick to address any questions we had. Love the location to the BCC as I wear several large costumes to both Otakon and Bronycon and the skywalk is a blessing in those instances.Only real issue we've had with the Hilton  was with their parking staff. If you're parking valet park on the right side of their drop off zone. If you're unloading luggage, park on the left side. We were unaware of this one year and dealt with a very rude parking attendant. The left side was parked up so we parked on the right to quickly unload our car (maybe took 10 minutes) and the attendant insisted if we were parked there we needed a bellhop to help us unload the car and use their valet service. After reassuring him several times we were just being dropped off and unpacking our own luggage he eased off as more guests arrived. I think he was looking to make a few bucks but the entire exchange was unpleasant.While attending a Hazardous Materials Conference in Baltimore, we stayed at the Hilton Inner Harbor in downtown Baltimore, conveniently located next to the Baltimore Orioles baseball stadium and near the convention center. The hotel was comfortable, clean and quiet, with a coffee shop on the lobby level. If we ranked the hotel on this alone, we'd give it a 5 stars, but they have some serious recordkeeping issues. Before arriving, we'd adjusted our check-out date by phone, but the update was never entered, requiring a second phone call. Then after arrival, our room wasn't cleaned until late afternoon when a supervisor came to inspect, surprised because their records showed our room was vacant. Upon check-out, our bill was correct except our room number. Oh, and don't expect to check in before 4 PM.Due to the few issues mentioned above, we would rate this hotel 4 stars out of 5. If they improved these recordkeeping issues, they would definitely rate 5 stars.Ernie &amp; Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith &amp; Foodies BlogGreat hotel that's right in the Inner Harbor if you're into that sort of thing and also a block from Camden Yards, I always did not like this hotel because it blocks the clocktower from being seen when you are in Camden Yards which is something that I grew up with, but the rooms here are very nice and the amenities are also very nice. I would stay here again, although it seems like everytime I do its because I get it on HotWire.Came here for a conference. Had an average stay. Would probably not willingly stay here again and here's why:- My boss was nice enough to book a king bed for me. We get there and they tell us they ran out. - The room itself was nice and clean, but for their rates it's kind of ridiculous. I stayed at a holiday inn that looked exactly like this room. - Charging guests for Wi-Fi is absolutely absurd! - I hate hotels that don't have late night eats. I'll settle for a vending machine. Everything in here closes way too early.But all of it wasn't bad:- I had a great view of Camden Yards.- The bartender Hashim was a peach.- It's a great location. Was able to get to much public transportation from here.Gigantic Bust.I come to Baltimore every year for a conference and I usually stay at the Marriott. I decided to stay here since I was a HHonors member. I was sorely disappointed from the day I arrived. I filled out a form asking me if I wanted anything to be in my room when I arrived. I ordered a few things and none of them were there upon arrival and I ended up waiting several hours for them.Room service took FOREVER. I understood there were two major conventions going on at once, but 3 hours for barely lukewarm food at almost $100 for three people was ridiculous. I got better food across the street at the bars than I did here. Housekeeping SUCKED. The first night they said the 'Do Not Disturb' sign was up. I found that to be hilarious since I didn't even have a sign and requested one. When they finally came, all they did was make the beds with dirty sheets, didn't replace the towels, or remove the food service trays that had sat outside the room for over 18 hours.You also pay through the nose for everything. $40/day for Valet, $28/day to park yourself, $12/day for very shitty WiFi, $12-40/glass for wines you can pick up for $15/bottle, $8 for a 12 Oz domestic beer and $6/can for pop. I was surprised I wasn't charged per trip up and down the elevator. I had booked in their Executive Suites, so I expected a little more than I got. When I complained to the front desk manager, she rolled her eyes and walked away from me.It would take an act of God to get me back in this hotel and I'll tell everyone how bad it was.The room and view are very nice. But what's the point of reserving a room with a king sized bed when it's not ""guaranteed?"" My husband and I checked in and the gentleman at the front desk reiterated that it was for a king sized bed... We got up to the room and found out we got stuck in a room with two full sized beds. Called the front desk and the woman just kept saying they ""sold out of king sized rooms."" No mention of that when checking in though?!? Not the best way you want to celebrate your first wedding anniversary....","I stayed here in April 2015 for the Food Safety Summit.What I liked:- Great view from the 14th floor. I was able to see Camden Yards (unfortunately the scheduled games were cancelled due to the Freddie Gray rioting and looting in the area)- Nice, updated decor throughout the hotel. Upscale feel.- Very polite, helpful staffWhat I didn't like:- When I first got to my room, I thought I heard a vacuum cleaner either next door or upstairs. The problem? The sound literally NEVER stopped. Obviously it wasn't a vacuum. Maybe I was near a laundry room? Or it could have been the HVAC system? Whatever it was, the non-stop humming noise was beyond annoying.- The coffee pot in my room was DIRTY AND DISGUSTING! See pics.- Very few outlets in the room, and they're all spread out in random parts of the room. I don't understand why hotels--especially a big one like the Hilton--don't cater to our need for ample outlets to charge all of our gadgets. First world problems, I know. But still.- Getting around this hotel is confusing and exhausting, particularly if you are attending an event at the Baltimore Convention Center (it's connected to the hotel). It's literally a 15-20 minute walk down random hallways, stairwells and bridges.- On my last morning, I was welcomed by an ant crawling from underneath my pillow.Tip: Don't wanna pay for wifi in your room? The events taking place at the hotel/convention center might have a free network password. You can ask for it at the desk, but they may require proof that you are there for an event.The staff here have been great. Everyone has been so friendly. Nice place with plenty to do nearby. Highly recommended.I'll make this quick. The location is great. The room I had was clean. No complaints there. But the king bed wasn't a king. I have a king at home. This was a queen at best. I've been in hotels where you get a real king size bed. Don't tell me it's a king and give me a queen. Plus, if your sleeping partner moves an inch the whole bed shakes. Let's just say it wasn't a great night's sleep. This hotel nickel and dimes you too much in other areas to shortchange you on the bed size on top of it. It's no better than three stars because of that.Came here on a business trip.....Offerings in the concierge lounge is sparse.  Continental breakfast and 2 hot dishes during the evening.  Cookies for dessert.Wifi was decent.  i was able to stream movies without problemsParking is sketchy.  I left my car in the deck and just walked to work everyday.Shuttle bus from outside the side entrance of the hotel 30 minutes past the hour every hour to the casino.Self parking was pretty easy, there are elevators to the lobby. We only stayed a night so can't comment much. One of the nicer Hiltons, rooms look new and the lobby is quite nice. Lobby was booming on a Wednesday night.Location is nice. Only thing I complain about is an odd smell but my fiance said its normal room smell. Reminds me of old sheets?We ordered bagels and they said it could take at least 40 minutes, ok that's fine.We have a pretty nice view of the city.They do charge for everything but so does every other hotel at this star level. Recently we learned that Marriott would block personal hot spots and force you to use their internet.I have to say that half of the fun of my vacation in Baltimore was the location of our hotel. The Hilton Baltimore is right next to Camden Yards, which I could see from our 11th floor room. We arrived at night and there was a game on. I could see the lights and the score and felt like I was in my own VIP suite with a King Bed. The room was nice and we ordered up a fridge for the week to make ourselves at home. The next day, I went to the gym and was blown away. Not only is it twice as big as regular gyms with a full lap pool, jacuzzi and hot sauna - it has a deck with chairs where you can watch the game for free. You can hear it, see the home plate and all bases. Like sitting in the Extra Outfield. Every neighborhood or place I wanted to go to was within 1.5 miles of the hotel, so I walked almost everywhere. Otherwise there is the Circular which is a free bus shuttle that goes all through the different neighborhoods or the Water Taxi, which is nearby in the Inner Harbor and by far the best way to travel. Housekeeping staff was very friendly and kept our room clean and stocked. I like to swim everyday, so I shower a lot and need extra shampoo/conditioner and towels. The beds are firm yet very comfortable, I slept great which means a lot away from home. I would recommend this hotel to any fan of baseball. Being that close to Camden Yards and actually getting to see the game from your room is an AWESOME experience.Convenient to the convention centre. Rooms were fine.Service was okay. Didn't have our rooms made up one day because we had left items on the bed? I've never heard that before.Glad the conference rate included wifi - I would have been pissed to pay $13 a day for that.Expensive for what it is - glad work was paying.I stayed here with my wife and two kids for one night recently, and found it to be a pretty good hotel. The lobby is spacious and stylish, and there was plenty of room for my kids to run around and annoy people.Check-in was easy and quick, though I was disappointed to find that a room on the Camden Yards side would cost an extra $30. We declined and instead enjoyed a pretty decent northward view of the city. As a baseball fan, though, I would spring for the other side if I planned to be staying there while baseball was being played.Our room itself was nice and typically Hilton-y. Slick and white. No fridge in the room, and Wifi was not free. Checkout was purely by email notification, which is always nice.We stayed here in part so our kids would have the opportunity to swim in the hotel pool. It's a weird pool -- very long and narrow. When we visited, it was somewhat crowded, so there was a fair bit of jostling with strangers. There was also a deejay playing very loud salsa music, and many people dancing in and out of the water. I think the hotel was hosting some kind of salsa dancing event. The resulting pool scene was kind of charming, but kind of annoying too. A larger pool would have been appreciated.Bar opens at 5 says the concierge. Waiting at the bar while 3 employees bounce around and guests stand there waiting. Only served when I asked when they opened. Bartender replied oh I didn't notice no one had a drink. Haa that's your job dude. Absolutely terrible. Beautiful hotel. Skip the bar. They're not into working for tips.Fabulous hotel in Baltimore's Inner Harbor with pretty great views. I was attending a conference in the nearby Baltimore Convention center so it couldn't have been more convenient. I was on the 15th floor and had an incredible view of Camden Yards. I didn't dine at the hotel but used the store inside which was a little pricey but otherwise I enjoyed my stay.First Hilton Baltimore is expensive, but in a great location. My room is big but worn and not the cleanest. What pisses me really off:* I arrived a little early (12:15 PM) and my room wasn't available. The unfriendly receptionist offer me a $40 room upgrade for immediate availability. No thanks. --- In similar situations both Sheraton and Marriott offer me a free room upgrade or at least a free drink while I wait. * Generously the rude receptionist offers to call me once my room becomes available. 3:15 PM and still no call so I trot back to the hotel to ask. A more friendly receptionist now has a room available. * Earlier, while I was waiting for a little while in the lobby and noticed that the lobby bar is not open. (That's hospitality)* In the room now and they want $12+ for internet access. NFW. If you like expensive mediocrity: Stay at Hilton! Otherwise choose a guest friendly hotel.After traveling lots and staying at plenty of places this place is the worse. Attempting to check in was so slow they apologized and have some vouchers to the bar. That appeared to be fair then later we went to the bar to use the vouchers...wow waited for 30 minutes no service...finally after trying to flag some one down we get service with attitude. Will NEVER stay here or stop here for a drink. Just horrible!Other than the convenience of being close to the stadiums, there is no reason to stay at this hotel. I travel frequently, and have stayed in many Hilton hotels. This was by far the worst experience I've had at a Hilton or any hotel for that matter.The customer service was terrible on all ends. Before booking my reservation I wanted to make sure that I would be able to do an early check-in. They said that I could, so I went ahead and made the reservation. They failed to inform me that there was a $25 fee for an early check in which is unnecessary and a complete rip off. I've never been charged for an early check in at any other hotel I've stayed in. It should be done as a courtesy if available.After after agreeing to pay the fee, we arrived at our room which was supposed to have harbor view, of course no view! Why would I specifically pay extra for a view only to open my curtains and see nothing.What really encouraged me to write this review was when I called the front and asked if I could get extra silverware sent up to my room. The woman told me to walk down and pick it up from the front desk!The next morning, I was woken up by housekeeping knocking on my door two different times after I had the ""do not disturb"" sign on my door.Finally, when I called to see if I could do a late check out, the desk said there would be an extra charge. Big surprise. When I asked to speak with the manager the front desk said they were going to transfer me and hung up instead. My boyfriend and I decided to stay at a different hotel the rest of our visit. It just wasn't worth it. 1 Star for the location... The hotel itself was mediocre and the service was unsatisfactory.Not very clean.  Dusty throughout the entire room.  They are going to upgrade the lobby area with new stores, but it will be later in the year.  One advantage, it's right next door to Baltimore Convention Center.  I will never stay here again.Horrendous! This is why we don't stay at places like this... Check in was terrible. We waited so long (there was only one person being helped at the counter and we were next in line) that they gave us 4 drink coupons... Then we waited at the bar for 15 - 20 min at least to get waited on. The bar tender had an attitude. The table stayed filthy with glasses from the prior patron that never got removed! For $300 a night you'd expect a little more. Should have stayed at our local favorite the Renaissance ... Never againI am writing this review as I sit in the lobby now. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are just ok. There are not any convenient places to eat within (gift shop seems to stay closed). I suggest you bring snacks. It is winter and snowing so we have been snowed in and literally starving~ the hotel only has a Coffee Bean shop that closes at 2pm &amp; never has anything in stock to make whatever you order anyway. The hotel also has a tavern that oh course is for full course meals but you would get bored going there. No Panera bread, Starbucks, etc,. I'm surprised the Hilton wouldn't offer more accommodations/options for its quest. It offers a nice view of Orioles Park &amp; 2 highly expensive vending machines. It also has a bar...This is not a gluten free friendly establishment. Their room service closes at 11pm and there are literally no other food options. For being the Hilton and trying to promote their brand outside of business travel this is a terrible terrible lack of accommodation. We have stayed at the Hilton twice in two diff cities and they have proved to disappoint both times. We will no longer be booking any stays with the Hilton.I wish the Lobby Bar had its own listing here on Yelp, because I had a much better experience there than the hotel itself. But it doesn't so I averaged the two for ratings purposes.The hotel was rather pricey and didn't give you much in the way of room amenities. No free wi-fi unless you are a Gold or Platinum member. If you want it, it $13 a day. No refrigerator in the room, if you want one, you'd have to pay extra.Now, this isn't much different than other hotels, and I would have not minded it if the service was better. We got a pull away bed for our daughter (who is four) and asked to put it away from the window and the vent for the AC. The guy who brought up said ""No, I'll put it here (Near the window and the AC vent) so she can watch TV in bed. My wife and I had to move it after the guy left.One of our days, we left our room about 9am. The maid's cart was a few doors down. We come back a little before 5pm and our room wasn't even touched. I don't know if they were just understaffed or skipped our room or what, but that was unexpected.There are good things about the hotel as well. It is right next to Camden Yards and there is a patio next to the gym where you can sit and watch the game. It has a walkway that connects it to the convention center, and it is only about 4 blocks away from Inner Harbor.But the best thing about the hotel was the bar, and that was due to the two bartenders working there when I went, Ana and Mike. I'm not a hotel bar kind of guy but I was there two nights (one to hang out with a friend and his wife and the other to watch a football game).The first night the bar was practically empty. Ana and Mike were great with conversation, filling up our drinks and answering our questions about what they offered. The next night, the bar was packed with businessmen who were there for a convention. I marveled at the way Ana and Mike worked. No one had to wait more than a second for their drink order and even though my tab was a pittance compared to hundreds of dollars the business people were spending, I always had a drink waiting when I finished my previous one. They made me feel welcome. Just great, great service from great, great people. The hotel should sit the rest of their staff down with Ana and Mike so they can give them some pointers on good service.Great lobby for meetings and breakfast. Hotel is close to landmarks and the glass keeps the room open. This can get packed during conventions as it's across the street and when there are ball games.The room appeared cleanly.   I had no problems with elevator speediness despite being there for a HUGE conference, easy access to the gym mid-day (at least 6 treadmills), and no trouble getting cabs from the hotel.   Also the cleaning person was liberal about replacing my soap/shampoo/conditioner daily which is HUGE.  And the location can't be beat right next to the ball park and inner harbor.  The gym treadmills actually face the ballpark so if you were there during a game you'd be able to watch the whole thing.However, on the con side, the coffee they provided in room was horrible and there was no close by option except for one starbucks in the convention center that was swamped given the size of conference I attended.  It looks like they are putting in a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf but that's the kind of coffee they had in the rooms so does not seem like it will address the issue.  Also - one of my colleagues found bed bugs in her room.  Another colleague who stayed at Sheraton for same conference ALSO found bed bugs so clearly not something the Hilton has a monopoly on in Baltimore.  The electronic check out option on the TV did not work because of some technical glitch either. Finally, the air quality in the hotel seemed really bad - like there was not enough circulation.  I could barely run on the treadmill at the gym because of it.","If you're coming to an O's game from out of town, this hotel is very convenient. The side entrance puts you less than a block from the Eutaw Street gate of the park. With the rain yesterday, it was pretty nice to be able to wait at the hotel until things settled down. Additionally if you happen to be in town and there's a game happening, there's a terrace on the 4th floor the looks right into the stadium. There are rooms with balconies that also have the same view, but the terrace is accessible to all hotel guests. The hotel is less than a mile from Inner Harbor and in a very walkable area. Even with my dad's wheelchair we didn't have too many problems going around the area, minus the crowds there for the Star Spangled Banner celebration. The handicap accessible room was weirdly designed. There's a slight hallway before you turn into the area where the beds are. I'm sure they designed it that way so it would be easier to get a wheelchair in the room, but if you're dependent on your wheelchair to get around the entire room, it's not going to work. The rest of the room is designed like your average room, so there's limited space between the beds and dresser. The other problem I found was that the bedding retains heat really well, arguably too well. The bed itself was very comfortable, but the inferno that built up while you were laying there made it very difficult to stay comfortable throughout the night. We even lowered the temperature in the room to nearly 60 degrees and it was still never comfortable. This is probably more of a personal issue than universal, but still something worth noting in my opinion. Also they severely overcharge you for guest valet parking. Maybe it's the area, but $40/night seems rather high to me. Overall there are a lot of pros to staying at this hotel that would make it worth coming back, so I'd give it another shot &amp; recommend it to others.This Hilton gets no complaints from me! Perfect location if you're hitting either stadium for a baseball or football game or the convention center. Room was clean and spacious. Hotel staff were helpful and courteous. And if you can get a room facing Camden Yards, all the better. Overall great experience.Great location, but the colors used to decorate were obnoxious. I constantly felt overwhelmed , even in my room. The 70s called and they want their hotel back! The beds were comfortable and the workout room was great. Did you see the view? Please update this awesome location!I'm actually surprised by the number of negative reviews for this hotel.  We stayed here to attend a game at M&amp;T Stadium and were very pleased.  The hotel looks new, is in a great location, and was very reasonably priced.  The bed was great, the room was clean, and the bath products were Peter Thomas Roth (my fav). Housekeeping and the front desk were both very accommodating to our special requests.  The only negative was the hallways were at times quite noisy with what I'm assuming were over served guests.  And I do wish they did not allow dogs in this hotel.  We did hear a lot of yippy yapping through the walls.  Luckily, I can go back to sleep easily.  When we return, we would definitely stay here again.The good:Room was clean and reasonably spacious. Beds were comfortable. Not much else to say. Not bad, but with a few issues...The bad:Room was a little worn down. Outlets were coming off the wall. Tub was impossibly small. Not enough towels (even when we asked for me). I also think they deflated the pillows before we got there. Way too flat.The ugly:No. Toilet. Paper.We ran out of TP (a valuable resource) given there wasn't much in the room to start, and they did not restock it when asked (or even after cleaning the room). One can NOT survive modern society without TP. It's magical. I can deal with a lot of things, but a distinct lack of TP is not one of them.The service here is horrendous.  Upon check in the manager continuously tried to get me to give up my reservation and share a room with my colleague because they overbooked, I had to tell her ""no"" 4 times before she finally stopped asking, she was overly pushy. Then she checked me into a handicap room without asking me that had no closet, I had to go back down to get another room.   My toilet broke and they had to come two separate times because they did not check their work the first time.  Don't expect any service as I tried calling guest services and no one answered the phone on 3 occasions during my stay, lastly the maid decided to not clean my bathroom one of the days.   If you want a drink or are hungry expect to wait and get bad service, I was shocked to see the rudeness roll over to serving staff at the bar, the lady had a attitude, I was shocked. The only reason they get 2 stars is that the location is good.  Avoid this place if you can get a room at the Sheraton on the other side of the convention center.  Usually I have great experiences with he Hilton but this one needs a whole new staff.If this was a Marriott Courtyard or similar type hotel,it would get 5 stars. But it is a Hilton,and that is the major problem. When you stay at a Hilton you expect the extra mile. Mini bar, fridge,micro way,$8.00 bottle of water available, etc.This hotel was clean and spacious, service average, lobby and restaurant freezing for temperature. The restaurant was available in the building across the street. The restaurant food was very good, and there was an indoor crosswalk available, it still FELT inconvenient and unwelcoming for the hotel. The restaurant was called a tavern,but the hotel lacked that hotel bar availability. All and all a clean and spacious place,but not a warm and cozy place.Great location, however, the staff is horrible. In 2 short days I was approached by people demanding cash from me in the hotel and outside the hotel to a cook coming out changing our TV to NBA from baseball which we were watching? The staff of the hotel could care less if we were even there. Our company made the trip worth while with the always great effort they put in to it. I hope the Hilton Baltimore got a few tips on customer service!This is a very nice hotel. Parking, check-in, front desk service all very easy. Location is great for going to Orioles game. It is a very large, spacious building. Even with the O's in town, several conference functions, the lobby and hallways never felt crowded. Ballpark view is an amenity I will never tire of, so do take advantage, if you are a fan.Brief introduction... I'm an HHonors member and I try to stay at Hilton Hotels as often as I can, however, I've found that I usually favor the Garden Inn and DoubleTree lines as the flagship Hilton Hotels are usually outrageously priced and do not offer anything more than what the less-expensive Hilton lines do. That brings me to the Hilton Baltimore, room came at a discounted price, so no real complaints there, but when you factor in the cost for parking ($28 per night/$40 for valet), and the charge for Internet ($10-13 per day), the cost of your stay really starts to add up. I actually called and requested a code for the Internet as this was my first stay at this particular Hilton and I was denied the code (even for just a 24 hour period) and was told I could use the free WiFi available in the lobby. Never in my life have I been forced to pay for Internet at any hotel (including Hilton).  I ordered room service twice, first from their late night menu (food was quite good) and then again from their breakfast menu (I could have gone to IHOP and paid less for a better meal). If I'm going to pay a premium for ""good"" food delivered to my room, then that food better be worth the cost. Now, I cannot vouch for everything the hotel has to offer as I only stayed for one evening and did not take advantage of things like the gym, pool, etc., but I honestly cannot believe that anything this hotel has to offer other than its proximity to the downtown Baltimore area makes it anywhere near the cost. Pros:Updated, comfortable, quiet rooms. Shades pull tight and the room stays dark.Prompt, courteous service in all regards. Convenient to downtown and major highways. Cons:Outrageously expensive. Pay for parking. Pay for Internet. Food is not worth the price. More or less pay for anything extra.No microwave or mini-fridge. Needless to say, I will not be staying here again, and unless you really have money to burn, I'd suggest staying elsewhere.Hilton honors member who stays at hIlton properties frequently for business travel.  For a true Hilton Brand hotel, decidedly unimpressive.  Stayed for two nights, management was conspicuously absent, and 50% of the time when we called to get our car from valet or called concierge, phones were not answered.  The ""hotel"" restaurant is across the street from the hotel.  Otherwise, hotel was clean and modern.  We've received much better service at some of the Hilton brand's less expensive properties.I gave it one star because of its location and the fact that it's physically connected to the Baltimore Convention Center (so I didn't have to walk in the rain).However, if those are the best reasons to stay here... the Hyatt and Marriott also have the same great location and the Hyatt is also connected to the Baltimore Convention Center.To begin, they messed up my reservation. Somehow (which I'm still unsure of), they had me down to leave a day earlier than I reserved. ...which was only noted when I received a reminder email. When I called to get it fixed, they told me the hotel was completely booked and, basically, I was out of luck. After arguing for a LONG time and being transferred around, they FINALLY found a mysterious room to put me in. I have no idea how a hotel can go from no rooms whatsoever so they can't fix THEIR MISTAKE to finding one, but as I needed a place to stay the night, I didn't ask questions.So, I arrive. The rooms are the same quality as a standard lower-end chain. It's not bad, but it's DEFINITELY NOT worth the money. You also have to pay for the Internet by the day.One of my co-workers was staying in the Marriott, another in the Hyatt, and I STRONGLY urge you to try those places before trying this hotel. They're both within a block or two from the Hilton (and the Hyatt is right by the Inner Harbor). Not only that, but the lobbies are nicer (the Marriott has a self-serve bar wall), the gym hours are more convenient, the Internet is FREE, the rooms are significantly better quality, and the staff is waaaay better. Don't waste your time or money at the Baltimore Hilton.We stayed at this location for three days during the last big snowstorm during the World Series of Poker circuit event. We stay in lots of hotels all over the country and assumed that the Hilton would be a safe bet. We guessed so, so wrong. We were nickeled and dimed throughout our stay and left really disappointed that we didn't choose one of the other numerous hotels in the area.Parking:$40/day for valet.$28/day self in a lot that is partially public...meaning limited security at best. You have to buy a new ticket every 24 hours and they rip and wear down and stop working pretty quickly. Wi-Fi:NO FREE WIFI.Hilton advertised this as 'free in lobby' meaning free in the overpriced ""Lobby Bar,"" and non-functional on the days that I was there. I listened to several of my fellow guests struggle with access while waiting for my order. You can only get the password by requesting it from the bartender, and, I'm assuming, some medium social pressure to buy something.  Otherwise you can pay $13-15 in the rooms or use the computers in the pitiful 'business center' attached to the UPS store for $6/hr.Food Options: Expensive room service, mediocre food at the attached Diamond Tavern. Vending machines are $3 for 16 oz. sodas, and on the guest floors the vending machines only take credit cards. This location also boasts a Jimmy Johns and a Starbucks in the attached East Building, both with limited hours. There is also a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf in the lobby that we literally never saw open the entire length of our three-day stay. They close at 2PM.  No bottled water in the rooms, complimentary coffee/tea is cheap instant. No complimentary breakfast offerings like the sister chains and not even as much as free water in the lobby.The bar in the lobby closed early (1:30 AM) on Friday night, the night we decided to head back early and catch a nightcap...so we sat there hoping for the bartender to come back from a break for a good ten minutes. Several staff members were at the front desk chatting, but no one came over to serve us or tell us that the bar had closed up early. Other nights we were there, the bar was packed and open until 2AM, so we have no idea what happened.NO FRIDGES OR MICROWAVES included in the room rate. This seems crazy to me. You can allegedly request a fridge brought to your room, but this is an extra charge. No experience on whether this is a daily charge or a one-time charge, but based on everything else, I'm sure it's daily.Most importantly we stayed on the 15th floor and our ice machine was RIDDLED WITH BLACK MOLD. At first I thought I was seeing things, then I thought it may have been the provided ice bucket. Finally, when I got home I stated unpacking my travel cooler and found even blacker mold-all over everything that I'd poured the ice from the machine on. Seriously gross and a health hazard. Not impressed.Cleanliness: Room itself was very clean. NO bedbugs in mine (believe me, I checked).However, there were shopping bags of other people's trash in the parking deck, in the elevator lobby to the parking garages, in the rooms with the vending machines....I saw them everywhere and was pretty grossed out. Maybe they need to provide bigger trash cans for guests in public areas, but I saw the same leaky brown paper bag of garbage sitting in the corner every time I went in and out of the vending machine area for three days.Service: All of the individual employees I spoke with face to face were incredibly polite, cordial, and helpful. I'd like to give specific shout outs to the housekeeping ladies working on my floor on 3/8/2015...I ran out of my room looking for towels and they handed me over a big stack, no questions asked. The employees working the parking gate were great too-I had issues with my ticket repeatedly and they were very patient with me. Echoing the earlier reviews, I did have two unsatisfactory interactions with the Guest Services line that I dialed from within the room. On day one I noticed that we had a burned out bulb and requested a replacement.....which never came. For two more days. On Check-out day, I requested that a bellman come help us with our bags....only to never hear from them again after giving them my room number. Finally, when my boyfriend checked out he was not even offered a receipt for our stay. You know how at fast food chains they advertise ""If our cashier doesn't offer X, we'll give you an entree free?"" Yeah. When Taco Bell has more efficient customer service procedures in effect than a major hotel chain, you know you're in trouble.I have been on hold on and off for almost 30 minutes to try to verify a rate for reservations. I am looking to currently book a room for this impending snow storm since I am a nurse at University of Maryland.  I called the number on the website and was put on hold for 20 MINUTES to then be told I need to call the location for the exact rates and to see if I can get an extended check out time since I work night shift and its crazy to be told I need to check out at 3PM! So I called the direct number given to me and have been on  even make s reservation for 15 MINUTES!!!  I have yet to speak with anyone!  I am done with this hotel and I will be telling all my coworkers who are looking for a room to go else where!!!The hotel is in an excellent location. I didn't think to ask for a room facing the field. (I recommend it!) I stayed on the 14th floor, where the halls had a peculiar odor--I couldn't identify it. My room didn't smell very fresh either, but after a long walk down odor hall, I noticed it less. I noted the rooms are a little worn, but my bed was comfy and I'll always favor the PTR soaps. The gentleman at the front desk was concerned about anything I had to say in regards to my room or my stay. I don't think it's worth as much as they charge, but I guess they base it on location. For a HILTON tho, I would think they'd upgrade some of their amenities.Overall, had a pretty nice stay for two nights during an Orioles' home stand and two large meetings occurring at the hotel, as well as a religious convention at the convention center. The hotel is large enough so you don't feel crowded. The value of the stay itself is not worth the price but you are paying for convenience, location and view above all.For previous reviews: stairs are not locked. My kids and I used the end stairs several times (they thought it would be fun to go from floor 4 to 14. Ha). The elevators may get crowded but there was never a wait for a second car. Cons: not too many. We had a stadium view room so it was pricier, and the room lacked a refrigerator. The TV was HD on only the local channels. Some outlets were very loose and there were very few to plug in devices. Wireless internet will cost a premium rate. The patio overlooking the stadium is very small but it wasn't too crowded. The patio also closes at 10pm every night and they are strict about this (games both nights went past 10). Pool is nice but it's a lap pool (narrow and shallow) but my kids didn't seem to mind at all. Room service forgot some items. Parking is premium and the rates ($28 self, $40 Valet) is per night, not per stay nor in/out. The load/unload area is very small for the hotel's large footprint so be ready to wait as someone likes to stop in the middle of the driveway to unload (why they don't just put this zone on Eutaw St??) Lobby bar service, especially after games, is non existent. Check in at 4pm is serious, if you arrive before you may not have a room ready. If you are in the ""south wing"" facing west, use the curtains as the ballpark view side can look directly into your rooms. Pros: For all the people and the street noise (Hi Pickles and Sliders!), rooms are insanely quiet and the black out curtains work very well. Staff were all kind and eager to help. Fitness center is large, great view of the ballpark and no wait to use machines. Lobby is very large and has lots of seats/sofas to stretch out on. Card access to patio, pool and fitness center keeps out the non-guests. Beds are very comfy. Lobby, rooms, and auxiliary areas are very clean. Bell staff always available. Location, location, location. Can't beat the views and access to downtown spots. Front desk always staffed at right times so wait times are minimal. There is a fee for late checkout but they give a grace period.Walking Distance to Ball Park &amp; Inner Harbor Restaurants and Sights.  Very nice hotel, Good Staff, Very nice Concierge Lounge that offers Breakfast, Lunch, and (Snacks &amp; Drinks 24/7). Not a Fancy, but a Clean Room with Nice Views.  Would Stay here again.  I strongly suggest the Concierge Upgrade if available.  I also suggest walking a couple blocks to M &amp; S grill for their Happy Hour Specials.Enjoy, Chef Gary CurryWhen you're somebody's mistress, you expect to be treated like a queen.  At least that's what I've seen on t.v. and read in chick-lit books.  As I am not officially someone's mistress,  a friend was kind enough to put me up here  to hang out while he was doing some learning.  Like some have said, the view of Camden is great, and the lobby is beautiful.The Diamond Tavern patio on a Friday afternoon is not too shabby, particularly when you knock over your drink and they give you a complimentary new one.  Granted, later than night when you're drunk off your ass, that doesn't seem so great.What's not great is when you're hungover and HOUSEKEEPING comes banging on your door at 9 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  Who. The. Feck. Does. That.In reality, of the Baltimore hotels I've stayed at in the past two months, this wasn't too bad.  But really, wait until checkout time before you come a'knockin, because I may be a'barfin.For me, the Hilton Baltimore will forever represent overly expensive, inattentive housekeeping and awful customer service. Choose another hotel. A) Their housekeeping staff is inattentive. Morning one, I discover no hair dryer in my room. Day two, the made up my room and failed to leave towels. Day three, failed to refresh the stash of in-room coffee. B) The hotel staff didn't care that housekeeping made so many mistakes!  When I spoke to front desk staff about my issues, there was no apology, no ""oh my gosh, I can't believe that. How can I make it right?"" In fact, on the morning I was coffeeless, they wouldn't even give me a free cup of joe. C) My room was $289/night. For those prices, I expect stellar and I received mediocre.  If you're in Baltimore for a convention, find yourself a different hotel.Don't be fooled this place is ghetto. Upon arrival it looks swank and hip but it is GHETTO.The lobby area is very nice and the check-in staff are really nice. The folks at the bell desk are also great as well. If you're an Orioles fan, this Hilton also has an enviable location right next to the ball park.(Otherwise there's not much around to do at night. But you can cab it up to Mount Vernon which is not too far away if you're looking for a bar or two)  If you're on the right side of the hotel and are on a higher floor you can watch the game from your room. The Hilton Hhonors Gold lounge also serves good cookies and coffee. These are the nice things about the hotel.Here are the not so nice things:-key cards for rooms do not work well. You have to insert key, leave it in for   about a second then slowly pull out. If you do it too fast you can't get into your  room.-no 24 Hour room service....they stop at 11:00pm-WTF??????-When we did order room service it took two hours....FOR WINGS!!! I will note  that there was a convention so there were probably a lot of room service orders  but that's what planning ahead is for.-I am supposed to have free wi-fi but I couldn't get a decent signal all weekend  and  their home page had trouble identifying me.-It was bad enough that I did not have my Double-A to iron my shirt for me,  forcing me to do it myself. The iron leaked water out of the holes on the  bottom so that instead of  pressing my shirt, my shirt was soaked.-I paid $11 for a Stoli and soda but they were out of limes so I had to have lime  juice in my $11 cocktail. If that doesn't go into Webster's dictionary as an  example of the word ""Ghetto"" I don't know what does.Very disappointing experience. If you HAVE to stay here because of a convention (or a baseball game) come expecting to be underwhelmed.","What is wrong with this hotel? I came here to stay for one night for Otakon 2014. One night for 4 adults costed $250 - with no free breakfast and no free wifi. We came here early to check in and they charged us $25 extra! My friends and I wanted everyones names on the receipt (so we could get reimbursement from Otakon for volunteering), so we paid an extra $20. It seems like this hotel charges for everything. However, we later realized that after we paid the $20, the hotel didn't even put our names on the receipt! We asked them to print out a receipt with all our names - especially since we PAID for it - but they refused.In our hotel room, we called housekeeping and asked for extra towels and shampoo since the room did not have enough for all four of us, but they did not bring any up. Room did not have a fridge or a microwave. The tap water tasted horrible, even after we boiled it. Bed sheets felt slick and disgusting. Would NEVER stay here again, especially since we were charged almost $300 for one night. We changed hotels for Baltimore Harbor Hotel, which costed $300 for two nights with free breakfast, free wifi, great housekeeping, and friendly service. Don't come to Hilton guys, ever.I was there for a week for a conference a couple of weeks ago (July 2013).  My 13-year-old son accompanied me.PROS* GREAT location across the street from Camden Yards if you're an Orioles fan (I am). The gym looks out right into the field, so on the night I didn't attend a game, I was able to watch it while working out and sitting on the terrace.* Very close to the Inner Harbor, the Aquarium, and other sites.* Nice room, comfortable beds.* Had room service one morning, and it was excellent. I requested a 7:30-8:00am time frame, and there was a knock on the door at exactly 7:30! Food was hot and delicious.* The Sunday brunch staff at the Diamond Tavern was awesome! MIDDLE OF THE ROAD* Front desk staff and concierge were polite and helpful, but just answered my questions. Didn't offer any additional info or assistance above and beyond what I was asking.  (Example: To concierge, ""Do you have a weekend schedule for the MARC trains?"" Answer: ""The MARC trains don't run on weekends.""  End of conversation. Had to keep asking questions regarding options to get to DC on the weekends.)* I asked front desk for a room on a higher floor, and we were put on the 4th floor.* Clock in room was two and a half hours off, and in-room safe didn't work.CONS* No mini fridge in room.* Several homeless people right outside the hotel leaning against the walls. I have no problem helping someone, getting them some food, etc., but many of these people were very aggressive (high/drunk). One three occasions, I was walking past someone and they called out to me. I continued to walk and they started screaming at me, demanding that I ""get back here.""  It was starting to scare my son. One of these times, about a block from the hotel, two people were walking towards us, one of them pushing a shopping cart. As they passed us, the one with the shopping cart quickly pushed it toward us, like he was ""joking"" and about to slam it into us.* My beefs were mostly with housekeeping. One time, I had to retrieve something from my room for a meeting that was about to begin. The housekeeping cart was right in front of my door, blocking it. Also, the door was closed. You ALWAYS clean rooms with the door wide open, and never lock yourself inside. I had to push the cart away and open the door.  At that point, the housekeeper got annoyed that I was entering the room (just what was she doing??) and said she was cleaning it now. I apologized, but said I needed something important.* Another time, I came back and found that the housekeeper just basically made the beds and changed the towels.  Did not restock any of the shampoos, lotion, or coffee packets and cups. Also left a plate of dirty dishes with crumbs all over the table.  I called downstairs and explained the situation.  I had to get to a meeting, but when I got back, whoever came just brought a bunch of shampoos and lotion and tossed them on the bathroom counter (instead of placing them on the tray). Didn't restock the coffee and still left the dirty dishes.* Yet another day, the housekeeper didn't even START cleaning the room until 5:30PM!  I've never had a room cleaned that late. I understand that maybe they were short-staffed that day or something, but both my son and I had to shower and change for an evening event. We both also needed to use the bathroom to answer an urgent call.  The housekeeper just replied, ""I'll be done in about 15 minutes or so."" We had to use the bathroom in the men's locker room at the gym, and then stand there and wait so we could shower and change to go out. (It was longer than 15 minutes.)Summary:  This shook my faith in Hilton hospitality.I have a lot of experience at Hilton Hotels as traveling consultant, have stayed in many of their hotels in many countries.  Loved them all.  Then this experience shook my faith in Hilton hospitality.  I was looking at the site as a potential wedding base:  big block of rooms, bridal suite, and brunch for 120 guests - aka BIG money, and was treated poorly by the Director of Catering (no confirmation of visit, 30+ minute wait, constant checking of her blackberry during appointment, no follow-up on questions asked).  I  DO NOT RECOMMEND this spot for anyone planning a large event.Whole Story (likely only to interest brides and other event planners):My fiancee and I were considering using the Hilton Baltimore, Inner Harbor as our wedding party hotel block, bridal suite (overlooking Camden Yards), and brunch location.  We had tried to make an appointment to view the suite and brunch venues and were directed by Sales Manager to make an appointment with the Director of Catering, Manager on Duty, let's call her M.M did not respond to our requests for an appointment via email the few days prior to our planned visit to Baltimore and as we were in the area visiting other wedding vendors, we dropped in at the Hilton anyways and spoke to concierge.  They informed us that M had been notified we were there and would be down shortly.  We waited over 30 minutes - during which time the concierge disappeared and we had no updates.  When a different person came to the un-manned concierge desk, we explained our situation and he called M who was down in 5 minutes.M claimed not to have been notified of our arrival and did not recall being asked to have an appointment prior to our visit.  Nor did she stop checking her Blackberry the entire 15 minutes we spent with her.  She did not provide us with any pricing or catering details (we asked to see sample brunch options) nor did she offer to follow up with us on our questions.  It has been 4 days since our visit and I don't think we will hear from her.  Needless to say, this is not thesort of treatment I would expect from someone in hospitality, particularly when the customer is a HHonors Gold member looking to spend a few thousand dollars.All my experiences at Hiltons around the world have been top notch and this really disappoints.Five hour wait to get roomHospitality is non existent. Go anywhere elseThis place was simple amazing...But for some strange reason they do not have water after several request we went to buy it from another store.Competative rate, excellent location, fanastic front desk staff and always a warm welcome from the bell hop. I have stayed at the Holiday Inn and Marriott at Camden Yard and this Hilton tops them all without a shadow of a doubt. Certainly not the most outstanding Hilton I have stayed at but definately far from the worst. The Camden Yard area has a lot of traffic so the rooms are a little run-down (scratches on the walls, outlets not working, etc) but certainly not something they can't overcome easily at Hilton. Room service and maid service is on point....I will be back for sure.I stayed at this hotel during the weekend of Otakon 2014.  From check-in to check-out, I experienced nothing but helpful and courteous assistance from staff.  Whether it be ensuring I got internet service in my room, or bringing up extra toilet, paper, my needs were addressed in a timely and friendly manner.  The only real downside to the location is the cost of parking on-site, which the Hilton has no control over (garage owned by the city).  Even on move-out Sunday, where EVERYONE is trying to escape the grasp of the long elevator waits, the Hilton staff came to the rescue.  Knowing that upper floor dwellers were getting the stiff end because of people riding up to go down, one of the cleaning staff ensured we got down much more quickly via the staff elevators.  My time at the hotel has made the Hilton #1 on my preferred lodging franchises.I stayed here for 3 nights and paid $140 a night during a recent conference held in the hotel. As such, my cost-to-value ratio should be taken into account considering how much more some other reviews paid for their stay, and how much higher expectations would be at those rates.The lobby is modern and airy, and the conference spaces/ballrooms are as well. The hotel in general seems to have been built fairly recently. The front desk was quick and the bell station was kind enough to loan me an umbrella on rainy days while I was there. The concierge was polite but both times I asked for food recommendations they quickly pointed me to the Diamond Tavern- the hotel restaurant. The area around the hotel seems tourist friendly- several restaurants and bars within a few blocks from the conference center.My double queen bed room was clean and modern, with a large window, a desk and a good size flat screen tv. The dresser drawers kept popping open though, and I almost tripped over it one night. The bathroom was also clean and modern, which was important to me. The walls seemed sufficiently thick too. I avoided the housekeeping drama mentioned by other reviewers by leaving the do-not-disturb sign on the door until I left the room.Overall I had a pleasant stay, and it was a convenient walk to the inner harbor area after the conference. My biggest complaint about the hotel though is not necessarily their fault- it was the lack of breakfast places close by. Lunch and dinner places abound, but not so much breakfast. There is a Starbucks about 4 blocks away but that was about it, unless you're willing to spend $15-20 for an just an average breakfast at the Diamond Tavern.My parents and I stayed here for 1 night and it's a very nice hotel!  We stayed on the Executive floor so they provided a complimentary breakfast (fruit, pastries, toast, hard boiled eggs, coffee, etc) and also had a happy hour (cheese and crackers, fruit, nuts &amp; snack mixes, etc) but you had to pay for the drinks :(They also have a very nice gym and a lap pool!  But me and my parents went for a run in the morning along the Inner Harbor, which is just down the street from the hotel!  It's about a 10 minute walk to hit the heart of the harbor.I appreciated that although the rooms did not come with refrigerators (and they said that there was a fee to get one in your room), they did offer to store my allergy vials for free in their fridge downstairs.I stayed at this hotel for a convention in August 2013. With convention block pricing, the nightly rates are pretty acceptable. The hotel is very clean, and a nice social center during downtime at conventions, and the covered walkway to the Baltimore Convention Center was very convenient. As far as cleanliness goes, the hotel was pretty clean, leaving me with no complaint. It looks very modern, well kept, and the rooms and public areas had an overall pleasing appearance. However, the hotel's size also was a disadvantage. They only have six elevators that run the entire span of the hotel, which lead to huge crowds of people and long wait times in order to get on an elevator. This was compounded by the fact that they normally keep their staircases locked except in emergencies, so the only options to get to your room is either wait for an elevator, or wait for someone to unlock the stairs.What got me though was that the hotel lacks a few basic amenities that you would normally expect in a hotel - there was no mini-fridge or microwave in the rooms, and the WiFi was kinda expensive, especially since the rate was per device, per day. Because of these, I'm planning on staying at a different hotel next year instead.Not set up to handle the amount of guests it accommodates. Nice staff, but overworked. New facility without effective technology - slowest elevators ever. Avoid this hotel - there are better in Baltimore.Nice looking Hilton but inconsistent on several levels.Pros: 1.  Beautiful lobby - Spacious and glass enclosed2.  Lobby bar - Friendly bartenders and attentive service3.  Diamond restaurant - Great lunch entree in the crab cake salad with roasted fennel  I could eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  But pretty pricey even by hotel standards.  The breakfast buffet is good but overpriced at $18.  The omelet bar was a nice touch and service was impeccable for breakfast and lunch; the staff is super friendly too.4.  Pet friendly - for a $50 plus tax fee.  But because I did have my dog in the hotel, the staff didn't clean the room and I had to hunt down towels and toiletries.5.  Some of my coworkers had views of the Oriole Stadium.  In fact, location is probably one of the best features of this Hilton, especially if you are a baseball fan.  Lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance.Cons:1.  Diamond bar service is pretty bad at prime happy hour.  Coworker kept trying to get a drink at the bar and was kept waiting forever.  A server was supposed to be sent to us at the outside table but no one ever came.2.  They charge for wi-fi. 3.  Minor wear and tear issues:  Towels were a little worn with little holes and some stains.  Room had damp smell because carpet was recently shampooed and still quite damp.4.  No mini fridge.Overall, a nice hotel that needs a few improvements.  Depending on the room rate, I would come back for a visit.It's a pretty swanky looking place but my stay here came with a few minor inconveniences. 1.Ya gotta pay for wifi. Don't stay here if you're going to need frequent access to the good ol' interwebs and you hate the thought of shelling out 14 bucks a day for it. 2. THERE IS NO MINIFRIDGE! This was a sad, sad realization for me. I stayed here for 4 days and I couldn't keep any of my leftovers, so I had to eat every bit of what I ordered out because I didn't want to waste it. I blame the Hilton for the 15 pounds I likely gained as a result. What was even more torturous.. was that there was a perfect little nook for which a mini fridge could be housed; I would look at it and think ""My leftovers would look wonderful inside of a minifridge placed right there in that corner.""3. Their staff is painfully clueless... about everything. It's like they went to the middle of nowhere Utah, picked up a bunch of people, dressed them in hotel staff garb and dropped them off at the Baltimore Hilton. If you want to know something about anything Baltimore or hotel related... ask anyone else. If someone told me I had to stay here again I wouldn't be too upset about it. It was a clean place and I'm not that fussy but I would probably attempt to bring my own freakin' minifridge.I stayed at the Hilton Baltimore for a conference in March 2012.  The staff was very friendly and the lobby/hotel had a funky modern decor.  The conference took place in the event rooms that were connected to the hotel, so staying there was very convenient.As other reviewers mentioned, the parking was a bit much ($28 a night).  I think they should comp at least one night for guests.  Our room was on the 11th floor in the corner.  The room was very small, but the bed was pretty comfortable.Horribly rude staff at front desk, operator, and housekeeping. I was in town for a meeting and the convention staff were great. Sheets were dirty and had hair that was not mine on it. Did not clean the room well, items left behind from another guest Rude whenever I would call down for anything. Rooms are in need of an upgrade and remodel. I asked where the gym was at check in and I got a 'last time I checked it was on the 4th fl' WHAT?!?! Rude!!!I stayed here on business last week and it was a nice hotel. Centrally located, clean, new, and seemingly well run. My only complaint, aside from the poor lighting in the bathrooms in the guesi rooms, came on the morning of my departure... I was walking down the hall from my room to the elevator with my suitcase and the housekeeper popped out of a room and asked me which room I had just left, which I found to be slightly unprofessional.Let me be clear--the 2 stars is relative to cost, expectations, and the Hilton brand. The hotel is huge, clean, and beautiful. If I had paid, say, $200 a night, I would give it 5 stars. Easily. The problem is I paid around $500 a night for a hotel directly overlooking Camden Yards in Baltimore's most tourist-friendly area. That's not a cheap room (although it's not a penthouse suite rate, either), and Baltimore is definitely not New York City.First off, the Internet was down for two days of my stay. Okay, so I'll read a book instead of browsing the Internet. That's just an inconvenience, albeit a quite large one nowadays. But it made doing any work completely impossible. They did offer the alternatives of sitting either in their noisy front lobby or in their cramped mailroom, both of which had working Internet. Not their fault, of course, but quite a damper on what I was hoping to be a simplified, relaxed work environment.Second, the rooms were small with very little in them. No mini-fridge, mini-bar, or microwave, and there was a dirty, difficult, unsynchronized alarm clock with awful speakers for your iPod. The shower had a curtain that was too high and only a thin rail that separated it from the rest of the bathroom. Every shower ended with water spilling everywhere. If I were paying a more modest rate, these are trivial problems not even worth mentioning. But given the cost, these were frustrating.Lastly, the maids knocked incessantly if I accidentally forgot to put up the 'Do Not Disturb' door hanger. It started around 9:00 and involved two mornings where maids walked in while I was wearing less than I would have hoped. (Even my cries of 'I'm here!' and 'Don't come in!' were to no avail.)I thought I was splurging to have a comfortable, stress-free stay at a hotel that takes pride in their hospitality. Instead, I felt like a guest at a quaint 2- or 3-star hotel who was practically being robbed blind.I only stayed here one night. Overall experience was good. The front desk people were pleasant. The bar service was a little slow.  It's in walking distance to a lot of things and about 30 minutes from the BWI airport. If you are planning to park a car at valet it's $40 per night. You have to pay separate from your hotel bill unless you prearrange it before hand. At least that's what the valet guy said!I belabored in my decision about how many stars.  They would totally get 4 if they had honored the preferences I shared when I booked, but the customer service they provided prevented them from getting two. THE BAD: When I booked the room, I requested a king bed with a view of Camden Yards and was told that one was available and that we'd get one.  A king bed is a simple pleasure that really makes us feel like we're on vacation.  All that space is a luxury.  When I checked in, the receptionist said she was sorry, but there were no king beds available.  The only ballpark-view rooms available were ones with two double beds.  No way jose!  I'm not downgrading from our queen at home while on vacation.  I expressed my sadness and said that a king bed was really important to us.  Nothing could be done, but we got loaded up with perks:  a voucher for 4 alcoholic drinks at their bar, a voucher for two breakfast meals at their restaurant, and an upgrade to the VIP lounge.  Despite my disappointment at the bed situation, I appreciated the receptionist's sympathetic nature and the manner in which she tried to compensate us for our disappointment and inconvenience.  We ended up pushing the beds together and it wasn't entirely terrible. THE GOOD: We had a view of Camden Yards, an absolute must for my O's-loving husband's birthday weekend.  We spent a weekend in B-more for his 26th, and a view of the ballpark was one of the best parts.  We were on the 18th floor... it was awesome!  The room was clean, with updated decor.  The beds were super comfortable.  Heavenly comforter and pillows.  The housekeeper was timely and efficient. Overall, I would try this place again.  The stay was enjoyable for both me and my husband.  If my preferences would be disregarded a second time, then I'd boycott.As the biggest hotel in Baltimore, it's impressive. However, don't let the size and modernized ways fool you. They have MAJOR issues.I stayed for a client's week long conference, and had presidential floor access...Cons:1. They never clean up. Order room service and watch the plates in your room and hallway pile up. I've had a plate of dried lasagna sit in front of my door for 3 days. Housekeeping doesn't take it with them (I guess it isn't their job) and room service never comes back to pick up the plates. EVERY floor you walk on will have the smell of food in the hallways. Guaranteed. Even after several calls and complaints, having presidential status didn't matter much.2.Roof leaks. Randomly at 4am, I thought I was dreaming that my toilet was overflowing, but the light bulb in the shower was pouring out water! I called down to let them know and no one ever came. EVER. However, I guess they went upstairs to check the room above me. To this day, I don't know if it was a problem in my room or upstairs.3.Elevator has one set of buttons, on the farthest side at that. Not saying you need to have more, but it saves a walk, seeing as though the hotel is already oddly shaped with extremely long hallways.4. Location - Because it's beside the stadiums, and a main street right off the interstate, traffic can be horrible and the parking prices are insane.Pros:1. Room had coffee and tea! I left a note for housekeeping to stock me up extra time and they kept at it the entire week. Happy to have had them.2. Housekeeping is on point, they work very hard, almost all day long I see them (it's a huge hotel!) and they are always friendly.3.There was construction done on the hotel for a day, and the next day we received a apology note with a candy bar shaped like a hammer :) It's the little things...4. Food - there's multiple places to eat, happy hour, and the food isn't bad at all.5. View - I could see the oriole stadium from my window6. Location - see #5, it's right next door to each other, a few blocks away from the harbor and cabs run right by the front door. You can't ask for a better location of downtown baltimore.Overall, I enjoyed my stay, and definitly miss the bed. Now THAT is what I wish I could've taken with me...","No shortage of great views at Hilton - gym, concierge lounge, room - everywhere I went, I had a great view of Camden. Location and views are impressive. Here's the rundown on the rest from a business stay point of view:Internet - good effort, but a FAIL: Two options for internet 1536K down or 768K - chose 1536, but only got .67Mb/s down on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fspeedtest.net&amp;s=c6718e4f8089518da216feddf01cbc9f87645f54738df80157a78e6d0185ae6b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net</a> <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speedtest.net%2Fresult%2F961396228.png&amp;s=4323508a1aeb8bb3b8badbc3b9127d5f83f87c7d8ae45d7a3ca19303c31bd2ff"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net/result/961...</a> for wireless - wired was slightly better, but not much - .97Mb/s down <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.speedtest.net%2Fresult%2F961888012.png&amp;s=d581310f85ac49afee38f8041f9a0169e9940c1d97e20eed224c72cb94c254dc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net/result/961...</a>Room - comfortable, clean - what you'd expect at a Hilton.Concierge lounge pretty good, but nothing exceptional.Gym - very solid Hilton gym - probably one of the best Hotel gym options in Baltimore. Pool is not your average BS pool for the kids - if you're a swimmer you'll appreciate it - there's a sauna to boot.Pros- Beautiful hotel with a great view of Camden Stadium- Very nice facilities for conferencesCons (Staff)- Fast-Food-like staff- Anything off the menu/script like resolving an incorrect charge lead to ""deer in headlight"" stares- Have little to no authority to resolve anything- Staff could easily be replaced by a kiosk- To their credit, they were courteous but not really empowered to provide above and beyond serviceWith its nice modern and well appointed rooms to its view of Camden Yards, where you can watch the Orioles play for free on the 4th floor terrace next to the gym, this is a great place to stay and get a real nice taste of  Baltimore. The location is really good, next to the light rail ( easy access the airport); proximity to the convention center; the aforementioned closeness to Camden Yards;  and a free Charm Bus stop located right outside of the hotel (allowing you easy access to the tourist areas), there is no need  for a car and pay the $35 a day it will cost you to park a car here.  Gym, although as mentioned in another review, the gym's hours are only from 6 am to 10 pm.  However, it  is well equipped with nice Precor machines, free weights and is roomy enough for stretching, yoga etc.  Concierge level for Gold+ HHonors members allows you access to unlimited access to non-alcoholic drinks and snacks, as well as continental breakfast in the morning and light appetizers in the evening.Got to stay here for a convention.  Nicest hotel I've stayed in this year.  Everything is so new and so fresh and clean!  The rooms are modern enough to be fresh, but still warm in a traditional way.The fitness center is top of the line.  Each treadmill and elliptical and bike has it's own tv.  They've also got weights and weight machines, and a good-sized pool.The best part is the view of Camden Yards!  Any of the odd numbered rooms have an awesome view of the ball field.  And if you end up in an even numbered room, you still have a great view of the park from the end of the hallway and the fitness center.  As is typical of these hotels, relatively nothing is included - you have to pay for the internet, the breakfast, and the business center.  But if you're there for business and it's not your bill, it's a great set up.Big city Hiltons generally don't disappoint, and this one is no exception. I stayed three nights, non-consecutive, and have no complaints. Yeah, the parking is too expensive (as are all downtown hotels), and room service was too expensive (ditto), so is the wifi (ditto) but if you're looking for cheap you don't stay at a Hilton...The room service itself was very good.  The wifi was fast. The staff was friendly, the room was comfortable and reasonably quiet. The lobby is quite big and inviting, rare for a downtown hotel. The location is fantastic if you're doing something at the Convention Center or Camden Yards, and very good if you're headed to the inner Harbor.Why only four stars, instead of five? Because the damn building blocks the view of the Baltimore skyline from Camden Yards! That view was one of the reasons they built the stadium there, and left centerfield open. For that, I can never forgive the Hiltons...The staff is very friendly and the location is great, outside of that, I found this Hilton product incredibly overpriced for what you get.  The room was worn and had an odd (and unpleasant) smell.  The tub filled with water while we were showering and took 30+ minutes to drain.  The sink drained slowly, too.  The room corridors were freezing, yet we couldn't get the room itself to cool enough to be comfortable.  We won't be returning unless we find a deal that provides a substantial savings on the rooms, because what we experienced certainly wasn't worth $300+ a night.I recently stayed at this property for business and experienced superior levels of service from Jason in food and Beverage and Josh Porter in sales! What an unforgettable experience from check in, to check out. This has quickly become my number one place to stay while in Baltimore.I travel at least 2-3 days month. I have stayed at Hilton hotels (and every other chain) many times all over the world, and this was by far the absolute worst experience I have ever had. I am an HHonors member (I even have the credit card) and am now thinking about canceling my membership and credit card.When we pulled into the self-park garage to park upon our arrival (we are from DC), we accidently got confused and parked in a ""Hilton Reserved"" spot thinking it was reserved for guests. Turns out it is reserved for valet, which isn't mentioned anywhere. We load up our bags, our dog (this is a dog friendly hotel) and start shuffling towards the entrance. Then we hear someone yelling at us from a parked car. They are yelling at us about how we are in a valet spot. Of course we appreciated someone telling us, but they were incredibly rude towards us and didn't even both to get out of the car to come give us a heads up, instead just shouted meanly at us. So low class! We were clearly paying guests and they treated us like trash. We asked her name, and turns out her name is ""Kia"" and she works at the concierge. Worst personality EVER! We would have of course moved the car right away, but she could have nicely given us a heads up without heckling us as we have our hands full with bags, etc. My fiance was LIVID, but we put it behind us, move the car to a new spot, and went to check in.Upon check in, I'm told our room isn't ready. It is just a few minutes before 4pm by this point. We are asked if it is OK for us to wait while it is cleaned, which we reluctantly say is fine. I wouldn't normally care, but we're in the middle of a busy lobby with our dog... not ideal for us or other hotel guests. We also have a 5pm dinner reservation for my fiance's birthday. About 20 minutes go by and we are called back in for a room that is now open. Oops, turns out someone else in the time that the lady came to get us in the waiting area to when she swipes my card has taken our room. Would we mind taking a Harbor View instead of a ballpark view? I say no, only because it is my fiance's birthday and we have tickets to the O's game at 7pm, and we're making a whole baseball theme of the weekend (why we specifically booked at this Hilton). We are asked to wait for another room to be ""rush"" cleaned. Another 30 minutes go by, and finally we're checked in to a Ballpark View room. They offer us two breakfast vouchers, and a couple free drink tickets. My biggest complaint -- a manager never once came over to apologize to us, ask if we'd like a drink, or offer a cart to help us with our bags. Totally useless management as far as I'm concerned... I saw them at the desk approving our vouchers and looking our way but nobody ever came over to say a word to us. That's a first. Not a big deal that there were mistakes and our room wasn't ready, but come on, just have a manager come over and at least pretend this hotel cares about its guests. Nada.An hour later, we're finally heading up to the top floor to check into our room. At this point, we had missed our 5pm reservation at a nearby seafood restaurant, and we were both hungry and ready to leave our stuff and head over to the stadium to find something to eat. We arrive on the 20th floor, and start walking towards our room. There are a handful of dirty trays outside of quite a few rooms, I'm guessing because room service is cleaning and leaving them there. It was gross to see people's half eaten food in the hallway... ick.The positive -- the room was nice. Clean and had a nice view. It was everything I had expected. We get back from the game that night and have a chilled bottle of white wine and cheese platter waiting for us. This is really nice, but since there was no note or anything, we were a bit confused. None the less, we appreciated what we figured was a nice gesture from the management for our troubles (it was also my fiance's birthday which we mentioned on the reservation, so that might have been it). Cherry on top -- I later learned that my mother called the hotel from overseas and ordered surprise a bottle of champagne and a birthday note for my fiance, and neither were ever delivered to our room (or mentioned once). Her credit card hasn't been charged yet, so hopefully we won't have to deal with yet another fiasco with this hotel.All and all, we had a pretty crappy stay at this hotel. I read the reviews before staying here, and while I noticed other themes from reviews, I am usually a big fan of Hilton and decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Big mistake on my part!If you need the bare bones, stay here. If you want a fun, relaxing weekend with great customer service, run away. We stayed at the Four Seasons in Harbor East last December, and were treated fabulously and didn't have any issues at all.Two thumbs down from a once loyal Hilton guest. :(I stayed here during Otakon 2009 (which seems silly since I live in Baltimore), and while the convention sucked (let's be honest, sometimes Otakon can suck), this hotel did not. The room was very comfortable, especially since it was just my boyfriend and I. The bed, oh my god, the bed was so comfortable, and the bathroom was beautiful!The view from the room was also really nice. The staff at the hotel was surprisingly friendly to us. I've been too enough cons and checked in at enough hotels to know the staff usually gives con goers attitude. Maybe because he saw that both my boyfriend and I were from Baltimore? Or maybe because I had a scowl on my face, I don't know. But the staff was friendly.If I had a reason to stay there again, I would.The hotel itself is beautiful...great open lobby, perfect Inner Harbor location, lovely rooms. But the service has been questionable and I can't believe internet in the room is $13 a day! And to park in the garage is $26 a day. Took four hours for my father in law to get more pillows last night. I guess the Hilton family isn't taking care of B'More very well. Still enjoying a great weekend for a fantastic event though!Can't really complain.  For $100 on Hotwire, it's a good deal.  So close to Camden Yards that if you had a good arm, you could sub in as pitcher.  We are HHonors Gold Status which afforded us a very meager continental breakfast in the concierge level lounge which was staffed by folks who could have literally cared less about the whole affair.  However, for $100 I was totally satisfied by our experience.I stayed here for only one night. I love the hotel. The lobby is modern and lovely. The staff I talked to was very friendly. The room is spacious and clean with a nice view. The bed is comfortable. The most important of all is the location! I can walk to harbour and had a quick exploration of the downtown during the short stay. I will definitely recommend it!Location, location, location.  Hotel could use some updates but the location could not be beat.  We could see the stadium from our room and walk to it almost as quickly.  Easy to get to the harbor or the convention center.Now that it's been open for a year and has the initial running bugs worked out, it's a great place.Staff in the front of the house were friendly, although one was less helpful when I tried to get them to contact someone in the sales department (I work for Otakon and there was an issue I needed to discuss).Found out they reserved our room as a double when we asked for king, they switched it without issue. The elevators run well, even with the loads of people from Otakon there. The meeting space is well kept and professional looking. The public bathrooms were clean all the time as well.The hotel rooms themselves are of the brand standard. My remote was on the fritz but I never had time to call, so it really didn't matter. The room was well cleaned daily, with the sheets changed per my request.Great hotel, convenient to the convention center, and overall a very pleasant place to stay.High Points: Bell Hops are awesome!  Very modern looking Hotel from the inside, great views of Baltimore.Low points: Messed up our reservation, the restaurant associated with them screwed up 2 meals, non existent customer service, unable to get anything right.My wife and I got married at Camden Yards... so it made sense to stay at the Hilton right across the street (right?).... never again.  I'm done with Hilton.We are very low maintenance, we didn't ask for anything special, no arrangements, nada.  We first thought the Hilton hooked us up!  We were staying in a suite looking over the ballpark with a balcony.  We had 2 bedrooms and a parlor (enough room for my wife and her party to get ready).  We were thrilled!!!!  The Hilton also asked for a photo of us so they would know who we were when we got there. OK! Thanks for making us feel like celebrities!But then we showed up..... They had no clue who we were, our rooms weren't ready at 2pm (which they said would not be a problem the day before and that morning), they gave my wife a hard time at check in saying I had to be there.  It gets worse.... our suite wasn't as advertised.  Turns out the parlor is considered a 2nd bedroom (hint... no bed...), that was a new one to me.  When my wife called to correct the problem the front desk manager did take $100 a night off for the trouble.  We supposedly got the mid level suite... I'd hate to see the entry level suite. Our room was not dusted, had a leaky sink in the parlor room and no frig anywhere in the suite.All in all our stay at the Hilton was lacking.  We don't expect special treatment, but when you tell us ""you're special"" and then don't deliver.... bad on you.Also throughout the weekend the front desk was not staffed very well - long lines of customers and only 1 person at the front.  They were not very friendly and kinda cold.... Never Again.Oh! If you've never stayed in downtown Baltimore before... after city and state tax - add $100 a night in taxes (ouch!).$169/night. Newly built hotel. It's central to Camden Yards and walkable to Inner Harbor. It is very close to University of Maryland (about 3 blocks).See photos.Stayed here for a recent company event.  The location is spectacular, especially if you are heading to an Orioles game.  The stadium is literally across the street, and may of the suites have an uninhibited view of the playing field, which is great for hosting events.3.5 StarsI stayed here for a business trip and if I was as big of a baseball fan as some, I imagine I'd be pretty stoked about its location. Though it did have easy access to the harbor and the touristy spots including the aquarium. The staff were generally helpful; especially the concierge who recommended a great restaurant for us on our first night. There was an issue though when my boss and I were using the business room/computer lab. We asked (I assume the manager on duty) for help but were told that in order to resolve it we would have to call the number of an external company they use for their computers and other tech equipment, as opposed to just the staff at the hotel, which was inconvenient.The room I stayed in (standard) was very spacious, with sleek bathrooms, but the water pressure wasn't as good as most.Although I didn't eat at the restaurant, we did hit up the bar before we left and it was decent. Nothing extraordinary.Overall it was a nice stay.I am staying here right now and I am extremely disappointed in the level of service. The staff appears to be uncaring and pretty stupid. I brought a jacket down to the front desk last night to be dry cleaned. There was no specific dry cleaning bag in my room, so I asked for one at the front desk. They asked me why I didn't have one. I replied there was no bag in the room. They asked me why not. I replied that I could not explain why their staff had not put their bag in the room, but could they please take this jacket anyway. They put it in a clear plastic bag. They assured me it would be done the next day. They assured me it wouldn't be lost. When it hadn't arrived back by the appointed time the next day, I started calling looking for it. The front desk staff, the housekeeping staff, and everyone I could get on the phone in the span of an hour just said they didn't know anything about it,  it was nowhere and I would have to call back in three hours, at 10 pm when the night staff came back on. Waiting until 10 pm to start looking for a lost jacket you need for a meeting the next morning at 7:30 am isn't going to work. A hotel staff should solve problems, not tell you to talk to someone else when they come on the night shift at 10 pm. I called back three more times until I found a manager who located the jacket rumpled up in a plastic bag somewhere. It has never gone out to be cleaned and had spent the night and the day crumpled in the plastic bag. He brought it to my room. But frankly, after having been reassured that my jacket would be dry cleaned in the next 24 hours, and having to spend an hour trying to find it, to discover it was more winkled and dirty than before, is truly terrible service. The manager called later to apologize, but his staff should never have started down this cascade of events.When I called yesterday at noon asking for a sewing kit, I was told someone would bring one up. No one did. I had to call two more times. And to be charged $28 a day to park in their hotel is an insult on top of this. I am extremely disappointed in the staff of this hotel. The manager seems eager to solve my problems, but it's frustrating to spend so much time wading through incompetent staff to get to him.Very disappointed, front desk treated me like if I was asking for a free room. I was a presenter in a conference, everything suppose to be charge in a master account,  but, no, they charge me. It has been a week and I still waiting to talk with someone that can say at least "" I'm sorry for the mistake"" Never going back.","['spent', 'night', 'town', 'see', 'brooks', 'royal', 'farms',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hotel-monaco-baltimore-a-kimpton-hotel-baltimore,"Hotel Monaco Baltimore, a Kimpton Hotel",4.0,$$$,181,"When I was shipped off to Baltimore for a work meeting, I must admit, I wasn't too excited. Mainly because all I know about Baltimore comes from Serial and The Wire. Then I saw there was an affordable Kimpton property close to where my meeting was, and alas the tides turned!From the moment I got out of my Uber, to the moment I got back in the Uber to head to the airport, every member of the hotel staff was super friendly and helpful. The bellhop was quick to great me and direct me to the lobby area, which is on the second floor. Check in was a breeze, and the man pouring wine at the happy hour in the lobby was very welcoming.Location was awesome! Even though it was a bit cold for this desert dweller, I walked everywhere and felt safe walking at night.I scheduled breakfast room-service delivery for 7-7:30, and it was right on time. You can also have them print your boarding pass for you with breakfast delivery.When I checked out, I had about an hour to kill before I had to head to the airport and planned to go explore. I got to the front door before I realized I needed to stash my luggage. The bellhop said he would watch my stuff so I didn't have to haul it up back to the front desk.And of course the room was super comfy. Awesome bathroom and shower. If I hadn't been so nervous for my meeting in the morning, I also would have slept amazingly well in the giant king bed.Even though my company picked up the tab, the room rate was super reasonable.Whether you're in Baltimore for business or pleasure, definitely check out Hotel Monaco!My wife and I stayed here a few weekend ago. The hotel is just beautiful and has so much history to learn about since it was once the B and O railroad headquarters. The staff was very friendly. You have to valet your car and I think that cost 30 plus dollars a day.  We stayed in the spa suite with a soaking tub.  The room was big and beautiful and we had plenty of room to relax. There was some dust on the vents that I noticed for being such a nice hotel I thought they would have catch that.       We eat breakfast in the hotel's restaurant both mornings overall good food. The hotel has a wine hour starting at 5pm, so we grab a glass of wine before heading out for dinner.  The hotel is in walking distance of the inner harbor.  After we had dinner we come back and grabbed some drinks from the bar.         We were on the seventh room and overnight my wife and I were woken up several times by trucks driving by.   Overall our stay was great. We would totally stay here again.Really great experience here and overall with Kimpton hotels. Staff was very friendly and answered my questions smoothly, the building itself is beautiful and great that they kept a lot of the historical parks as best they could. Room size was what you'd expect. But bigger than most hotels I've been to. A really solid hotel to stay at if you're in the Baltimore area.This was my first time staying at a Kimpton hotel and I was not disappointed!The hotel is beautiful. It used to be an old train station and the marble decor is absolutely stunning. The rooms themselves were spacious and clean and the bathrooms were also pretty big.I loved that the heat was blasting as soon as you walked into the lobby (it was in the 50s when we visited Baltimore and we are from California). I also loved the fireplace on the left side of the concierge desk, and free happy hour every day at 5!My only real complaint is that we ordered coffee and tea to the room, and it ended up being almost 30 bucks with a 5 dollar delivery charge and tip included (we didn't see the tip was included until after and also tipped room service on top of this). That's a little ridiculous for two beverages! Sidenote - the restaurant attached the the hotel had the worst service ever!My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco, along with several of our friends, for a wedding weekend in Baltimore. We got a decent room block rate on a lovely room, and had a very pleasant stay.I made our reservation over the phone and found the Kimpton crew friendly and easy to talk to throughout the process. We missed the room block rate for our first night before the couple opened up more rooms, and were able to get the cheaper rate applied without any problem when we called again. I also mentioned that we were celebrating our anniversary that weekend (mostly true--it was the Monday), and the hotel sent us a bottle of champagne and a full-on dessert of rich, tasty chocolate peanut butter cakes.The hotel was attractive, definitely renovated but done up in a classically opulent style. I guess the hotel is in the old B &amp; O Railroad building--I must not be the only person who thinks of Monopoly when I hear this, because there were at least a couple Monopoly-related flourishes in the hotel (""Monopolizing My Doom--Do Not Disturb""). It had a historically salient feel that I enjoyed.Our room was comfortable, pretty, and clean, with a nice bed and a decent view--not that we got much use out of that, as we were in for a dim, rainy weekend. The Hotel Monaco was a great place to be stuck, though, when there weren't wedding events going on. We made two visits to the B &amp; O restaurant, and I liked that place a lot, both for food and drink. There was wine in the lobby at happy hour, which we took advantage of at check-in. If the weather were better, the location would've been convenient, but that didn't end up mattering, unfortunately.Staff was pleasant and everything went smoothly overall. I guess cheaper parking would've been nice (something like $37 for overnight), but no real complaints. I'd recommend Hotel Monaco if you're looking for a place to stay in Baltimore. I'll keep it in mind next time we make this trip.This hotel is by far one of my our favorite. High ceiling, room was clean. Complementary humidifier, tooth brush, etc. best of all you can request a pet goldfish for your stay. Also the wine hour with appetizer!!I can't believe for all the times I have stayed at this gorgeous hotel I've yet to do a review.  This one is long overdue and since I stayed here again last week I figured now is the time.This hotel is stunning and at one time was the headquarters for B&amp;O Railroad.  I have stayed at quite a few Kimpton properties (to include numerous Monaco's) and the entrance to the Baltimore Monaco may be the most beautiful.The staff...everything you would expect from a Kimpton Property....Valet, Check-In, Housekeeping, etc...all go above and beyond to ensure that you are satisfied and enjoy the Kimpton experience.  This is what truly sets Kimpton's apart from all others.  Caitlin was awesome and it was so nice of her to send along my welcoming gift too.The rooms are beautiful and very spacious too...the beds are extremely comfortable...the bathrooms huge and very modern.  They also have a decent exercise room that does the trick....One of the most beautiful hotels I have ever visited. Beautiful lobby, great history, friendly staff, comfortable and luxurious rooms. Where else can you grab a handful of Goetze's Caramel Cream upon check-in??Great downtown location. Walking distance to the Inner Harbor and Camden Yards.I am a Hotel Monaco and Kimpton fan for sure!Can I move in?!Oh so fancy...Nice big room.It's clean.High ceilings.A bathroom big enough where you can break dance.Ric Flair robes in the closet. (And a subsequent Instagram video).Comfortable beds.Valet parking.Close to many shops being in the Downtown area of Baltimore.Did I mention the Ric Flair robes in the closet.BTW, Baltimore is much prettier than Hampton Roads. They win.Me likes Monaco. Me wants to go back.The Hotel Monaco team was so helpful throughout our entire visit over Labor Day weekend. We brought our English Bulldog along with us (yay pet-friendly hotels!) and they allowed an early check in to make sure we could get him situated and comfortable. We were easily walking distance to the inner harbor (half a mile?) - it was pretty warm out, so make sure you walk on the shady side of the streets if you venture out in summer!The immediate blocks around the hotel werent the best - lots of homeless people and a few cops on corners at night time.... but my guy and I stuck together whenever we went out in the evenings and we were fine. We also are at the restaurant in the hotel - my guy had a burger and I had the brussel sprouts with some cocktails - if you've OD'ed on local crab... definitely eating at the downstairs restaurant will be a delicious detour.Hotel Monaco offers a wine hour from 5-6pm... we indulged one night and made new friends in the lobby over a glass of sangria - it was lovely!Staff was incredibly friendly (as was everyone in Baltimore!) and the hotel was immaculately clean, even with all the furry friends running around!We are staying in Hotel Monaco for our wedding in Portland, Oregon next year - and after this visit to the Baltimore location, we're thrilled with our choice in supporting such a fantastic place!My wife and i stayed here back in September ... we loved it we had the Mediterranean spa suite and it was unbelievable. ... we were in Baltimore for only one night but we loved the room so much and the price  that we wished we could stay for a week! ... we will definitely be back as soon as we can ... definitely the best hotel in B'more and a true hidden gem we love the Hotel MonacoThe building is gorgeous. Really it is. The majority of the staff we encountered were friendly and accommodating. Room was clean and updated. One gripe- I was told they swipe your card for $75/night for incidentals (which is reversed) and is the norm at may hotels I visit. We stayed 3 nights- and it was swiped for $765. A slip of the finger maybe? When I brought it to the desk's attention, she told me not to worry as it is reversed if nothing was damaged...... which I understood but I didn't get an explanation or reversal for the original swipe (which should have been more like $225) at that moment. The location was ok, it required a car at night as it wasn't right in the heart of the action.I really, really wanted to like this hotel more than I did.  The exterior is gorgeous as is the lobby and common areas.  However my room itself was a let-down; clean but ragged and worn, in desperate need of a makeover.  The hotel staff was great, very friendly yet efficient.  Service at the restaurant was slow even though it was not crowded at all but we enjoyed the food and signature cocktails we ordered.  Did not bring a pet, but impressed that it is a pet-friendly property.  Enjoyed seeing other furry critters, as I always miss mine when traveling.  What was most disappointing is that I inquired ahead of time about booking a spa service, my travel indulgence to myself whenever I'm away.  I was told that for the time period of my stay (mid-week) I did not have to make a reservation ahead, I could call the morning of service to choose a time.  That is not the way I normally handle these things but figured the 'expert' had just assured me of the process so I did as instructed.  Bad move; there was nothing available for any of the days of my stay!  Sorry Hotel Monaco, you lost me there.Kimpton hotels are the best hotels! I've been to a few and I've never been disappointed. Definitely sign up for karma rewards! You'll get free breakfast and wifi. As a side note, it's very vibrant and hip.The hotel is a beautifully restored office building. The rooms are enormous and lovely. I thought the staff were also very attentive and did a great job getting me a room right away. I valeted the car and it was quick and easy. I had a meeting in town and the fast service made it a lot less stressful to get in the room and out to attend to business. The only thing I thought they could improve on were the pillows. They were a bit lumpy, other than that I would say this is a great place to stay in this town.I recently stayed in this this hotel for two nights, it is beautiful with rich history. However the service was terrible. My boyfriend and I checked in and were given keys to our suite. Upon arriving in the room, we quickly discovered that this was not the room I paid for. He placed us in a standard room, when we booked a spa premier room, in which was significantly more. I chose this room because of its beautiful Fuji tub, so was disappointed. Went back to the desk, to be served by the same fellow who assisted us earlier. He was not sympathetic, did not apologize. Just took the keys from me and handed me two comp ""continental breakfasts... Without saying anything. (The hotel offers $1 continental breakfasts )He said ""let me see if we have one available"" I thought, ""if you have one?"" This is what I was booked for, now I assume that he placed us in the wrong room on purpose, hoping we wouldn't notice.A few minutes later he located one, called who I assume was house keeping , to ask if the room was ready. It was, or so we thought. Upon arriving in the new room... Which was beautiful but not clean. The tub I was so looking forward too still had water in it, the water had hair in it, as well as hair was around the tub itself. We went back down, as we planned on attending the free wine and appetizer hour, in which there were no appetizers and no where to sit. The man serving the wine watched me walk around looking for one, and did not greet me or offer me a glass. While doing this my boyfriend spoke to front desk, same fellow again. He said he would send someone up, again wasn't very sympathetic. We headed back up to the room as we missed out on the wine hour. Waited for someone to arrive to fix the tub, about 20 minutes later a young man arrived with a towel and spray bottle in hand... Mumbled something and just walked in the bathroom, fumbled around there for a bit. Walked back out and went for the door, without saying anything. My boyfriend had to ask ""everything good to go""? He said ""yeah"" and walked out... Not exactly professional by any stretch. To make matters worse because of this we were late for our dinner reservation at a restaurant. A few other things that should be mentioned. The elevators were also very touchy, they wouldn't register the floor when the button was pushed sometimes and other guests were having issues with that as well. Some high points... *The building itself is worth the stay! Beautiful and historic. Gorgeous original staircases, detailed ceilings, gold accents. Lobby is warm and inviting, with lovely decor and fireplace. Building is also leed certified and pet friendly :)*Valet service was good, the attendants were friendly and accommodating. Timing wasn't the best. *The night/early am shift front desk person upon our check out was pleasant and helpful. Overall, not a great first experience at this hotel, I had high expectations due to its star rating and Kimpton's reputation, but came up short. Not sure if I will be staying with Kimpton in the future.Stunning. I have no idea how the Kimpton chain has the ability to take historical buildings and turn them into Hotel Monacos, but they done did it again. I believe this was the National Rail HQ from the mid 1880s, and the Monaco has preserved all of the gilded glory of its former digs. The rooms are appointed in rich tones and leather, with subtle modern flair -the art is all post modern surrealism or bright abstracts juxtaposed against leather quilted bedframes, antique chairs and trunk end tables.Huge marble showers, chevron print carpet and as with all Kimpton's- impeccable service. The only place I'm likely to stay in B'more.My wife and went back 1 year after our wedding here. The staff was very friendly and went the extra mile to take care of us. Thanks to the staff, and especially Vernon, the front office manager, for making the visit special.We visited recently with high hopes and expectations.  Our room was very nice.  Huge and well kept.In the middle of the night our AC went out.  It was a sweltering 79 to 80 degrees from about 2 am on.  We could have called maintenance or asked for a new room but for our daughter who was managing to sleep through it and had two interviews the next morning.We reported the issue first thing in the morning and suggested they address it before reletting the room.  When we checked out the desk clerk was most apologetic and offered up that the manager would be calling us about our experience.  Never ever got a call.  What horrific customer service from a chain with such a good reputation.  We'll not visit this property again.As much as I wanted to like this hotel unfortunately there were too many problems for me to give them higher than two stars.The woman who checked us in on Tuesday night was quite cordial. My friend and I requested a high floor and to my delight she put us in a room on the top floor. Unfortunately while high up, the room appeared fairly standard which translates to adequate, nothing special. The big problem that night was that the room was freezing cold. Even though we set the thermostat to 80 degrees, the room never truly warmed up. I called down and asked for slippers since the floor in the bathroom was particularly cold, the same young woman who checked us in informed me that the hotel did not provide slippers but would bring up an extra bathmat to cover the floor, which she did promptly. The temperature outside that night was particularly cold so I gave the hotel a pass for the cold room and maybe I'm old fashioned to expect slippers in a hotel room these days. I held out hope that our stay would improve.Fortunately the weather warmed up substantially the following day so heat was no longer an issue. But that morning I observed that the bottom sheet on the bed was torn but was confident the housekeeper would notice and change the sheet. That night while turning down the bed I was quite surprised to see the same torn sheet. Once again I rationalized that maybe housekeeping assumed that since the tear was at the edge of the bottom sheet they could get away with it. So again I looked forward to our continued stay.On the following day, Thanksgiving, we returned to the hotel around 11:30 PM. My friend and I pulled up to the valet parking area which appeared to be deserted. After lingering some time with no one in sight I finally went inside to find an attendant while my friend waited outside by the car. Ultimately I located two attendants on the second floor by the check-in desk. It was Thanksgiving night so who could be upset with the parking attendants celebrating a bit.Friday night we returned to the hotel around the same time, 11:30 PM and once again no parking attendants. This time I went straight to the desk to complain. Before I even finished explaining the problem the manager deducted the unreasonably high valet charge ($38 for overnight, clearly he acknowledged the major error in service. The final insult came that night when we returned to our room to discover that housekeeping had never stepped foot into the room. The response when we called down to complain was an offer to send someone to do a ""light refreshing in the room"" which we declined as we were tired and just wanted to go to sleep.While the exterior and lobby of the hotel are very pretty, even grand, and the restaurant quite pleasant it doesn't come close to making up for a mediocre room and seriously sub-standard service.","The Hotel Monaco is a beautiful historic place with all the grandeur of it's  4-5 star neighbors. The staff are super friendly and get an A+ for customer service. The BEST part is that they are 100 percent DOG FRIENDLY!  It was so nice to see so many dogs coming and going during our stay. If your a dog owner, I highly recommend.  Fyi, the check in desk is on second floor, one elevator floor up.I really like how all hotel monacos are in historical buildings. This one is so beautiful. The hotel overall was ok. I asked for a room with a roll in shower for my husband and ended up with an accessible room with a normal bathroom that was really no different from a regular bathroom outside of grab bars. Oh well. The room also offered a doorbell and some lower items for someone who would need that feature. Overall a clean room and mid day they surprised us with some fresh fruit that was ok. I forgot my flatiron and they lent me one from housekeeping. Worked out well! All employees were kind except for one valet guy that couldn't understand why we wouldn't want to walk a few blocks to the ballgame. (Duh-its called handicap$. Kind of thought that was ignorant. Do your job-get us a taxi.What is up with the no locks on the bathroom door? Although I was only with my wife and son, I felt like I had no privacy. My son would constantly come over and slide the door wide open. He had a blast with it, but I sure didn't. Sitting on the toilet while he runs over and slides it open and runs away laughing was not a hit in my books. But, I have to say, it was rather cute seeing him do it, but it was also very embarassing and got annoying after awhile. Wife also had a really good laugh too, but I still would like locks on my bathroom door.What I did like was the fact that they have a wine hour at this hotel. I believe it was at 5?? It's in the main lobby of the hotel. You come down, get a glass of wine or cocktail, grab some snacks (flatbreads, goldfish, fruit, etc), and just chill on the sofas. The guy serving the wine was very nice. He even went and got my son a popsicle from the hotel freezer. Also, another plus was the decor. It was a very clean and upkept hotel. The valet guys were also great! They were very nice and fast at getting the vehicle when needed.I did have one little misshap that got me pretty upset for a good portion of the night. Wife and I wanted oysters and asked the guy up front if he could make us reservations at a specific restaurant. The person said that Sunday nights aren't busy and we wouldn't need it. We got to the restaurant and there was an hour wait before we could even be sat. UGH. I wish he would have just made the reservations for us. We would have avoiding the whole fiasco of trying to find other restaurants that would seat us right away.Oh, and wife booked the aquarium package which included a fish in the room. It was cool at first, but not even a full night past and the fish died! It just sat there on the counter and when we got back to our hotel for the night, we just saw it floating on its back. It's not like my son played with the water or anything. He didn't even get a chance to play with the fish. It's a good thing he's very young because that could be pretty dramatic for a child that was old enough to remember and comprehend their surroundings.I know Kimpton hotels are supposed to be Amazing. I've heard and read great reviews, but this one just didn't cut it for me. Maybe another kimpton elsewhere would??Overall: I would probably be back if they put locks on the bathroom door, but until then, I will have to check out other Baltimore Hotels.Very Nice hotel !  It was beautiful on arrival .. The valet guys were awesome gave great info . The security guy , Craig was nice as well and funny. The parking was too expensive , front desk was ok not very friendly though .  On the first night I was getting out of shower and stepped on glass. Security came to my room and did an incident report . However no manager ever called or came check on me .  I complained the next day. And was given 100.00 credit to restaurant there and free mini bar .. Ended up not eating at restaurant there due to us not liking anything on dinner menu .  Upon check out they offered me a free 1 night to come back and stay in suite .  They said they would email the offer to me per Vernon the manager .  It's been 1 wk later and Nothing in my email . Not to mention corporate has not called to check on my foot .  Hotel was wonderful but I can't believe a hotel this nice does  not have top notch customer service.. Also no pool .  You pay 300.00 per night and no pool ... Major ding with meThis place is 3 blocks away from Inner Harbor Baltimore, so it was a good location to stay for New Year's Eve. We didn't have to walk far to see the fireworks. We did valet parking since we were staying for the night, the valet parking was $38 (if you do the parking yourself is $30/night). Even on a cold night, someone was there to hold the doors for us and gave us direction to the check in lobby, since the lobby located on the second floor instead of first. The place has the historical design, the stairs to the second floor was long but it wasn't just straight up but it was in a circle style. I was in love with the lights design and even the signs to show the directions. The check in staffs greeted us nicely and helped us through the process smoothly and quickly, I was very satisfied with the service. Our room was on the 10th floor but sadly it wasn't the room that face the front street, instead it was just the back. I am okay with that since the room design was already amazing.Kimpton is my favorite hotel chain but as other people have noted, this one is far cry from the standard expected from this group.  While the building is beautiful, room service is awful (unapologetically so), the rooms are very much the worse for wear and need updating/reconditioning, parking is ridiculously expensive, no cable TV (really!), no swimming pool or spa on site (limited services are available in guest rooms).All in all, I would rather have spent my money at a Holiday Inn for half the price.  At least I wouldn't have been as disappointed with the lack of services and amenities because my expectations would have been much lower.This is the second time we here.  It is near the inner harbor (walking distant) and it is a great hotel overall.  The place is beautiful.  Front desk (on 2nd floor) is friendly.  Amazing coffee and tea by the lobby.  The room are clean and roomy.  I only wish the wi-fi were free.Firstly...the staff was very very very nice. The building itself is cool, HOWEVER...The room looked like someone had lived there for a while. Wasn't clean - M&amp;M's behind the couch scattered on the floor elsewhere and a crunched water bottle was just sitting there in the middle of the floor. Huh? The finishes and decor are a hodgepodge of an unbelievable level, and I could overlook it if I wasn't paying 300.00 a night! Like whaaa-at? ONE LESS RANDOM PATTERN WOULD BE NICE.  What about the wires sticking out unceremoniously from behind ill-mounted or busted electronics? Oh lord, the bathroom...faux leather shit colored wallpaper that is peeling up and window shades so sheer that require you to keep the light off at night lest you be seen by any and everyone...   The bed, the sofa bed AND the roll-away were the most uncomfortable beds I have ever sat and/or slept on. I don't know what kind of hotel doesn't have an extra blanket somewhere? Why have that ridiculously huge thrift shop looking dresser in the room if not to provide the guests with extra linens like a normal hotel? When we asked for an extra blanket, the one we got looked like it had been wrapped around a water heater!! And please do not order room service. Like the hotel itself, you most definitely do not get what you pay for...Fucking wretched. I don't know what hotel the other reviewers stayed at, this is the first time I have been misled by fellow yelpers because this hotel is low brow and waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced. Definitely a blemish on the Kimpton portfolio. And they must know it.We stayed here after seeing a special on trip advisor.Staff is great. Happy hour was a plus. Lounge with fireplace really nice.Only drawbacks are the rooms are small and sliding door on bathroom lacks privacy. The charm and history abound however and I would come again.Easy walk to the harbor but don't stray too far from that direction at night!Kimpton's just never seem to fail me! This property has to be one of my favorites! It's gorgeous! It was a converted train station, and I can tell you they did it right! The lobby is on the second floor, and you are always greeted with a smile. The staff just makes every Kimpton visit a little nicer. They are so quick to accommodate any needs. I truly appreciate that! The rooms were a nice size with all the amenities! It was tastefully decorated, bright and clean, comfortable beds and pillows. The bathroom rocked with a cool open shower and a huge jacuzzi tub! The Monaco has 24 hour room service, and a decent menu to order from. Love the location, we were able to walk down to the ballpark. When I'm back in Bmore this will be my go to hotel!This Hotel is beautiful, no doubt. The costumer service is great too, but there are some details that left us thinking we would try another hotel if we return to the city.  We paid extra for the spa suite, but it was a little strange.  I've been to three other Kimptons where the tubs are more than worth the money.  This one left me comparing it to a weird Jacuzzi at the YMCA.  I've said this before with other Kimpton's, but as eclectic as the robes are, they're freaking uncomfortable... crunchy...and small.We stayed in the hotel for the first nights dinner and drinks the following night.  I understand this is a Hotel that accommodates many different parties and people alike, but we felt like we could not escape the Sh*t show of a wedding (I think) that was going on.  The restaurant didn't seem to keep any of it separate from the costumers that were there for a relaxing weekend.  Sorry, but I left college years ago and I don't wish to attend an Ivy league frat party.Sorry, Kimpton. Thumbs down on this one.I was very impressed by this hotel, not only is it gorgeous but the staff are friendly as well. My room was beautiful and I felt that I got a lot for what I paid. The suite was big, nice tall ceilings and a gorgeous marble bathroom. They were so nice to my dog (which was the reason I booked with them in the first place, it's hard to find a good hotel that allows pets) and even gave her a goody bag. The location was great too, I could walk to the inner harbor and I felt safe as well, my dog approves of this place (as she peacefully passed out beside me on the bed),which is the only thing that matters to me.Stayed here at Monaco Baltimore 2 weekend ago for a wedding. There was no safe in the room, so I left some things in the dresser to lighten my backpack. Left a few magazines, iPad and a book and forgot the items on my way out. I called the hotel the next day asked for Housekeeping. They said that they did have my things, but that there was no iPad left in the drawer. I insisted that there was an iPad in the drawer, and was told that the staff member who cleaned the room returned everything that was left in the drawer. She was kind enough to offer to send my items for free. Nice gesture, considering someone made off with a nice iPad. Don't trust the Housekeeping staff. You've been warned.This is a nice hotel with good, personalized service. Rooms are sizable, bedding comfy, and bathroom amenities are nice. I was staying for a conference and service seemed okay. Banquet food service, at least what they served me, was frankly subpar. But you don't go to hotels to eat. This is a good enough place to sleep.We love the quirkiness of the Kimpton line, and Monaco didn't disappoint!  Our room had bunk beds for the kids with a huge puppy-portrait mural on their wall--adorable!  In-room gaming system made the kids' waiting time a lot more fun.  The building is gorgeous and really retains the old historical feel of the B&amp;O railroad headquarters it used to be!  Marble staircase, stained glass, train-inspired details everywhere...it's lovely!As with all Kimpton hotels, the morning/evening snacks &amp; drinks are so appreciated and just give that extra touch of making you feel comfortable and welcome.  Same with the staff--so friendly!  Love it!'The bf and I stayed here just one night for a Valentine's weekend getaway.  We arrived a bit early before check in time but were able to check in and head to our King room.  The front desk staff were super friendly, advising how they are a secure hotel- you have to insert your key in the elevator to get to your floor.The hotel is HUGE, spacious and very swanky.  I love all the details- the marble and chandeliers are so nice. The room is very big with very high ceilings, the mini bar (pricey!!) has all kinds of neat stuff.  Snacks, drinks, champagne, beer, and even Patron- of course, all for a price in a nice little price sheet on the table.  You can even have a new pair of fuzzy socks! They also have a couple fun robes in the closet- a zebra striped and leopard one, which was cool but they were not soft, along with a yoga mat.The bed was comfortable but you could definitely 'feel' the springs, and I was a bit disappointed there were no additional pillows, though I think we could've asked for more no problem.  We actually forgot toothpaste and in the bathroom they have a sign saying they will bring you complimentary (!!) toiletry items like toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.  I felt silly asking them to deliver toothpaste when I could've walked right down to the front desk, but they insisted delivery was no problem, and the toothpaste arrived in less than 5 mins!  My only complaint about the room was that the walls were very thin- you could hear doors slamming and people talking in the very next room.  Thankfully it was during the day and not when we were trying to sleep. They have free wine hour from 5-6.  I recommend getting there right at 5 as they also have hors d'oeuvres that were completely gone when we arrived at 5:45.  I don't like wine so can't attest to that but they also had coffee and water, and the bf said their red wine was meh. It's free- do the math- you get what you 'don't' pay for.We ordered room service because, well, when in Rome!  We only wanted the experience so we ordered their chocolate chip cookies.  They said they were a bit backed up but should arrive in 45 minutes.  Over an hour later they finally arrived, but we were blessed with  more than the 2 cookies listed on the menu- and they were warm and chewy and perfect!  They were a bit thin though, and as an avid baker I might suggest chilling the dough first before baking- it decreases the odds the cookies will spread while baking...just a random tidbit.They have valet parking- which was super expensive at $38 for the day/night. But I'll pay a good amount for peace of mind my car is safe. Overall not a bad stay.  Pretty pricey but decent room and very friendly service.This place is an excellent value for the price. We stayed here over Labor Day weekend this year, and felt like it was perfect for our stay. Our room was spacious and clean, and very comfy. We usually stay in places like Four Seasons or Hyatt and we felt like this place was as accommodating for a much more reasonable price.  I loved the historical aspects of the building as well, and it is centrally located. The staff couldn't have been better to us and there were plenty of Uber cars, Hotel cars and taxis at the ready.  I would come back, for sure. The only thing I would critique was the all hours dining menu wasn't so varied with options. But we had room service breakfast and it was awesome.  Get the lox plate! Mmmm...Oh and hubby had the french toast and loved it.I love Kimpton, as I am an Inner Circle member,  but after this experience I will not be staying at this hotel again. I primarily stay at the Surfcomber in Miami for work, but business has taken me to Baltimore this month. I stayed last month for a just a few hours (checked in at 11pm and out at 8am) so barely got to really experience the hotel. Onto today... checked in late thanks to a few delays with my flight - figured I would be comforted by getting to a trusty Kimpton property. Right? Wrong!!!! Staying for two nights this time and dreading it.  It's only been about an hour and I'm ready to head to the nearest Hilton. Pulled up and no valet to be found. There was some homeless guy hanging out across the street yelling, so I was nervous to get out. Parked the car and got my own suitcase and work bag out of the car and started walking inside...oh finally, the valet shows up. Great. Head up to get checked in and the girl at the front desk is just kind of blah. Nice enough though. I get my keys. ..no raid the mini bar coupon. No welcome Inner Circle member. Nothing. The Surfcomber gives you a glass of champagne on arrival!!!I ask for the room service details since I'd been at the airport all day. No room service (it was 11pm). Figured there'd at least be an overnight menu? Nope! I asked for delivery options and got ONE menu which upon checking yelp, had literally one and a half stars and had already been reviewed by a Monaco guest who said it was HORRENDOUS. So glad this was the menu given to me.OK brushing it off, I decide that I'll have a nice big room with my amenity waiting, so I can eat that! Head upstairs and I was not upgraded even though it's guaranteed. There's a leak over my window and the wallpaper is peeling off. And no amenity.  Not even a bottle of water. I am so used to Kimpton being spectacular that I am beyond disappointed at this experience.  Going to bed hungry and pissed. At least I know tomorrow to eat before getting here. Kimpton lovers steer clear!!!!!Centrally located and clean, historically significant, gorgeous, long elegant marble staircases, high ceilings, sexy modern bathrooms with two headed glimmering chrome shower heads, fun, full wall murals for the kids, complete with bunk beds and complimentary Xbox!  Terry cloth robes, well-stocked fridge, soft comfortable white dressed beds with tons of extra fluffy pillows, modern and way-above-average friendly service especially the best most understanding office manager, Vernon Drummond, this is THE place to stay in Baltimore!We always have a fabulous stay here!  The decor is amazing...very chic and retro fabulous.  The marble stairs and crystal chandeliers add to the charm of this boutique hotel.  Our room was clean and nicely appointed.  This location is close to Inner Harbor with ample restaurants and shopping.  The B&amp;O restaurant downstairs is also great to grab drinks, dinner or a quick bite.  Staff is friendly and attentive which made our stay even better!","I'm really starting to dig Kimpton Hotels. As far as this Monaco goes, there's almost nothing negative I could say about it. The space is beautifully re-purposed and the rooms are a good size for a downtown hotel. The high ceilings and design features (like the sliding door for the bathroom) make the room feel big, even though the square footage is probably not so high.Check in/out was quick and easy. Every staff person I interacted with was friendly. And the evening wine reception is simply awesome. The location is OK, but leaves something to be desired. It's close to the Inner Harbor, but not in the Inner Harbor. By no means does the area feel dangerous, but you'll want to be on-guard if you venture out after dark.I know. I know.  Could this hotel really be worth 5 stars??  Yes.Nervous as all get out about staying in Baltimore, I had to find a hotel that had nothing but good reviews.  Luckily I work for a big bank and was able to score the bank rate.  Knowing that this was on the  bank negotiated list, I knew that it would be a good one.  And I was right.  I haven't experienced hotel services like this before.  I would go out on a limb and say that this hotel could be close to comparison with The Ritz.  There.  I said it.  Two totally different styles, however same awesome hospitality, flare, and luxury.This hotel is in a perfect location.  Close to the inner harbor, and close enough to walk (a mile...) to the stadium.  We arrived and like ninjas, the doormen (like three of them) open our doors and had our luggage out within minutes.  We arrived in time for the end of the manager's reception and the bellmen asked me ""red or white"".  0__0 huh??  Giggling husband said ""white"" and I was still confused.  Apparently the manager's reception was a cocktail hour and the bellman was asking me if I wanted red or white wine.  I laughed.  ""White please"" After a LONG arse drive, I was almost in tears as the glorious white wine was handed to me.  ""hello, you"" is what I thought.  Check in was a breeze.  Up to the room we go with the friendly bellman.  Room was AWESOME.  Spacious, clean, comfy bed, nice flatscreen, and a GIANT shower....I was in heaven.  Every time we left the room, either the cleaning crew or the doormen were asking us if they could help us get to our destination.  I felt like a rockstar.  I felt like they REALLY were genuine and were just happy that we were happy.  We'd leave the hotel, and they would open the doors....smiling.  We'd come back and they'd say ""hey! it's you two again! welcome back""  giving us high fives.  I couldn't believe it. Beautiful hotel with a  grand marble staircase.  It's inside the renovated B&amp;O railroad and I loved it.  There is a manager's reception that provides lite bites and wine from 5-6 Mon thru Fri.  It's an amazing place and will now be a fan of Kimpton Hotels wherever we go.Ah, I so wanted to give this hotel five stars!  Alas,  I can't.Husband and I were only in town for a night -- wanted to get an early start at the aquarium the following day.  I based my hotel choice on Yelp reviews (and a <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotel.com&amp;s=1c9cd25474134bd332ead348e1af3dd34ef04702a504940ac882b95d1297049a"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotel.com</a> credit), and got a King-bed room with a soaking tub for us.  We were happy to see we could bring our dog, though we opted not to as we wouldn't have a place to leave her while in the aquarium.  (Good to know that Kimpton is pet friendly for future trips, though, as we travel with our dog often.)Parking is expensive in downtown Baltimore.  Self-parking at a nearby lot and getting the ticket validated helped, but there are light rail and metro stops very, very close so definitely look into mass transit options. The building itself is gorgeous and they've done a great job preserving historical bits such as the marble staircase.  Lobby is tasteful with a nice lounge area complete with squishy chairs and a decorative fireplace.  Staff was very friendly and helpful -- they even loaned us a goldfish to keep us company overnight!  (They didn't offer to help us get our bags up to our room which is fine by me - I can handle my own luggage - but I know that's an important thing for some people.)The room itself was a decent size and the tub was perfect.  The clashing patterns and colors really should be eye-smiting, but they weren't, for some reason I can't fully understand.  The bathrobes made us both smile - one zebra-striped and one leopard-spotted.  The walls were a tad thin and the AC a bit on the loud side, but neither one bothered me too much.  What was a problem, however, was the bed.  Despite being a king, we were mashed together in the center of the mattress because there was a huge sag right in the middle.  No center support was present, the mattress itself appeared old, the pillow-top was very lumpy.  It kind of defeats the purpose of getting a huge bed when it forces you to sleep in a space the size of a twin.So very, very close to an excellent stay, but so ruined by a terrible bed.Impressed from start to finish. The lobby is gorgeous the rooms are gorgeous the wine hours is nice &amp; you can't beat the location. We came for a four-day weekend with our two children and got the family room which has an attached room with bunk beds for the kids. Wow!! They have their own tv &amp; Xbox too! The rooms are sophisticated and well done. I travel a lot for business &amp; I would stay here again.This is long overdue review. Like at least a year. But better late than never, I always say.Upon walking into the hotel, you barely remember that you are still in Baltimore. Statement staircases, marble flooring, grand lighting and a rich sense of style make this Kimpton boutique hotel just as posh as all the others.I have stayed overnight in 4 Kimpton hotels including 1 in Washington, D.C. and 2 in New York City. All were stellar but the visual appeal of this hotel is memorable. Maybe because you can tell the building is one that was build perhaps in the '60s or '70s but given the modern touches it has great modern appeal with great historic ""bones"".The wine happy hour is quaint and the wine selections are appealing for those who like white, red, dry or sweet.The room definitely had a moderate upscale presence. Light and pristine bedding. Thread count is apparent in the sheets and they are so endearing to the skin. I just melted in the pillows and there were several of them for me to get lost in the clouds of softness. Spacious bathroom and a shower that has great power stream of water. Great attention noted to the updated and contemporary design. Clean lines but great flow of colors that are not too obnoxious or  overpowering with each other.I have nothing negative to say about my stay here. Whenever in Baltimore again, this will definitely be a first choice for me.This place is wonderful! The staircases of marble are so spectacular. This makes the hotel so elegant and historical. All of the employees are courteous, helpful, and friendly. There also is a wine and bite size pieces of pizza available as a courtesy between 5:00 and 6:00, which was a nice touch. Easy walking distance to Inner Harbor. I will definitely stay here again!As good as it gets, yes a truly great hotel with all the amenities for a great place for you to stay.We stayed at 2 ""Kimpton"" owned properties (other in OldTown Alexandria) Our two nights in Baltimore were awesome, and close enough to Fells, Pt. Inner Harbor but was extremely cold to walk so we used Lyft/Uber to get around GET APPS AND FORGET TAXIS...better prices for better service and ride. The hotel is the old railroad offices and was terrific, garden tub, spacious rooms and has that historic feel. We ate and had drinks at the lounge and a two blocks away are a couple of pubs, (O'Sheas) and other food places to enjoy. The food and drinks were really well made and priced accordingly. I would highly recommend this hotel.My only complaint was the (homeless) people inside the lobby and the demolition of the old Morris Mechanic theater next door. The noise during the day was off-putting, but the hotel graciously allowed us to move to opposite side of hotel away from noise. The construction was not really early a.m. but constant. I am not a complete ahole without compassion since it was in the low teens temperature wise, but when a homeless woman went and helped herself to hot drinks/chocolate and placed her ""unwashed"" hand in to the marshmallow bowl and began eating them...I had to speak to the front desk clerk and asked to have them remove the contaminated leftovers....5 stars across the board for this stay..thanks KImpton/Hotel Monaco I will returnvery clean and chic! friendly staff. awesome service. spacious rooms. kimptons are consistent.My husband and I stayed at Hotel Monaco last Saturday night for a business trip and thought this hotel was beautiful.  We have stayed throughout Baltimore over the years for this annual business trip and my husband decided to take a chance on this hotel for a change.  The valet was welcoming, the front desk girl was informative and our room was so comfortable.  The room had high ceilings with a comfortable bed and a large bathroom but the best part of the room was that is was so quiet. In the morning we were amazed at how late we slept because there was not your typical hotel noise of doors banging and people talking in the hallways...great nights sleep.  We had cocktails and appys in the restaurant bar and found it to be friendly and comfortable.  The food we did have was delicious and the bartenders were attentive. If I search for a complaint the only thing I would say is that the water pressure in the shower was low...which is minor but I try to give pros and cons on my reviews. Also, walking distance to Inner Harbor and convention center.  We will be back.A grand hotel!  Highly recommend this hotel.   This is a lovely stately hotel.  Marble staircase, brass fixtures but still an uber modern feel. Blocks from Inner Harbor.  Lovely room.  Extremely high ceilings.  CO Bigelow toiletries.  Modern furniture. Plenty of electric outlets to 'recharge'.   Trip: Business, Date: 10/7/2013Stayed in Baltimore for the weekend over Xmas.  This hotel is great.  Upgraded to the Mediterranean Suite, which was very large, had a whirlpool tub, and nice views.  A hotel is only as good as its staff, however, and the staff here were very nice, cheerful and helpful.  Tamika at the front desk was awesome, and the restaurant staff were as well, specifically Maria at the bar and the Ozzy Ozbourne looking guy in the restaurant.What a beautiful place! The entrance is spectacular, what a beautiful restoration of the B&amp;O location. The room was huge with high ceilings, and everything was spotless. The valet (Ahmed) was so friendly and helpful, the front desk was great from check-in (they let me in 3 hours early) to check-out. Excellent service. The restaurant has an amazing breakfast and great atmosphere.This is our 3rd stay at Monaco Baltimore and it didn't let us down!!I'm looking forward to staying at another Kimpton Hotel.We love Kimpton hotels and this one is awesome!  Beautiful building and rooms.  Our original room was near the elevators,  but the staff worked to find us a quieter room.  Huge thanks to Julia McCarthy!   Super helpful in making our stay wonderful and relaxing!I had the opportunity (and pleasure) of staying at the Hotel Monaco in Baltimore this past weekend for a wedding.  Let me just say -- Kimpton Hotels know exactly what they are doing.  I am not sure I'll stay anywhere else when I'm not necessarily looking for a budget stay.First, the building itself is very aesthetically pleasing.  A lot of this has to do with so many of the older buildings in Baltimore being historical buildings with original architecture (to include the dual marble staircase in the entryway to this hotel).  Everything looks very nice from the moment you walk up to the moment you enter.  It's clear that the designers for Kimpton go above and beyond to present a luxury hotel.The room itself was excellent.  It was honestly comparable to the Four Seasons room I stayed at in Atlanta.  Whether that is a function of Atlanta's Four Seasons hotel not being ""up to par"" with its counterparts or not, I cannot say.  But Kimpton is decidedly different as well, opting for more modern appointments than the traditional classics of the Four Seasons.12-foot ceilings in all the rooms here, modern furniture and linens, and an absolutely phenomenal bathroom...honestly, the bathroom is something I would like to put in my own dream home one day, albeit with more storage/function.  The shower is nicer than some home custom jobs I've seen, and I'm pretty sure the floor features travertine tile, which isn't exactly cheap.All of this for under $200/night with a pretty awesome restaurant/bar on the ground floor and minimal, non-invasive staff.  You'll never have to wait long for help, but the staff isn't overwhelming and all over the place either.  Pretty decent city views of Baltimore too, for what its worth (it is still Baltimore, after all).I would definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco in Baltimore for anyone looking for a remarkably comfortable and luxurious stay for a short or long trip if your wallet can make it happen.  Kimpton Hotels are now my new favorite line of hotels thanks to the Hotel Monaco in Baltimore.  5 Stars.Just arrived. Elevator smelled of vomit. Woman at front desk was reading some paperwork and asked us to wait a min. Ok, we waited.... Then she took a phone call, still waiting (no one else there but us) finally a gentleman came out if the back room to check us in. Got into room, no remote control for TV. Had to call down for one. Room is nice. Large with two queen beds. Cute bathrobes in closet. Lots of toiletries. Parking was $30 per day or $38 for valet. We were not offered a goldfish, but I did see someone going up the elevator with one. To use elevator you must insert your room key.I live in Baltimore, however my boyfriend and I wanted a romantic night away from dogs, roommates, etc. This hotel was beyond our expectations! The whole hotel is gorgeous, the room was large and immaculate, clean, smelled clean, and was beautifully designed. The kind sized bed was SOO comfortable, we didn't even want to get up in the morning! We also used the jacuzzi tub and it was amazing. Staff was also very friendly and efficient. Only complaint was the $38 valet parking. We ended up parking 1/4 of a mile awhile at a cheaper garage. Wish they had a cheaper parking option. Otherwise, we loved everything. Will be returning!This hotel is amazing! My wife and I recently stayed here for her birthday. We were made to feel very special from the very start: from the email two days before our arrival from AFOM Vernon Drummond to confirm our stay and inquire if we had any special requests; to the free upgrade to their Mediterranean Suite; there was champagne &amp; fresh fruit; candles around the jacuzzi, and candies shaped like a heart on the bed. And  my wife loved the yoga mat! She felt very special indeed. Monaco is minutes from Inner Harbor, is clean, has a great lobby, foyer, and stairs leading to the front desk.Enjoyed a delicious breakfast both mornings  at B&amp;O Brasserie. If you are planning a trip to Inner Harbor, this is the place to stay.Our first time in Baltimore and first stay at a Monaco. Absolutely loved this hotel! No complaints!! The entire hotel is beautiful. The room was very big with a big bathroom as well. High ceilings. Have to use your key to access elevators so it feels safe. Nicely appointed, modern decor. The staff was helpful and friendly. Lots of elevators so you didn't have to wait long. Good location within easy walking distance to the Inner Harbor and lots of shops and restaurants. Loved the C.O. Bigelow soap/shampoo etc--it smelled SO good! Would love to return here or to another Monaco!One of the best and most beautiful Kimpton hotels I've stayed in (and ALL Kimpton hotels are great)! The room was comfortable and quiet. The hotel is housed in the historic B&amp;O Railroad headquarters, which only adds to its charm. Be sure to grab a bite to eat at the B&amp;O Brasserie downstairs, as well. The food was amazing. HIGHLY recommend this hotel!","This is the second Kimpton Hotel I've had the pleasure of staying at (Burnham in Chicago being the other). I must say, Kimpton is becoming my favorite chain.The building used to be the corporate home for the B&amp;O railroad, and if you look around, you can see through some of the modernization. It's a really cool space, and I'm fond of unique properties with charm.This hotel is beautiful. The bedding is very good, and the high cielings really make it feel spacious. The bathroom benefits from modern touches and fantastic water pressure - even on the 9th floor. The restaurant hotel (which I really need to review separately) is also very good. It's not your typical hotel restaurant; it's good enough to draw in locals. Customer service well exceeds what you may be used to at the usual large chains.I would strongly recommend this hotel if you're in the area.Got to be a friend's plus one here during her book's publicity tour. Loved the quirky details like zebra and panther print dressing gowns and the wine hour - should have had soft drink option and veggie canapes tho! Not a huge fan of the room-service food (we ordered a lot and only enjoyed about a third of it - the breakfast burrito was awesome tho!)  Good choice of movies on the in-room system though it was a bit fiddly to use...Lovely large bathrooms and helpful friendly staff. What more could you ask for...!My first time in Baltimore and we chose this place. The moment we walked up to the front door we were greeted by ""Big Dave"" who was super friendly and funny. He escorted us to our room and told us a little about the hotel as we made our way up to the 8th floor.This place is beautiful inside and out. Our room had a giant King sized bed, very high ceilings, and big windows overlooking the streets. The bed was very comfortable and clean. Bathroom was beautiful but had limited privacy due to the sliding door and no switch for a fan. Even though we didn't have our pups with us during this stay, I was pleased to find out that this hotel is very pet friendly. Overall this was a great place to stay if you're only in town for a few days. Not far from the aquarium and water. My only complaints were the lack of parking and wifi wasn't working. It got to be a little pricey to park in the garage across the street and valet parking was just as much. It was also a little annoying that you had to sign up for some program and give the front desk a code # to get the wifi for free and a $10 mini bar credit. It took longer than I expected to check out of the place. Other than that minor stuff we had a really great time here and would most likely return.Inaccurate accounting, incorrect, unauthorized charges, absolute failure to correct  mistake despite admitting having charged my card extra $459.70 in error. Despite repeated promises by Harold in accounting no corrective action has happened since July. I have opened disputes with American Express on 5 charges they have placed on my cards following my stays here, that have no mention in the check-out bill.I stayed at this hotel at-least 6 times since January 2013. Each time I am seeing false and unauthorized charges to my cards in the amounts varying from $35 to $500. I have prohibited any of my staff traveling to Baltimore to stay at this hotel. Stay away or at-least check your credit card statements 2-3 months following every stay at the Hotel Monaco Kimpton in Baltimore.Pros:- Beautifully decorated interior- Clean and comfy- Free wi-fi &amp; $10 Raid the Mini Bar credit if you are a Kimpton Rewards member (free to join)Cons:- No coffee maker in the room. Although, you can request one and if they have it available they will bring you one. - Expensive parking (look for nearby parking garages as an alternative)- Customer service was hit or miss- Asked for late check out and found the cleaning lady camped outside of our room- The area is a little sketchy but I guess that's just BaltimoreThis was my first visit to Baltimore in about 20 years and I can say that the area is much nicer than I remember. This is the first time that I stayed at a Kimpton Hotel and I can say I was impressed. This is a very secure property with keyed elevator access and nice security personnel on the first floor.  Everybody that I interacted with was very pleasant and professional.  The historic building was very nice and my room was clean and the 8th floor was very quiet.  I thought that the 5pm wine and appetizer tasting was a nice touch.  The only negatives were that that hall carpets were pretty worn and the the leopard print robe in the closet looked a little sketchy.  I do have allergies and this is a pet friendly hotel so be aware of that but I had not issues due to the clean room.  Some people mention the cost of parking but their are other options very close if you want to self park.  I opted to pay to have to hotel handle parking and you pay per day and can take your car in and out for the day price.  All in all when I return to Baltimore I will be staying at this HotelI LOVE Kimpton hotels. They have incredible customer service, and are always willing to go above and beyond. This particular one is in the old B&amp;O railroad station, so it's a gorgeous building inside, with large marble staircases.From the minute we arrived, the staff was incredibly accommodating, helping with our luggage all the way from curbside to our room. They provided us with maps, recommendations, and best of all, are pet friendly! They provided a bag with treats, a poop bag, and a map with directions to the nearest dog park. The wine hour in the lobby is awesome---everyone brought their dogs down, and mingled with dogs, wine, and appetizer samples from the restaurant downstairs. Kimpton hotels never charge a pet fee, which is an added bonus. Unfortunately, I don't think this hotel is in the best area, but it is certainly not the hotel's fault. I lived in DC for a few years and am not really scared away by city living, but others seemed to be wary of the neighborhood, and a girl at the dog park told me she was mugged a few months ago. Just be careful walking around at night.Gorgeous hotel. Everything is up to Kimpton standards (friendly, helpful staff, comfortable beds, great towels, nice bathroom, etc.).  There's even a nice, big gym! But there are a few kinks...*Valet. Gosh almighty this was a pain. We'd call downstairs to the front desk (you can't reach valet directly) for the car at least 20min ahead every time and not once was the car ready when we came down. In fact, there was not one time when someone was even on their way to get the car. We had to allow an extra 15+ minutes to any trip for this during our stay. *Front Desk Staff. Guys...if you're during prime check in or check out times, please staff your front desk with more than one person. We had to wait on a 5 person line both upon arrival and departure. Not a huge deal but could easily be solved.  I will say that for the price, staying here is a killer deal...Just bring a little bit of patience.The hotel was very good.  The rooms were huge and unique.  Most of all they were clean.  We only stayed for one night but if I come back through Baltimore, this is where I would stay.This was a great hotel, especially for the price.  Everything was clean, and we liked the large windows and tall ceilings.  I will admit that I'm a bathroom snob, and this one didn't disappoint.  Lots of room and a clean, modern shower with no yucky shower curtain that reminds you of everyone else that has stayed there.  My only complaint was that they are a bit stingy with bath towels - they should just stock three in the room instead of two.Chic. Sexy. Fun. Clean. Hot (in a chic, sexy, fun, clean way)!  I love this hotel.  I freaking hate staying in hotels.  They give me the creeps, even some nice hotels really make me uncomfortable.  It's the UNKNOWN...who slept in this room?  Who did what in this bed?  Who pooped in this toilet?Well, once I opened the door to our room at Hotel Monaco all my quesitons of the unknown were immediately answered as I felt like I was the ONLY ONE to ever walk into this room, with the exception of the maid (who got a very hearty tip from me).It was so clean!  It was so comfortable.  It was so BIG, for a king size bed hotel room in a metropolitan city.  It was not expensive.  My fiance had the mental capacity to look on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a> as we were coming down for a weekend for a wedding and didn't really want to stay in a best western/holiday inn/etc.  We wanted a nice hotel and he saw it was a four star hotel...and on hotwire they don't tell you the name of the hotel until you book.  HOT FUCKIN DAMN did we get lucky with the Hotel Monaco.We checked in and immediately went up to our room to unpack.  I don't really ever unpack since I don't like my clothes co-mingling in the drawers of the unknown so I decided to hang up my dress for the wedding and we headed down to the bar for drinks.When we are on vacation we definitley want to have three square meals a day and we tend to drink with most of them.  It was around 2:45pm and the wedding was at 6pm so we had time to kill.  We had a great bartender who made me a gin drink.  I had a couple.  We had the bacon wrapped dates, not amazing but ok.  Then we had homemade donuts.  THESE WERE AMAZING.  You must get them.Then we had to get in our fancy clothes for the wedding but first, we needed to attend the free wine session in the lounge.  We had some wine (beringer or some brand like akin to that).  Not my fave, but free is free and I had a few sips.Then off to the wedding.  After the wedding I was looking forward to returning to my room to sleep.  And sleep I did.  It was a beautiful sleep and I woke up after 9am. Please note, that I NEVER can sleep in a hotel room.  I can't fall asleep, stay asleep, I just can't get comfortable.  I was so comfortable here that I could have just died and it would be ok because I was doing something I loved.  SLEEPING.My fiance stayed out and came back to the room much later than I.  I didn't care.  I had a great shower before bed and put on a fabulous robe (I believe it was a leopard print one) got in my jammies and off I went to saw some wood. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZWe got up in the morning and had breakfast.  I don't remember what I got, but I know it was good because I would have complained here if it was bad.We then went out all day, ate, drank, saw an O's game (they won), drank, walked, and then I ate another meal in the hotel.  And got my gin drink,I will absolutely come back here again.  In fact I really want to return to B'more just because of the Hotel Monaco.It's a great place!I frequently stay here in Baltimore. It's a good location, walking distance to the harbor, Mt. Vernon and the stadiums, but also often has on-street parking available. The inside is very beautiful and historic, they have free wine happy hours, a nice lounge with fireplace. The rooms are always very nice and clean. The price is usually very reasonable for a hotel of it's class. Service is excellent. This is my go-to hotel for when I want to stay in Baltimore and don't want to bother staying with a friend.Simply the Best. It's a Kimpton. An outstanding hotel in a gorgeous historic building.I am a Kimpton junkie so I was excited to try a new (to me) location. Unfortunately it was a quick stay for me so I did not have the opportunity to get the overall experience, but I can comment on a few things that are important to me when I'm travelling for work:#1 The staff is super friendly. That's pretty standard for Kimpton hotels but this staff seemed to be having fun at work - while still being very professional. #2 My room was great. Big room, high ceilings, clean clean clean. There was one specific element of my room that I let the front desk know about, otherwise the hotel would have received 5 stars. It wasn't anything that detracted from my overall stay.#3 Overnight room service. I didn't use it, but you know when you've been flying all day and haven't eaten and get to your hotel super late and have to venture into the howling unknown for a sandwich ... ?  I'm looking at you, Portland.#4 They have Bravo TV. (Am I the only one who cares about that?)Combined with Kimpton's InTouch loyalty program, this is a no brainer. I can't wait to come back.I love Kimpton Hotels!  The attention to detail at each hotel is amazing and my stay at the Baltimore Hotel Monaco was great.  This specific hotel's theme was world traveler in which was carried out through the light (train decal) and the night stands which are luggage cases! The room had great tall ceilings, beautiful tall windows and a grand bathroom.  The hotel offers bike rides (call ahead), yoga amenities, and is pet friendly during your stay.  They have great coffee in the morning until 10 am and they do offer wine at 5 pm every day.The only complaint (if you even want to consider it a complaint) is the bed as it was not as plush as I would have hoped for a california king bed and wifi is not free unless you sign up for their rewards club.Overall, my stay here was comfortable and relaxing!We absolutely love Kimpton Hotels - between the beautiful decor, helpful staff, and great amenities, Kimpton is always our first choice when it comes to hotels. This hotel didn't disappoint us. As always it was clean, comfortable and convent to where we wanted to go. We also were able to enjoy our $10 free raid the mini bar reward.An outstanding find for our family! Hotel Monaco is breath of fresh air in the cookie cutter world of hotel chains. From the moment we pulled in front of the hotel we were treated as welcome and appreciated guest! Every staff member we encountered was beyond pleasant! The management team knows exactly what they are doing. The check in process was painless and seamlessly smooth. Our bags were brought to our room with great efficiency! The room was clean and well decorated. The room had a very modern feel to it, that is a welcome change! To sum it up we were pleased with the high level of customer service along with aesthetics of the hotel decor. We have found a new brand of hotels that we will look for in other cities when we travel!Very courteous and friendly staff. Bathrooms and bedrooms are very clean. Bathrooms are supplied with C.O Bigelow bath products (basic shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, and soap). Make sure to joint the free rewards program to enjoy free wifi at the hotel!I got a stain on my blouse and the hotel supplied me with stain remover towelettes when I asked if they might have anything to possibly help remove it. Also, unlike other hotels, they provide you with basically anything you can possibly want such as toothbrush, toothpaste, sewing kit, mouthwash, and etc.This was the second time I had stayed at this location.  The building is very old, but decorated really nicely and it looks really cool at night with blue lights shining up the side of it.  About the only complaint that I have with this visit was that the door lock to our room did not work correctly.  Overall though it was a good experience and will be staying there again.Everyone who I encountered at the Monaco is exceptionally nice and helpful.  The hotel is in a beautiful historic building but is done in a cool, modern design - best of both worlds.  The room was nice and comfortable, and very quiet.  I liked that the comforter was covered by sheets - much cleaner than having a blanket that probably isn't washed all too often.  Plus there's free Internet, unlike some 4 star hotels that charge $10+/day.I like Kimpton hotels because the chain is environmentally responsible.  There are recycling as well as trash cans in the rooms, housekeeping changes sheets and towels only upon request, not every day (which is silly anyhow - who does that at home?!)  They also adjust thermostats while guests are away to be energy efficient - no point blasting the A/C or heat all day if you're out.  They also have bikes that you can use, not sure if they are included or extra, but regardless, that's great!I also love that you can request a goldfish to make your room feel more like home, and also a yoga kit - a yoga mat and block.  The hotel usually has a yoga channel on an in-house TV station with classes you can follow, but it wasn't working so they delivered a DVD and hooked up a DVD player.  After check in, the guy called to ask if my goldfish had arrived ... how great is that?  When I mentioned that the goldfish seemed too big for the little vase it was in, he had someone bring a proper goldfish bowl right away.  Kimpton hotels are pet friendly and you can bring your dog, I saw one coming in as I was walking out.  The General Manager was also really helpful when I wanted to extend my stay another day at the same rate, which wasn't showing up online.There is tea/coffee and newspapers in the lobby in the a.m. (even the Sunday New York Times!) and fruit infused chilled water the rest of the day.  I didn't make it to a wine happy hour but they don't serve cookies anymore. There's valet parking (I parked on the street.)  One tip - if you have a preference between a bathtub and shower, let them know on check in.","I'm addicted to Kimpton Hotels...They are hands-down the BEST with customer service.    This location is particularly opulent.  The building used to be the executive offices of the B&amp;O railroad.  The hotel is filled with old world charm.  Beautiful marble, brass and stained glass.  Kimptons are all dog friendly and my puppy was treated to a goody bag on arrival that had treats and directions to a nearby dog park.  As for us, we used the secret word at check-in and were upgraded to a beautiful suite.  TLove, love, love Kimptons...we'll be back. he rooms are spacious and clean.Found this by accident and truly loved it. Staff was very helpful and the rooms were great. If you are looking for old style class with modern touches. I recommendI called reservations on this hotel and asked for a room on Valentine's Day with an in-room Jetted Tub. I was promised one and requested to book the room... After booking the room  a few days later I received a 20% off coupon in my e-mail. I called back and asked if I could use it.. While speaking with that representative I decided to surf their website photos to catch a glimpse of the awesome tub I would hav in my room. When I didn't see an example of one on the website, I asked the rep if she could confirm that my booked room had one. She stated that the type of room I was booked under did not have that available... Long story short. I ended up speaking with 5 different agents and managers before one of them (almost blatantly) called me a liar and said that would have never happened. She also informed me that the calls were recorded (as if that would have made a difference in my ""story"") I lost my reservations and had to reschedule my trip to a completely different state. I will now will be staying elsewhere for Valentine's Day. Never again will I book with any Kimpton Hotels location with service like thisOn the positive side... Some of the agents were quite nice and onsite staff were quite nice while telling me that there was nothing that they could do for me about their mistake.I love Hotel Monaco! The entire hotel had this ""expensive feel"" to it, yet it was only about $119 + tax (a little less than $140 with tax) for a deluxe king bed room AND valet parking. I reserved their Park n' Play package which included valet parking (better than paying $36/night alone on valet parking + tip!). The check-in process was very easy and quick. The room itself was beautiful, the bathroom even more gorgeous (with a marble shower). If you sign up for their loyalty program (it's free), you get complimentary internet every time you stay there (although their internet sucks...) and a free $10 raid towards the minibar (all the items are already in a fridge in your room and you just take whatever you'd like and mark it off - even if you don't mark it off, obviously something will be missing so they'll notice).Every time I needed my car, I just buzzed the valet and was downstairs in 15 minutes and the car would be ready. The valet parking people were extremely kind as well.I'm deducting one star because 1) housekeeping comes at 10am (TOO early for a Sunday morning! Please consider coming at 11am at the earliest) and 2) I left an article of clothing at the hotel and called a few days later when I noticed it was missing. I called the hotel and noticed the phone wasn't ringing anymore and someone was chit chatting in the background for little under a minute. I didn't want to be rude and gave them some time (even though the first thing you should do when you pick up the phone is greet the person, but whatever) until I said ""HELLO?!!?!"" and I heard the front desk person say to whoever she was talking to ""Ugh hold on. Hotel Monaco, blah blah blah how may I help you?"" Yes, that is how you should greet a client...With the exception of both being on water, Monaco and Maryland aren't exactly super alike.  The Hotel Monaco Baltimore bridges the gap a bit with elegance and sophistication that even Princess Grace would have admired.When I stayed there though, I was hardly graceful. It was after a night of hanging out with my sister-in-law and our cousins.  She was staying at the hotel because she was in town for business.  I wound up staying there as well because our night involved too many drinky drinks and I didn't want to drive back out to the 'burbs.  LOL!With beer goggles this place was gorgeous! Thank God, when I woke up and the goggles were gone, it was even better! lol! The high ceilings and beautiful furniture made for a classy feel, but the rooms themselves were more modern than traditional - dimmer lights, platform beds, spacious bathrooms. It was really, really nice.For a chick who is sprung off W Hotels, Kimpton's Hotel Monaco was giving them a run for their money.  I live too close to really use the hotel again, but I recommend it often... in fact, it's the only hotel in Baltimore that I recommend without hesitation.  It's centrally located downtown, close to shops, attractions, and great food, and a charming addition to Charm City!Kimpton hotels are becoming my new favorite.  You can join the In Touch rewards program for free and get benefits like free wireless and $10 mini bar voucher every stay.  After so many stays, you can earn free nights, etc.  Definitely worth it!  The Hotel Monaco of course was no exception to the great experiences I have had at Kimpton hotels.  A beautiful historic building (old B&amp;O railraod building) with wonderful white marble everywhere.  The staff here is friendly, helpful, and will go out of their way to assist the guests with their needs.  As with the Kimpton line of hotels, they have a free happy hour (usually between 5-6) in their living room with wine and appetizers, what a lovely plus!  The rooms here are beautiful, tall ceilings and windows (lots of windows!), a granite counter in the bathroom and a beautiful shower with glass door.  The Aveda bath products are a nice benefit, I plan to use the hotel products and don't bring my own like when staying at other hotel lines (saves space in my suitcase!).    Upon checkin, we received a helpful list of local restaurants, bars, etc. where the hotel offers free vouchers, coupons, or rides!  So helpful!The bed and pillows are actually comfortable!!!  There are plenty of spare plugs for your phone and computer charger and each room have an iHome!I definitely recommend staying here, great location (Inner- Bay) that is close to museums, Power Plant Live!, dining, bars, etc.  We got a great deal by booking through Priceline Name Your Own Price, and that just makes me like to hotel more for the great deal we received!I Loved this hotel!Great restaurant, beautiful indoor decor, great rooms, all the Kimpton goodies :-)Minus 1 star because I have been immensely spoiled by other Kimpton's service, and the front staff (bellman, valet) were lacking significantly in this department :-(Nevertheless, I hope to stay here on my next trip to MD!Have been meaning to update my review.  The hotel management contacted me after my bad experience and were very apologetic.  They asked if I give them another chance.  Because of the genuine apology from the hotel,  I decided to give them another chance and my experience was quite nice in every way.  I would definitely go back again.What a great hotel.  A+ service all the way around.  Some of the most professional hotel staff I've seen in a while (from the front desk folks to the valet guys).  The design and decor was beautiful inside and out.  I loved the high ceilings in our room (12-15 ft at least).  It made it feel very spacious and open.Wife and I stayed here as a quick weekend getaway for our 2-year wedding anniversary.  When we arrived to our room, there was champagne on ice and a lovely card from guest services congratulating us on our anniversary.  There was also a cute goldfish the hotel provides for companionship.  Don't worry, they care and feed it themselves. You just enjoy it.We booked the King deluxe room but were given a complimentary upgrade to the Mediterranean room which included a 2-person spa tub...very relaxing and romantic.  We booked a couple of in-room massages, as well.  The animal print bathrobes they have in the rooms were fun and the umbrella in the closet is handy for rainy days.They have complimentary wine in the hotel living room each night from 5-6 and coffee and tea in the mornings.  We didn't take advantage of the wine since we had dinner reservations at the connected B&amp;O restaurant (see my separate review).Great place and would recommend this place in a heart beat to anyone looking for something more than a Best Western or Motel 6.Very dog friendly. Comfortable beds. Nice sized bathrooms. Clean. Very friendly. Got a great price. I've always been impressed with this brand of hotels. I wasn't disappointed this this time either.Cocktails and cookies...for free. Need I say more? Yes, because this place is fabulous. I can't compare to other hotels in Baltimore, because I haven't stayed in any...this was for a splurge for a nearby wedding...but I've stayed in plenty elsewhere and the Hotel Monaco is top notch. -Unique. This place does is not cookie-cutter. The interior is gorgeous. From the lobby and the common areas, you get the feel that you're in jazz-age Baltimore, and you're rich...when actually you can score a fantastic deal on Priceline. -Comfortable. Compared to the historical feel of the rest of the hotel, my room was plush, modern, and big! Fluffy white sheets and towels--check! All the amenities were there and despite the fact that I faced the street, my room was pitch black and dead quiet at night. -Location. You're slightly away from all the tourist traps of the city and Inner Harbor but only a short cab or free circulator ride away from them if you must. -Service. The free cocktail hour and wine tasting and nightly cookies are just the tip of the iceberg. I really got the feel that the people here wanted to go above and beyond for me. When I arrived, I was running extremely late for a wedding and the staff could see that I was harried. They let me skip the whole check-in ordeal and threw me a key. While I ran upstairs to throw on my dress and attempt to do my hair, the woman at the desk WRAPPED MY GIFT. My savior. Seriously. I ran back downstairs after getting dressed and there was a hotel car waiting to take me to my destination stocked with bottled water and mints....and that's how it's done.I booked a room here in order to see Bill Burr last night. Btw he was funny as hell as usual. L0ve that man!The hotel is beautiful and very secure, the rooms are clean, and customer service is top notch. FYI they have a loaner bike that you can use if you want to explore the city on 2 wheels.  Self-park is right around the corner for $20. If I ever need to stay in Baltimore again, this is the place.We stayed at Hotel Monaco for my birthday weekend and it was a great experience.  The rooms are cute, clean and have a great view.  The staff is very helpful and they have a free wine hour included every day between 5-6.  Also, I love the fact that such a nice hotel is pet friendly.  We'd definitely go back or visit another Kipton hotel in another city.  My only complaint is the shower in our room was not designed very well.  There was no door, just a partial wall, so water got everywhere when we showered.  Not a big deal, just a little bit annoying.A stylish hotel with very friendly service. Everyone was so nice and the room was gorgeous. Gf's fave - the leather wallpaper in the bathroom!When booking, the agent asked if this was business or pleasure. It's our 13th anniversary. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a suite and greeted with a bottle of bubbly. Two huge surprises! Also mentioned that we were bringing our furry friend--the website says they are pet friendly but wanted to make sure. The doggie bed and dish were already in our room when we arrived. Everyone was so sweet to the dog; we arrived too late to enjoy Santa Paws, where the staff took pix of the dogs with Santa (which my dog would have never agreed to, but it would have been cute to watch the other dogs). They even provide a little bag with pet treats.  So - check - extremely pet welcoming.Also appreciated that by signing up for the free Kimpton program, you get $10 of free goodies from the mini bar. Which just feels really luxurious b/c I have NEVER eaten anything out of the mini bar. I had some cheese crackers and bottled water while we were waiting for our dinner, but they have everything from Tom's toothpaste to liquor and nuts.Order carefully with the room service. For dinner, we had the chicory salad, fisherman's stew, the farmer's market pizza and the pork osso bucco. The salad needed something to balance the bitterness of the greens (endive, radicchio, chicory). The stew was very good but a tad salty. The shrimp, fish, clams, etc. were all perfectly cooked in a nice broth with a little rice. Be sure to ask for spoons. The pizza- the crust was pretty bad. I think the toppings would have tasted better if it wasn't overcooked. The osso bucco was a huge portion. Gf would not order it again b/c it was just so-so and the accompanying potatoes were undercooked. Lacked the typical red wine sauce. So dinner was pretty meh. A minor gripe - a bread basket with the entree would have been nice.For breakfast, we had the healthy bennie and assorted breads and fruit with coffee and tea. Had to call to have them send up spoons again. Gf loved the healthy bennie, she said it was the right portion and nicely cooked though it looked really small to me. I wanted to try all of the freshly baked breads. Go for the croissant, it was very good and buttery. The muffin was oat something and just meh; the scone was meh as well. Also tried the doughnuts, which were too heavy and smothered in an overpowering red berry sauce. Our fruit cups were honeydrew, strawberries, blueberries, and pineapple -- pretty good, and we both had a small pot of coffee or tea.For parents, if you are trying to bathe a child in the tub, you may have some trouble. It's like 3 feet deep and the taps empty onto the 2 seats. So in order to bathe a child, you would need to sit in the tub with the kid instead of being able to lean over the side.this hotel is so gorgeous. i wish i can take a chunk of it home!! the checkin desk is slow but they get their things done so no complaints there. its just a shame this place is lacking a swimming pool !! when we stopped here it was mega hot !! prob as hot as florida!!i love marble standing showers. the hotel will tell you that only the mediterannean suites have that. theyre wrong!! if you are looking for a king bed, ask for room 1228 with standing marble shower. if you want a tub only then ask for 1229!valet is super pricey (they literally either leave your car on the block where theres a spot or theypark in the underground garage a block away). my advice is to search online for an overnight deal for garage parking... that way you will save loads of money!! i got a corporate rate on this hotel so it made everything so much sweeter. my corporate rate also got me and my guests free breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel! it was a great breakfast!! i went during a busy weekend for baltimiore. it wasn't deserted/dead til night time came. during the daytime, plenty of people out and about. yes, the area a block backwards is questionable with shops boarded up and whatnot but if you are ina small group, i'd recommend sharing a cab everyhwere. also sign up for kimpton intouch program! they give you $10 to raid the mini bar, whcih at checkout you can tell them what you spent it on so they dont charge your room. i believe u also get free wifi when you become a member so thats also a plus!definitely ask for a companion goldfish! why not???!! this hotel has so much charm!! such a shame that the location is not by the water! the hotel is definitely walking distance to the water.. if you tend to speed walk, i'm sure you can make it to the waterfront by 10mins. otherwise i'd say 20mins is a good estimate of the distance.also don't forgo their snack hours! they have morning coffee/tea available in the living room til 10am. cookie hour is 3pm(i missed that !! darn)... and then at 5pm wine reception. free alcohol and there was 1 hors duerve being served. i think smoked salmon crostini! delish!!! ive also heard there is free wii games at night for the kids but didn't get to check that out.baltimore is a city that you can prob stay 1-2 days and be satisfied with some nice activities. its a very low key place and more relaxed.Lovely romantic weekend here this weekend. We came up from DC to fancy things up for a few days. This is a beautifully appointed place, classy, but not too much. Free fresh baked chocolate chip cookies every afternoon, and a free wine hour each evening. I had called ahead to see if they could do anything special for us for the weekend, and they had a complimentary bottle of champagne sent up for us!If you're looking for a nice place to spend the weekend with lots of access to downtown and the harbor, a great friendly atmosphere, and nice rooms, this is your spot.What's there to not like about Hotel Monaco?  Other than the price I guess.  Its gorgeous and worth every penny, if you have that many pennies to spend.  By far the best hotel in Baltimore.  I won't stay here every trip, but when I'm interested in a splurge Monaco is my first choice.this hotel is drop dead gorgeous!  in the old B&amp;O railroad office building, you can feel like you are walking back in time.  they don't make buildings like this anymore.  the rooms were nice and we really enjoyed the social hour from 5-6 in the lounge, free appetizer and free wines.This is a really nice hotel.  I stayed here this year for the first time when I was catching my red sox who were in Baltimore.  I usually find myself commuting from Annapolis, but this time I wanted to be able to get out and do more while I was there.  This hotel was in walking distance to inner harbor, little Italy, and Fed hill, and most importantly the stadiums.  You could not beat the location, and the price.   We stayed Friday and Saturday night.  When we arrived I got offered their free wine hour.  Talk about classy, who offers free alcohol these days.  The rooms are a great size as well.  The room we were in had nice high ceilings, and was decorated eloquently.  The only complaints I could say was lighting.  While the room was gorgeous, the lighting was not so good.  It made it very hard to see in get dressed at times.  The day we checked out, we were to tired to get out of bed, and decided to order room service before we left on Sunday.  The food was pretty good.  I did not try the place downstairs, but will next time when I come back.  If you are staying in the downtown Baltimore area, I recommend checking this place out.  You can't go wrong and the staff was wonderful.  Its a treat in its own.Had a pretty nice one-night stay here for a reasonable price ($135/night with AAA).  The room was clean and comfortable, with a comfy bed and nice high ceilings.  Overall, it was pretty good.  A few minor complaints - there was a sort of weird, ad-hoc sliding door into the bathroom that didn't lock, and honestly I thought the carpet was pretty ugly.  Can't have everything, I guess.  They do have free WiFi, which is a big plus for me (I hate it when hotels are so cheap as to try to take advantage of you that way).The common spaces are very attractive, with a grand old staircase and a nice lobby with comfortable seating and a nice gas fireplace that doesn't pretend to be a wood one.  Because it's a retrofit building, the front desk and lobby are on the second floor, which is a bit odd but only a minor inconvenience.  Still, it's quite nice.  They've also got a nice happy hour with free wine and snacks from 5-6, which was nice.They charge too much for parking - I think it was $35 per night.  You can get parking much cheaper elsewhere.A nice hotel near Inner Harbor for a pretty good price.  I'd stay again.","['shipped', 'work', 'meeting', 'must', 'admit', 'excited', 'mainly', 'know', 'comes', 'serial', 'wire', 'saw', 'affordable', 'property', 'close', 'meeting', 'alas', 'tides',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/renaissance-baltimore-harborplace-hotel-baltimore-3,Renaissance Baltimore Harborplace Hotel,4.0,$$$,120,"Excellent customer service as we asked for a harbor view and I think they upgraded is to some sort of suite??It was a massive room AND came with free breakfast.I don't know how we lucked into this for $124 a night but they were generous with this upgrade!Great views and medium but excellent workout area.The water view restaurant had a delicious brunch with tons of options and omelette and waffle bar.Will definitely consider staying here again!Staying at the Renaissance Harborplace was an indifferent experience for me, having travelled enough and staying in an array of hotels from bottom of the barrel to absolute luxury, I'd comfortably put this hotel right in the middle. I was in Baltimore for a convention at the Baltimore Convention Center. It's only a couple of blocks to the hotel from the convention centre itself, and directly across the street from the Inner Harbor tourist area. If you were staying in a room on the outside of the hotel, great views of the surrounding neighbourhood (and the accompanying city noise)- however my one huge praise is staying on the courtyard (inner) side of the building, inward facing onto a very quiet sun patio so there's no city noise to bother you! The staff were very friendly, and very accurate- providing my room with a couple of requested extras upon checking in. That's about where my list of good things will end. If you end up with a room on the far side of the hotel, away from the elevators, expect a bit of a walk. Internet is rather pricey for a hotel of this calibre (13 or 14 dollars/per day for access). The rooms are nice, but I noticed that the corners of the room and the air conditioning vents apparently lacked a good cleaning in a while, and were quite dusty. The bathrooms were spacious, though dated- and the paint on the ceiling was splitting and peeling over the shower and sink. Now my one major issue I had over the week I stayed, one day I opted to grab a couple bottles of soda from one of the pepsi machines in the ice/vending rooms at one point later in the evening (probably close to 11:30pm/midnight). Both bottles I received from the machine were expired, one by about 9 months and one by about a year- to add as well, neither of the vending machine's buttons selections matched what you received after you paid. I decided to try the vending machines on the floor below, and had the same problem. Product out of date by nearly a year and one of the bottles was leaking and half empty. I called the front desk at this point and let them know what was going on, they sent up room service with fresh product from their kitchen. However upon checkout I had found they had billed me for the bottles they sent to the room despite having paid for 4 out of their in-house vending machines. I had that corrected upon leaving. There are many options in the Inner Harbour to choose from as far as places to stay. This hotel has decent customer service and ""location, location, location"" but not too much else going for it.5 stars here. Not the greatest hotel you will stay in but 5 stars because it hits on all the major points and stands out for 2 major reasons.Location and design of lobby area.The hotel is located in the heart of the inner harbor, right across from the aqaurium and connected to a mall.This lobby was so well designed, hit on every note. Modern sleek furniture, with color schemes and design that are subtle yet pop when you look again.Took tons of pics of the lobby area. It's huge, well spread out. Great to have meetings and just gathering if you with a big group.Service was awesome here from valet to bell service to front desk. Everyone was kind, helpful, just seemed overall to be pleasant.Stayed in a king size room. Everything was nice here. I won't say great but nice. Bed was comfy, it wasnt super loud all over the hotel, you can get your sleep in. I woke up at 2 am and there was a huge commotion outside yet the hotel is so quiet you could not even tell.The price was awesome under 300 a night for king size suite was great.That is a steal, I mean I can't remember when I stayed in a suite for less than 600. One thing I guess i did not like about the hotel is the length. Whoever built the hotel or renovated it just kept making it longer and longer. Feels like to get from the elevators to rooms was a block long walk lol. The service here was phenomenal. From checkin, recommendations, room service, and checkout. Just a plesant experience. So if you are looking for a hotel in the best part of Baltimore I highly recommend this place* Wedding Venue Review Only * The traditional Chinese tea ceremony was understaffed (actually, no staff helped us) in a room that was way too small for the occasion. Maybe nobody in this area of the country has ever heard of it, but the lack of staff for the tea ceremony was jarring. Thank goodness we stepped up to the task to help my cousin during this important ceremony.Other things appear to be overpriced - parking is ridiculous, thank God we were smart enough to park elsewhere. WiFi was not free except within the area of the lobby.Food: extremely salty - the soup was just a ball of salt. The steak was overdone, the fish was better, but still, quite salty. The chocolate dessert cake was great!Service: people were relatively responsive during dinner!Decor: beautiful view.We loved 99% of our stay here.The lobby is gorgeous, with a Starbucks and a connection to a shopping mall.There is an elevated walkway to the Inner Harbor and all of it's attractions. The proximity to the Inner Harbor is a huge plus.Our hotel room was spacious, with great AC, huge television, and a roomy bathroom. The shower worked great- good pressure and temp.The concierge louge was a nice perk, with a terrific breakfast, plus snacks and beverages.  It was a great place to relax.The three buffet breakfasts  for our convention were all very good, a mix of cereal, pastries, pancakes, eggs, egg whites, sausage, turkey bacon, grits, and oatmeal. Not everything every day, but a changing mix.Our convention had 2 sit-down meals here, and this is the only area I had an issue with. The pork tenderloin served at lunch was not very good, it was very hard to cut and tough to eat. This wasn't just my reaction, it was a common complaint among our group.Secondly, we were served the identical dessert twice (a very good cheesecake) - but it's a curious observation since we only had two sit down meals here.But overall , this was a terrific stay.Large Baltimore hotel with a great location in the inner harbor. Modern decor with that traditional Marriott feel. Coffee bar in the lobby and is adjacent to a mall. A good place to stay for events in the area. Comparable prices to other Renaissance properties. Clean rooms with Aveda products in the bathroom.This is by far one of the BEST hotels we ever STAYED in!!!! They offered me a FREE upgrade and a COMPLIMENTARY bottle of wine and a SMALL personal chocolate CAKE!!!! The stay were AWESOME!!!! They did ANY and EVERYTHING necessary to make sure my BOYFRIEND enjoyed his stay on his BIRTHDAY!!!! The hotel is directly across from the harbor so everything was conveniently close!!!! The room was GORGEOUS the VIEW was MAGNIFICENT!!!!Overall good hotel! I am not sure a regular rate as I had special rate with a conference.Wifi works well and everyone is friendly here. Room is specious and quite new. I liked Aveda toiletry. Sunday brunch buffet was great as you can get everything (waffles, fruits, oatmeal, eggs and pastries) including made-to-order omelet with crab meat.  Fruits included not only cantaloups but also plenty of blueberries, blackberries and strawberries. You can also get cappuccino and nice harbor view.Executive lounge was also great as they offer great breakfast (including egg white scrambled eggs, boiled eggs), evening snacks (hot food and salad/cheese snacks) and desserts and non-alcoholic drinks. Wine/alcoholic drinks were offered at small price.One downside is expensive parking but it's all the same in Inner harbor area. Park in the gallery garage attached to the hotel as this is the best deal for overnight stay. Only weekend is a little cheaper when there is no Raven's game. No free street parking either.Great hotel! Close to the harbor. The hotel was beautiful and everyone was so nice! We ordered room service for breakfast. It came when they said it would and the food was really good.Best location if you plan to stay in the inner harbor area. The breakfast buffet has a great view of the harbor.Get a room with the harbor view if you could, I got mine through the free upgrade. Also got my free wifi with my gold member status. It's a great deal.A perfect hotel to explore the Baltimore area.After being on a red eye and not sleeping at all, I was greeted with big, warm smiles. My bags were taken out of my hands and I was escorted to the front desk where my the agent sent some wine to my boyfriend and I for his birthday. We had dinner at water table, the restaurant in the hotel, and it was a lovely view with delicious food. The bed was so comfortable and the room was so homey. It's also a 10/15 minute walk to a whole foods that you can get to by taking a short cut through the inner harbor. There's a wine cellar next door, you can't buy liquor in Baltimore unless you go specifically to a liquor store. I would also recommend going to fells point. Such a lovely little city.Came out to Baltimore on business this week and had a pretty great time staying in the whole time the ""Snocalypse"" was supposed to blow through..I rate hotels on a number of standard items (please see below!):Cleanliness/Service - The hotel was pretty nice and cleanliness was top-notch..especially for a luxury hotel, you would expect it to be nice and clean. Service didn't blow me out of the water though..when I checked in and walking through the hallways, no one was exceptionally nice - they did provide me with a general sense of comfort though.Layout - This is probably my biggest gripe about this hotel. The layout doesn't effing make sense! Its because there is one set of elevators in one corner, and the rooms wrap around a huge (empty) middle square so if you are *lucky* enough to land yourself a room at the far corner from the elevators, such as yours truly, it takes friggin' foreverrrrr to get from one end to the other. This clearly was not thought out... *shakes head*Lounge - The concierge lounge was pretty spacious..definitely props for having full size bottles of water. Marriott chains usually have those small bottles of water that you have to take 2-3 of..so definitely liked that. Breakfast in the morning was exactly the same for the 2 nights I was here, dinner/desserts were different. The food was good..the cake was really good for dessert. lol..of course, i would like the cake though..Fitness Center - Really impressed with the fitness center. It's not HUGE, but it is well equipped enough to accommodate the morning workout crowd! LOTS of treadmills..and it now faces a Shake Shack...which is kind of cruel. *sad face*..Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Renaissance Hotel and it is a really nice, clean hotel. Next to a Starbucks and only 20 min from BWI airport in downtown.As a side note, that the common areas here are COLD in the winter..including the conference rooms..so bundle up if you are just here for a meeting/conference/luncheon.I have stayed here twice.  Once in a normal room and most recently in a very large corner suite, all windows.  Dining table for 6.  VERY LARGE bathroom.  Comfortable beds, as all Marriott's.  Striking view of the harbor and the tall ships.  We were pleasantly surprised by the brunch price on Sunday, $19.99.  The selection was awesome, fresh, even fruit smoothies and a made to order omelet station.  Parking right underneath the building.  Only issue with the all windows room in August was the AC couldn't keep up and the room was a tad warm, but we were leaving for a day and night on the town anyways.Great location, great hotel.  Front desk staff and bellmen are just fantastic!  Anticipating your needs well before you even know you need something.  If you are coming to the harbor area of Baltimore, this is the place to stay.Awesome hotel for a 2 night stay right after New years eve. I think this was the quiet season since the prices were amazing! I reserved a King room for $99/night and ended up with a sweet upgrade to King corner suite with a view of the harbor. The room was huge! There was a dining room table and large seating area with couch and chairs and coffee table.  This was perfect for having a few friends who live in Baltimore area hang out with us in the room.  This is a very kid friendly hotel.  Attendants were welcoming to my 20 month old toddler and the bellhop brought out a wagon of plush animals for her to pick from when we arrived. I requested a pack and play for our room which also included a johnson&amp; johnson baby anenities kit for our daughter. These little touches definitely add a lot to our overall experience of a hotel. I signed up for loyalty membership just before booking and it certainly helped! We even got access to the club lounge which offered a good continental breakfast that included HOT eggs. The attendants were very cheerful and accommodating. There was a very nice selection of food esp considering it was complimentary!  And they even had high chairs. Most exec lounges are adults only so i was really happy we were able to bring our toddler and eat together. The hotel is connected to the galleria mall which made it convenient for shopping and has food court. It's right across the street from tourist attractions and close to the Aquariam and the Port of Discover which was on our itinerary for our trip.They also have a nice size indoor pool and jacuzzi which we took advantage of in the late afternoon after we got tired of walking around.My one negative was the bed was not totally comfortable.  I couldn't figure out why there were so many layers of flat sheets and there was a crinkly noisy plastic somewhere buried under the layers which might have been a waterproof sheet since we were with a toddler. Overall really great service and quality hotel.I stayed at the Renaissance for two nights while attending a business conference. The staff was very pleasant, and the room had all of the standard amenities typical of a hotel in that area in that price range. What I found notable is the fantastic location, the mall that is attached to the hotel, and (surprisingly) the food.The Renaissance is located directly across the street from the harbor (as the name suggests), and a block or two from the baseball stadium. It's also in walking distance of the national aquarium, African American history museum, restaurants, a movie theater, and I'm sure many other attractions; however I can only speak to what I was able to cram in between conference sessions. The mall seems more than adequate, but I was never able to make it past the main floor which has stores that I frequent (if only to window shop). I say that the food was 'surprisingly' good because in my experience - even at expensive hotels - hotel food can often be just ""good enough"" or unremarkable at best. The roasted skin-on bone-in quarter chicken with vegetables was anything but dry or devoid of taste, as was the filet of fish served with a lemon butter cream sauce on a bed of orzo. Given there are several comparable restaurants within walking distance to include McCormick and Schmick, even if my meal expenses were not covered, I would have no problem indulging in the luxury of convenience and dining in the hotel restaurant or ordering room service rather than hitting the streets for similar American fare.Terrible! STAY AWAY!!! That is my one word sum up. $30 for parking! What an outrage. Even the lot across the street is $10 all day. $13 for Internet access! News flash, most places, including the park down the street from this hotel, have free internet. And now for the details of the room: dirty, outdated, health hazard, dangerous, disgusting. In short think ""a pig wearing lipstick"". And at a total base room with no extra room service charges, just room and tax and parking, of $306.05 it's a complete rip off. Please take the time to look at all my photos. In particular the one that shows a sharp nail, from what looks like carpet tack strip, sticking out of floor that all four members of my family had stuck in our foot!!!Great, convenient location in the Inner Harbor with nicely furnished rooms and well-appointed common areas. However, the layout of the hotel leaves something to be desired. There's only one bank of elevators, so if you have the misfortune of being placed in a room away from them (as I did), you better be prepared for a haul to get to your room. My main issue with this hotel is that they charge for wifi. At a hotel of this caliber and price point, charging for wifi is ridiculous. Even low-end lodging establishments offer free wifi.We stayed for one night over Easter weekend; there's really nothing remarkable to say about it.  The staff was as courteous as you'd expect at a hotel; the concierge greeted us and the bellhops courteously opened doors.The elevator traffic was a mess; we think this was because all the elevators, including one of the only ones to the parking garage, were all in one little hallway.  This caused traffic jams and sometimes people were so desperate to get in an elevator that they wouldn't let you out.Be sure to take the hotel up on their parking offer - the $30 they will charge you is better than the $52 we ended up paying for parking about 24 hours.We paid about $200 for a Saturday night (all taxes and fees included).  The room was clean, no extras or anything special.  There seemed to be a wifi fee so we didn't use it.  We declined the extra $50 for a 'harbor view' and got the 'city view' with another building in front of us and an alley below.  The walls were paper thin inside the room and out - I could hear people sneeze in their rooms while walking down the hallway.  My husband remarked that the pillows were 'the little crappy ones'.We had enough to do that we didn't spend much time in there anyway.Beautiful place! I attended a couple of events here and both were fantastic. Not sure if the food and drinks was catered by the hotel itself but it was great. Music and dance were a lot of fun.","Not a bad deal at $70 on Priceline. Cha Ching! This is located directly across from the Harbor (hello Phillips!) and has a self park garage that is $12 less expensive than valet. Hotel is one of the nicer places I have stayed while in Baltimore for Baseball or visiting the Aquarium. It is walking distance to Camden Yards and the convention center. They have free fruit infused water for your hangover. There is a Starbucks inside the hotel. The room was very spacious and larger than some of my friends manhattan apartments. The bed was just the right level of firmness. Cons: elevators are confusing. There are two sets and one takes you to the parking garage the others take you to the rooms. They are not clearly marked. -valets wouldn't let me leave my car to check in/use the bathroom. I am not going to state what I did, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do. -parking garage is confusing to navigate. Great hotel. Would stay again.I stayed here twice in the last month this a great hotel and close to almost everything you need.I would recommend this place to anybody and great service.I can only summarize my experience in two words: Excellent Service. I left my phone and my watch during my recent stay, I called the hotel immediately after realizing my mistake and was provided with the most understanding and professional help in getting my items back.  I travel for work a lot and I have left behind countless of items, from flat irons to valuable pieces of clothing, this is the first time where the hotel employees have taken the time and care to return my items. I am so grateful for their support and service.  We received the expected greetings at the door, easy professional check-in, nice clean rooms, helpful staff and service, but their actions in returning my forgotten items was beyond what i have ever experienced.  The views from the higher floors are very beautiful too.This was a very ""swank"" hotel....i guess that's a good term for it. Even though there was a huge conference going on it wasn't as loud as you would expect it to be in the halls.This was next door to their galleria and a plethora of shops and restaurants, (and of course Cheesecake Factory for the to-go order of Crispy Chicken Costoletta.)We had a private bar on the 12th (can't remember the exact floor) and we had a blast. The service was top notch, and they even stayed open another hour and a half just for our group.Hats off to this Renaissance. I will definitely be coming back to this location if I'm ever in Baltimore again.The stay was pleasant until I was selectively asked for a room key inorder to enter the building. I say selective cause they were only asking people of color. Mind you I am in town for an engineering confrence were most companies are paying $300+ per night.  If you want to room key someone how about the pissy drunk white sailors infront of me. not the engineers of color who just came back from dinner and light drinks.I normally don't write reviews in this format, but there are so many good/bad things about this hotel.We stayed 05/24 - 05/25/15, king size room, 7th floor, harbor/city view.PROS:Location is super close to the inner harbor, downtown, sound stage, and ram's head live.Great view of the harbor from our room.They allowed us to check in 5 hours early, for a $20 ""upgrade fee"".Parking ramp under hotel, and elevators that go right into hotel. Huge TV. Room was big, bathroom was nice, bed was comfortable.CONS:Sheets didn't fit, I had to keep re-making the bed.NO microwaveNO free wifiI tried to go to sleep around 10:30, but there was loud dance music playing, it rattled the ac vent on the wall. I guess I didn't hear it as much when the TV was on. Around 11:30, I called the front desk, and asked how late the music was going to play (i thought it was a night club). I was informed that it was a wedding in the ballroom on the 5th floor (I was on the 7th), and it would end at 12. At 12:30, frustrated, I called back and spoke with Patrice. She told me that the wedding was paid for until 1:30am, and they could have the music on until then. I asked to be moved to another room away from the music, but she said they were all booked. I fell asleep around 1:40 after the music stopped. I had to wake up at 7am to start my 10 hour drive home, and just as we were leaving a note came under the door apologizing for the inconvenience, and offering us a free breakfast. But like I said, we had to start our journey home. I drove home tired from the night before. Based on that I will not stay here again. A free breakfast was a nice gesture, but I really needed a good nights sleep.My Sweetie's Office Holiday Party was in January, after everyone returned from their lavish holiday vacations and the kids were back in school. It's held at the Baltimore Renaissance Harborplace hotel. We made a getaway weekend of it. Check-in was smooth. The valets and bellmen were very nice and helpful. The reception area and lobby are lovely. Not over the top gorgeous. But understated elegance. Hot or cold beverages are available as well as an apple.The room had a partial harbor view even though he is Marriott Rewards Silver Elite and requested harbor view months in advance. Oh well. It's not like we were just standing there at the window looking out of it all the time. We were busy so being able to see the harbor in the AM or harbor lights in the PM was very nice. Very nice.The bed. O~~~M~~~G!!! Can it be anymore comfy shmumfy? (That is for you Corbo E.) (LOL!) The sheets were like a billion threads per inch and there is some kind of magical comforter atop the whole setup that warms you to perfection then stops so you don't wake up in the hotel hell sweat box thing. I love that bed!We took advantage of many hotel amenities such as the bar, the fitness center (very well equipped, mind you), and room service. All of these amenities are great. Oh, by the way, even though there are plenty of cups and plenty of water in the fitness center, don't drink too much of it: there is no separate fitness center bathroom. U have 2go back2 your room 2p. Do get the room service breakfast though! 1 egg/meat dish plus one bready/sweet dish will be more than enough for two people. We ordered the two egg breakfast: two eggs, three bacon, three sausage with two pieces of toast and hash browns. Amazing. And complimented it with the french toast with fresh berries, butter, and fresh maple syrup. Toss in a pot of fresh hot coffee and get your ported in bottle of prosecco out of the complimentary fridge and pour it in the champagne glasses you had sent up with the brekky and you're good! Other than that, I'm a fan of this hotel! I hope to come back again! [Original visit January 24, 25, 26, 2014.]Renaissance Harborplace Hotel - Inner Harbor, Baltimore, MD<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marriott.com%2Fhotels%2Ftravel%2Fbwish-renaissance-baltimore-harborplace-hotel%2F&amp;s=36b4089edef9d85cd2c238a38a9432f80040e8214c2c2ddf7bfbfc708a7c8cfe"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">marriott.com/hotels/trav...</a> Marriott owned hotel and conference center centrally located in the Inner Harbor.  In my opinion this is the best centrally located hotel for a variety of eating, drinking, entertainment.  Constantly filled with business, conference travelers, and of course, tourists.   Recently renovated.  Indoor pool, gym, laundry facilities on the 7th or 8th floor.  The rooms have a great view of the harbor, but they might charge you for it.  Lamps with outlets at their base, alarm clocks compatible with iphone 4 or less.  You'll need an adapter to charge your iPhone 5.  Toiletry brand - Aveda.  Shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bar soap, shower cap standard.I enjoy staying here due to the nice furnishings, staff, and convenient location.On site restaurant, the water table also has approachable meals/bar specials with a great view of the harbor.  Starbucks in lobby. Taxi stand located on Pratt Street and are also available on South Street side. If you are checking in, come through South street entrance.5th floor escalators go down to the attached Galleria Mall but you cannot come back up them.  Enter the hotel using the 3 street level entrances: Mall, Pratt Street, or South Street.Tip - there is a club lounge on top floor for Elite Rewards members.  Free appetizers and breakfast. Alcohol available for purchase. Appetizers:  2 hot dishes and a salad with ranch or balsamic dressing. Breakfast:  Scrambled eggs, 2 types of bacon.  Various carbs: bagel, toast, muffins, pastries.  Fruit.  Orange juice, milk, coffee, tea.  Dessert bar: a few cakes, cookies, brownies locally baked.  Don't forget to tip the servers!I love the contemporary feel of the common areas of this hotel but the rooms (at least my room) leaves something's to be desired. Upon literally walking into my room (which smelled faintly of smoke) I was greeted by room service with a 6 pack of craft brews and 6 waters -- that I did not order. After trying to dismiss the mistake, I was assured that it was for me. I thought this was a hospitality effort by the hotel because I am part of a large conference but after my first night I have decided that it's because I am right by a heavy utilized stairwell. I'll have to confer with colleagues to see if this the case. The fitness center is well equipped although it lacks anything so that you can clean up after yourself when you are done using the equipment.  If you want to be in the thick of the tourist scene, then this is a great location.We loved our 1 night stay! We visited the pool and Jacuzzi and it was nice, and the room was awesome :-) the bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Everyone was very nice too.Beautiful hotel in a great part of the inner harbor.  Came here for a special event  and free happy hour with my wife. We were totally surprise when we walked through the door and seen the layout of different foods from oysters to meatballs and free beer tasting.  Including a wide variety of pastries.We left this event impressed and stuffed. The service from the employees we had contact with including the different catering companies was knowledgable about the different foods and drinks they served at this event.One day soon me and my wife will come here for a overnight stay and enjoy the room and outstanding view of the Inner Harber. This hotel obviously has an eye for a beautiful hotel.  I think we deserve the best from time to time.Ate at Hotel restaurant for breakfast.My husband and I stayed here for a getaway night, and I mistakenly left my jacket behind in my room. I was pretty upset because it was one of my favorites, and I called to have security check for me. After two failed attempts, I spoke to a wonderful woman named Antornette Owens, Safety &amp; Security Supervisor, who promptly found my jacket and even overnighted it to me! I was so pleased and grateful for her kindness and professionalism that we will definitely be returning. Thank you so much. :)This place is absolutely beautiful!  The a staff at check-in was friendly and efficient. The room is absolutely gorgeous! The hotel is marked by refined sophistication. I hope the experience continues this way.NEVER staying at this hotel again! Came to this hotel for a convention because all of the other hotels in the area were either $400+ a night or completely sold out. I made a reservation for a room with 2 queen beds and when I arrived at the hotel I was told there were only rooms left with 1 king bed. They offered us a room with ""1 king bed and a pull-out couch"". When we got to the room, the ""king bed"" was smaller than the sofa bed. This was the first hiccup, but we were exhausted after traveling to Baltimore, so we decided to deal with it.Second problem, the hotel tried to charge us the full amount of the room AT CHECK-IN plus $50 a day for ""incidentals"". This policy and fee ARE NOT LISTED ON THEIR WEBSITE!! They may have done this because of the convention weekend, but I talked to other people staying at the hotel who said they were not charged like this and had no fees. I had called and spoke to the hotel several times before arriving asking them to explain the checkout process. I was told we would pay at checkout and may be charged a fee ONLY if we used a debit card. Maybe they have had bad experiences with con-goers destroying rooms or skipping bills, but we're still hotel GUESTS.Lastly, the hotel doormen and security were extremely rude and disrespectful to anyone staying for the convention. At 11pm they locked the main entrance to the hotel and WOULD NOT let people in without showing their room keys. Many of the events at the convention center run late and this was a huge inconvenience. Also, while inside the hotel lobby guards blocked entrances to the restrooms and demanded to see room keys. EDIT: Need to explain this better- we were told the initial charges were holds on our account and would be taken off at checkout and then we would be able to decide our final payment method. This DID NOT happen. On Sunday morning everyone staying for the convention was given a bill under the door stating that all pending charges had been processed. There were security and staff waiting in the hotel lobby outside each elevator to collect room keys for ""express checkout"". It was obvious they REALLY wanted us con-goers to leave, haha.TL;DR:Pros: + Location close to harbor and convention center+ Connected to The Gallery mallCons:- Disrespectful staff harassing con-goers- Unexplained fees- Hotel locked up at 11pmThis is NOT a convention friendly hotel! They do not offer any room rates for the convention and in general seemed like they were not happy to have us. This is a Holiday Inn trying to pass off as a 5 star luxury resort that's too good to host all these crazy people in costumes. (At least Holiday Inn gives you free WIFI.)My family of 4 stayed here as a stopover after our overseas trip. The hotel is very close to the airport and has a complimentary shuttle. This is a very attractive hotel and includes a valet, concierge, etc. The rooms are modern and the beds are VERY comfy. There is a also a hot tub and pool with comfy chairs and chaise lounges. I didn't use the fitness room but it had way more than the usual hotel, including free weights. My hotel package included a breakfast buffet. The buffet was delicious and included fresh fruit, pastries, real bacon and omelets/eggs cooked to order. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I would absolutely stay here again.Bed was a little soft for me, but that is a personal preference thing.  Other than that, the room was large, the service was very friendly, and the location was fantastic.  If you park in the garage below, they will validate your ticket and stamp it with something that allows you to go in and out of the garage without having to re-pay or take another ticket - if that makes sense.  We liked that!We chose this place partially because it had a pool, but never ended up making it there.  Whoops!  But that was a positive.  We got a pretty good deal here through priceline over Valentine's weekend so are pretty happy.  Regular price I would say the place is overpriced but if you can find a deal I think its a great place to stay and would definitely recommend!  Minus one star because they charge sky high prices for Wifi and were trying to sell a $4.50 average-size bottle of water on the countertop.  Asses!Nice hotel. Perfect location. Just disappointed with concierge who recommended the perfect restaurant but said we didn't need reservations. We waited for an hour. I would stay here again!!!!I had a great experience with this hotel. Then staff was super friendly and helpful. I was here for a conference at the convention center and enjoyed my time. The only thing I would say is that it's kind of a walk to get to the convention center and some of the other  hotels like Hilton (attached to the center) and Marriott are closer. This hotel is closer to the harbor and has a mall attached to it which is fun. There's a Starbucks in the lobby and plenty of space to lounge. The room was large and spacious. I liked the bathroom amenities. It also sounds like they have a 24h gym. They also had a pool and jacuzzi which I wish I had checked out.There is plenty of eateries around the area and all walkable. It was also the cheapest hotel in the area out of the hotels the conference recommended!We stayed here for one night and found it to be thoroughly ... okay.Our king-bed room was nice, though its fifth-floor location meant our windows looked directly onto a odd internal courtyard that seemed to be largely a waste of space. If anyone had actually been taking advantage of the lounge chairs out there, they could have knocked on our window and said hi. But, in any event, the room was large, with comfortable furnishings. The common spaces in the hotel are pretty nice as well. They've clearly tried to W-ify the hotel, with cool blue lighting and hip-hop music. Not necessarily my style, and it seems somewhat affected. But it's not a dump.We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, and it was quite good, with a good buffet spread and friendly waffle-and-omelet makers.My beefs are:1. The elevator situation is atrocious. Apparently, one of the four elevators was out of service for ""renovation."" The remaining three elevators were woefully inadequate to move sufficient numbers of people. We had to let many elevators pass because they were too full.  Ultimately, the only way to get down from the fifth floor was to get on an up elevator (which would already be pretty crowded) and ride it up then down again. Indeed, the situation was so bad that it's hard to believe a fourth elevator would have solved the problem.2. Look, internet access is a utility now. You don't make me pay for my water and electricity when I stay in your hotel, so don't make me pay for my internet access. Even places that make you pay for wireless usually give you a free wired option. Not so here. Very bothersome and not consistent with the ""cool,"" modern vibe they're striving for. Were this place $100 cheaper, these things might not bother me as much. But it's not a cheap hotel, and customers shouldn't have to put up with frustrations like this.","Was able to book a room at a great price via Priceline!  The hotel room was nice and the normally exorbitant prices may be for the view.  We had a fabulous view of the harbor.  We did request a crib upon check-in and it was being brought to our room as we were walking towards the nice guest assistant lady.We ordered room service and the NY strip and glass of blush Moscato w asparagus and mashed potatoes hit the spot.  I even snagged some of the delicious fries from our sons' grilled cheese plates.We ordered room service for breakfast and there was nothing out of the ordinary good about it, but it was not totally bad.Just wish there was more information about what amenities were available at the hotel and nearby and had to call for a room service menu since it was not there.Self parking was ridiculously price, but considering it was inner harbor....we get it!  I was stoked to wander into the attached shopping mall directly adjacent to the hotel and hit up Godiva for my free chocolate for the month.  I would have wandered into Coach13.95 for slow internet. 16.95 for ""fast"" internet. No free breakfast, 10 'cheap' pancakes. IF you went to the business center for internet? 40cents a minute... Welcome back to 1990 and the AOL Highway Robbery express train to empty wallets.For the price of undiscounted rooms, you'd expect something free. Not so here, where the business model is: if you can afford a $230/night room, you can afford 20 dollars a night for internet.  Rooms nicely appointed, yet showing their age. Room doors shut loudly, so that at 4am when guests return it jolts you awake. Staff: 4.5 stars. Totally attentive (to all but preset prices on internet and breakfast and parking) and very polite...Parking: 2.5 stars, convenient but pricey (no surprise)View: 3 starsBilling. Minus 100 stars. The bill that was signed, and the amount billed on the credit card differ by over $150 AND there is a phantom charge of $13. No beuno, and no es frio. Not cool.Remodeled hotel. Rooms can still use improvements doors are cheaply made. Bar on 5th floor is nice and staff is very helpful.Having attended a conference here, I was able to discover the amenities of this conference center. I did not stay at the hotel, but rather spent 3 days in conference rooms and in public spaces. My favorite aspect of the center was the coffee shop on the ground floor and the bar areas. They were a great respite from the conference itself, which had us packed in to the point we could barely move. The World Cup was going on and there was ample seating and televisions screens to watch Germany vs. United States. I had never considered lounge spaces as an important part of conferences, but the Renaissance did a great job of considering the needs of attendees who may need some space.The room was fine, the staff was great. I booked the room for 4 days for a convention. The convention is huge so I reserved the room with my personal card while my company arranged payment. The lady in the Marriott's reservations office assured me that my personal card wouldn't be charged once they received the third party authorization form from my company. Our executive assistant filled out the form and sent it right away. I called the front desk to confirm that they received it. They said they did. I also have the fax receipt. I get there and day 3 of my 4 day stay I noticed that the entire room bill had been charged to my card. My bank account was in shambles. The hotel said they never received the 3rd party authorization form which just pissed me off. I also asked when I checked in, the front desk said it was paid for and that I would be responsible for incidentals as stated on THE THIRD PARTY AUTHORIZATION FORM. They eventually switched the payment to the correct card but now my account is in the negative until this is all sorted out. I have $150 on overdraft fees bc I have bills in auto draft. I couldn't unschedule them in time. Thank God I have funds to live off of but what if I didn't? Pay day isn't until next week. The customer service person filed a grievance today but I won't have a response for 3-5 business days. It's Thursday. I feel like they're not empathetic at all. A friend who travels for business told me that this used to happen to her all of the time. I am most shocked that the hotel office refuses to take responsibility and insists that they didn't receive it, essentially calling me a liar. Why would I lie? I'm so frustrated with the whole situation and the lack of urgency that to resolve this.The Renaissance is an upscale hotel. The rooms I saw were large and tastefully decorated with plenty of polished stone. The location is great-- across the street from Baltimore's Inner Harbor, 2 blocks from the convention center, and less than 1/2 mile from the ballparks. There's a shopping mall on the lower floors. The hotel was pleasantly quiet during my 3 day stay, but the presence of a uniformed police officer plus 1-2 house security staff in the lobby throughout my stay left me wondering how safe the neighborhood really is. The rates here seem to run a little high compared to similar hotels in the area.Very average hotel.  2.5 stars.  This is an old hotel that has undergone a remodel or two.  The rooms are nothing special.  Old carpets and doors, popcorn ceiling, unspectacular view in most of the rooms.  Nice beds though, nice mahogany headboards...can't complain.  Room service menu - unimaginative and overpriced (31 bucks for soup and sandwich?  I think not.)  I stayed there for a work conference.  Conference facilities were nice.  Easy access to shopping center (adjacent to hotel) and a number of inexpensive restaurants. Good convenience store on main level, next to Starbucks.  Very close to the harbor so you can take a nice walk.  Internet was horrible.  You had two options, the $12/day one or the $15/day one.  They were both equally slow and kicked me off multiple times...reminded me of the old AOL days.  The door key situation was not good either.  I think the system in the hotel was a prototype one of the first magnetic ones ever installed.  I had to swipe my card across the magnet over and over and over before I could get into the room.  It didn't help that there was a marathon going on in the morning, on my last day/morning there.  The streets were all closed off and I started to panic because I didn't know how my cab was going to get to the hotel!   Fiasco was caused when a room full of partiers were thrown out by security in the middle of the night, and one of the angry evictees pulled the fire alarm, causing evacuation of most of the hotel.  The elevators are under lockdown whenever fire alarm is pulled so everyone is forced to walk down the stairs.  Extremely unpleasant.  I don't think that made a difference necessarily, in my opinion of the hotel, but it didn't help.  With the fairly high rates they charge, it is surprising that this hotel seems more geared toward partiers/tourists and not professional folks like myself.I have passed through the mall which is connected to the hotel but I've never stayed in this hotel before.I was here for a conference for work and the experience was wonderful.The staff were wonderful and always got me my starbucks in the morning (that is a plus)The comp. breakfast sandwiches were good as well.The crabcake horderves were bomb!The rooms were clean and had everything I needed to have a comfortable stay.I had a little episode where I needed a band-aid and they sent like 2 people to come down and check to see if I was ok.I was a little embarrassed but oh well!Great place to hold a conference.We had such a great experience at the Renaissance that it'll probably be our go-to hotel when we're in Baltimore from now on.Every member of the staff that we met was super nice, helpful, and simply fun to chat with. The rooms were large, clean, and modern, AND in a city with so many one way streets, it's nice that there's a two-way street outside of the front of the hotel. That may seem like a strange positive, but having stayed at numerous hotels in the city, it really saves you the hassle of driving in an extra circle to enter or leave the hotel.The parking costs are reasonable for in/out privileges, and the hotel is attached to the Gallery and also has a solid restaurant &amp; bar, so you can shop a decent selection of stores and grab some pretty good food if the weather isn't great outside.All that on top of the fact that you're across the street from the Inner Harbor, so it's a great central location if you're in town to explore!For Valentines weekend, I decided I wanted to get away from my home without being too far away. As a Baltimore native, I never thought to stay at a hotel here. I choose the Renaissance because it is a Marriott property and I wanted some bonus points (lol). This hotel is lovely. Very clean, I like the layout and decor. Our view from the 10th floor was decent. The beds were comfy and room size is great. I love the Aveda products in the bathroom. This hotel has a convenience shop located near the lobby and the Galley is just a few feet away. Breakfast in the hotel's restaurant was great also. For $18, we ate buffet style with waffles and omelets.  We order room service late on Saturday and it arrived pretty fast and hot. The gym is also nice. Check in and check out was painless and parking is convenient. My only complaint was the noise level outside but that something that cannot be control by the hotelI would stay here again.This rating is really based on what I expect out of Renaissance more than anything else. The suite size was quite large and the rooms were nice and comfortable. The location was also really great in the inner harbour area. I was expecting more on the service front based on how much they were charging. For example, I asked for mouth wash and tooth brush that was never delivered even though someone checked in on me after 30 minutes to see if it was delivered. They were charging $54 for valet parking even though parking in Baltimore really isn't very expensive. So I felt ripped off by that.Such a nice hotel, and such exceptional service to boot.  I will say that this hotel is ginormous and it can be quite easy to get lost, or take the long way to your room, but for the most part, everything about our experience here was top notch.Clean rooms that were very large, friendly and attentive staff,  updated and modern interior and a convenient location make this one of our top choices for a hotel in the Inner Harbor area.  I would highly recommend staying here and visiting the restaurant and bar here too.Of course it's a nice hotel, since I live close I've never had a reason to stay in the hotel but I've been here for happy hour and it's a perfect go to bar if you need to work to meet with somebody. There's big windows to see the harbor so you can see everything going on, theres also TV's for people to watch a game. They have a wide variety of seating with seats at the bar, tall bar tables behind the bar, comfy couches/chairs, and another big table. I'm sure people over look it because it's a hotel but If you're in the area around happy hour or want to catch a game on TV I'd suggest to stop by this place.Stayed here a night, got a great deal on the room, and had a  great experience--beds were comfortable, room was quiet, clean and spacious, and staff were extremely polite and friendly. We arrived early for check-in by a few hours (arrived at 11:00 AM) but our room was ready and everyone was extremely pleasant.  In the afternoon, they had surprisingly good rum punch and iced tea at the front desk for free.  The gym has nice, updated equipment, and there is a pool.  The hotel is in walking distance to the stadiums and harbor, and directly connected to a mall that has a bunch of standard mall stores in case you forgot something.I didn't stay here, just walked through the lobby.  As you would expect from all Renaissance hotels, it is a nice place.  Location is perfect if you are visiting Baltimore.  Right across the street from the Inner Harbor, restaurants nearby, attached to the Gallery, a nice shopping mall.  Not walking distance to the sports stadiums that the Baltimore Orioles and Ravens play, but pretty close.  Also close to the convention center.  Down the street, but again driving distances are Little Italy and Fells Point.  If you are visiting here, this seems to be the place to stay, if you can afford it.In town for a conference and requested a room away from the elevator. Snagged a corner room so far from the elevator, it takes me about 4 minutes to walk to the elevator (first day, was lost trying to locate the elevator!).Other than that, my room was large, quiet and clean. The rooms do not provide robes so call the front desk to request for one.The indoor heated pool (depth up to 7 feet) and the jacuzzi are open until 10pm and has a lifeguard on duty.  During our working lunches, the crab cake and the rum chocolate balls were my favorite.In consideration of the cooler season, complimentary hot cocoa is served in the lobby. Danielle at the front desk was extremely helpful troubleshooting technical issues with the printer, which was the perfect opportunity to enjoy a cup of hot cocoa.I haven't arrived for my stay yet, but I wanted to have my hair done when I arrive in a few weeks and it states there is a Beauty Salon on their website.  I called and the woman said they don't have one.  I recommended she tell the person that manages their website, to delete it. I explained where it was located, then I asked for her name.  She stated, "" Oh, we don't give out our names due to security reasons"".  I've never been to a hotel and spoken to an employee at a hotel that does not give out their first name.  I suspect she didn't want to be responsible for following up to delete misinformation on their website. I hope my stay won't be as disappointing as my initial experience with this hotel.  I usually enjoy my stays at the Renaissance's.Really comfortable beds!  I've stayed in hotels all over and this was one of my favorites because I fell asleep like a baby.  Food was great - short ribs were my favorite thing on the whole menu.  Tender and very flavorful. Service is great - people are very friendly and willing to help.The Gallery is connected to the hotel for easy shopping.Parking is a little steep - $28 for hotel guests and $40 for non.Overall really good experience and would be interested in staying there again!This is a somewhat atypical review in that while I never got the oppty to stay here, I had reservations that I had made a long time ago and had a miscommunication (def more my fault though) and forgot to cancel before i was supposed to arrive.  this hotel was very understanding and gracious and credited me back my one day room charge.  this decision was made specifically by the renaissance baltimore, and was much appreciated and as an avid traveler something that they, clearly, did NOT have to do.  thank you renaissance baltimore.  i will def. be rebooking there next time my travels take me to baltimore.We had to be in Baltimore early Sat AM so we stayed one night in a local hotel.  Knowing you have to be near the Inner Harbor to avoid scary areas in Baltimore, we chose only from those very close to downtown.  Of them, I was looking for value.  It was one night.  There were a lot of selections in the $125-150 for a standard room.  So I chose this place because they had queen beds instead of double.  (Pay attention competitors - QUEEN INSTEAD OF DOUBLE, it makes a difference.)It was easy to find, and easy to park.  The lobby is beautiful... quite fancy in fact.  It's attached to a mall that is attached to a catwalk over Pratt so it's super easy to get to the waterfront.  Great location, esp convenient to the Aquarium where we were headed the next morning.  We did not check out the pool or restaurants or other ammenities.  I did not realize that parking was an extra $28 a day (valet is $40, and a ""day"" is 30 hours exactly).  YUK.  I guess a lot of people come straight from the airport in a taxi or something.  In hindsight I wonder if the other hotels for the same price included parking.  Maybe this one (at $149) wasn't the value it appeared to be.  I don't honestly know, but I will be sure to check next time.The room was very comfortable, especially compared to the hotel we were in last weekend (not comparable, not a touristy area, etc.).  I think it was the SPACE.  For a standard room it was roomy.It did not have a fridge or microwave or even a coffee maker.  I found that suprising for this level of hotel.  We did order room service breakfast.  The pancakes looked beautiful but were not fluffy tasting, kind of rubbery... my guess is they were reheated.  The fruit plate was YUM.. not the oranges (which I had to spit out ) but the other stuff.  The muffins were fine, but not inline with the expectations I had (they looked like the cheap Raga muffin mix I sometimes make at home, but not quite as tasty).  My son said the fruit loops were just fine (wink).  It was EXPENSIVE, and when the gal who brought it up asked me to sign and I commented... ""oh gosh, I can't do math this early... how much should the tip be?"" was when she said ""Gratuity is included"".  Hmm.. she was gonna let me tip on top of the tip.  Not sure how I feel about that.Check in and out was easy... I guess... we just left our keys in the room.  Do people still ""check out"" these days?Bottom line:  I'd stay again, but would double check the pricing, and I'd bring instant coffee and skip the room service breakfast.","I got a BEAUTIFUL harborview room on the 12th floor using my Marriott rewards points. I'm a Platinum Elite member so the entire experience was quite cushiony! I got the room for a two night getaway for my boyfriend and I and the hotel was right in the middle of everything that we planned on doing that weekend. Parking was probably the biggest expense that entire weekend. It was $28 for overnight parking and the lot wasn't solely for hotel guests. However, it's steps from the harbor, the aquarium, and a slew of good seafood restaurants (which I really miss since temporarily moving to the mid-west). It's also really close to the Powerplant district which is home to some good bars and lounges to hop around if you're looking for something to do after hours. The hotel treated us to a free movie that could be ordered on the room tv so we didn't mind staying in the first night after dinner and wine. We ordered breakfast the next morning and although we forgot to place our order the night before (as the hotel requests) they still took our order and promised to deliver in less than 30 mins, which they did. The breakfast was absolutely lovely and delicious! The attendant who brought up our food offered to pour our hot chocolate (we aren't coffee drinkers) and uncovered our plates so we were set to dine as soon as he left. The view from the room was absolutely stunning and the staff was wonderful! Love this hotel and would recommend it to anyone!This is a great hotel, in a fun location on the harbor. Rooms were clean and comfortable. The restaurant was pleasant and food was fine. Prices were fair. I would choose this hotel again if I could do it over again.Beautiful hotel in a great part of the inner harbor. I was very impressed with the service from the employees we had contact with. The front desk was knowledgable about the area and the  bell hop fellows were are nice as could be.We found our room to be impressive with an outstanding view. This hotel obviously has an eye for standards and I would come here over all other options in the area. They leave noting wanting. BTW our room and a fun retro feel to it. I thought that was  cool. It had red carpet! I think I deserve that from time to time.  :)I only stayed for a night so this didn't matter too much but we were on the 7th floor with a room overlooking the rooftop courtyard area - meh, so much for ""beautiful"" Baltimore. Would have been way better if I could have actually seen the city since it was my first time to this city but whatever. The biggest issue I had is despite the be courteous and keep quiet sign, I kept waking up at all hours of the night to screaming guests. It started with a girl who kept yelling down the hallway repeatedly ""mom, I have your phone!"" And then a huge group came up around 2am and started cheering like it was NYE. -_- worst night of sleep. Sometime around 8am, someone headed to the lobby walked the halls singing the 12 days of Christmas extremely loud, it was ridiculous. That being said, the hotel was nice, large lobby with lots of plug to charge electronics while waiting for your travel companion. Good coffee bar. Across from all the touristy stuff and a short walk to the aquarium. My bf forgot to pack pants so he went on a quick sweep of the connected mall (unfortunately all the stores open later in the day - weird). The valet is super nice and helpful too!I stayed at the Renaissance for a conference.  The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in (I usually have trouble sleeping when I travel).  The staff could not have been friendlier.  Everyone I encountered greeted me with a smile and kind word or two.  The Water Table restaurant food was delicious both for lunch and for late dinner at the bar.  (I recommend the fish and chips).Still a great location, wonderful view and great service. However the elevators which seem too few to begin with were not in good working order and that presented a problem every day. At one point in our stay only one out of six elevators was operational. Frankly, that is dangerous. Also the bed was quite uncomfortable. The mattress was very hard with no pillow top and the entire bed was slanted. I had a hard time falling asleep because I thought I was going to fall out of the bed! Also it took over six hours to get a roll away bed delivered. I traveled with my family but have been thinking about going for a girls' weekend. However the gang of thugs lined up in front of the walkway leading from the Gallery to the hotel entrance was problematic. I would not want to have to walk to this hotel without my husband. I would think the city and the hotel would make sure there were not people lined up shouting at visitors and hotel guests and it is pretty dark over there.I don't know if they had an off weekend or if things are going down-hill. I think they definitely need to replace some of the beds.Great hotel experience! Hotel may be a classic to Baltimore but the interior of the lobby and rooms appeared very stylish in a current way. The view from our room was amazing at night but also neat in the morning, too (the marine layer gave a ""in the clouds"" feel on the 10th floor!!). We were upgraded to an amazing suite w a studio style dining room, and living area in addition to the ""bedroom zone"" we had expected. Super closes the some fabulous restaurants and night clubs. We are already planning another overnight!!Pssst.  Don't tell anyone, but when I want to work while drinking on the job, I come to the lobby here.  It's perfect.  Set up your laptop at a big, comfy chair/table combo, order a wine at the bar, and commence to getting your work on.  If there's a game on the TVs, it can get a little noisy, but not anything you can't work through.  Hungry? There are plenty of options both within the hotel and without since the Harbor is right across the street and the mall is next door.  It's a great spot to stop into for meetings away from the office or just after work drinks as well. The wine selection is A-OK and there are enough plugs and outlets that you don't have to go on a scavenger hunt if you need to power up. All in all, a great place for my purposes!I am from Baltimore, originally, so I am picky about the locations in where I stay when I return for visits. This location cannot be beat for downtown. You overlook the harbor and are a hop, skip, and a jump from all surrounding neighborhoods and attractions. The hotels itself has easy parking and not too expensive for that area. The lobby is clean and inviting. The staff is incredibly nice. Our room was an interior two-queen that was very clean. My only cripes: 1.) You can hear EVERYTHING. I could hear toilets flushing at all times of the day from inside of my room. Even when away from the elevator area, the halls were pretty noisy. 2.) We ordered hot tea to be delivered to the room in the morning. All the teas and accoutrements were fine. But the hot water was given in a carafe that you could tell was used for coffee previously. I don't like to taste coffee in my tea! 3.) The soda/bottled water machine. It costs $2.25. And they sell Pepsi products. 4.) The bathroom could have used a little more upkeep. The showerhead wasn't functioning fully properly. The shower curtains needed to be replaced. All in all, a decent stay in a clean environment in the perfect location. If you want a simple breakfast, try Lenny's across the street. Or for a blowout breakfast, try Miss Shirley's.I've stayed here a few times with a great deal on Priceline. Loved it when I lucked out with a harbor view. BUT if you can't get that, not worth it- a hike to the elevator, noisy courtyard, staring into other guests rooms. Check out fells point. I've stayed there a dozen times, at the Mariott- always a water viewRooms were nice, very quiet. Staff was friendly and very accommodating. Great location.Great location.   Nice clean, luxury rooms and my kids loved the pool!Only giving 4 stars because I was able to name my own price on Priceline for eightynine bucks and ended up with a room here. Although it was only a courtyard view (of the center of the building) and not a city or harbor view room, it was nice. The bed was VERY comfortable, ie - fluffy. Not sure what you'd do if you prefer a firm mattress.The best thing about this hotel is the location. Conveniently located across the street from center of Inner Harbor, made it especially easy with the baby. There is a business center on the 5th floor, and also an airplane check-in kiosk where you can print boarding passes.The water in the room was $4. Luckily there's a 7-Eleven just a couple of blocks away where you can get some drinks and snacks even at odd hours of the night.The elevators in this building aren't designed too well. Of the 6 elevators, only 2 of them are dedicated for parking. The other 4 elevators are for everything else. This means you'll be waiting a very long time to get to your car.Parking is public, and not dedicated to the hotel. Self-parking was $26 for one night but lasted 30 hours from the time of check in. That allowed us to check out but still leave the car in parking lot while we explored the city.For the price we paid, it was a steal. Great deal = great experience.We stayed here for a five-day visit to Baltimore; and, it is, by far, one of our all-time favorite hotels. Foremost, the parking area is well-lit and clean. This area suffers from a large indigent population which can deter many families from visiting. Nonetheless, know that this Renaissance is devoted to customer care, safety, and comfort. We saw no loiters and no suspicious behavior in this garage.Check-in was surprisingly quick and extremely courteous. All front-desk employees were well-groomed, friendly, and helpful.The rooms were positively immaculate and aesthetically pleasing. They are modern and generously sized. And, the beds are a dream! The linens were soft and super clean. The consensus was that after a long day of shopping and touring the area, the room was a welcoming space in which to ""unwind."" We have not a single note of criticism for this hotel! Keep up the fantastic work!I only paid $50 for one night stay with my brother and parentssince I was a Marriott associate kkk Anyways awesome hotel,near a indoor shopping mall which is good if you want morechoices and inexpensive areas for food. Overall nice spaciousrooms and decent service!all the chargest that the manager said would be removed were still on my credit card. PLUS, there were more random charges added. When I contacted the hotel, they wouldn't believe the final receipt I was issued. It took some time and effort to contest and remove the charges. The hotel wouldn't do anything, but the credit card did. So beware and check your credit card statement.really nice roomgreat front desk serviceawesome view of the harborwalking distance to everything in downtowna bit pricey....but it was a vacation so meh! what the heck lolVery nice hotel with excellent location at inner harbor. Parking steep but convenient; just do the self park with in and out privileges from the beginning. I tried a cheaper option the first night of our stay but regretted having to walk several blocks back to the hotel at night in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood. Starbucks in the lobby is the worst service and product ever but I heard there is another stb in the mall attached to the hotel. Just enjoy a walk in the am to fells point for good coffee and breakfast. But can't say enough about the excellent customer service by Terence, who greeted you at the front door and managed to miraculously fix any problem with his quick, spot on attention. Would definitely stay here again. He made it all work out.stayed here for work. great location. your standard modern decor, nothing surprising. comfy bed. super friendly staff. decent gym. cheapest Starbucks coffee I've ever had ($4 soy latte???).  elevators take forever in the morning. I hate paying for WiFi.Great Hotel! Staff was very nice. But there are things you should know, the pool has a life guard and goes to 7 feet, if you want WiFi you have to pay for it ( Which i thing is stupid due to the price of each night and all the other stuff), and there is a mall attached to the hotel. But its a wonderful hotel.","What an awesome place! It is super convenient to shopping, restaurants, and the Aquarium. We had a room with a partial harbor view and it was great! I did find the location to be loud--both with road noise as well as the noise from people in adjoining rooms. This isn't the hotel's fault, of course. We thought the staff from the bellman, the valet, front desk staff, and pool life guard to be super helpful and professional. It was well worth the price to stay at this hotel. It truly made my daughter's birthday weekend!What a disappointment this entire stay was.  For a $200+ a night hotel I would have expected better service.  First, I am put in the SMALLEST room that also happens to be farthest from the elevator.  With a hotel the size of a city block, it isn't very fun to have to drag a suitcase for that entire block just to get to your room.  Then, the room is VERY tiny.  It was stuck off in the far corner and smaller than any of the other rooms at the hotel, which was confirmed by the ""you are here map"" on the back of the door.  Not only was the room tiny, the bathroom was even worse.  VERY dated fixtures and a tile was ready to fall of the shower surround.  Clearly updating the crappiest room in the hotel is not a priority.Two days in a row I called for laundry service.  Both days no one showed up to pick up the laundry bag. I called during the allotted time for laundry pickup, but obviously even their staff doesn't want to hike down to this corner crappy room.  Twice I asked for shower gel and twice I received none.  Twice I asked for an extra coffee cup for the morning and twice I received none.  All three nights I was kept up by the constant sirens outside my window.  Because hey, if you've got the crappiest room we might as well stick it in the farthest and loudest corner of the hotel!  And leave the extra bed from the room next to yours outside your door partially blocking it so you have to move it to get out.The ONLY positive thing I have to say about the hotel is that the room service staff is at least willing to walk a block to get to this otherwise forgotten room.  Of course by the time the food arrives it is basically luke warm from the ridiculously long trip to even get here, but the gentleman who delivered my food was polite and courteous.  I have no complaints about the service he delivered.  He was the only good thing about this stay.I paid the same amount as everyone else did who stayed here, but in no way received the same experience.  I will NEVER stay here again, and if you have the misfortune of staying here and getting room 11072 RUN, don't walk to the nearest exit.  You'll have a miserable stay.Great location and nice facilities!I visited here very briefly and did not stay overnight - but I sure will consider it.Right across from the Inner Harbor.The ""Ground Floor"" bar &amp; cafe is very nice, too.Renaissance Baltimore Harborplace - where everybody knows your name.This place makes me feel like I'm living in the epicenter of Southern hospitality, and it's not even really the South!  In fact, it's in the homicide capital of the US, or so my brother informed me.  If that's true, you should definitely check into the Renaissance and stay there, if you ever need to be in Baltimore.Every employee smiles with weight of sincerity, goes beyond doing everything he/she can to help you, and ends his/her extraordinary efforts with the most heartfelt ""Have a wonderful day"" you've ever heard.Well-stocked coffee stand, brightly-lit fitness room, easily accessible ballrooms, delicious whole-wheat flatbreads offered for room service: these are some of the things you'll enjoy at Renaissance.  I'd say that really beats having to stay out of danger in the questionable downtown Baltimore area.Overall a great experience. Check-in was a breeze, and the rooms are clean and spacious. Especially enjoyed the super comfy bed and high quality bath products. Also, the hotel offers a great exercise room and convenient meeting spaces. Only thing I did not love was the exorbitant fee charged for Internet access.   May be just because I'm from a different area, but I'm accustomed to hotels with free wifi!Will stay at this hotel every time i visit area... Location is perfect, hotel staff are extremely courteous and professional. The valet guys are great... As busy as the hotel is they always had my car ready inside 5 minutes and they also shared inside info about the city.  The rooms were very nice, comfortable bed, great linens, pillows, room was hospital clean. View from 9th floor room with harbor view was great. The 5th floor restaurant was good for breakfast, quick service and good selection.Next to aquarium puts this hotel at 4 stars.   Breakfast included in cost was worth it.   If you want to be in the middle of the inner harbor this is the place to be.  Bathrooms need upgrade but are clean as is the room.  One thing I noticed is the door to the rooms have a 1 inch air gap  and sound comes in easily and you can see the reflection of people walking by.  Pool is a plus for the kids.  Plenty to eat around the hotel so no need to eat there.I'm a Marriott Elite rewards member so I'm always loyal to Marriott and their brands. There're several Marriotts within a 6 block radius to choose from.  So I'm in Room 11113 during the weekend of June 3-5 and there are problems at this hotel.  #1 Internet wasn't working so I had to waste 10 minutes of my time to give them the MAC address to my computer to allow usage.  I guess their DHCP server was down.#2 All local TV stations were not working in this room.  I don't know if it's the entire hotel or not but I like to catch up on local news wherever I go.#3 the water pressure was inconsistent!!  I had soap in my eyes when the water went out for 25 seconds!!!What's good about this hotel:#1 Service was very good and attentive something you'll find in a 5 star hotel.#2 Location is the best of all hotels as you are in the middle of the inner harbor.  6 blocks to Camden oriole park and 8 blocks to Lexington Market and less than a mile to the eastern harbor. But this hotel is actually connected to the Gallery Mall!!!  That allowed me to wake up and get the latest Retro Jordan at Footlocker!!! #3 The Watertable restaurant was very good (Located on the 5th Floor)#4The fitness room was excellent and had all of the machines that I needed!!!So why the 1 star????  All of my complaints should always be addressed ahead of time!!  Whether you're a budget or luxury hotel these are the basic needs of a hotel guest!!  Continuous water, Internet and Local Channels!!!!The husband &amp; I had a great 2 night stay. The room was outrageously spacious &amp; the staff was welcoming and helpful. The location is fantastic; close to shopping, restaurants, the harbor (obviously), and to the Charm City Circular, a free bus route that hits several of the major sites.The free lemonade in the lobby didn't hurt, either.My husband was able to get a free hotel room through work so, Baltimore date night here we come!  Our room was beautiful and clean.  The AC works great.  The bed is comfy.  The bathroom is large and clean.  Nothing smells funky as with many hotel rooms.  The decor is also modern and fun.  Why not five stars?  The hotel bar is really expensive.  Captain and diet was a shot of captain with a splash of diet for $9.  Ouch.  The valet was also really slow to get our car this morning.  We called before we left our room and it still took 20 min.  Bonus: There's some animation thing going on at the convention center so holy dork alert batman!  The people watching was entertaining (yes, its mean, but....) so lots of people in capes, white suits with their shirts unbuttoned, and other crazy looks.  We had a good laugh because they all seemed to be staying at our hotel.  Oh, how I love the tourists!I will have to say this Hotel is the most unprofessional. I had the worst experience with this hotel this last weekend, I was told upon arriving that because I was given the family discount( my family works for marriott headquarters) that my room was given away and that they put me in the Marriott down the street. Upon arriving the comp. room they gave me, I noticed that they changed my reservation. I had booked 2 rooms and was only given 1,( 2 families were present). I was told that, Baltimore was booked and that it was nothing they could do. And I was comp. a room, so basically why am I complaining. The room wasn't even really a room, it was a pull out sofa bed and two rollerway beds. I have never been treated so disrespectfully. I called back Renaissance and spoke with a manager that was present on 4/26/14 that evening. Mike (the manager) was insincere and told me that because of my discount, he couldn't help me. I had a previous great experience with this hotel after my wedding ( without a discount) and was treated great, but after this treatment I will never return ever again nor recommend to my family that come to visit Baltimore. To make a long story short a Hilton worker saw me crying outside after getting off the phone with ""Mike"" and told me that had a beautiful suite available and we decided to stay there and had a great time. There customer service was very acceptable, and they even gave us a voucher for a free breakfast for me and my husband. I have always stayed at marriott's all my life, even before discounts but after this experience I doubt I will be staying at any marriott's for a while.Nice business hotel. Good functions area. On the water. Lots of bars and restaraunts. 15 shuttle or 35 dollar taxi from airport.On 8th floor you can find yourself walking a full city block and a half to the one elevator...... StrangeHorrible customer service with no disregard to our concerns!!! The hotel engineering department thought it would be a good idea to drill before 7am in the room above us.  After calling twice and going downstairs to the management they  had nothing to say other than it's not our issue and basically gave us no other options or resolve.  So be forewarned...if it's under construction stay somewhere else.I had a short stay at this hotel only 1 night, but from what I saw I loved it. Great location. My only complaint 's... the difficulty finding the hotel entrance from the mall. And the valet pulls up offering me keys to my rental, I get inside and realize he pulled the wrong car!I No apology, I read some reviews about the parking garage, I can see why. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, just maybe not valet my car. Yes this was another stay via Priceline. I saved over 60% on the retail price.Great hotel!! Smack dab in the middle of it all, its within walking distance of all of the harbor action, attractions, and restaurants. Our room had a view of the mall downstairs :/ but still very comfortable. The bathroom was nice (just missing a flat screen) with the separate deep tub and shower stall, spacious of course. The heated pool was a VERY nice size. Kids were there playing and not once did that interrupt our small adult party. The jacuzzi was chlorine laced, had to get back into the pool a few times bt I'd rather smell chlorine than bo. Easy access to the mall downstairs, Starbucks, harbor shopping across the street, basically whatever you want. I never did catch the bar or bistro-looking area. The local teens did tend to hang out in the area outside of course, bt after a certain time, no key, NO ACCESS. Great place to stay and the location couldn't be better! Did a LOT of easy, carefree walking :)I came here to celebrate my four-year marriage.  It was nice.  The location is tops--it can't be beat.  I remember this hotel being around for a long time, yet the inside did not feel dated or worn.  It must have been recently remodeled.If you book on Priceline, as I did, be prepared for the clerk to announce loudly to no one in particular, ""I see you booked this on, uh, PRICELINE.""  And you can say proudly, ""Yes, yes, I did, and I saved a buttload of money.""I wish I would have had time to check out the pool and fitness center but my stay went by too fast.If possible, I'd give this hotel 3 1/2 stars. It's definitely a more than decent hotel, I'm not sure it's worthy of 4 star status.I got a deal for this place on Priceline that was 60% off the regular price, so I can't complain about that. I found the hotel staff to be very pleasant and the person who checked me in at the front desk was very nice.The room was large and the bed was very comfortable. However, I was very disappointed by the pool. I was looking forward to taking a swim, but when I entered the pool area I was overwhelmed by the noxious stench of chlorine. It was so bad that I started coughing and there was no way that I could stay in there without getting sick.Also, when we were leaving the the hotel on the morning of checkout, it literally took about 10 minutes just to be able to get on an elevator. There was a sign in the elevator bank in the lobby that said the hotel was doing some repairs on the elevator system, so I think they're were only two working elevators.For $28, the parking was actually a pretty good deal. We pulled into the parking lot at noon on a Saturday and didn't leave until 4:00 p.m. the next day, so we actually had some time in the lot before officially checking in and after checking out.The hotel is in a very convenient location right in the Inner Harbor and about a 10 minute walk from Camden Yards.There were some issues with the pool and elevators, but I think I'd stay here again if I could get a similar deal on Priceline.Wow. We got a lot more than we expected staying at the Renaissance Harborplace. We had reserved a city view king room. What we got was an upgrade to a harbor view executive king suite. Can you imagine my excitement? Our room was a corner suite, taking in views towards Camden Yards and all of the Inner Harbor. The room was huge and beautifully decorated with a lot of special little touches. The bed linens were soft and cozy.  Plus, everything seemed brand new, like no one had ever stayed in it! I can't believe how lucky we were. Valet parking may seem a little steep at 36 bucks. However, it's really worth it, to be able to dump your car off, walk everywhere you need to go and not have to worry about it. The hotel is conveniently located near Camden Yards, The Baltimore Aquarium, The Hard Rock, etc. Plus, the Boston Red Sox's just happened to be staying at the hotel, so we had a couple player sightings. Not too exciting for me, but my boyfriend loves baseball. We would definitely stay here again!  Love the location, very nice hotel.Enjoyed my two day stay here.  Rooms were comfortable. The hotel is in an excellent location next to the Baltimore harbor front.   Some hotel staff were pleasant while others were crabby (especially the late night staff)I was really excited to stay at this hotel, but it ended up disappointing me and my boyfriend on several levels. First, parking was $38 per night which would have been fine had we known beforehand. Luckily there was parking available on the street (metered). Second, the shower was dirty. There were someone else's hairs all over the bottom of the shower along with the soap holder. It was disgusting. Next, the hotel was unable to accommodate our request for a king size bed. Now, I realize it is a 'request' (which the lady at check in rudely explained), but we were staying there for Valentine's Day and instead of having a romantic room, we had a room cramped with 2 queen size beds. Lastly, starting at around 7am there was a very loud buzzing noise coming from the wall. At first I thought it was an alarm clock, but we concluded it must have been a pipe acting up in the wall. It made noise for 5 minutes at a time nearly every 20 minutes until we checked out. Some positives are the location (right on the harbor, walking distance to everything), the hotel bar (open late and tasty drinks), and the price we received off priceline ($75 per night I think).Although there are some positives, the negatives definitely don't even it out. I definitely would not recommend this hotel.","['excellent', 'customer', 'service', 'asked', 'harbor', 'view', 'think', 'upgraded', 'sort', 'suite', 'massive', 'room', 'came', 'free', 'breakfast',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-regency-baltimore-inner-harbor-baltimore-2,Hyatt Regency - Baltimore Inner Harbor,3.5,$$$,117,"Well earned 5 star review for an excellent all-around stay.Room: Comfy Bed, large TV, beautiful views downtown, large walk-in shower with granite tile.Other perks: super nice gym loaded with equipment, towels, water and fruit; fast elevators that overlook the harbor; pedestrian bridge over the street to aquarium and harbor; a bar that looked pretty decent.Service was outstanding from start to finish. Staff greeted me warmly upon arrival and helped me with my bags. I needed to dry my hoodie after it got soaked and they let's guests use washer and dryer for free! I later lost my car key and staff went above and beyond to help me find it. I ended up finding it in the drier I used for my hoodie!Conference facilities also worked out nicely for the training that I attended. I'm going to take advantage of future opportunities to go on work trips here!This is my latest (and most expensive) experience with a hotel that does not live up to the most basic requirement I have for lodging (besides the absence of bed bugs): the ability to get a decent night's rest. I was there for two nights, tried two rooms, on different floors and on different sides of the building, and achieved two hours of sleep each night- and that was with two separate noise makers operating (one came with the room). Admittedly, I am not a heavy sleeper; however, the amount of white noise present in my rooms should have been more than enough to suffice.The first room, ninth floor, harbor side would have been fine, if not for the constant reflected traffic noise, which only abated from 2 AM to 4 AM. I don't honestly know how soundproof hotel windows can feasibly get- but these had a long way to go. A loud car would go by about once each minute, beamed right through my window.For my second night, I was moved above the pool (eighth floor), with the hope and assumption that the extra roofing below would block some of the traffic noise. It blocked about half; meaning that, while I could not hear every car going by, I could still hear most of the ones starting from stoplights and/or stop signs. Additionally, the refrigerator in this room was loud, and turned on frequently (every 10-15 minutes, for 5 minutes); it could be heard clearly over even the traffic. Also noted, hallway sounds (doors) were more noticeable in this area of the hotel. Finally, there was an odd dragging, scraping sound from above or beside the room, that continued throughout the night. I still have no idea what caused that one. Not sure I want to.The only other two issues I had with my stay was the price of the food (expected) and the inconsistency of the shower temp- both of which could have been easily overlooked, had I been able to sleep.The workout room was well appointed (even offering hot towels and complementary fruit), the rooms and public rest rooms were clean, the staff professional, the view (from harbor side) was gorgeous, the location was ideal- sadly, all hard to appreciate on two hours of sleep. I have several other conferences coming up soon, held at the Hyatt, and I am seriously considering staying elsewhere.I lived in Maryland all my life and when we were young, visiting the Inner Harbor was a treat. I thought it would be cool to stay at that hotel with the mirrored windows - heck, we always parked in their garage because the pedestrian bridge offered great access to the Inner Harbor.Fast forward a number of years to 2016 and I had a couple of Hyatt Diamond Suite Upgrades to burn before they expire in February. I self-parked in the garage, took the elevator down and walked into the lobby. Check-in was very professional and before I knew it, I was wowed by the Superior Harbor View 2-bedroom Suite. These rooms are on the corner edges of the building, rooms X45/X47 and offer a spectacular view of the Inner Harbor. Both rooms offered a flatscreen (a 42-inch in the bedroom and a 55-inch in the living room), a bathroom, desk, coffeemaker, and fridge. Free Hyatt Wi-Fi was also available. I wasn't able to enjoy all the amenities at the Hyatt. The fitness room is on the 4th floor and there's also a rooftop pool, open in season. The hotel restaurant, Bistro 300, is on the 3rd floor. I only had their breakfast buffet. The service was very attentive and the food was pretty good.Overall, I enjoyed my stay at HR Inner Harbor - the price was right at $99 (plus parking and taxes coupled with a Diamond Suite Upgrade), but don't expect this price the rest of the year! I stayed here on Jan 1, post holidays, hence the fab rate.Great location..  Bummer that the mini bar in my room wasn't full.  Called front desk to have refilled.  They said it wouldn't be refilled until the morning.  What?   Luckily, the bar stayed open a little late for me.  Rooms clean and beds comfortable.We ordered room service and my wife's egg whites were undercooked and runny.  My burger was ok.  Pretty much equivalent to a Denny's burger.  Expect better from a Hyatt.  There was also mold in the grout in the shower.   That is a new one on me.  I stay in many Hyatt's.  I have never experienced a shower like that.After perusing a few hotels in the Inner Harbor area for a quick weekend trip to the National Aquarium, I went with the Hyatt because they had a package that included passes and discounted parking in their attached garage. Convenience! I rejoiced, because the other hotels I looked at didn't have obvious parking information and the costs just added up to too much when you factored in aquarium tickets.Anyway--that's a long-winded introduction to say that choosing the Hyatt for our weekend was the best choice I could have made. The service was impeccable. I emailed regarding the aquarium tickets because we wanted to arrive early on Saturday, and Andre from the Front Office responded almost immediately. He was there when we arrived, shook my hand and wished my husband a happy birthday. When we got back from lunch and finally relaxed in our room, we were welcomed by a handwritten note and a special birthday treat. Andre is exactly the kind of person the hospitality industry needs; he goes above and beyond the call of duty, striving to make sure the guest has a good experience. We stay at Hyatt brand hotels when possible, and this is--by far--the best service we've had.The hotel itself was very nice. The walls are a bit thin, so we heard someone's baby, but that's to be expected in hotels. Our view of the harbor was gorgeous. This Hyatt probably has some of the best views of all the hotels in the Inner Harbor. There are pedestrian bridges to easily cross to the Light Street Pavilion and into the Harbor complex. It's walking distance to all of the Harbor attractions.I kind of thought this trip to Baltimore would be a one-off thing, but I'm already thinking about when we could go back. The Hyatt Regency will make an excellent home base for exploring other Baltimore attractions--and going back to the Aquarium on a day other than a summer Saturday!The Hyatt Regency is THE place to stay when in Baltimore!  The staff is professional--the rooms are clean--the service is impeccable -- special thanks to Melvin for taking time out of his day to guide us with directions over the phone the last few miles when we needed help the most.!  We will never forget that ""little extra"". See my 300 Bistro review!  This place is second to none w/out a doubt.!!Thanks to the entire staff for making this trip one we will always remember--not to mention the 1D concert we are here for.!  My daughter loves 1D and the Hyatt.!!Positive feedback - the staff was pleasant, Joel the best!Negatives:  stayed for 5 days and three mornings I had a cold showerbecause they were fully booked - no excuse!  Every time the room above flushed the toilet water would drip down from the light over our toilet. We reported it three times but it wasn't fixed.  The kicker is I woke up with a bed bug bite on my butt and another couple we were with had a bite on his leg.  Will never stay there again. The construction of the hotel was of poor quality.  Again the staff was very pleasant.Staff was lovely.  The building was lovely and looked newly re-modeled.  The look was modern.  Location was great. There is currently construction on the 2nd floor.  Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable.  My reason for 2 stars is the room was very sterile and uncomfortable to me.  We did book on Priceline so I cannot complain.  The new furniture looked nice, but there was one uncomfortable little chair at the table and one fancy appearing chair.  No counter space anywhere.  Only one nightstand between the 2 double beds so each outer side of bed had no table.  This room was good for sleeping only, but I guess that is what one does when they come to a hotel :-)I'll keep this brief--I don't often give five stars, but the hotel staff treated us very well and were extremely helpful, the rooms were lovely and bright, and breakfast at Bistro 300 was excellent. The beds were very comfortable--just enough support as well as cushioning.Excellent customer service-- amazing place, with very cool elevators. We spent a fantastic weekend here, right in the heart of Baltimore, within walking distance to all of the good stuff:)Nice location, rather forgettable but nothing terrible about it. Perfect for conferences. Overpriced but everything in the Inner Harbor is. Check in and out was quick enough. Rooms were standard. Bathroom on the small side. I know I'm a snob, but I hate the Hyatt brand of toiletries - KenetMD. You don't want to use body lotion and shampoo by a brand that sounds like a prescription while on vacation. If we didn't have Hyatt points, I probably wouldn't stay here again.I have nothing but good things to say about the Hyatt.  I just stayed here and from booking to checking out the experience was ubiquitously warm, positive, and welcoming.Check in was easy and the gentleman at the desk made sure to ask how my trip in was, could he help me plan anything, would I like to speak with the concierge, etc.  Great service and made me feel at home.On my walk to the room I passed two flavors of infused water and fresh baked chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies, a great touch.The decor is modern, open, and warm.  The room was clean, neat, and very comfortable.  Large flat screen TV, adequate size fridge, single serve coffee maker.  There are plenty of outlets scattered around the room and a nice desk space if you're there to work.The concierge helped me look for a couple of local services and even took my cell number and spent 20 minutes looking for 2 options for me.  Wonderful service.The only reason I wouldn't come right to the Hyatt the next time I need a hotel in Baltimore is because of the plethora of upper-end hotels all in the same area.Love this hotel! Clean and modern, close to everything, friendly staff. Love the view of the harbor and really nice and romantic outdoor pool. And it's affordable! Every dollar was worth it! We will def come back here! We came here for forth of July and we got a great view of the firework right from our room!Very pleased with this hotel although my stay started off with a slight plumbing disaster in my room which required a move. However, the staff was very apologetic and eager to please. The hotel overall is very nice and clean. The workout facility is top notch. I have to admit it is one of the best hotel workout areas I have ever seen. The rooms themselves are nice. Good bed and clean bathrooms. That truly matters. Decent area attractions are easily accessible which is a plus. All in all, I will keep them in mind for my next inner harbor visit.Nestled along the inner harbor is a gleaming mirrored building that stands amidst the darkened buildings like the Emerald City of Oz. It towers over the waterfront as a beckoning oasis and as you enter it almost seems as if you are being taken away from the hustle and bustle of urban life.The rooms have been tastefully re-done. Nothing truly wow-ing or special, however they do feature the very comfortable grand bed and the rooms are nicely sized so that it doesn't feel claustrophobic. No matter what the view, whether the harbor or the city, they are all comfortable so that you aren't looking into the awkward naked person in the bathroom over in the building next door. Its location is definitely a highlight and it is convenient to many of the cities attractions. Whether it is the nearby inner harbor that is connected by a skybridge, the stadiums, or perhaps the downtown core. It is all a short walk away. Yet, if you do park a car, valet or self parking are available. If you're into saving a few bucks, self-parking is easy and there is another entrance off S. Charles street, although there is a separate garage elevator that means a few extra minutes.Staff are pleasant and helpful. I asked for tips and directions on several occasions and they were really personable and nice. Over all, it is what I would look for in a hotel and they offered a great choice that I would definitely use for my next visit to Baltimore.Awful value!! Stayed 3 nights last week on the 7th floor.   Hallway carpet was stained and literally coming apart at the seams.  Room was extremely tired.  It had no reading chair/ottoman, bathroom sink took forever to drain and the ""Ken and Barbie"" coffee maker and supplies were a joke!  This room and hallway are in dire need of a total renovation.  Paying top rate of $279/ night for this room was completely inappropriate!!Based on the poor conditions noted above, the rate should have been heavily discounted or, better yet, the room should not have been available for booking at all.Nicely done renovation makes this hotel attractive again.  They still need to work on the Charles Street back entrance which is dirty and worn.Took the boyfriend on a getaway weekend and stayed in a Grand King View Room. Expensive, but worth it. The room was clean, spacious, and the view was to die for. The bed was absolutely amazing. Best night sleep in a while. Room service breakfast Sunday morning was on time and fresh. The orange juice tasted like it was just squeezed! Everyone was polite and helpful when checking in, out, and dealing with the valet. Great hotel!! Expensive, but wonderful.Great people and love the new web check-in capability, but they need to upgrade rugs on some of the floors, and my bathroom window blind needed replacement. Also, they need to keep gym temperature at 68 during the summer. There are always folks who wanted hot and others cold in the gym so lets just stick with average, and please make sure to have enough towels in the peak times.I spent Tuesday and Wednesday nights this week here for a client meeting. I don't know how much the room cost. The client reserved a block and charges were direct billed, so I can' speak to overall value. Here's a quick net of the good and the bad:Pros- Excellent location - a 20- to 30-minute ride to/from the airport, in the middle of the central business district, adjacent to quaint Federal Hill, on the water at the Inner Harbor and a short walk to the much cooler Harbor East neighborhood.- A very nice staff.- Hypoallergenic, thrice-cleaned Pure rooms with HEPA filter, white noise machine and fragrance-free toiletries.- Touch card entry. No need to insert or swipe a card key. A timesaver.- Very quiet. Every guest I saw was a business traveler. No bachelorette parties, frat boys or screaming kids. - Comfortable beds with decent linens.  Cons- The food. Absolutely horrible. For that matter, I have never had a good meal at any Hyatt. Eat elsewhere.- No bottled water in fitness center. And every time I went (3X) there were no towels. In addition, while it's nice that they put out a basket of apples, oranges and bananas, they should swap them out every week or so. There was rotten fruit (see my photo).- The bathroom had insufficient vanity space, just one hook and no towel rack. I had to put a clean towel on the toilet to avoid walking across a tile sopping wet to get one. - Ironically, found a silver dollar sized dust bunny on the desk in my Pure room. Oops.- They have obviously tried to update the 80s architecture and decor, e.g., the water feature in the third floor lounge that reminded me of the one in Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, NJ when I was a kid.I wouldn't object if I had to stay here again, but nothing I experienced fostered brand loyalty or would cause me to switch from the Marriott program. Please let me know what you think of this review by clicking a bottom below. Thanks!","Great location, unremarkable service. Except for the front desk staff, who were extraordinarily helpful, this hotel has a mediocre staff and mediocre food, and worse banquet catering. Mainly, it was a staff issue. The Good: it's a great location. A bridge will take you over to the waterfront Inner Harbor area and it's a half mile walk to beautiful Camden Yards. And a short half mile at that, you'll spend more time mounting the ramp to the upper decks than you will walking to the park.  Parking is next to the hotel--swing in from Light Street on the right (beware of the MBT buses that peel off and cut you off as you try to turn in, get into the right lane immediately. Or you'll have to go around the block.) It's twenty a day self park and not difficult to maneuver.The hotel public areas are  nice looking. The architecture is 80's--glass and steel and concrete, with those glass pod elevators everyone was so hyped about thirty years ago. OOoo! Look! We can see down into the atrium! Yep, the Eighties were all about that.The rooms are unremarkable and not that big, but adequate. The decor is a paean to Bland (plain abstract pictures, beige and white on beige decor). The bedding is hypoallergenic and covered with dust-mite-excluding polyester covers. These tightly woven covers prevent dust mite infestation and are a brilliant touch. Only--the bedding had feathers (the pillows) and those are allergic beyond belief. But the staff did have non-allergenic pillows available. The sheets are a bit slick because they are not cotton but a blend. No minibar. There WAS a minibar but it was empty. On top was one of those one cup brewers for coffee or tea and Starbucks Verona and decaf Verona pods. Lipton tea and the usual skimpy one sugar, one pink packet and one tiny creamer. Paper cups. No bottled water. They also have a number of toiletries you might have forgotten available at not charge...but you have to ask. What's laid on in the room is basic; toothpaste, lotion, shampoo, a bar of soap. Nice soap. The bathroom is a bit small and the vanity shelf is only as wide as a stick of gum--so it's hard to put out your dopp kit AND a makeup bag, if there are two of you. And only one sink. The shower had one of the best shower heads I've used, loved it--you swivel the head inside a ring and it goes from rain water to pulse to stream to flat jet. Likey! The Bad:The beds are just ok, not great. I had a double, not a king, but it was tolerable. Some other of my party felt the bed wasn't comfy. Maybe not all the beds were updated. The room wasn't serviced. I was at early events, then late afternoon needed to rest up, shower, and dress for evening festivities. Room not done up, no new towels and the staff beating on the door during nap time. If you can't get to a room before 4:30pm, don't knock on my door. So no clean towels or anything for the entire stay. I was too annoyed to go chase down housekeeping and get them to do up the room. They had from 7am onward so what's the hold-up?The rooms are noisy--older building, thin walls. There is a white noise generator in the room to help you with this issue but they don't work on thumps. Just traffic noises and voices.The catering: wow. Our entire table was neglected. No water, no wine, no coffee. The entire evening. And what was funny was we were by the wait station, so it's not like they didn't see us. And one of us specified NO NUTS and every dish had...NUTS. THe entire table was laden with nuts and even though a nut-free option was ordered, they didn't come by with the no-nuts to our table (because we were apparently invisible the entire evening.) When the dessert of NUTS showed up, I complained and was offered a vegan cake (which I was suspicious about, as vegan food features a lot of ....NUTS) and a tiny tiny fruit cup, the size of a baby food serving. Two pieces of melon and a blackberry. So that's what my dinner consisted of, along with one piece of dried out bread--as they'd cut it and put it out hours before.The steak we were offered was so tough it couldn't be cut by the plain (not steak) knife. Was supposedly ""filet"" but it was tough, overdone, and soaked in a salty brine. The fish was dried out.  The asparagus was completely raw, in the cheating method of caterers these days, who do not blanch vegetables, but coat raw ones with butter to prevent overcooking. By not cooking at all. I hate that--happens all the time with haricot beans as well. It's raw. Gross when buttered.  The breakfast was the usual greasy eggs, pastries, no toast, fruit showed up sometimes, and no plain non-sugared bread, sausages and very sorry bacon.  There was the usual sugared and sugar free yogurt. If you want plain, that's for European holidays. Americans want sweets.Summary: pretty much what you find in an American ""five star"" hotel these days unless you are lucky.This place is terrible. Charging ports on my room don't work, phone died over night as a result I was late for an appointment. ""High Speed"" internet I paid $10 per day for us slower than a 36.6k modem. Customer service doesn't care about you and the air conditioning is a joke, a fan would keep me cooler. Stay anywhere else, think I would have been better off at Motel 6.Spacious, welcoming rooms and bathrooms, excellent conference space by the water, but...My company booked my trip and Hyatt charged ME!  This is a HUGE issue for me, so I am not a happy customer.Stayed here for thanksgiving 3 nights . Really nice hotel . Big . Good food in the bar and restaurant . Drinks were a little pricey and there was construction going on inside hotel . Rooms were big and nice . Great views of the harbor . Customer service was perfect . Great location . Super close to all dining and activities in inner harbor .Definitely will stay here again .Some friends and I were in town and decided to stay here because of location and things to do within walking distance. I was surprised how clean, friendly staff and renovated it is inside. I will definitely be staying here again should I visit Baltimore again.Exceptional customer service. Everyone staffed here was SUPER friendly. The hotel itself was very lovely and the rooms were clean. The bed was so comfy. The lobby had infused water. The strawberry one was rockin'. If you love chain restaurants right on the water then the location is stellar, I hate chains so I was a tad disappointed with that. Overall a nice place!Came into town for a night to attend a friend's going away party.  We HotWired this hotel and got a great deal.  We arrived a little early for check-in but the staff was really friendly and helpful and got us into a room a little early.  I signed up for their loyalty program which is free and they upgraded us to a King corner full harborview room and gave us 2 free things from the mini-bar.  Since we were out partying all night we ended up taking 2 free waters.  It's a great hotel with a good location and the cost to park your car isn't too bad.  I will say though that the toilet in the room was ridiculously low which is good I guess if you are short.  All in all a good stay.Nice and lovely hotel..a bit noisy in the hallway.comfy beds..nice big TV and good water pressure tooo.Our stay was excellent. Part of the positive experience was due to the fact that the Inner Harbor, and by extension - the Hyatt, was awesomely dead during the weekend before Xmas. The hotel staff was lovely. The only hiccup was upon check out when we ordered a bell hop and none showed up. Thought maybe they were busy, but when we got down to the car, they were standing around chatting with one another. That said, Duquan was fantastic. He helped us on the way in and again helped us to load the car up on the way out. If you stay here, do everything you can to get a harbor view. You won't regret paying a little more. I rate the view better than most and I've had some great views over the years - Boston, Times Square, even a rustic resort in Washington overlooking a white capped mountain. On the downside, the garage is not attached to the hotel. On the upside, you can get directly over to the harbor view the skywalk. Thumbs down on the lobby decor - it's outdated.  But the room was upgraded. Super quiet room; comfy solid bed.  All in all, I would absolutely recommend the Hyatt if you are staying in town.While not physically connected to the convention center, it is the closest hotel to the east side and harbor, and there is a sky walk that spits you out on the 2nd level.They have kiosk check in, for which you can use either your credit card or your Hyatt membership card.  There was always at least one employee standing there to help with kiosk check in.  More showed up at peak times or when lines were starting to form. The rooms are nice, the toiletries are nice, but the walls are thin and there's lots of noise.  There was a noise machine in my room, which I had to turn on each night since even on a Thursday night, they were doing construction work at 11pm on removing the elevated walkway on the side of the convention center.  I'm a little on the tall side, and the not-adjustable desk chair was too short, so I had to sit on an extra pillow.I left on Saturday morning for an early flight, and the cab to the airport is a fixed rate of $30.Decent convention experience, but bring your ear plugs!Attending a conference, I stayed here for a few days. The rooms are very nice and clean. The staff both at check-in, throughout the stay, and at check-out were very nice and professional. The irritating service at a hotel such as this is no free wifi. For almost $200 pet night, I expect it to come as part of your services. At a $50-100 per night establishment it is free. It's almost as if with at a more expensive place, they know you'll pay it. Here is the customer service excellence though. I mentioned it during my checkout about being unhappy with it and not expecting anything to happen. However, after leaving I was contacted by the hotel manager to help me work through this issue during future visits. I really didn't expect the desk staff to take my comments any further, little alone have the manager call me to rectify the situation. Excellent job to their desk staff, management, and internal communication.We went there for a company party and stayed overnight in a guest room. We had a great time overall! We were self-parking the car but the valets said it was fine to leave the car for a while when checking in. We used a self-check in kiosk, but when we had an issue an employee was quick to help us, providing room keys (TOUCH room keys, no dealing with the annoying card slot) and directions. The elevators are very quick and the views from the elevators are amazing!Our guest room was a harborview room. It was very clean and tidy, but kind of oddly shaped, with a narrow little corner to turn to go between the bathroom and the bedroom area. The coffee maker was well-stocked and intuitive. My only complaints are that the bathroom sink ran for several seconds after turning off, slowing to a trickle instead of turning off quickly and completely. Also, the toilet made an odd squeaky sound when it flushed, but those were minor complaints. The toiletries were good quality. We didn't use any of the food. There was a noise machine in the room, but our room was very quiet and I didn't find it was needed.There is NO extra room in the mini-fridge, so if you have something you need to store, you will need to remove some of their minibar items... just remember to replace them!Overall, this is a solid hotel. We stayed after an event on Valentine's Day. The room is well appointed but a little small. The bed very firm. The bathroom is well lit and the shower had plenty of hot water and water pressure.On the downside, this is a loud hotel and by that I mean the hotel itself. Every so often the in room heat/air unit kicks on and it is loud but settles into almost white noise. The minibar fridge kicks on and is loud. The air-handlers on the roof below our window were extremely loud. To top it all off, we could clearly (CLEARLY) hear the couple in the to next to us (ahem) celebrating Valentine's Day. The walls are thin, but that happens everywhere so I will give that a pass.However, the biggest complaint we have is that at 7:45 on Sunday morning the hotel staff started cleaning and vacuuming with a vacuum that was as loud as a power washer. So much for sleeping in, but hey it was only for one night and could have been much much worse.I had a wonderful stay at this hotel.The service was great, very friendly and professional staff members. The management did everything to make me feel comfortable while I was staying there. The room was absolutely fabulous and the bed was super comfortable.The staff are awesome making you feel at home while on the road. I will definitely recommend this location to anyone.Nice room in a great location, but the cable tv didn't work and hallway noise was extremely loud in the room because of poor design and lack of insulation around the door.  I don't watch a lot of tv, but like to have the news on in the morning while I am getting ready for work.  As I was watching, the sound was cutting in and out badly.   I ran into a man in the hall later and he asked if my TV was working. I told him it wasn't working properly, that the sound was cutting in and out. He stated that his was doing the same and he had been staying in the hotel for two weeks, had reported it several times and hotel management had done nothing. He asked me to report the problem too, so they would know it was not just him. When I reported it to the gentleman at the front desk at first he acted surprised. Then when I told him that the gentleman in the room next to me told me he had the same problem for the past two weeks the man at the desk suddenly seem to remember the problem.  He told me they were aware of the problem and we're working to fix it.  My question is, if they knew about the problem for two weeks, does it really take that long to fix and why weren't they letting guests know and perhaps giving guests an option to take a room where the cable was working.  On the plus side, the gym was awesome, with a lot of great equipment.I stayed here when I was in town for a football game.  The location to the inner harbor and the stadium is ideal.  Anything you would want to do in Baltimore is a quick walk from the hotel.The hotel looked very modern and had great views of the harbor.  The staff was very friendly and the hotel had a lot of energy because the Baltimore Ravens were staying here the night before the game.  They had a great breakfast buffet at Bistro 300.  I would definitely stay here again.this is a hotel with a great location.... got a wonderful price on the room.....bar and restaurant are pricey ....personnel here are great....have to pay to park.....Beautiful hotel. View was one to remember. And a nice pool overlooking Baltimore. I suggest this hotel, the Hilton over Camden yards and royal Sonesta if you come to Baltimore.The hotel was best in class. The rooms were clean, staff was friendly , and it was within walking distance to the ballpark.  Great place to stay!Beautiful hotel!  Awesome location!  We had a view of the harbor which was beautiful at night!  Well stocked mini bar and there is a Starbucks in the hotel.  I got a great deal through Priceline Make Your Own Bid, but feel that the room and service would be worth the money. My only slight con was that the room service meal was not as great as I expected it to be, but I like how they have the menu you can scroll through on the TV.  But, the menu on the TV had some differences than the menu in the room.We were there the day they were sending off the Ravens to the Super Bowl and it was right next to all the festivities.","This was my first trip to the Inner Harbor part of Baltimore.  I can't wait to go back and staying at the Hyatt is the perfect way to stay at Inner Harbor. I arrived early which was not a problem and was quickly in my room.  The room was very nice as you would expect in a Hyatt.  The Valet was very courteous and professional.  The reception staff were fantastic.  This staff really enjoys their work and the management team is truly doing a good job.   I stay with Hyatt's quite frequently so I had access to their Regency club.   They had  wonderful evening snacks and a nice continental breakfast.  The club staff were very courteous and friendly.  Jesse who was running the club in the evening is an amazing individual.  He was working hard but made time for all the guest.  He is extremely interesting to talk with and I spent a couple extra hours chatting with him and another guest.  I actually missed my dinner reservation but didn't care as i was having such a fun time.  Jesse is a true professional who makes you feel as if you were a guest in his home.My wife and I were driving in from Detroit on our way to Virginia Beach. I was pretty excited to stay in a world class city like Baltimore but, I wish I would have stayed somewhere else. I heard Hyatt hotels were pretty good so we booked one and used it as a check point to stop driving and reset. Hotel room itself was actually rather comfortable but, the staff was not so interested. We booked a room with a king sized bed and they initially stuck us in a two bed room. We needed a down feather free room and when we switched rooms after the complaint call it took an hour and two phone calls to get the down out of the room. Purifier smelled awful and was crazy loud. Room service was slow and not masterful. Overpriced for the hassle and laziness of the staff. I did like the free toothpaste though. woo hoo. View was bad as well. Will book a different hotel when we stay in Baltimore next time.Exceptional hotel for meetings (we had two conference rooms for two weeks)- the staff of the hotel ensured we had everything we needed. Great location- right on the harbour--TONS, and I mean TONS, of options for places to eat. One of the better Hyatt Regency's--check in is fast, especially if you are a Gold Passport member. I appreciate that they upgraded me and I was on Regency level, with a huge room. Downfall- there was some kind of cheerleading or volleyball comeptition at the same time and the parents of these kids who were staying on Regency Club level let all their annoying children take over the Club. There went all the food---all the areas to relax, and at some point some kids got into a scuffle and because I was entering and leaving the room at the same time, security told the hotel staff that I had started the altercation! It took a lot of investigating and by the end of the next day, as appalled as I was, the hotel apologized for their flub and banished the rugrats from the Regency Club. Understandable mistake, and especially as a then-Platinum member, I was taken aback and how abruptfly I was wrongly accused of some disturbance. OTHER THAN THAT, its a great hotel.Oh yeah, prepare to pay an arm and a leg for self-park or valet. Either way, there went half your gas $$ for the day!I got stuck in this Hyatt for 3 nights and days because of Hurricane Sandy (not 'superstormmediablowup Sandy'), so I think I can say some pretty informed things about this hotel.The rooms are impressive. I had a harbor view on the 6th floor with two full sized beds. The amenities in the room were nice. Nice bathroom, nice TV, nice view.. but the beds were too soft for me. Dining in the hotel is very pleasant. The staff were friendly, the bar tender attentive, and the food all-in-all decent. You will get tired of it after the 4th meal straight, just FYI, but I think that might be the case at any hotel. They did roll out snacks, coffee, and tea for the prisoners of the hotel during the hurricane. THANKS!The value was alright, I don't think it was worth $180/night, because I have stayed elsewhere downtown for much less with similar amenities. But the Hyatt doesn't disappoint as usual.This hotel is at a great location, very convenient/ quick to walk to the inner harbor area! The rooms were clean and modern, but our room was uncomfortably hot at certain times (even with the AC going full blast) because of the excessive sunlight. Also the wait for the elevators was pretty annoying, just to go to the lobby from the third floor there was always a wait. Same for the parking garage but that was even worse, having to stand around waiting with luggage is not fun. They are very strict with upholding the checkin time (which is 4pm) we got there around 2 and had to wait for the room to be ready. Also, we had the breakfast buffet for $20 a person- it wasn't bad but not great either just very mediocre. I would recommend going to one of the great restaurants nearby for meals rather than trying your luck at the Hyatt. Overall it wasn't a bad experience just mediocre and slightly over priced- parking for guests is also $28 for one night!!Stayed at The Hyatt this past weekend while in Baltimore for a professional conference. The location was great---in the heart of the Inner Harbor, within walking distance to shopping, restaurants, and many sights. I really enjoyed this hotel's atmosphere &amp; the customer service was excellent! Plus, the food in hotel's restaurant was outstanding!! One of the best meals I had all weekend was right there! Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Baltimore!We have stayed here many times and have always had a wonderful experience. Highly recommend getting a harbor view room. Views are beautiful. Rooms are spacious and the staff is very professional. We always enjoy a meal at Bistro 300 as well. Walking distance to harbor attractions and Camden Yards. Looking forward to our next visitThought Hyatt is a world class hotel, but they need to keep the rooms clean. The staffs are extremely helpful.I was in Baltimore for a week for a business convention (traveling by myself). I heard good things about this hotel and I have respect for the Hyatt moniker in general. Given that the hotel was within a short walking distance (I have bad knees) to my meetings. This SEEMED like a no-brainer. I had to check-in late because my room was not ready at 4:00. No big deal, the desk promised to give me a ring when my room was prepared. There is a ton of stuff to do in the beautiful Inner-Harbor area. I took a short stroll across the street. Phillips Seafood immediately caught my eye, so I decided to check out the rest of the harbor later...I will write a separate review for Phillips Seafood in the future, but for now I will say it was SUPERB! I started with a shrimp-cocktail, steamers, fried calamari, crab cakes, and for my entree, I had the triple mac-and-cheese boat... AWSOME. I finished with a chocolate cake and chocolate mousse desert. All good. Perfect timing too! My room was ready just as I was finishing. Before I went back to the hotel, I decided, why not splurge a little? I found a wonderful gelato stand in the harbor mall. Heavenly. Finally made it up to the room around 5:30. The view from my room was beautiful (a nice view of Hooters). The bed was nothing great, I like a little cozier. I was meeting a friend nearby for sushi and drinks at 7:00. I thought I had enough time to quickly go to the bathroom before I departed. This is where things started to go wrong for me. I used the bathroom and to my frustration, It clogged after only two flushes. Low flow? Ugh! I called the front desk to ask for a plumber and waited a HALF-HOUR for him to show up!!! Come on! Very unprofessional. I was going to be late for my dinner and obviously I could have left and just assumed it would be fixed, but I wanted to make sure it would be okay for when I got back. In case I had to go again before bed. I ending up meeting my friend a little late, no big deal. When I returned to my room, I needed to use the bathroom again. Guess what? It clogged again! When I called, I got the same woman. This time, I clearly detected a tone in her voice. Once again, very unprofessional. They sent up another plumber and it was fixed again. I went to bed much later then I intended. Not happy. Next morning I woke up early so I could try a nearby deli for breakfast. It was right across the street and very convenient to walk to. My buddy told me they had a local Baltimore favorite called ""scrapple"" (traditionally a mush of pork scraps and trimmings combined with cornmeal and wheat flour, often buckwheat flour, and spices). Of course it was excellent! After I ate, I went to my room to use the bathroom. I had just enough time to do this before my first meeting at the convention center. Can you guess where this is going? THE TOILET CLOGGED AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! This time I flagged down a maid in the hallway and brought her into my room. She was very rude. Tons of eye rolling and attitude. She had the nerve to suggest that it was MY FAULT!!! I could not believe it. I did not have time to wait around for it to be fixed, so I left for my meeting. After a wonderfully catered lunch at the convention center, I stopped by my room to make sure it was fixed... STILL CLOGGED!!!!!!!! I immediately called the front desk and got a new woman (much nicer). She apologized and sent someone right up. The room smelt horribly. The maintenance man pointed this out to me very rudely. He didn't need to say anything! I was very embarrassed. I even asked the desk if I could switch rooms to get a WORKING toilet! Nope! They were full. Just great! I learned through hard experience to use the toilet in the lobby for the rest of my stay at the Hyatt. Not very convenient for me. The hotel itself and MOST of the staff were very nice. It still did not live up to the Hyatt moniker. If it wasn't for the horrible bathrooms, I might have even given it four stars.Ok I'm not a hotel food kinda guy but went here for a conference today...and to my surprise the dinner food was actually pretty good. I nibbled on a salad (greens were very fresh), and some kinda of fish (battered) which I rarely eat.  Looked like Cod. Not only was the food very delicious but the service throughout the hotel was quite friendly. My impression of Balto is not that good but this experience is helping to change my perspective...sort of.This hotel is in a perfect location to all of what Baltimore offers and even offers a walk way over to the Inner Harbor area. The service was good and everyone was friendly from check in to check out. Rooms were well appointed and the toiletries were excellent. The beds are super comfortable and we had a great night's sleep. All in all this hotel is a great pick for your stay in the Baltimore area.Good!If your here for a long time and need to order something not available downtown and have it shipped to the hotel, be prepared to cough up. $7.42 a package for a processing fee. This is crazy. Also several friends of mine reported bed bugs. Allergy free rooms are dustier than regular rooms.I am a travel agent and Hyatt Platinum member. I stay at a lot of properties annually and have had some great experiences and not so great experiences over the years. I am pleased to say that Hyatt Regency in Baltimore was definitely a great place to stay!Service is top notch--  the minute you arrive at the hotel, the staff makes a huge effort to get to know you and to fulfill all requests. Nicole, the FOM was really great about accommodating my standby requests and secured a great room for me. Kenny in the Regency Club was so polite, friendly, and helpful-- he definitely made my stay a memorable one.The rooms themselves are large and boast great amenities. While they aren't ultra modern or super luxurious, they do provide a high caliber of comfort and were very clean. I was also impressed by the Regency Club at this property. There are so many variations in Regency Clubs from Hyatt to Hyatt, but Baltimore really pulled out all the stops with a great spread of items throughout the day and evening. I cannot say enough nice things about this hotel!I stayed here for 1 night  and had a nice stay. They let us check in at 11am and let us check out at 2pm. The price was a high at over $400 per night but I stayed here on rewards points for free so I can't complain. Only negative thing to say is that the doors don't block out noise very well. They have a lot of signs up about being quiet after 9pm, but of course there will always be a few that ignore. It was short lived thought.    And the elevators are pretty cool!I can't say enough nice things about this hotel and staff. The room was immaculate and the hotel renovations are beautiful. The staff has gone above and beyond for us from upgrading our room to offering me a bottle of water on a hot day (I'm currently pregnant). I've stayed I'm many hotels in this area and so far this is the only I would feel strongly about staying in again. Wonderful staff who truly understand customer service!Great hotel and staff. Rooms are very noisy, you can hear the street noise and the hallway noise all night longRenovations are nice and so is the hotel......you can't beat the location.We expected quality from the Hyatt, so I'm not surprised our stay was pleasant.There is plenty of staff to answer questions, and point one in a direction upon entering. Rooms are clean, and spacious, and the view from the 14th floor was positively, panoramically, brilliant. I chose to book through Priceline, with the deciding factor being that parking was included in our package. This turned out to be a wise decision, as the parking at the Hyatt is highway (or parking lot) robbery.  For a two day trip, I easily could have spent 80 on parking.  Just a heads up for future guests.  Other than that, I can go ahead and give Hyatt Baltimore an endorsement.  Urqhart out.Stay somewhere else with the free breakfast.","Loved this hotel.  EVERYONE (valet to front desk to everyone in between) was FRIENDLY beyond belief.The hotel itself is nice and clean as are the rooms.  The bed was very comfortable.I had a view of the pool to my left and to the baseball stadium to my right.The hotel itself is located on the harbor.  Apparently this is a very touristy area ( I had no idea).   Once you walk out of the hotel and cross the street you are standing on the harbor.  There are lots of restaurants and things to do.Great location.** I do wish Hotels would stop charging for WIFI !!! ***i stayed here my second time in Baltimore for a trip to see a client and stayed here 3 nights.The front desk was amazingly courteous and helpful.The room was okay. I was stuck in a 2 queen (wish they would have fixed that) overlooking the pool. The room was fairly spacious and had a small chaise lounge to sit on. I always appreciate a sitting area that isn't the desk so I can lay back and work on my laptop. The main issue I had with the room was that it either was dirty, or that there was so much wear and tear that it looked dirty.The bathrooms didn't have any storage, so I had to leave all my items on the counter, which kept getting moved so the cleaning service could do their job. The tub was kind of gross as it had buildup around the edges. I wish I would have brought a pair of flip flops to wear in there.I wanted to go to the bar one night for dinner, but there's very little seating and it was packed. I ordered room service instead and it was quite good. It was a tad cold but came with all the amenities for a burger and fries so that I had everything I needed. The gentleman who brought it up was also very kind and cheers'd me as he opened my beer.I'd recommend this hotel to someone for business or short stays.Stayed overnight to visit the aquarium with my family and enjoyed every bit.The food was excellent and the room was clean. Service both at the front desk and at the hotel was like a five star hotel.This hotel, lives up to its ratings. Would definitely go again.I booked four nights here on line and then realized that I booked for the wrong weekend.  When I called the next day to change the reservation for the following weekend, the hotel was completely booked.  So, I decided to cancel my reservation and look for another hotel.  THEN, I found out that the reservation was completely non-refundable.  So, I'm not going to be in Baltimore that weekend but I have to pay $219/night for four nights.I realize the initial error is mine but who has ever heard of no cancellation policy.  I thought most (all) hotels were 24 hours.  You would think they could understand that since I called the very next day that it was a simple mistake.  If this is Hyatt's universal policy, I'll never stay at a Hyatt again.Be careful when you are booking a Hyatt reservation!!Stayed here for a couple days during the summer with a couple of relatives.Location: For Baltimore, you may not be able to get any better. You're right on the inner harbor, two blocks from the National Aquarium in Baltimore and a bevy of nautical museums. If you're lucky, you may catch the air show or annual collection of sailing vessels. Baltimore is known for being a dangerous city and this was actually one of my greatest hesitations when deciding to stay here. However, the Inner Harbor near the Regency is actually very safe at almost all hours of the day. Rating: 4Service: Probably the worst part of this hotel. With that being said, this is still lightyears better than others I've stayed at (Sheraton Meadowlands). The good: was able to switch from using cash to hotel points to pay for the room the DAY OF. Most hotels wouldn't push to process the change. The bad: We requested extra toothpaste and lotions to be brought to our room. Twice. Nothing. Rating: 2 starsHotel: The hotel itself is actually pretty nice. Some of the hallways look a little old but that's pretty much it. There is no funny smell. The rooms are spacious and clean. The lobby has vaulted ceilings and soothing background music. Sometimes you have a doorman who runs out to open the door for you, help with bags. Other times you wait. Flavored water and cookies sit near the lobby for the weary traveler. Elevators run pretty quickly so regardless of what floor you're on, you'll be back in bed in no time. Rating: 3 starsRooms: Spacious. Not as modern or high tech as I'd like it (see Hyatt 48 Lex) but enough to be comfortable. Otherwise, you basically get everything else you'd expect from a Regency. Rating: 3 starsOther: The pool had just opened up and so everybody and their mom's was sunbathing or doing cannonballs into the water. The ""track"" was basically the top of the building where you can run circles. The tennis court was taken down. The gym was more than adequate, containing free weights and machines. The spa was down for fixing. I didn't actually go to the bar but it seemed to fill up every night. Rating: 3 starsRecommendation: Not a bad place to stay. The highlight is definitely the proximity to the inner Harbor and all that it has to offer.Exceptional customer service!!  (Michael at check in, have year an angel in the bistro, and that lovely lady in the gift shop )Every staff member I encountered welcomed me warmly, and or asked if I needed anything. The check in desk staff were helpful and kind.  My suite was immaculate and everything smelled clean.  The bedding was luxurious and comfortable!  I used the business center and found it well appointed.   You need a credit card to get on the Internet and print copies.   There is a five dollar minimum for the first 10 minutes .   However, there is a free workstation in the lobby and there are signs indicating that in the business center so you can avoid paying if you need free Internet access.  Something I found very convenient was that it has a walkway directly to the convention center. Travelers going to any function at the convention center will find this hotel convenient with easy access to the convention center.  The breakfast buffet at Bistro 300 was delicious and the staff was warm, professional, and attentive.  The hotel has a wonderful view of the harbor and is centrally located.  Finally, Loved that they accommodate individuals with disabilities all the way down to the grab bars in the showers.   In all the common areas there is a very soft low-volume kind of New Age music playing everywhere you go and the hotel features interesting indoor landscaping and soft textures that provide a relaxing environment.  If I ever return to Baltimore this will be my top choice for a place to stay. Thank you Hyatt Regency Baltimore!.....Stayed here recently for a conference. The conference facilities were top notch and catering was decent. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms weren't anything special - my room just had a shower and no bathtub which bums me out. But the white ginger toiletries go a long way to make me forget that I can't chill in the bath.Location was good - right across from the Inner Harbor and a $30 cab ride from the airport. Don't rent a car if your conference is at the hotel, it is a waste as you generally walk wherever you need to be. Just note that it can be sketchy downtown, so be aware of your surroundings and cab it for short distances if you are alone.Great hotel, perfectly located.  Got a great deal on Priceline too!was here for a conference. beautiful hotel. no complaints. situated next to everything on the waterfront. would definitely recommend.This review is for the valet only.Upon arriving to the hotel I was disappointed, not with the prices, wait (other than two empty cabs I was the only one there) nor the rates but the state of humanity.In what world is it okay for FIVE grown men watch a lady (or anyone for that instance) wrassle her suitcase out of the car - finally turn off her car and approach the valet while five said valet attendants watch on. Then one valet genius says are you checking in? I think hmmm it's like nearly midnight so not sure what else I could be doing standing here with my suitcase in hand. So then they start filling out the paperwork and one of the shiftless quint asks how are you? I give him the stinkeye and grunt something I hope resembles good. What I really wanted to say is disappointed that you five men were just standing there watching me instead of doing your job. The one I can only imagine is the leader (wearing a suit) goes to another ""how are you?"" The other one answers something nice and happy and this leader dude says something to the effect of glad to hear it. Now I'm pretty laid back, but these hmmmmm not gentlemanly gentleman were clearly making fun of me. It took everything out of me not to let them have it. I really hope these five gentleman realize they are gentleman or EVEN just people and if you see someone in need of help-help. Next I hope this group realizes that if your job involves parking cars and helping guests - get to it. Standing behind your podium and staring at people won't make your day faster neither will it earn you tips.This hotel is in a great location. Great views of the harbor and near shops and restaurants. My husband used his reward points to stay here and when we checked in the hotel upgraded us to a suite. The suite was nice and clean and had plenty f space for a family of 4. The hotel staff is very courteous and professional. The only complaint I had with the breakfast we ordered from room service. When the food arrived, the food was not warm, and the coffee was not fresh. $70 for breakfast and the food should at least be fresh and hot! Other than that, I would stay at the hotel again.Stayed here for a conference and found the hotel to be OK. The location was amazing.....within walking distance to the harbor. I had a great view of the harbor, too. The amount of money that the hotel cost, I did expect a bit more. Also, I tried to go to the hotel bistro, but it was packed and had to go walking to get some food.After recently staying in the Hyatt Cambridge and having an amazing experience I was very excited to head to Baltimore. Unfortunately the experience did not measure up at all.The staff was equally as friendly and helpful, but the hotel is noisy all the time. I woke up multiple times every single night because of people talking in the atrium (many of whom were employees), yelling in the hallways, hearing people through the walls etc. Some of this they can't control, but if you are looking for a peaceful night this isn't the place to stay.It is located directly across the street from the harbor, which makes it ideal for seeing a lot of Baltimore without needing a to take a cab. I also loved it for a beautiful safe place to run.We also had a few issues with getting the room charges correct and let's be honest dealing with paying too much money is never fun either!5*     location5*     Lobby/hotel decor 4*     Room accommodations (minus faulty ac unit)1*     Noise due to construction/repair during early morning hours1*     Air Conditioning unit that didn't work1*     Rude Employees/Bad customer Service 1*     Unorganized 1*     Bad management total 2.4Great Location.  Decent Hotel and amenities.  AWFUL Customer Service.  I have stayed here many times but after several bad experiences I won't be returning again. My most recent stay was for a medical conference.  We were there on a hot sticky summer week and I received  a room with a faulty A.C. unit.  After a few hours in the room I realized it was not getting any cooler and called customer service to let them know.  They told me someone would return my call...someone did not.  After waiting three hours we did not hear back so we went down to the front desk.  We were told they would call maintenance and have someone come to our room. Nobody came. The next morning (after being awake all night) I requested a room change and the manager was very cold and unapologetic.  I got to the new room which was nice and cool and I was finally able to fall asleep.... Unfortunately, I was not able to stay asleep because about 20 minutes later I heard an excruciatingly loud noise (sounded like a drill against a metal door) I gave it a few minutes thinking it would stop but when it didn't I called back down to customer service and told them about the construction noises.  The young woman at the front desk was very pleasant but she said she was unaware of the situation and transferred me to a manager that told me that there was not currently any construction going on in the hotel and definitely not in the room next door.   Frustrated, I put clothes on and went out to the hallway where I saw the maintenance crew with power tools repairing the door to the next room.  I called back and asked to speak with the manager again.  I couldn't believe it, she continued to argue with me and said that there was no construction or maintenance currently going on and they wouldn't be able to change my room.  I went next door and asked the crew how long they would be, they apologized but said that it would probably be a few hours, I asked them to call the manager and let them know what they were doing.  They thought this was a strange request but they agreed.   I called back downstairs where they told me that they were unaware of the repair (obviously) but there was no apology.  They explained that they would not be able to change my room again without me paying for a more expensive room.   by far the WORST customer service I have ever experienced at a Hyatt!The service was definitely among the very best I've ever encountered. We encountered smiles and friendliness among every employee we met while we were there. It is a very convenient hotel, too --- just a short walk (via over-street bridge) to the Inner Harbor.We were given a Harbor View, simply because my son asked for one. It was spectacular!My complaint --- and this is a complaint I have about many downtown hotels --- is the exhorbitant room service charges. A 12-oz can of diet coke was about $5 when you factor in the service and mandatory gratuity. So an order of two sodas, a plain pizza, and bowl of soup somehow became $51 and change. But, no worries --- the person at the front desk agreed this was unreasonable and knocked a substantial sum off our bill.  This is what I mean about great service - no employee wanted to see us dissatisfied for any reason. We will definitely come back!Horrible food for $16 a person for breakfast, painful beds and TINY rooms. I got the biggest room in the hotel and it had 2 double beds and one disgusting bath room. You have to put your room key in the elevator every time you go past floor 4 which is a pain in the a** and NO FREE WIFI!! $10 for 10 mins!?? OUTRAGEOUS!! Horrible service at the hotel and restaurant, I will never come back!Great service! Was very happy with the staff during my 4 night stay here. They were all accommodating and helpful. There's an outdoor pool and the hotel is located in the Inner Harbor so good location. And Regency Club members get free breakfast, snacks, beverages etc.It is a nice place and has a good location. It is a bit noisy by the traffic and can be warm in summer. Their staff is very friendly.Pros: the desk clerks are incredibly friendly and helpful, and the location is greatCons: The walls are paperthin (you can hear everything in the rooms next door and in the halls). The security people are completely incompetent (they intentionally locked us out of our own room because of a noise complaint from the room next door, then when we complained about that same room later on in the night, they told us that no one was in there).Booked this hotel on Priceline. Got a great deal and was very satisfied with my overall stay. Conveniently located across the street from many restaurants and stores. The checkin and front desk people were very friendly and always had cabs waiting for me when I requested them. The personal attention of the bell staff was phenomenal, impressed me much more than my experience at the Hotel Monaco a few days later. Did not experience any issues with thin walls.I did leave a blazer in the room and was able to track it down and have them hold it for me at the front desk. Really appreciated the above and beyond service here. Kinda hate that they have 4 ESPN channels, but no Bravo or Lifetime (I wanted to see project runway!)Would definitely stay here again!","The location of this hotel along with the pedestrian walkways seemingly make this hotel a good choice. I stayed here for 2 nights to do some recruiting at Johns Hopkins Homewood.The Regency club at this hotel was a complete joke and I can't believe they charge extra for rooms on this level for access to the club. The complimentary hors d'oerves (sp?) consisted of roasted veggies, Costco cheese and canned nuts. Yes, this was on both nights and therefore not an anomaly. The room was absolutely huge although the layout was a bit odd. The desk was on the far side of the room facing away from the tv so I could only watch tv reflected on the mirror above the desk.When coming back to the hotel in the evening there was a HUGE lawyers reception blocking the area from the pedestrian walk to the elevator. I was afraid I was going to get sued just trying to get to my room. Why the hotel set up the reception right in the way of other guests really baffled me as there were private reception areas available.All in all, I wished I were staying down the street at the Intercontinental and confirmed my belief that Hyatt Regencys are overpriced, inconsistent, and cater to convention centers.This hotel was beautiful!My husband and the boys were w/ me.  Hubs was there for buisness.  Everyone was so nice and helpful.  It is right across the street from the harbor.  Room service was nice for late night wings, fries and bread pudding. :)  We ate brunch at their cafe and that was an all you can eat deal.  The boys loved it and tried just about everything.  The food was not a disappointment.  The room was spacious w/ a nice view.  Clean and smelled good.Garbage, the parking lot has no signs so good luck trying to get to the hotel after you park. The idea of a kiosk check in is offensive. After a long trip the least Hyatt could do is staff the front desk in case a guest has a question or needs something.  I arrived at approximately 7:30-8pm on a Friday night in August and there were no hotel employees present so I had to figure out the kiosk check-in and then try to find out where the elevators to the rooms were. This hotel is crap.My boyfriend and I spent stayed at the Hyatt for Valentines Day weekend, and we were incredibly pleased with our stay! The staff was friendly and incredibly knowledgable and the hotel in general was nicely kept. Our only complaint was that our bathroom had a faint cigarette smell. it didn't really bother either of us, but we didn't want to risk being blamed for it at the end of our trip. I told the front desk and they offered us to change rooms, to have housekeeping take care of it, and then comped our parking fee. I was very impressed with their customer service.When we went out to dinner that night, we called down to the lobby and asked for a cab, and ended up having a shuttle drive us straight to our restaurant and then back to the hotel after our meal. The driver was very friendly, and even gave us a complimentary ticket for a free qppetizer!Overall we had a great trip, and I would recommend this Hyatt in particular to anyone.It's a great location if you're attending something at the Convention Center, and the rooms are entirely decent. The staff is courteous and the elevators are fast, but they seem to be a bit incompetent.We faxed in a credit card authorization form to bill a company card *twice* and they still managed to screw it up and bill our personal cards. Apparently whoever received the authorization form just stuffed it in a file somewhere instead of entering it into the system, so the automatic billing just proceeded with our personal cards.I had to convince the desk guy that they actually did have the form (which he found after searching for about 10 minutes) and wait for him to correct all of the reservations while I waited. He kept apologizing, but was just barely competent enough to fix the issue. I don't know about you, but I like dealing with businesses that have their affairs in order and know how to deal with issues decisively and confidently. These guys barely squeaked by.Location is fantastic (right across from the harbor), room is beautiful (comfortable bed, gorgeous wall to ceiling windows with views of the harbor, flat screen TV with ESPN2 -- to watch Euro 2012, of course), nice lobby, and great service make this hotel a solid choice.  Minus one point for no free wifi, often expensive rates, expensive parking, and fine but not amazing food.Everything was fine except for the following:$27 per day for parkingFee to use the wi-fi internet serviceDirty swimming poolJust back from a two night stay at this Inner Harbor location   June 12 &amp; 13   I flew in from Ca to meet my sister who came from PA. Great location for a game at Camden Yards and just about any other activity in and around the harbor.   Can't say enough about the staff.  Incredibly friendly and helpful.  Ryan who greeted us Wed in the lobby was especially charming.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is a housekeeping detail.  We had a room with 2 beds.  The room only had one robe.  When I called the front desk to ask about another robe the gal basically said no, they only put one robe in the room.  I'm a Hyatt Gold Passport member so I found that response a bit off putting.  Also, when housekeeping changed out the towels Thursday they did not replace the washcloths or hand towels.  Other than these two incidences our stay was quite lovelyLet's start with the deplorable: it took me nearly an hour to check in.  On a normal Saturday evening, say 6pm, they had only two check-in clerks working and at least five people waiting in line for each.  After ten minutes of waiting, I was pointed to a self-check-in kiosk by a staff member (who inexplicably wasn't checking people in).  I stepped out of line to use it, only to have the stupid thing tell me to see an agent.  More waiting, I finally get checked in.  But on arriving at my room, the door won't open.  Even more waiting.  By now I'm late for dinner, great.  When I finally got into a room, the place was clean and modern, just what you would expect.  Plus the usual Baltimore touches where perfection is marred by the odd bit of sloppy work (misaligned plumbing fixtures).  Ahh Baltimore, how I've missed your charm.Between $27/day self-parking and $10/day internet, they're catering to the business types who just expense it all.  Pleasantly, the garage is obviously patrolled by security, so my convertible felt safe.  I loved the automated voice on the parking garage elevators:  ""welcome to Baltimore, please remove all valuables and lock your car"".  You would be wise to heed that warning.A polite complaint about the checkin process got my internet fee waived without argument, so the hotel earned back a star.  A solid 3, but rather soulless and greedy.My organization hosted an event for our community partners and the venue was great. I'm glad the hotel had a space that wasn't in a stuffy ballroom. Review will change once I actually stay at the hotel. Parking is pretty expensive - but what downtown hotel isn't?Overall, this is a great Hyatt...very clean, modern, and the accommodations are superb. The service is outstanding, and it seems there isn't anything they won't do for you. Location is great...you have the inner harbor just out the front door and you can take the skywalks from the 2nd floor to just about everywhere.My only beef is the fact they have nice HDTVs in each room, but the signal is not HD. You don't have access to changing the settings, so you get a really bad, stretched out picture that is extremely pixelated. Other than that, this Hyatt is great...if I ever visit Baltimore again, I will definitely stay here.I've been staying here since the mid-90's when I come to Baltimore and I've never had any complaints.  The rooms have always been clean, beds comfy &amp; the breakfast buffet or sit-down breakfast in Bistro 300 restaurant has always been wonderful.  I also like the gift shop and the lobby.  It's very nice and we always come back to stay when in Charm City, plus it's right at the Harbor with nice views.I stayed at the Hyatt this past weekend while in Baltimore and was very happy with this hotel. The staff was very friendly and accommodated our early check in.The room was a perfect size and the king bed was very comfortable. It also had a partial harbor view which was a nice surprise. The bathroom had a nice tiling detail that reminded us of the ocean.The hotel pool, located on the sixth floor, is a great addition to this hotel. It is clean and very big, with a large selection of chairs. Also there is bar at the pool. The location of the Hyatt is the best in Baltimore, seconds away from the Inner Harbor.I will definitely choose to stay here again!I don't ever write reviews on hotels, nor do I ever write reviews on chain places.  But this Hyatt is an anomaly for me.  I'm actually a Hyatt-ho ever since I used to stay at the huge ass one over in Ann Arbor and collected a trillion points doing so.  I even got married at a Hyatt. But this one was a special experience all together and for one reason only. We got to our room after checking in; we had to settle for 2 queen beds because there was a conference in town and there were no more single kings available - the beds were so SMALL (which is why I docked a point), so I called downstairs.  Nice guy Adam at the front desk told me there were no more king rooms available - and then said hold on.  After a moment of silence he said ""come downstairs, I have another room for you"".  We get downstairs and Adam is nice as pie, he apologized for the small beds (what can I say? my husband hogs the space) and hands us the new keys. We get to the new room, which is like a closet compared to the first room; but had a huge bed; I walked over towards the closet and notice a huge mirror, floor to ceiling.  As I go closer, I notice that it's not a mirror, but the entrance to a WHOLE OTHER ROOM!  We basically got a sweet penthouse sweet on the corner of the building with some sick views of the Inner Harbor and downtown buildings.  Not to mention, I got a late checkout too. =) Thank you Adam!Two stories - both of which are pretty awesome.First, I showed up atypically early to check in on the 15th.   Turns out I accidentally made a reservation for the 25th!  The short version is that the amazing woman at the front desk, Khahn, 1) didn't make me feel like an idiot, 2) rebooked me for the 15th even though the hotel was near full occupancy, and 3) was able to get me a good rate (and it even had a harbor view).  I don't know what I would have done otherwise.Second, I made a follow-up mistake by leaving my suit in the hotel room when I checked out.  I realized it four days later when I needed to wear it....  So I called up the hotel and spoke with John in security (near Thanksgiving weekend).  After nothing showed up in the system, John went back to the lost and found area and searched through everything until he found the suit.  So I didn't have to go Black Friday shopping.I dislike making such silly mistakes, but I am thankful that the incredibly great staff was there to help me get through it.  Aside- the room (parlor) was quaint, reasonably priced, and had a great view.  I would definitely go back.Can I just review the hamburgers at the bar? Oh dear lord, that was probably the best hamburger I've had in forever. Kinda raw on the inside, a little burnt on the out, on a fresh bun that was just sopping up the juices spilling down my hands. Oh, burger, I want you now. And the fries! The fries too were awesome. Drinks, on the other hand, are highway robbery. The hotel, you ask? The hotel was beautiful, had a great (and I mean great) work out center, and was really attentive to our needs as a huge conference. They even discounted us a ton of money because our needs changed. Not locked into a contract = awesome hotel. Beds are comfy, and my friend even got upgraded to a harbor view because it was her birthday. Love these guys. Eat the burger!I have been here since Tuesday for a conference and I am very impressed and pleased to indicate that the service, food, and facility has been fantastic!I've stayed at Hyatt Regency hotels in Philly, Chicago, and this one in Baltimore. This review pretty much constitutes my take on all three (and probably many other similar properties) although Chicago's doesn't have a rooftop pool like Philadelphia and Baltimore. The good news: great location, friendly staff, impressive atrium and lobby, many nice amenities, small but adequate rooftop pool, very well stocked fitness center, BUT... ENOUGH with the constant nickeling and diming! Just because expense account wielding, per diem brandishing, porn-renting business travelers and the blackberry/airport shuttle/never-leave-the-hotel-crowd are willing to pay for internet doesn't mean non-business, leisure travelers should have to. It's 2009, and internet should be, if not free, at least NOT BLOCKED IN THE LOBBY!! [NOTE: You can take your laptop across the street to the Renaissance Hotel lobby and your wireless will work there.] I suppose $27 a day self-parking is pretty standard, but there's ample street parking available behind the hotel and one block over. And what's the point of having nice new flatscreen, high definition televisions if you're not going to pump in an HD signal? Oh, and I saw Dick Gregory at the hotel bar. I thought he had died, but (if I may paraphrase Mark Twain) reports of his demise apparently have been greatly exaggerated.Atteneded a weddding In Baltimore and This was the Hotel of choice.I couldnt be happier to be Downtown walking distance from a lot of bars and restaurants. About a 15 min drive from the airport. Costs about $30 by cab.The rooms are in keeping with this class of hotel as was the service.My only issue was that the Parking was expensive.We ended up here after our other hotel was flooded. It's quite the story. The staff was professional, friendly and adaptable, and we were very grateful for that! I thought the rooms were really quite nicely designed, the bathrooms in particular.A gripe is that one thing I love about hotel sleeping are the blackout curtains. There are not. The glow a soft orange in the light.","['well', 'earned', 'star', 'review', 'excellent', 'around', 'room', 'comfy', 'bed', 'large', 'beautiful', 'views', 'downtown', 'large', 'walk', 'shower',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/baltimore-marriott-waterfront-baltimore-3,Baltimore Marriott Waterfront,3.5,$$$,126,"We went for a weekend getaway and really enjoyed ourselves!  We were within walking distance of many great restaurants with high rating on Trip Advisor and even some featured on DDD!Upon entering the hotel we were greeted by staff and appreciated the grand, big and beautiful entrance way.Our check-in was nearly perfect (we just didn't get the king bed room we booked). The clerk who checked us in was very nice and professional and smiled the entire time.The room we did get was very nice and had an AMAZING view of the harbor (see our pics!).  Room temp control was perfect and quiet.  Bathroom was functional, clean, in perfect working order and had an AMAZING shower!  Bed was comfy but it was good that we got two beds to choose from in our room as one was broken and one side of it was 6"" lower than the other side.The staff that we encountered were all friendly, with exception of one complaint we made about a server in Apropoe's, who was rude and not attentive.Concierge was very helpful and friendly.Good attention to detail was noticed in the upkeep of this beautiful grand property!We really enjoyed ourselves and will most definitely be back!Valet pricing is unbelievable for Baltimore... I could see maybe in NYC, but Baltimore? Get real. Came here on a Saturday night for my husband's holiday party. His company has held their event at this location for the last 2 years. They rented out one of the ballrooms and had a cocktail hour, formal dinner, after party and brunch the following morning. The food here was pretty terrible. The bison served at dinner was okay, but the accompanying horseradish tasted and resembled sour cream. The root vegetables were extremely undercooked and all of the water (at dinner, at the after party and brunch) had way too much lemon in it. It was impossible to find water that did not have very pungent lemon in it. Also, none of the bartenders know how to make an Old Fashioned the correct way. Really? That should be like a basic drink that all bartenders know how to make. Following the dinner and dancing, there was an after party in a private room connected to the bar. Again, the food was underwhelming and almost inedible. The sliders were bland and the griddled onions were ice cold. The pizza was not cut all of the way through, so multiple people were tearing pieces apart with their hands and placing the leftover back on the platter (gross!). Brunch the next morning was pretty much a repeat of the night before. For an expensive hotel, you would think the food would be way better and higher quality. If the food wasn't bad, the room sure was! There was a space for a mini fridge, with no mini fridge in it (cheap and tacky). The room walls were paper thin! At 5 a.m. I was woken up by the next room showering and running water and a child crying. This went on for hours. If my husband's company decides to choose this location again, I will make sure to NOT book a room and just go home for the night and also eat a big dinner beforehand.I've been fortunate to stay here several times a year for work and every time is better then the rest! The veiws are stunning and rooms clean and staff friendly. I like the big counter in the bathroom and variety of furniture in the room. Room service is also a bonus! This is one my favorite hotels in Baltimore because I know it will always be a fabulous stay!The only horrible part was the parking.  I phoned down to have my car retrieved, I was told 10 minutes. I was fine with that because checking out and gathering a child under 3 is a task.  I got to the valet stand and they told me they are running behind (it's been 15 minutes or so) I went out side to wait... So after 20 additional minutes I asked for my keys... I told them keep the $45 bucks for valet I requested my car 30 minutes ago and this is far from convenient.  So after 35 minutes my car finally comes and they guy still expected a tip! My tip was fix the incorrect pricing marked at $38 bucks for valet. I think I will be a Hilton person going forward, I feel more valued.This is one of the nicest Marriott hotels that I've ever stayed at!  We were partying in Baltimore for a night and chose to stay here.Check-in was slow due to other events going on that evening (wedding, One Direction Concert, Moonrise Festival, etc.) but check out was swift and they allowed us to check out late.  Valet was also accommodating during our stay. The room was comfortable -- the pillows were plush and there were plenty of towels in the bathroom.  We also had a lovely view of the harbor.  The location is prime and within walking distance to the Inner Harbor area.Let me start by saying I am a frequent marriot user. The hotel itself is great. Newer. Great location. So why 2 stars...... THE STAFF. front desk was fine. But the concierge is a joke. The desk in the lobby was rude. Would not look at me. Ignored me. And when they finally looked up we short and snappy..BTW I was asking about the in house restaurant. But end up going elsewhere due to the impression the concierge left with me. Next day, concierge lounge for breakfast... rude rude rude! No good morning. Just rude blank stares and frozen milk. Usually these lounge are happy, fun places! I will probably look to stay at the another property next month. If this place gets some nicer staff, it would be a 5 star.We only live around 20 miles from the hotel but we love coming to Baltimore and staying here at least twice a year. We've been coming for 5 years now and the hotel just keeps improving. The view has always been amazing in every room we've been in, the breakfast is awesome and of course nothing is better than a Marriott bed. What made our stay last night the best ever was the service. The service here in the past was always a solid 4 star. The service last night went well beyond the maximum 5 stars I can give it. Everyone that we dealt with during our stay was top notch professional. I won't stay anywhere else when I'm in Baltimore.Not the best and not the worst... just okI expected the Marriott Waterfront to be beautiful.  And from the outside, it is.  Even the lobby is beautifully appointed.  Scratch this glossy surface and you see the real Marriott... an aging hotel struggling to keep up.  The room was clean but decor dated.  Perhaps a decade old in appearance.  The furniture is quite worn.  The mattresses are way too soft.  I suspect not by intention but by wear and tear!  My back was stiff every morning from the lack of support.  I could literally feel my body sink into the mattress.  I had to order room service twice.  The first night I had the caesar salad which had a dressing so thick I had to dab it with a fork!  The crab cakes were too dry and rather bland.  The second night, I had the green salad with ranch dressing (not the best ranch I have had but at least fresh greens).  The grilled salmon with broccolini and mashed potatoes was quite good however.Service was not great.  Housekeeping forgot to tidy my room one day and I called the front desk to send someone up while I was out for the evening.  That never happened.  When I checked in, the staff member swiped my card so many times it triggered a fraud lock from my credit card company.  That took 30 minutes to fix.  The only cool thing was the a member of the cast of House of Cards stayed here and was extremely friendly.I have stayed at the Hyatt near the convention center and that was much nicer.  Marriott has some catching up to do!Nice hotel. Great location. Room is comfortable but the hallway on the 27th floor is freezing.My stay at this Marriot was great!  I was impressed with the ambience of the hotel and the front desk reception.  Thanks Iriana!  She was awesome and soooo helpful, she is one of the few reasons why I am still married to Marriot.  She and the staff at this hotel work hard and are superb in giving customer service, professional, and exudes the Marriot brand. This hotel will be on the map for me as a returning guest and suggesting to others to ""get married"" and visit for those who want to be treated as a royal!I thought this hotel would have had more to offer! The location is nice! Parking is tricky!! $27! No real signs in the garage to let you know where to go once you exit your car. The lobby was cute, fresh orange infused  wAter when you come in, we were greeted right away! The front desk staff were really nice and fast, but not hasty! She gave me a ton of coupons for local restaurants. The room was small. Had some water stains below the thermostat but clean (505) . My tv kept  scrambling!! I couldn't watch a thing!!!! I had a ton of towels, no shower cap, no toothpaste! I guess I expected more from this hotel! I had a good drink at the bistro for happy hour!! Very strong for $5!! Breakfast was not free either it wasn't nasty but again not what u expected for this flagship!! Maybe I had higher expectations for this hotel!! The staff and bed comfort are why I am giving 3 stars ! I just don't think it's worth the money!! I had bigger rooms and more personals offered at a cheaper and lower star hotel!!My wife and I stayed here for our 25th wedding anniversary. Wonderful room, excellent view, but the service at the hotel was not up to par.Suite package came with champagne and strawberries, but they took more than 5 hours to arrive, and then only after I called the desk. Strawberries were not chilled, brown stems, still wrapped in plastic? Really? The apology from the person on the phone sounded like she was reading from a script. No follow-up after the fact. Disappointing to say the least.Excellent service and there was always attentive staff readily available to direct us and answer our questions. We had a problem with our room AC and after reporting, we promptly had someone in the room who fixed it quickly. My boyfriend forgot his belt and we were leaving for a wedding in 15 minutes, the manager hooked him up with a new Kenneth Cole belt and we didn't miss our shuttle! The rooms were clean and our bed was comfy. The place is in a nice area and they have  bar and restaurant on the main floor. This is our new place to stay when visiting Baltimore. Highly recommend staying here during your trips as well!What happened Marriott??!?  Guess I haven't stayed at one in a while but the quality has really gone down. Why are my sheets paper thin and the beds looking so cheap?  Is it because I'm on the 7th floor and I should have waited for a better room when I checked in?  My group is taking up at least 13 rooms here tonight and this is just a joke. I use to think Marriott was a decent chain but this experience has opened my eyes. My sink was leaking water so I called front desk. First person had an attitude and didn't apologize.  I had to ask for a supervisor. Then the supervisor offered sending someone to fix it but it's already 12am and I'm in my pjs. He told me that the cost is already being billed to the group. I don't care who's paying for it but where's the customer service?  It's almost seems like he thought I shouldn't care because I'm not personally paying for the room. Also, the door between my room and the adjoining room isn't completely sealed. Light shines through the bottom of the door enough to illuminate my room so I had to stuff a few towels in between. Location 4 starsCustomer Service 2 stars Cleanliness of room 3 starsBedding 2 stars (they used to have down comforters)Bathroom products 2 stars I will think twice before staying at another Marriott again. Did they recently have some budget cuts?  Normally my group uses boutique hotels so I'm surprised that we are even staying here. I asked for the manager to call me tomorrow morning for a solution so we'll see if that happens.This hotel is in Baltimore's Inner Harbor. The staff were friendly, polite, and supportive of our requests for assistance. They were able to help with vegetarian and vegan options for food during a wedding we attended. Parking is in an adjacent lot for $26 with in-out privileges. Pay slightly more for a harbor view room.Beautiful hotel right on the water.  You are able to walk to numerous restaurants in the area.  hotel staff super friendly and very accommodating.  Valet parking is expensive but that was expected for this area.  The breakfast buffet was reasonable considering everything they offered.  I would definitely stay at this hotel againLove the location. - it is right on the water with a watet taxi stop.  The associates a very friendly and helpful.  My only complaint is the bed.  The bed was too soft and the pillows way too fluffy.  My neck got a crick in it while I was attempting to sleep with it.  The bed  cost the Marriott one star; otherwise I would have rates it a 5 star.Now I had the pleasure of staying here for a work event for two nights. The stay was simply amazing. The view was very nice. I truly enjoyed my stay. They take customer service to another level and make sure all needs are met.The in house restaurant was one of the best I've been too in a hotel. They even have really good drinks. I was able to get my champagne and St.Germaine. The only complaint I have was the annoying alarm clock from the room next door which woke me up at 12:49 AM. I had to make two request to have it turned off. My suggestion would be to make sure you disable the alarm clock after a person checks out.If you need a place within this area, I would highly recommend them. I would give the 4.5 if we can do half stars.Great location and beautiful views of the harbor and bay.... it was an amazing hotel with a great elite club and breakfast. The room service, although expensive, was good. I would return for business or leisure.This location would get 5 stars if it had a slightly better room service for price, and was a little less expensive.  I feel you are paying for location not so much value.Was here for a conference and have to say this is a beautifully designed hotel. The bathrooms are great. I loved the bamboo decorations. I did not get into the hotel rooms so I can't speak to those.","Here on a work trip, this hotel was perfect location for many reasons.  Near an amazing running trail and some pretty incredible restaurants, this hotel needs to be considered on your next trip to Baltimore.  Impressive hotel bar and solid workout room, this Marriott ranks high on my list!  My only complaint is an odd one...be weary of the shower floor.  I fell as I stepped inside it this morning and laid there for a moment wondering if I broke something.  Please Marriott, put some grippers in your tubs or change to a different cleaning solution.This hotel is in a great location right on the water and soon as you walk out the door and make a right there is the water taxi landing. All of the staff was friendly and the room was clean and had great views of the inner harbor.  if you're in the area you should try this hotel out.I have stayed at this hotel a couple of times. Never any problems.  This time was awesome !! We were greated and checked-in by Jesus who we later found out was Hispanic like us. He give us an inner harbor view rather than the city view. That was much appreciated and thank Jesus for that. We had a great stay and will continue to go back to this hotel when in Maryland.Always seem to have an issue at this hotel, wether it's no hot water, a noise problem, or poor TV service. Plus, as a Gold Elite, I would expect at least a bottle of water in the room, but nothing. Also have a room adjacent to the elevators (despite my preference to be away from them) and have to listen to them all night. Plenty of other options in this area. I'm done with this property.Second time staying at this gorgeous hotel.I was injured on my job during my stay and needed a wheelchair and crutches.The entire staff took care of me and made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable. The service has been impeccable and all of the staff went WAY out of their way for me.Food was excellent but it's the kindness and courtesy of the staff that keeps me coming back.The warm, salt water pool is great, also!I had the pleasure of staying here for the Kronos PCW  conference and was very impressed not only with the nice room (I had a gorgeous view on the harborside) but with the level of service and food they had for the conference. It's a beautiful hotel that is a little aged but still a great place to stay. The location is perfect as we all walked back from a dinner cruise across the harbor stopping at many attractions along the way. And on the other side you head towards Fells point and little Italy where there's lots of food and shopping. The staff was very attentive and were readily available for transportation when we needed it without having to wait. Definitely somewhere we would enjoy staying again.If you are staying in Baltimore, stay here. It's a gorgeous hotel, in a more than perfect location. It's within walking distance of the harbor, power plant, and countless restaurants and bars. We stayed on the 30th floor. Gorgeous view of the harbor from our room. Room was clean and well stocked. The staff is nice and helpful. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of the following;We stayed here in late March. It was cold that weekend (30 degrees) and the lobby was FREEZING due to people not using the revolving door. They used the large handicapped ones that stayed open for a period of time, letting all the cold air into the hotel. You honestly couldn't walk into the lobby without a jacket. If you were at apropoes (their in house restaurant/bar) it was cold in there as well. We were missing a blanket on one of the beds. We didn't take notice at first because the duvet cover was on the bed, there was no duvet in it however. By the time we got in from our evening, it was late and we didn't feel like dealing with the hassle. And lastly. The Starbucks. Good grief. The people running the Starbucks were clueless. I waited 17 minutes for 3 lattes. There was 2 people working and  they were unorganized and didn't seem to be ""with it"" at all.Overall, it was an amazing hotel. Id absolutely stay there again.The location is positively perfect.  Staff is very nice.  Love the valet guys and the guy that facilitates out there who looks like Secret Service.  They were all so nice!  We had a corner King with an amazing Harbor View.  Very clean, nice and reasonable for the level/city/view that it is.For two nights, I have dealt with loud noises from the room next door. The first night, I couldn't sleep. They allowed some party. The second night (now), they continue. There must be 20 people in the room. I have called the front desk. They sent a security guard up who asked them to be quite.. but they have not. Wny would the guard not have told them of having too many people in the room? Can they be moved to another room? I am paying a signifiant price for this room and am very displeased with the experience.... The good side - the view was good.Beautiful  weather and that was the extent  of it.  Checked in and used the bathroom.  As I sat there, water splashed  up on my ass!  OK something  must be wrong.  This is not a bidet?  Called room service  and a very nice gentle came to check toilet.  As we asked him about the area, the toilet decided to flush on its own.  Marriott  decided to move us to another room.  View of the harbor was gone, king size bed, gone!   We asked to be moved.  We final move to a nice room with everything  we wanted.  My wife was freshening up and came out  of the bathroom  and almost fell!  There was water covering the floor outside the bathroon!  3:30 am in the morning  and this of all things.  Again,  called room service  and we were moved to another room.  And compensated for the night, really?  I have been running  around all night changing  rooms.  I was under the impression this would be a nice visit in a nice hotel.  Baltimore  harbor  was over priced and not really too much to do unless your an alcoholic.    Thanks but no thanks.This is the most gorgeous hotel.  The lobby is classy, yet inviting.  We ate in the restaurant quite a bit and the food was tasty.  All of the staff from reception to bell man to wait staff are top notch with their customer service.  The room was well-cleaned and taken care of.  The view was awesome!  I don't have enough good things to say about this hotel.  We stayed 10 days and 9 nights.  If you are going to the airport, take their flat rate vehicle back to the airport - much more reasonable than a taxi.  Love the location as you can get to all the activities around the harbor.  Restaurants are a bit expensive in the surrounding area - the James Joyce pub is very reasonable nearby, and the Hawaiian restaurant has impeccable food and service for a nice date night.I work in event planning and have worked with many hotels, including other Marriotts. If you are planning an event in Baltimore, I'd recommend finding a different hotel in the area. The event staff at this hotel is very difficult to work with. I called every day for two weeks trying to get a hold of an events person to book a meeting room. I was told there was only one events person I could talk to, and was always transferred to her voicemail, and my calls were never returned. I asked to speak to anyone else who could help me, and was told there wasn't anyone else in events. When I finally got in touch with that person, I was tossed around to two other people (evidently they had two other events people...). When I finally was put in touch with someone to work with, they didn't assist with booking the AV equipment, but told me I needed to call that office to do it myself. They also quoted me a different price on the food than was on their menu. When I would call to get clarification or help, they acted very inconvenienced and were short with me. I am trying to book a very small meeting - lunch meeting for 10 people - and it has taken 4 weeks so far. Everything still isn't done because they haven't sent me the credit card payment sheet. I highly recommend using a different hotel for your meetings.Stayed NYE.  Simple breakdown on the hotel:Cleanliness- 5/5Customer Service- 5/5 (Assistant Mgr, I think her name was Andrea, was so helpful.  Ordered and had terrible service getting take out Pizza they recommended.  She was so professional, friendly and helpful and helped me with my issues. Great Manager)Room Amenities:  3/5- We have stayed at SEVERAL lower value hotels in cities all over that came standard with microwave.  This room didn't have one which disappointed me but wasn't a deal breaker.  One thing that was terrible and made it unbearable to sleep was how silent it was.  The room felt so quiet, there was no fan fan option to keep a constant flow of air  and some noise and it was either cold or hot.  No in-between.  We were also stuck in a handicap room which felt strange, even more so when it took 5 mins to close our door and double that time to figure out how to turn the shower on.I would not stay at this hotel again for the price combination and lack of room amenities and comfortability but would recommend to someone looking to stay in the area for customer service alone.Thanks!Got a great deal on Friday night of opening day, room was much better than the game.  Walking distance to the harbor shops.  Very clean.  Nice cafe and bar. Shower was like a power washer, so no water pressure problems here.  Beds were comfy.It's a Marriott. It's a hotel. Nothing that makes me go WOW.  There are chain standards etc. My boyfriend and I were here for a conference he was attending. Good thing he double checked at check in, they were going to give us a room with two double beds, when he clearly booked a king. Because they ""made a mistake"" we were given a ""free harbor view upgrade"".  Eh, ok, whatever.  We got up to our room and that upgrade was worth it, as our nightly view has been amazing!That being said, these are PAPER THIN walls!!! We have a room that could be adjoining to the room next door, and the amount of things we hear, are ridiculous. We've heard our neighbor's ""romantic interludes"", as well as (no lie), a morning fart. (To name the more memorable things we've heard.) Doors slam, no bumpers, no soft close hinges...nothing.So to conclude: decent hotel, but bring earplugs.I appreciate the automatic room upgrade they do for platinum members , like yours truly ;).  We get the best view all the time. Great customer service.Great location and comfortable beds. Not so great service and unclean rooms. Our room had food on the floor and hairs in the bathroom. There are no vending machines and room waters were $4.Great ambiance as soon as you walk into the lobby.. Complementary Apple cider and fruit infused water also offered in lobby. Only compliant was that the door keys kept giving us a problem and we had to make multiple trips to main desk for new keys.After completely destroying my girlfriend's apartment's ceiling with a fire sprinkler (don't ask), I was unable to clean up in her completely flooded bathroom (don't ask) and ended up driving both of us - one of us (me) covered in flecks of ceiling and stupdiity - to the Marriott Waterfront for an emergency hotel room at 4:00 AM.  The man at the desk took my money, did not ask why I was covered in bits of ceiling, and let us stay in the room slightly past check-out time.  Enough said.Worst place that me and my family has ever been too !!!!!!  We went down over the holiday weekend 5/23-5/24, We get there we check into our room, the bathroom was not cleaned it had BM on the toilet yet !!!!!!! Then we get the room was by the elevator, weheard the thing going up and down all night. This wasn't the kicker. It was when we had ordered room service witch by the way sucks !!!! So we put the cart outside the door for them to take ( now mind you its 10:00 at night ) the next morning we got up to go out and it was still there. At 1:00 when we got back from going out it was still there and our room wasn't even cleaned yet !!!! So we call the front desk they said somebody will be there to clean the room. So they accommodate us by giving us chocolate bars , chocolate cookies and soda!!!!! REALLY this was not what we were expecting from this hotel that is very pricey!!!! I will NEVER return to this hotel again","I booked a one night stay at the Baltimore Marriott on Priceline- I was expecting a crappy, parking-lot view room, and so was pleasantly surprised to find myself on the fifteenth floor with a gorgeous harbor view.  Even though the rooms here feel a tiny bit tired (the hotel just seems in need of an update -- a fresh coat of paint, some brighter lights in the bathroom, and so on), the harbor views are spectacular, and the rooms are spacious even if, as is often the case at Marriotts, you might feel nickled and dimed a lot ($12.95 for internet, $25/night for self-parking).  The one piece of advice I have: this is a thin-walled hotel, and the staff seems to know it (the sign by the elevator on the 15th floor urged guests to be quiet as they walked down the hallway!) - you will hear folks in the hallway even when they are quiet, and you will hear when your neighbors turn the water on in the morning for a shower.  So I could imagine in the busy season when the hotel is full, things could be a bit noisy.If you're coming to Baltimore, this is certainly one of the hotels you want to put on your list. It has an excellent  view of the harbor, and It is also the perfect hotel for any wedding party. Expect to see a sea of brides making their way through the lobby during the summer months, The rooms are plush and elegant, and it is no wonder this location is so popular with those planning a wedding. The Baltimore Marriott Waterfront boasts a professional and excellent staff. However, my only complaint involves the valet and bellman service. I asked a valet to retrieve my wedding gift from the trunk of my car, and I even tipped him in advance. However, when he returned, my gift was missing its card, but to his credit he retraced his steps and found the card in the parking garage. This still would have been ok; hey, accidents happen. However, later that day I was tasked with driving 30 miles to pick up the wedding party's flowers. I was under a serious time crunch and managed to make it back with just 5 minutes to spare. I had to park my friend's car (not valet parked), so I asked a bellman to take the flowers to the bride's suite while I parked the car. I gave him the room number and the name of the wedding party in case there was a problem, but 15 minutes later I got a call that the flowers had not arrived. One of the bridesmaids went down in the lobby and found the flowers just sitting on a cart like so much discarded trash. Now, I don't know if you have ever seen a matron of honor on the warpath, but i can tell you it is not a pretty sight.To be fair, the wedding was a huge success and all was forgiven. Also, the bell captain was extremely understanding which means a lot. Except for this one incident, the weekend was flawless, but I still have to 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Still, this hotel would always be my first choice for its location, rooms, and genrally excellent staff.Waiting for my room and already I rate this better than the Hyatt Baltimore. The lobby / lounge / coffee/bar area has a cool vibe and a great place to hang out and kill time if you need to. Free WiFi for the day is also a bonus in comparison to the Hyatt, and almost a given with any hotel that wants to cater to any business traveller. Might change my rating once I see the room, but so far, including service, far and above the Baltimore Hyatt. Can't exactly complain about the waterfront view either...Staff is wonderful, the location is perfect and the rooms were nice.  I'll be coming back!Pretty hotel. Not luxury. Rooms were small and noisy. I could hear showers and movement in the surrounding rooms. Staff was great. Thier only restaurant apropoes was great for a bar and breakfAst, but the regular menu was pretentious and not kid friendly. The pool lifeguard was great. Nice sauna. The rooms need updating.GOODLocation is ideal and central. Gym. Swimming pool. Outdoor terrace. Restaurant. Staff was super nice and friendly.NOT SO GOODMy coffee cup had stains and lipstick - asked for a new one - got the same one back.Room was facing the same side as the outdoor concert space. Music can be played until 11pm, so check your room or the concert schedule in advance.What a wonderful location for a company meeting! Our company meeting this week has been amazing! The staff here has done everything possible to provide a fabulous experience for this company meeting, housing and feeding and providing for over 1000 people! Thank you, Marriott!!This hotel and its employees are top-notch. I stayed here in Feb. 2015 for a long weekend with 13 add'l family members (over 4 rooms), and our stay was terrific.We had a fantastic meal at Apropoe, and our waitress Ashley was a gem. She went above and beyond in making us feel well cared-for. I really like that this hotel is quiet, despite having a very full hotel that weekend, and running numerous private events in the ballrooms including a major fund-raiser and a wedding. The central location and beautiful views enhance the overall vacation experience.My only note for improvement is that the prep for our food and drinks in the bar and in the restaurant took way too long, but I got the sense that the kitchen was slammed. Fortunately the quality of the food and our our attentive waitress made it all worth it.I recently stayed at the Baltimore Marriott for a 3-day conference, and really enjoyed my visit. I don't typically feel super comfortable in hotel rooms, but my room at the Marriott was clean, the pillows and bed were comfortable, and the shower had normal water pressure, all of which contributed to my comfortable stay. The restaurant bar located in the hotel lobby is a fun place to hang out and meet other conference attendees. I can only speak for the white crab pizza, but it's delicious! The customer service at this hotel is also great. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. The only con to my stay was that the noise in the hallway was somewhat bothersome, especially at 2:30am on the Saturday night of my stay. Given the large size of the hotel, it makes sense that there would be several events taking place at the same time; however, I woke up 2 out of the 3 nights of my stay due to people talking in the hallway and the sound of doors closing (i.e., bring your own white noise). Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my stay, and would definitely book with the Marriott again.A first-class business hotel and conference center in the heart of Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Little Italy and Fells Point are both just a short walk away, as are dozens of outstanding restaurants, shops and attractions. I can't imagine a better place to stay when visiting Baltimore for business or pleasure.Great location, but be sure to ask for the specific view and bed size you want or you will end up facing the parking lot like we did!  Walls are VERY thin, so there's nothing to be done if you have noisy neighbors.  Very corporate and busy hotel, so it's hard to receive consistent customer service.  Housekeeping barged in on us after knocking before we had the chance to say ""come back later!""The Marriott was a really nice hotel in a great location. It is right near a water taxi stop, going to be right by a free water taxi (Harbour Connector), and also sits on the Green and Orange Charm City Circulator routes. The hotel is in a quieter area of downtown right on the water. There are offices, new condos and shops and restaurants nearby. It looks like a really newly developed area and there was still some construction, though not near or in the hotel so it didn't cause any issues. The free circulator routes get you to the main downtown or fun areas like Fell's Point very quickly. There are lots of great comfy seating areas on the lobby level of the hotel with free Wifi: a busier area by the restaurant and a smaller quieter area by the concierge. The gym is on the 5th floor separated from the lobby by two banquet levels. Rooms on high floors I would say are preferable and of course Harbour view rooms. I enjoyed the view of the Harbour from my 14 floor room. Even standard rooms come with three massive floor to ceiling windows which are just great for taking in the sunrise/set. The room did heat up quite a bit thanks to the big windows so I had to keep the AC on, but the view is still worth it. The rooms had a nice entrance to them, painted in an accent colour of red. The little coffee bar with glass shelves and the double door white closet were nice contrasts to this space. On the other side was the bathroom. It was pretty basic with a shower/tub combo and single sink. It was well stocked with various towel size options though. However I only found one bar of soap and no liquid soap so I had to share that one bar between the shower and sink. There were plenty of plugs both on the desk and on the lamp next to the bed for plugging in iDevices. Each headboard also had a little worm light coming out of it so you could read in bed without disrupting a roommate (not that I had one - there were only double bed rooms when I checked in). That's not a complaint however. I checked in at 0830 so I was really impressed to be given a great view, despite the extra bed, before the breakfast guests of the night before even cleared. Marriott made a move to win me over there! I didn't have a chance to eat in the restaurant as there are so many great spots nearby. There is a small cafe though with grab and go options I stopped in before check out. All in all a great stay and I'd do it again next trip for sure!Wonderful hotel great location and amenities recent upgrades to the restaurant called apropoe and the bar and inside seating area made this it must stop will come back here once a year in October like we have been for the past few years thanks Marie appreciate your hospitalityAs far as Marriotts go, this is one of the better ones.  I spent almost a week here for a conference, and while I didn't spend much time in my room (despite the fact it had FANTASTIC harbor view), I will say that every single employee I encountered went above and beyond.  There have been instances when I have been at a hotel for a conference my company was hosting, and the staff either wasn't friendly, was absent, or had the personality of a turnip.This was not the case here.  Everyone was fantastic, from the valets, to the front desk staff, to those who worked banquets.  I know many of my peers hold their meetings here, and I would recommend it to anyone.  Be forewarned, however, that if your meeting is large and you have a lot of breakout rooms/exhibit space, it will most likely be on two floors, although the escalator is very conveniently located.It does take some navigation, but with proper signage, it's easy enough to figure out.This hotel is in such a great location! They're just a short walk from a ton of bars and restaurants. The staff is so helpful and informative. Will definitely be back!Wow. What a fabulous hotel. The views of the harbor are absolutely spectacular. I stayed here for a work conference and really enjoyed everything about it. The location of being right off the harbor enabled us to be able to just take a walk around the harbor, or just grab a bite to eat at one of the many restaurants near by. Of course the weather being sunny and fall like just added to the experience.Our meals during the work day were catered by the hotel and the food was very good. The rooms were very clean and extremely comfortable. My co-worker had higher status so she got a suite which was very roomy...two sets of windows to view the harbor.For those who have access to and are into hearing about the concierge lounge...the views and food there were excellent too.Service overall was top notch. However I chose the self-park option ($27) versus valet ($40) for parking the car.Besides the hotel location being prime for the harbor view, it also was only ~20 minutes from the airport (though I am sure that can change based on the traffic).I really enjoyed my stay here, it was everything I could expect. The room was comfortable and spotless with great views of the harbor and downtown. There was a large wedding here during my stay and I didn't notice it at all except when I had to walk through people in the lobby, so points for the quiet stay up on the room levels. The staff was very helpful and answered questions, helped me out with a problem/adjustment to my bill, and were otherwise excellent. Room service was good, service was quick and friendly, and the portions were generous. I was able to leave my bags with the front baggage people and wander around the harbor for a few hours between check-out and when I had to leave for the airport. The staff outside is great at giving directions or grabbing you a cab in a matter of seconds. The location is excellent and within walking distance to everything in the Inner Harbor as well as down to Fell's Point. I walked maybe 10 blocks back from Fell's Point in the middle of the night after not finding a cab who would take me the short way and had no issues.The Baltimore Marriott Waterfront is a swank hotel located in a little shopping/restaurant plaza in Baltimore. It lives up to the waterfront name with an awesome view of the harbor if you pony up more money for a room with a view. However, you can name your own price on priceline and end up with this hotel for a good price, and the rate qualifies you for a room with a partial view. The lobby and room are both very modern and clean, and the staff here is really attentive and accommodating. My only complaint is that you have to park in the parking structure next door, and it's a bit cumbersome to take three elevators to get to your room. Also, there are no ins and outs, so you have to pay each time you enter and exit. If you plan on going in and out, it's better to pay the $5 extra to valet ($40/night) versus the $35 max for the parking structure.Beautiful hotel with a perfect location in Harbor East. I stay here whenever I can. Check in was fast and the breakfast buffet was delicious. They just re-vamped the hotel restaurant and the area is sleek and stylish. Definitely recommend this hotel for travelers.This hotel does not remind you of the Marriott property.  The staff does not do very well at communicating amongst each other nor do they even do a good job at communicating with guests. I called the hotel to check on parking and was told three different stories before getting to the facility and then when I get here there was a fourth story which is unacceptable. My faucet in my shower is leaking and has not been repaired. I advised the front desk of this leaky faucet Friday and it is now Sunday I am sure their maintenance on staff 24 seven with a facility like this. I would not return to spend personal money here.","Love it!I come here every so often for some fun in the city, the staff are competent and know what they are doing. Check in took about a minute and I was in my room in 2. Rooms are spectacular, and the views are amazing, no matter what angle.I really like the pool. But the lifeguards are nazis with the kids.Way over priced. Our rooms had a  beautiful view but the bathroom was tiny and cheep. Pillows were not great. And you can hear through the walls. Also we had terrible service at the restaurant. The waitstaff was disorganized. Waited forever for pancakes.  I will never stay again especially for what they charge. Next time it's the Four Seasons.I've stay at many hotels in my day and just recently started travelling again. Just finished a week at this Marriott and I had a very pleasant experience. My room was clean and I had great view of the city.The food at the restaurants were better than I expected.Everyone who helped us, from the front desk to the bellman was very efficient and friendly.I would highly recommend this hotel and it is walking distance to many great restaurants and things to do.Worse experience. My door would stay open and a man walked into my room. He said the door was open. I called  downstairs and they sent security and told me it was not an employee. This man was obviously coming into my room to steal my things. The entire rest of my stay I became very paranoid that this man would come back and try to get back in. I did not feel security was taking it very seriously. I then later realized he was coming off the street and going door to door trying to open doors and my broken door that would not close properly was his ticket in. Very unimpressed with my stay. They was also supposed to send an engineer to check out the door but no one came.Came here for the Emmy's (my husband was nominated, not me!). The hotel itself was gorgeous, much more so than I expected for a Marriott in Baltimore. Loved the huuuuge chandeliers in the ballroom. The service was also fabulous as our ~1000 person dinner service was flawless and every step of the way there was someone on staff to direct us.I stayed here last week and had a great experience. Very friendly and helpful staff. We came in town for an Orioles game and was able to walk there from the hotel. Nice stores and restaurants in the immediate area. I would definitely stay here again.Was a wonderful place to stay during my conference.  Friendly staff all around where they constantly greeted you and asked you for help if you looked lost.  Clean rooms, quiet, and relaxing.How does a girl almost completely ruin her engagement proposal from her boyfriend-turned-fiancee? Really, I have been silently giggling at the almost perfect night at this Marriott this weekend; and, how I managed to totally throw my fiancee's surprise plans out of the hotel's scenic window! The quizzical look on the staff member's face after she saw us standing in front of the room with bags at an unexpected hour - priceless. That's another story altogether... The hotel, itself, was beautiful. The valet service was a bit inattentive initially, but came through in the end. The location is prime, and obviously a major factor of why I'm giving it four stars. The room was nice, but the bathroom lacked a certain distinction that I've seen in many other hotels. The best part about our room was the view. Actually, we got a surprise peek at a ""neighbor's"" not-so-private party in his hotel window... All we saw were socks up in the air - perhaps he had just proposed to her, too? Although the bed was comfortable, I didn't sleep much from pure excitement. Overall, the hotel service &amp; charm of the Waterfront contributed to its excellence, so if you're ever in town you know where to book.....The Marriott is a gorgeous high-rise of a hotel perched on the edge of the sparkling waters of the Inner Harbor. Uniformed bellhops assist with bags in an impossibly high ceilinged lobby lined with perfectly arranged flowers and polished marble floors.  Fancy-schmancy one might say.The desk clerks are cool; not the ""hey, dude, welcome to this totally awesome hotel"" but more  icy cool... efficient, professional, a tad snooty even.But, no mattter, the rooms are fabulous - remarkably comfortable beds, pillows like clouds, power strips smartly placed on desks, impeccably clean and well suited for business trips.Request a room on the highter floors with a view. Enjoy the delicious coffee from your own Keurig coffee maker. Beware of the wifi and inroom internet... $12.95 per day.Try the crab and smoked corn chowder at the downstairs restaurant... (out of this world!) Lots of great dining otions within walking distance and the aquarium is right across the bridge.Overall, excellent experience.Don't stay here during spring ... A/C is not on yet, rooms are hot, and they have nothing but thick comforters on the beds.  It's like sleeping in a Sauna. Apparently they have no woven blankets at all.  I've tried 4 times to get a blanket.  I just get more comforters.This review is NOT for the hotel since we live in the area and didn't stay here. My husband and I enjoyed the Star Spangled Celebration on Sunday and decided to go into the Marriott to grab a drink and some appetizers, because we had a Marriott gift card. I asked the bartender if he had any special margaritas, maybe a flavor. He said, ""no just regular"" My husband asked for a bloody mary and I agreed to the ""regular"" margarita and we each ordered the Caesar salads, mine with shrimp and his with grilled chicken and some waters. I said to my husband that he could have said that he could float some grand marnier on top, something! We got our drinks in 10-12oz highball glasses. No salt on mine, wasn't asked if I wanted salt or not but assumed a ""regular"" margarita came with salt. Also since we ARE in Baltimore that my husbands bloody mary would have been rimmed in some old bay. Both drinks were garnished with a lime on the sides. We had to ask for the waters 5 minutes later and for him to wipe the bar which was a sticky mess. A second bartender showed up and we watched him make more than one bloody mary for different patrons and he rimmed 16oz pint glasses with what looked like old bay, garnished with a lime and an olive. The 2nd bartender was in front of us and I asked him if those were bloody marys and he said yes. I asked why our bartender would offer us the 10-12oz glass, no old bay and only a lime. His response was that he was probably trained that way. WHAT? We asked our bartender for the check, we were so turned off we couldn't wait to get out of there. He gave us the check and said that our salads would be right out. I told him we no longer want the salads. He just rang our drinks and handed us that. We didn't even bother with the gift card, we paid cash. Then the 2nd bartender asked if we wanted him to make us another bloody mary---how about my drink?? Offer this AFTER we asked for the check? I asked my husband how much the check was since I saw him leave a $20, he said $9 each with tax $19.02. I would have asked for the change!!. I am certain we paid  the same price the patrons with the 16oz glasses paid for theirs. I believe I saw bartender #2 speaking to bartender #1 and we're hoping he was letting him know why we were leaving and left him such a small tip. We left there and went to the Four Seasons where we were offered impeccable service, great drinks, even got the happy hour prices and ordered some appetizers.The sad thing about this is we aren't nitpicky people at all, may sound like it if you don't know us and are reading this review. I've work in the customer service field and my husband works with the public. We are very generous tippers also, even if the service is just ok as long as it's not bad. This experience at the Marriott was bad all the way around.Beautiful hotel, comfortable room and bed, gorgeous views of harbor, good food...only gripe is that rooms are beyond noisy!! Can hear every little thing going on in adjacent rooms from toilets flushing, showers running, and the ice machine! I asked the front desk for ear plugs and they didn't have any, so I had to sleep with my tv on to try and drown out the noise, which is not something you'd expect to have to do at this type of hotel.While staying here I also attended a conference in the building. The conference rooms were comfortable and the food was great. It was nice to be able to get drinks (coffee, tea, soda, etc) throughout the day and for free.All in all the views were great and it was a nice place, but the only way I'd come back is if it was paid for by work again!The conference I just attended was booked here; while we were offered a special rate, I truly couldn't afford to stay in such a posh hotel, even at a discount. So I have no information on the rooms; this'll be about the conference area.The space was on a grandiose scale, with southern colonial architectural details (complete with a bar lounge tailored to feel like a GOP cigar-and-brandy gentleman's club). The ceilings were at least 25 feet high -- 50, in the escalator foyer between the third and fourth floors... and on the conference room floors, there was this interesting Alice-in-Wonderland feel -- giant oversized wing chairs in yellow leather, checkered walls, carpet in primary colors. I had to take a picture in one of the chairs; I only lacked a teacup and a giant hat for the picture to be complete.The conference rooms were HUGE. Vast, cavernous, and very cold. We sat shivering through lecture after lecture; I resorted to sitting next to the electrical outlet and plugging in my laptop so it would generate some heat. I understand that a room filled with people can get muggy and stuffy, if not properly air-conditioned; I just wish the system were a bit more responsive to the particular circumstances. It's possible that the ridiculously high ceilings made climate control on a human scale impossible.The service machine was very, very smooth. However, if you happened to be eating or drinking anything (there were multiple receptions), you had to physically hang onto the plate/glass, or it would be whisked away, no matter how full it was. I actually engaged in a tug-of-war with one such plate-whisker: with my mouth full of the bite I had just taken, I noticed a hand reach over my left shoulder, and latch onto my mostly-full plate.""MMMM!"" I said. She didn't actually let go of the plate. I scowled at her, my mouth still too full to swallow. She seemed to acquire the idea that something was wrong. ""You're not done?"" she asked. Thinking to myself, Does it look like I'm done? It's a full plate! I just sat down and I'm still chewing!, I say ""MM-MMM!"" She finally relinquished her grip on the plate. But I turned around, clutching my plate, and noticed that another dish-whisker had removed my glass of wine, while I fought for my food. Dammit, I paid for that! (I wonder if the food is just for show... they don't actually want you to eat any of it?) Regardless, the food was consistently excellent (and I have high standards).On Halloween, the hotel actually had free cupcakes, hot chocolate and hot spiced cider in the lobby... VERY GOOD hot chocolate (I couldn't make myself stop drinking it long enough to try the cider). They also offered Starbuck's coffee with every meal service. And while Starbuck's isn't my fave, it was at least REAL coffee, not some industrial truck-stop yuckwater. I drank entirely too much of it, trying to stay warm, and probably resembled an epileptic Chihuahua, to anyone brave enough to try to converse with me.As I was staying at another hotel, and required taxis to travel to and from it, I saw rather a lot of the doormen. They were universally wonderful, hailing cabs, hoisting my rolling laptop carrier into the trunk, stopping the cab that first tried to rip me off and then started to take off with my luggage (the cab-driver didn't start the meter, and tried to charge me twice what it normally cost to make the trip)... friendly, efficient, and professional staff. I made sure to thank them specifically when I left for the last time.Would I stay here, in the future? If I could find a roommate or two to make the trip affordable, I would, happily.What a wonderful experience--if only all hotel stays were like this! My boyfriend and I stayed  at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront on New Year's Eve, and the hotel pulled out all the stops. We were greeted with a champagne welcome and sped through check-in. The bell hops and front desk staff were extremely friendly, helpful, and professional. The hotel lobby and various sitting rooms were festive and lovely. Our room was spacious, impeccably clean, comfortable, and modern, with a gorgeous city/harbor view. As Marriott Rewards Elite members, we received a bottle of free champagne and New Year's Eve favors. We were also invited to a members' party to ring in the new year, but we had other plans for the evening.The hotel is in an excellent location in Baltimore--very upscale. Although we stayed only one night, it was an excellent experience. I highly recommend this hotel! We will be sure to return!Beautiful hotel with all the amenities- free wifi in the lounge, great fitness center, clean rooms and friendly staff. Also can't beat the views of the inner harbor! The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the proximity to the outdoor concert venue Pier 6... my last night in the hotel there was a DJ playing house music there, and the bass was so loud that it literally shook the entire building for hours, until 11pm when the venue is required to close.Full Disclosure:  I'm a Platinum member with Marriott and used points/ free night voucher for this trip.OMG!!  What a great vacation!It all started with an email from my pre-arrival co-ordinator Fulden, asking if we had any special requests.  She followed up with another email telling us she was going to give us a complimentary upgrade to a corner room (more windows) with a Harbor View.  I loved the personal service!Upon arrival, our room was not ready (it was noon, and check in was at 4pm, so no biggie).  We dropped our luggage with the valet and headed off to lunch at Miss Shirley's and an afternoon at the National Aquarium.Once in our room, we opened all the curtains and lost our breath to the view.  Gor-geous!  The room itself was spacious-ly small, elegantly appointed.Concierge Level is open to the Marriott muckity mucks (not sure how high a level you need to be to get in).  It is open from 6am to 10pm, providing unlimited fancy Starbucks coffee and tea, water, soft drinks, internet and printer access, lounging area, etc.  We did breakfast one day (made to order omelet, french toast, fresh fruit, bacon), soup lunch another (crab corn chowder), and evening apps another (wings, hummus and pita, more fresh fruit, brie and crackers).  Very nice perk, and I'd recommend it to any Marriott elites staying at this location.  The staff was attentive and friendly.Hotel location is perfect - close to the touristy Harbor attractions, but also walking distance to Fell's Point and Little Italy.  There is a Water Taxi stop just outside the hotel also.All hotel staff that we came in contact with - front desk, housekeeping, valet, conceirge desk in the lobby - was professional, friendly and very helpful.Splendid hotel!Word on the street is that this Marriott is one of the nicest in the area.  I believe it.  The Waterfront Marriott is spacious, well-decored, and has all you could ask for in a hotel.  I came here for a conference and the staff did a superb job making sure there venue was well-organized.  Refreshments were well maintained throughout the conference.  The staff was courteous and polite.  I found the interior well designed with nice maritime details (such as pictures of sails and line), though the carpet could definitely use improvement.  Plus, the Marriott is located right where the action is in Baltimore, in the Inner Harbor.  Whether it's the aquarium or the Ritz Cabaret, the local destinations are a quick walk away.  On the small chance I come back to Baltimore, I'd come back to the Waterfront.Staying here for the week.  I'm not going to stay here again.  Service is REALLY slow and clean isn't their thing either - my room service tray came with lots of lint (ugh).We decided to stay here over the Renaissane for the night (don't know why lol) when in Baltimore. Check in was fast and efficient, and the gentleman at the front desk was funny and pleasant. Our room was on the 30th floor (WOW!).Upon entering the room, we noticed that it was an adjoining room and also near the elevator, both factors that could make the room noisy. We called the front desk to switch rooms, and the woman speaking (who was essentially whispering) said she'd send a bellhop up. 10 minutes later, no bellhop. We call again, and she says she will double check. 10 minutes later, you guessed it, no bellhop. Finally, one came after 25 minutes--totally unacceptable. Then, all afternoon, the housekeepers let all of the doors bang as they were cleaning--ugh.The room was well equipped with two beds, a flatscreen TV, and a gorgeous view of Baltimore and the Inner Harbor--it was almost as good as looking out on a beach and water. My dad is Marriott Platinum, so we also had access to the concierge lounge. One word: unreal. The concierge lounge is absolutely huge. Lots of food is available, and ice cream sundae bars for dessert. Breakfast consisted of waffles, fruit, pastries, bread, cereal, and really a lot more. It was the best concierge lounge my dad and I had ever been in--and he has stayed way too much at hotels. After we left, we left a complaint to the hotel, and we were immediately sent an apology and credited 10,000 Marriott points--nice. This kind of service makes me want to go back to the hotel. Thumbs up. Overall, it's a good hotel with a great concierge lounge. Make sure you get a floor looking out on the harbor and you're golden!I took my honey here for his birthday while we explored downtown Baltimore. I must say absolutely loved the front desk staff, they were the nicest, sweetest people I have ever met and very accomodating. The beauty of the views of the hotel are just amazing ( I mean I could live here, seriously!) I reccommend even if you already live in Baltimore, around the corner or next door, please take a moment to stay with these lovely folks. Marriott I will be back in the summer!","This is the best service I've received at any Marriott! Highly recommended! I booked a room here and received an email from Leishla Lee, one of the Pre-Arrival Coordinators, before my stay offering her assistance. Since my boyfriend and I had been separated due to work and this was our first getaway since then, I decided to splurge and requested a sparkling wine, wine, and rose petal ""romantic"" greeting.We arrived in Baltimore approximately an hour before check-in and received a key to a room that was described as having a ""partial water view"". However, as we entered the room, room service hadn't quite finished cleaning the room, so we dropped off our bags and headed downstairs for a 15 minute wait in the lounge. The lounge was actually a relaxing place...the seating areas were separated enough that each party sitting in the area had their own separate areas, and it was set to the side of the main lobby, away from the hustle and bustle of people checking in/out. When we walked into the room, my boyfriend was surprised by the rose petal spread and we enjoyed drinking our champagne while looking out at a phenomenal view of the water...there was nothing ""partial"" about it. Leishla called the room to ensure that everything was to our satisfaction and apologized for the room not being ready (which was no problem at all). I also got a voicemail greeting and email from Simon Tetley, a Front Office Supervisor, offering further assistance. This has been the nicest Marriott property I've stayed at and was blown away by the attentive customer service. I will definitely return on my next overnight stay in Baltimore.My boyfriend and I stayed here this past weekend, and we absolutely loved it.  The hotel is located in Harbor East, which is a relatively newly developed area near Inner Harbor.  We loved walking around, stopping in the shops and restaurants nearby.  It's really located in a great and fun area.  Parking was $26 a day in the garage that is connected to the hotel by a walkway, which was convenient and reasonably priced for the area.The lobby of the hotel is beautiful and the staff was very friendly.  Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we left our luggage with the bellhop and walked around the stores nearby.  The front desk attendant took our cell phone number and called as soon as the room was ready, which I thought was very helpful and nice.The room, on the sixth floor, was beautiful and spacious.  There was a large entrance foyer, with a Keurig coffeemaker, which I loved.  There was a large closet with hangers, and a big bathroom, with a large shower and countertop.  They have the curved shower rod, which I love.  There were Bath and Body Works products available, as well.  The room had a gorgeous view of the harbor, and the bed was so insanely comfortable.  We both fell asleep instantly.  There was also a chaise lounge and a desk, providing more seating.  The flat screen television was a plus, as were the reading lights built into the bed.There were several restaurants in the hotel, and we stopped in the breakfast place for Starbucks iced coffee in the morning.  There was also water and some snacks in the lobby while we waited to check in.  This is definitely the best hotel in the Inner Harbor area and I hope to stay here again soon!What a great hotel! I recently attended a 5-day conference at this location and absolutely loved it. All of the staff were excellent, from the doormen, to the people at the front desk, to the housekeeping. The room was spacious, the location excellent, and the conference rooms above average. I highly recommend this hotel. The only things I would complain about is the cost of parking ($25/day) and cost of wi-fi ($12.95, except for where it's free in the lobby). I parked at the Legg Mason building for cheaper and the internet was included in my conference fee. Just wanted to give a heads up on those fees.Incredible harbor view.Rooms were nice and comfy.Our family had a room on the 31st floor and another on the 30th.Only thing I didn't like was their small pool. It took no effort to float, because all the salt in the water. I know, I know, It's not like you're supposed to drink the water, but let's face it, you're swimming in it, some of it's gonna get into your mouth.Trying to book a reservation at this hotel was a 45 minute endeavor.  They employ some of the most unintelligent people I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. If you're going to call yourself a ""reservation specialist,"" perhaps you should actually know how to help a customer book a room!  Telling a customer that you don't know how to reserve a room seems to defeat the purpose of you being employedA reasonably priced hotel in a very nice area of Baltimore. Located within walking distance of shops, restaurants, inner harbor and bars. The area seems to be the nicest in Baltimore. The staff is nice and their rooms are clean. Lobby area is spacious and you can walk outside to the walking area near the water. Parking was the expensive part but your options are limited.I usually don't leave reviews for hotels unless the experience was either memorably good or memorably bad. My stay here, I'm happy to say, was memorably good. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. All your needs will be taken care of. They pay close attention to the details (for example, if you're at the hotel for a conference, there will be coffee and tea served at break times, and water served at all times--and not just plain water, but varieties of citrus water). The bathrooms are awesome--I would hesitate to say that the women's bathroom contained 'stalls,' because what they have is too nice to use such a common word. The location is great--right next to shops and restaurants--and if you walk out the door around checkout time there will be someone there asking if you need a taxi--no need to worry about that yourself. And if you get a room on one of the upper levels, you'll have a great view.This Marriott is definitely better appointed than most of the FS Marriott's I hit. It's closer to a Renaissance than a JW. SUPER comfortable pillows, decently soft mattresses, and spacious meeting areas make this a great place to host an event.  The staff were all friendly and helpful, the catered meals were actually quite tasty, and they were extraordinarily accommodating for our event. That's the good side. The bad side, however, is one of those things that just /pisses/ /me/ /off./ Yes, I'm talking about the shower where the only thing resembling ""water pressure"" I experienced was when the steam condensed on the ceiling and started to drip on me. It was like trying to bathe with humidity, rather than a shower. When I'm three time zones earlier than I normally awaken, I don't need a gentle mist to wake me - I want the shower to press me, unmercifully, against the wall, scalding and flaying my flesh off of my very bones. Otherwise, I'm useless all day. If it's not like standing under the hell-equivalent of Niagara Falls, it's just pointless. So - fix your water pressure. So, there ya have it. Great views, good beds, decent amenities, but you can get yourself clean faster licking yourself like a cat than you can with the showers here. So, if you're ever in Chlamydia, er, Charm City, this is the place to stay!I stayed here during a conference and it was pretty nice as far hotels go. Ask for a corner room, you'll get more space. The views were great, despite the Legg Mason building construction. The hotel is in a great location - near lots of places to eat, including a Whole Foods.Parking is  a pain and expensive, but what other options do you have? There is a skywalk that connects the garage to the hotel and makes getting from one building to another a lot of work since you have to change elevators three times. The staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout the conference and our stay. They split the hotel bill four ways so  each person could pay their share individually.Decided I would do a weekend getaway from DC and boy was I surprised. For a getaway I was expecting relaxation and wonderful service. Unfortunately what I experienced was far from what I would expect of ANY decent Marriott chain.First and foremost the construction is incredibly poor. I have a great room at the end of the hallway with amazing views. Alas the kudos end there. I can hear anything and everything in the hallway, Whether it be unruly children running/playing in the hall to drunk messes of people coming home after a long night of partying I hear complete conversations, laughing, yelling and the like. Needless to say sleep before 2:30 and after 8am is unlikely or so it has been. Second, the customer service is incredible lacking. Example I ordered breakfast thru in-room dining. The meal was mediocre at best but hell it was the American Breakfast. I wasn't expecting five star. That's not my complaint. The dirty coffee mug is where my complaint lies and how the staff handled the situation. I immediately called the front desk to request a new cup be delivered almost as soon as it was delivered so I could enjoy my morning coffee with breakfast. After 45 minutes (and finishing my breakfast) I called the front desk again and inquired where was the cup. I was given a phone call a few minutes later to let me know it was in route. Almost 30 minutes later I finally got a cup. The one good thing is they delivered with a fresh pot of coffee. All in all its a well appointed hotel on the surface. The furnishings look nice but are cheap much like the construction. I'd only recommend the hotel if you were in a pinch or you Name-Your-Own-Price on Priceline and can't help but get it. I've had much better Marriott experiences in lesser chains of Marriott. If you can afford it stay at the Four Seasons which is right across the street. Its 1000 percent better in service, design, and comfort..The room had marvelous view of both the city and the harbor and waking up to it puts a smile to a sleepy face. My favorite part- the long board walk in front of the hotel. :)If you'd like to avoid paying $40 valet parking, you can park yourself and pay at the one of parking machines located in the hotel side after checking out. It cost me $25.My experience here was great, especially after the ordeal I had at the Intercontinental.I had originally booked with the IC for an overnight stay.  When I got there, after dealing with some crap from the valet guys, I was told (very rudely) that they were overbooked and I had been transferred to another hotel. And that I should be happy because they got me a good rate.  After some complaining at the IC, they said they would comp my parking at Marriott.When I arrived at the Marriott, I was pretty...upset.  Mostly because I had been treated so badly by IC staff.  The lobby manager promptly greeted me and after talking to me about my experience at IC, directed me over past the line to the Front Desk Manager.  She was amazing (I think her name was Jennifer).  She said that the IC had sent over several people and was comping their entire stay.  Then, she called the IC and argued with them until they comped our stay as well.The room was immaculate - clean and up to date.  We ordered room service and I would advise to stay away from the hummus and pita chips.  The quesadilla was fine though, and tasted fresh and was hot. In general, the services as far as the front desk, valets and bellhops were great.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.Fantastic Hotel. The hotel is located right at the waterfront and there are many attractions nearby like the Powerplant, Barnes and Nobles, seaport, Aquariums, malls, etc. I love how right outside the hotel, it's water/bay/waterfront or whatever you want to call it.I enjoyed this hotel.  Very clean, good service.  The rooms were a very nice size.  My room had a mini fridge and a kuerig coffee maker.  The beds were clean and comfortable.  The view of the harbor was amazing.  I had the opportunity to enjoy several meals as a part of a conference and all of the meals were delicious.  My only complaint would be, that at a regular rate of $359/night, it is shameful that wi-fi is not included.We arrived at three in the AM after a delayed flight. I had called no less than four times during the previous day, including just prior to our plane taking off, to check that the roll away bed that we had requested be in the room when we arrive. Surprise, surprise, no roll-away bed at 3 AM. We had to wait another half an hour before they brought up a roll-away bet that they had requisitioned from the Spanish Inquisition. The next morning we spoke with the manager and she provided us with several options, a new roll-away bed or a room with a fold away bed or both. We opted for both since we were not sure that the fold-away bed would be any better. The manager sent keys up to our room so we could try the new room at our leisure and not have to go down and deal with the front desk crowds. Not only was the fold-away bed much more comfortable than the roll-away bed, the new room was great. I was trying the Marriott because I had become sick of the condescending service I had been receiving from Starwood even though I had been a Platinum member. Once they see you using your points for free stays, there is a different although only slightly more snotty attitude. At the Marriott I was a neophyte member of their travel program. Even their telephone reservation people are nice. If this is the way they treat everyone, good by Starwood.Stayed here for 3 nights for a conference.Hotel is beautiful and clean, with great views of the harbor.  I can't give it a 4 star for the following reasons.#1.  Bring your own toilet paper!   I would describe there's as 1 ply sandpaper.#2.  Wife had skin reaction to hotel soap, so bring some of that too.#3.  The sheets on the King bed don't really fit, expect to wake up with your face directly on the stained mattress....gross.When we checked in we asked for an extra night at the same conference rate which they agree'd to, then on the 2nd day I got a bill for 2 nights, when I called down they had no record of the 3rd night and wouldn't honor the conference rate for the 3rd night.Very nice lobby with kind staff.  Rooms were clean and comfortable.  It is not far walking distance to the water.I recently stayed at this hotel for a conference for three days.  This was my second time at this hotel.  It is a very nice hotel with a very nice staff.  Everyone says hello, is very pleasant and wiling to help.One night when I was there I was going out to dinner and the bellman offered me an umbrella to use because it was raining.  I greatly appreciated that.The rooms are nice, and clean with a nice view of the inner harbor or the city.  The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms nice.  They have a Keurig in the room with a selection of coffees and teas.There is a restaurant downstairs which is nice, but a bit overpriced.  There is also another area where you can by sandwiches, drinks and snacks.The only problem that I have with this hotel is how they nickel and dime you.  There is seriously a charge for everything!  The thing I disliked the most was the fact that you have to pay for wi-fi!  For $200 a night for a standard room, Wi-Fi should be included!  I just really felt like there was an extra charge for EVERYTHING.  This is why I only gave this hotel three stars.I just returned from a four night stay at the Marriott Waterfront, while attending a conference held at the hotel.  Service, food, accommodations, location - everything was excellent.  Of special note is the friendliness and professionalism of the hotel staff.  I highly recommend this hotel for business or personal travel.I. Love. This. Hotel. !  I was there for 5 days on business.The rooms were clean, comfortable, very spacious, nice! Views were great! Staff was super-helpful. The bar is the place to be! Great place to meet up w/ friends and people-watch. We hung out in the bar every night and people from other hotels came over to hangout there as well. The restaurant and mini-store/bakery were equally great. Food in the restaurant and bar get 2 thumbs up! Loved the crab cake. The mini-store has all types of snacks and they have soups/desserts.. The hotel is in a great area! Movie theater, shopping, Starbucks, convenience store, around the corner. Its also a quick walk to everything downtown. I walked to work each day. One night I went out to dinner and came back with left-overs. Called downstairs to see if they had a microwave in the cafe area that i could use. She said ""we'll bring one up to you right now"". A couple of mins later, a lady brings up a FULL size microwave for me to use, no charge.. Awesome. Internet was quick. I was able to work just as i would in the office.The 'only' negative complaints i have.. One lady at check-in was rude and not helpful at all. She had that ""Im more important than you"" attitude. However, she was the only rude person i encountered during my entire stay.Also, the hotel seems pricey and they charge for internet service. I was there on the corporate dime so it wasn't an issue for me. However, if I was there for a leisure trip that may have been a problem.","['went', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'within', 'walking', 'distance', 'many', 'great', 'restaurants', 'high',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-by-hilton-baltimore-inner-harbor-baltimore,Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor,3.5,$$,124,"I went for a conference there this pass weekend. The employees were a Hugh help. The hotel was on point. The conference rooms were super cold. No matter who we asked they could not it warmer. The food was Delicious. The employees went above and beyond to get use what we needed. Fyi the oatmeal raisin cookies were hot and YUMMMMMMY.I was here for an event (we hosted) in June. This hotel is a little bit away from the actual Inner Harbor tourist area. It is within walking distance as I did walk it. At check in there was no mention of the complimentary breakfast or free evening happy hour but I read it somewhere otherwise I would not have known about it. My room was on the 17th floor and pretty spacious. It was a double bed room with a sitting area and a desk. Pretty standard but was not cramped. I wish the pillows were firmer as I ended up stacking 2-3 to make it firmer. Personal preference so no big deal. As a business traveler the one thing I didn't appreciate was that there was not a clock in the room. I use my phone for an alarm but I like to be able to just glance over and see what time it is and keep me on time (or close as possible lol). Another small annoyance is the auto scrolling tv guide on the TV and no printed channel list. Print outs are always appreciated or the option to page up/down through the on screen guide. Kthanks. The elevator seemed to be slow at times so plan accordingly. So I was here for an event, as previously mentioned, and our event space (which I didn't know ahead of time) was in a connected building. I had to go to the 5th floor of the Embassy Suites, walk pas the business center and through the connected hallway where there was another elevator to take me to the 2nd floor of the event space. Once at the event space the entrance was at the front of the room so I had to direct attendees through the room next door to find me at our check in table. This was the only way to navigate the space (trust me I tried to find another route and got lost). I ended up the night before our event making directional signs to assist our attendees in finding their way. The event space is nice and they were going through a transition period with management and staff. It showed but our sales manager made sure we were taken care of and she went above and beyond for us unlike our banquets contact (ooops I wasn't going to go there..let me stop). Thanks Crystal for your hard work for us! :-)Horrible place. Elevators slower than a sun dial (looks like only one of four work), trash in stairway that is dark and narrow and creepy, smoke detectors taped over, other guests with the manners worse than a NY cabbie. Won't stay here again. Free drinks gets the one star.Awesome suite for a very reasonable price. Great staff and we will stay again when in Baltimore.My fiancee and I stayed here during our Poe sightseeing trip in Baltimore. Upon arrival the valet staff was very professional and did a damage inspection of our vehicle before parking.Check in was pretty quick and easy (booked on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>) but apparently they overbooked? and ended up giving us a free upgrade from a 1-room king suite to a 2-room king. So far everything was going well, the room was very nice and spacious. Things started to get a bit strange after that though. A few moments before we were going to leave for the evening someone else was trying to swipe into our door, not sure if he was at the wrong room or booked there as well but it was odd.Upon our return to the room our keycards wouldn't work on the door either and we had to take the elevator down 34 floors again to resolve the issue at the front desk which was handled quickly.Overall we had a nice stay, and a great sleep. The bathroom was also very nice, a more luxurious shower would have been nice in a room like that but then again we did get a free upgrade. Overall a nice place to stay, great price too however some miscues by the staff made things a bit inconvenient but all in all very nice.I wish I could give half stars, because I would give this place 3.5 stars.Service: 4 stars. Really excellent.Quality of the room: 3 stars. TV was not working and extremely loud air conditioner Breakfast: 4 starsInternet not connected in the business center: -1 starNot a bad place. Service was really really excellent. The made to order eggs during breakfast was also really really great.I'd probably stay here again, but I would make sure that things are working in my room.I stayed here with my family for a wedding recently! We booked two rooms one king bed and one with two beds. That is not what we received! We got two kings instead! Pros: 1. The hotel is connected to the grand venue which is where the wedding ceremony was taking place which was very convenient.2. The breakfast was good! Many options and it was all you could eat ! Omelets could be made to order.Cons: 1. The staff seemed very unfriendly and unwelcoming. They didn't seem to care how the customer.2. The room is spacious but, just okay! Nothin amazing.3 only one  elevator worked out of three 4 parking is 35 dollars or 16 at the garage but you have to pay each time. They don't tell you about parking so just prepare yourself.Overall it was okayThis place has really gone downhill in the past few years. The primary negative that is enough to keep me away for good is that apparently, now they charge $12 per night to access Wi-Fi in the room. It's 2015. Every other hotel out there has free Wi-Fi. Never coming back due to that alone, unless it changes.Other things bothered me less... giant dead cockroach on the floor last time; taking three minutes for the shower to warm up this time, over half the laundry facilities out of order, and the slowest elevators on the planet.The only redeeming factors are the helpful and polite staff, free drinks and snacks during Happy Hour, and the free breakfast in the morning. But food is available anywhere. I'd no longer recommend staying here and don't plan to again.Great location. Room was very clean and comfortable. Parking next door. There is a shuttle service available out front that got us where we needed to go. Walking distance to Inner Harbor. Some tasty food options in the area as well. Staff was very friendly. Stayed on a weekend so, the area wasn't too crowded. Can imagine it would be bustling during the week. Would stay here again.Where should I begin? First, the parking situation. The Embassay Suite charges $32 for parking and neglect to advise visitors that there is a parking structure immediately adjacent to their building that offers $6 if you go after 5 pm. That's shade. I could see these rates not being advertised for their guests but visitors, that just foul. Next, the room that we visited was allegedly the ""Presidential Suite"". Umm... Not quite. The room had carpet that I'm sure was procured from a discount carpet warehouse. If this room was so ""presidential"" why not at least have hard wood floors. Hell, they could have at least had marble countertops at these rates. The view was ok. Although, most suites are equipped with thicker walls. You can hear each and every sound that came from the adjacent room. Frequently, we were forced to hear the cry of a baby and some kids who seriously lacked discipline. My friends were forced to leave the room due to noise complaints. Due to the amount that she was spending, it would seem that she could have received a courtesy call from the front desk. I hate to play the race card but the front desk called the police and she was forced to leave. It was a birthday function, which management was duly advised. In fact, she was moved to the Presidential Suite to have fewer neighbors. However, due to the lack of craftsmanship in the construction, surrounding patrons could hear EVERYTHING just as we could hear them. To add insult to injury, the cabinets in the bathroom fell off. I would NEVER stay here especially with the policy of eviction without warning. Then to send 4 officers. Everyone in the room were well educated, non violent,  and had clean criminal histories. I have stayed at MANY Embassay Suites in my lifetime. This is the WORST experience ever!This hotel is in a great location for events at Royal Farms Arena.  The two bedroom suite gave us plenty of room.  The staff is amazingly friendly especially Jess and Jay at the front desk.  The breakfast buffet gives plenty of options.  The downsides to this place is the elevators. There are four nice sized elevators but by the time a fourth person gets in some of them the buzzer is going off saying it is over full.  They hold 2500 lbs so they were not full.  This leads to a very long line waiting for an elevator especially right after an event lets out.I spent time here for a friend's birthday weekend.  I think the accommodations were OK, but definitely not stellar. The 2 suites she'd booked were of a decent size.  The kitchenette was a bit cramped, but the dining and living area were more spacious. I appreciated the view of Baltimore from the 31st floor, though.  The bedroom and closet were spacious and nicely appointed.  Overall they weren't anything to write home about, but were well-suited for our needs. I really enjoyed the complimentary breakfast.  We had a late breakfast on Sunday and really enjoyed the omelette station.  The potatoes were remarkably good!  They also had other common foods like bacon, sausage, scrambled and hard-boiled eggs, cereal and fruits.  It was definitely better than most complimentary breakfasts I see at hotels. My biggest gripe was with the elevators.  They are terribly slow. The elevator bank has 4 but only 2 seemed to operate during the time we were there. They should get that checked out.The hotel doesn't have its own parking, but there is a public garage a few steps down from it.  It's directly to the left of the hotel. The price wasn't bad - I was there all day and only paid $5.Overall, it's not bad.  Again, it's not the greatest, but it gets the job done.Overall a very nice hotel, I would recommend to travelers who will not be ""overly"" disappointed by hotels minor flaws. ProsLarge rooms with room to spread outVariety at breakfastClose parking garage at discounted priceConsWalking distance to harbor is doable but rough after a long day. Elevators are slow during peak times (breakfast, dinner, check-in)Breakfast and happy hour very crowded so get there early or WAITIn room Bathroom door would not shut completely, shower drained slowly, odd positioning of microwave an mini fridge making it difficult to use.Beds were fantastic!Top floors can hear the elevator cables rattling in the wall all night. Restaurant food is disgusting. Left over uncooked bacon, and how can you screw up Mac and cheese? The have figured out a way. Worst hotel food ever. Fitted sheets on mattress are all for thin mattresses so they come off on the corners. Place, overall SUCKSGot them to replace the sandwich and it was WORSE. Brown avacado and cheese that was hard and turkey roll was slippery meat. The health dept should check this kitchen and close it down. The staff doesn't seem to care.My husband and I were attending a concert in Baltimore.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Check-in time wasn't until 4pm, but I decided to take whatever room was available because I was traveling with an infant that needed a nap.   My room was on the 26th floor.  It was big and spacious for the 3 of us.  Starbucks in the building!  Breakfast was a plus...but it is why I like the Embassy.  Cons:  The room had minor cosmetic things that stood out (i.e. shoddy repair of the ceiling in the bathroom, the vent in the living room was dirty and looked as if it needed to be repaired).The seat cushions in the breakfast area could use a simple upholstering.  That would be a quick fix or simply replace them.  My suggestion to management is to take a look at the entire facility and make the minor changes.  It will show us that attention to detail matters!I'm currently here on business for 6 weeks and I feel like I'm right at home. The staff are amazing, hard workers. The rooms feel like tiny apartments with a kitchenette. The gym has a nice variety of things to do and there's a little laundry room to do your own if you'd like. The best part after a long day: free happy hour!!Not your typical Embassy Suites, this hotel is a reincarnation of an old downtown hotel and Embassy did a pretty good job. My only comments are that the fitness center is far too warm for exercise. This could be resolved by adding shades to the windows. Also, the restaurant where the Embassy Suites free breakfast is served is a bit cramped and dark, but hey IT'S FREE!!! The staff is very professional and friendly and the rates are usually reasonable. Parking, like most downtown hotels, isn't convenient and costs $16 overnight. All together this is a great place in Baltimore. It's just a few blocks from Inner Harbor and neighborhood restaurants and bars.Is there an option for no stars? Seriously I'm that upset! My fiance and I spent 6 nights in this hotel. The first night we  stayed in a queen suite which unfortunately was situated right next to the elevator. All night long we heard banging and noise from the elevator. The walls were so thin we even heard people talking inside of the elevator! My 6 month old son was up crying all night and none of us got any sleep! The next morning we asked to be switched to a different room. We got a king suite on the 33rd floor. The sound problem was better however every time we tried to use our keys to the room the doors would not unlock. We ended up having to go up and down the elevator 4-5 times to get ""new keys"" for the room (which with an infant and traveling up 33 floors was annoying!) we repeated this routine several times a day for 2 days. One of the days this almost caused us to miss the train to Washington DC that we needed to catch! On the 3rd day I told the front desk the problem was not with the keys it was with the door lock. They said it probably needs the battery's chanted and promised to get the changed while we were gone for the day. We arrived back at the hotel at 9:00 only to discover they never fixed the door! They promised to send some one ASAP. By 10:00 we were tired of waiting and went to bed only to have the repair man knock on the door at 10:30 waking us and our infant son up to change the batteries in the door. On top of all that the last 3 days of our stay our room was never refilled with clean towels or complimentary soaps. On our last day I went down to the harbor with the baby and returned to the room around 4:00pm wanting to give the baby a bath and lay him down for a nap only to discover the room had not even been cleaned....the bed was unmade, no soaps, no clean towels, dirty towels everywhere, and overflowing trash cans. I called down to the front desk 2 times only to be transferred to housekeeping both times and reach a voicemail. After 45 minutes of waiting for someone to come clean the room I went downstairs to personally talk to the front desk. They promised to send someone ASAP...15 minutes later they arrived. Unfortunately they left behind dirty towels in the bathroom and still did not refill the soaps. I wish I could give this hotel a better rating...its location was perfect for us (walking distance to inner harbor and short taxi ride to train station). The beds were comfortable and rooms were large. Breakfast buffet was delicious. However on weekends they don't open buffet up until 7:30 which meant large crowds of people stood in line waiting to get in and eat and once inside it was a disaster trying to get food. Not everyone sleeps in on the weekend and many people still have places they need to be! The breakfast should be open at 6 everyday of the week. Wifi internet is not free..they charge you $14.00 for Internet. They give you 2 free bottles of water on your first night but won't replace them if your staying multiple nights. The bell boys were helpful and they flagged cabs quickly. The staff was friendly but with the problems we experienced here we will not be back! Sorry embassy suits this location disappointed us!In town for Morgan State University's Open House. Enjoyed my 2 day stay Thurs 4/2-Sat 4/4. Cost for 2 days was $220 non suite on Expedia. 2 queen beds, fridge, microwave, sink.  Parking is $32 a nite with valet or there is a parking garage right next to the hotel which was $16 a night. About 5 blocks (walking distance) to the Inner Harbor area. The included breakfast buffet (eggs, bacon, toast, sausage, bagels, fresh fruit, yogurt, apple, orange and cranberry juice, made to order omelettes including egg white only and im sure i missed a few things) was well worth it and don't forget the complimentary reception hour(530-730pm) aka FREE LIQUOR lol i had (amsterdam vodka and cranberry, hubby had bloody mary)also included were budweiser and i think coors beers. Customer Service was good easy check in and out. Only complaint with service was my daughter called the front desk and said the clerk sounded a bit annoyed. But when we needed additional wash clothes they were brought  up within 10 mins of calling the front desk and a clerk called to make sure we received them.The only other complaint i have is the bathroom was a bit small. They could have lessened the size of the walk in closet and made a bigger bathroom. We did stay in a corner room so that may be the reason. Neither complaint is enough to lose a star over 5 stars GREAT!!!Overall...anytime I'm in Baltimore I will be staying at Embassy Suites-Inner HarborWe had a wonderful 4 days staying here. The staff is very friendly, courteous, and helpful. The suites are very spacious &amp; comfortable. I love this place and hope to visit again in the future","Comfortable rooms look the part, but the noisy ass elevator sounds disrupt your sleep and kills the comfortability. Sorry guys, but you need to fix it!Very kind service here and they were generous to upgrade us when we stayed during a snow storm.  Very comfy bed, spacious room, and superb complimentary breakfast (best I have had in a hotel actually!! yum!!). Great complimentary coffee as well!  Thank you! Only downsides are that the internet pricing is not conveniently listed and cell phone reception is not great on higher floors (to be expected).  The rooms are rather quiet but noise does transmit a bit with a rowdy neighbor.  Also, the alarm clocks should be turned to 'OFF' when the staff turns the room around: no fun waking up at 7am when the alarm (not set by me) goes off.Disappointed severely. The room wasn't ready when I initially checked in at 4pm, so we waited about 15-20 minutes. No too bad. However, I am upset that I had to check with the front desk manager to inquire if the room was ready, they did not volunteer. There were two events when I visited the hotel over the summer - gay pride and the comic con. There was a large volume of people, more then usual and I don't believe staff were prepared for the crowd of guest. After voicing my complaint to corporate - the hotel staff were concerned about my needs and addressed my needs. I was very happy about this - it felt good that I mattered.  This hotel decor is modern, contemporary &amp; chic. There are parts of the hotel that is old and charming. Check out the old Masonic area on the fourth floor and have your socks blown away. It's gorgeous with high decorated ceilings and crown moldings . It would be a wonderful place for weddings and other events.We loved our stay here! Everything was just perfect. We came in earlier than expected but the concierge accommodated very nicely to our needs. We were up in a room within 5 minutes. The room itself was clean and large complete with a lounging area, desk and swivel flat screen. I was greatly impressed. I think my favorite part about the Embassy Suites is that they provide a more than satisfactory complimentary breakfast AND alcoholic happy hour. You should hit up  the breakfast early, it can get pretty crowded and the seating can be a bit competitive. Very happy with this service, especially after a heavy night of drinking...it was just what we needed. The complimentary happy hour was just the cherry on top. They provided great drinks, a couple of bartenders in the resturant area. Premium costed a couple of dollars but oh well, still cool! The munchies consisted of chips, salsa, and some chex mix, its not gourmet but hey...not coming for the munchies are we..there are plenty of nearby places for that! I definitely recommend coming here. Cheers!This place is an absolute joke.Where should I start?  First it's in an absolute horrible part of town, even though the police station is right across the street, nothing but ghetto, street trash stay here. So on 10/12 I was invited to a brunch here.  Parked the car in the deck next door and went inside to ask the receptionist where was the brunch located for the individuals that invited me.  She said ""There is no record of any reserved area for brunch or record of people staying here by that name.""  Alright fair, lets try a couple different names (I wasnt sure who's name the actual room was booked under).  She said ""No. I am not sure what to tell you... but no one by any of those names are staying here"".At this point more invited guests came in inquiring about the same thing. Alright, being patient I decided to make some phone calls to see if I could get in contact with someone that was there.  No luck.  So I asked the lady at the front desk to speak with a manager.  Her response ""No, I do not see any reason why you need to speak with a manager... ""   WTF  I discussed that I need someone to absolutely make sure that a reservation was made and to report the lack of customer service.  She refused.  In a matter of PURE COINCIDENCE someone I knew walked by and I quickly grabbed them.  1) The reservation was indeed booked under the name given2) There couldn't have been any possible way that the front desk lady missed it.  She obviously refused to even lookOn to the actual hotel based on my observation.  It's slammed busy, seemed that there was not enough staff to assist with the guests.  I was told the hot breakfast buffet was included but I cant verify that.  But I will tell you it looked like not enough food was put out and the tables werent being bused fast enough.  I saw people standing up against walls trying to eat. This place F*ing sucks.  Go and stay elsewhere.Check in and valet parking were flawless. My room was on the 35th floor and we had a great view!  The room was very very spacious. My only complaint was that the carpet had so many stains. It's time for some new carpet asap!  It was so noticeable and really was odd considering everything else was so clean and the hotel was well managed.This was a much better experience than NC.  Although the rooms again were only one room they were a good size room.  The staff could not have been any more courteous. Gym was nice, happy hour was great.  Breakfast went smoothly even when very crowded.  Good location, within walking distance of everything.Solid hotel located in Baltimore's Downtown Area. Its Location gives you walking access to the Inner Harbor, Mount Vernon and Midtown (and if it was warmer probably Little Italy and Fells Point). Rooms were large and well kept. Staff was courteous and informative. They have valet parking for extra ($32, not too bad). The lounge also does a free happy hour for 2 hrs on weekends (cheese cubes, draft american beer, wine by glass, and well drinks) which I find to be a great deal. They do lack a large hotel lobby store, but considering a 7-11 is within a block this isn't a big deal.While the staff at this property were well meaning and mostly courteous the property itself is very poorly managed.  There is an apparent level of ignorance and poor training that is pervasive in this property. Issues with hot water, valet communication, amenities not delivered and mis delivered. Wedding gift bags -25% of guests never received them. Shout out to Shannon and Jon at valet area.  However one valet did not know how to start my sons car (VW) so we went down to the 4th level of the garage to drive it up ourselves. All in all a very poor property. A well discussed topic at the bar one evening. I will be writing a detailed letter to Hilton.Stayed here for a weekend night downtown. Went downstairs and asked to use the lobby bathroom and we're told that ""if you are a guest in this hotel you should just use your own bathroom..."" yeah, never staying here again based on that one comment. Whack wanna be bougie ass hotel. GfyGreat room for the price. I came down for a business meeting during the week and got a great price from the HIlton site. The room was clean and large. Great workout room. I did not try the pool because it opens after 8 am. Breakfast was good with good selections. Keep in mind it gets busy because there are a surprising number of rooms in the hotel. There is a Starbucks I. The lobby too! Staff was friendly and the beds were comfortable. The room was dark and quiet at night and there are several charging ports in the room. Very good experience. I will be back.Expensive, but standard for downtown.  I stayed for 3 weeks.The rooms are nice, with a small kitchenette, a couple TVs, comfortable bed, and several couches.  Breakfast (6-9 M-F, 730-1030 S-S) is buffet style.  There is a customer omlette bar, but otherwise the food is just standard fare found at a Hampton Inn.  Parking is next door in the garage ($16/24 hours) which is expensive, but it is a 24/7 garage.  Valet parking is also available for $32.  Internet is free if you are a gold or diamond member, but it is extremely slow.  Otherwise, it's some $10/night.  I'd stay here again, though I would look around at some other hotels first.Incredible hospitality. Free happy hour. Free hot cooked to order breakfast. Free internet. Inexpensive parking at the city lot next door ---don't valet!  Free local trolly takes you to the inner harbor. What's not to like?I was scheduled to stay here on May 2, but due to the curfew and other uncertainty the wedding I was planning to attend was moved.  Embassy Suites (Hilton) refuses to work with their clients and offer a refund under these circumstances.  This is not the service I have come to expect from Hilton over my ten years as a Hilton Honors member.  Time to go find a hotel brand of choice.Stayed there for 4 nights for a professional meeting. Short walk to the Convention Center is convenient. Free breakfast was above my expectations, a big plus. The guy that makes omelets does really great job and is pretty efficient in serving customers fast without creating a line. The other big plus is the happy hour with free drinks, which got rather lively on Saturday night. Rooms are comfortable, beds are soft. TVs are fine, and I got free in-room WiFi for signing up for HiltonHonors for the duration of my stay. That was a big plus. Staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful. Also, there are at least three restaurants with very good Yelp reviews within one block, which is very convenient. I checked out the turkish place and the noodle place.Thermostat in my room read 80F all the time, even though it was obviously less, around 72-73F I'd say. But since it was a comfortable room temperature, I did not complain. Also, the bedding gets a lot of static electricity for some reason; I saw a few hairs stuck to it (probably in a dryer due to the static or something, did not look like it was from previous occupants; pretty sure it was washed). Also, room soundproofing is not great, and I could hear elevators going up and down. I can see how this can be an issue for someone, but it was not for me. Overall, a very pleasing hotel experience for a business trip.We stayed the Embassy Suites for my brother's birthday weekend. While the staff were very nice and helpful, the building itself is awful. I'm aware this is an historic building; but, I really think more should've been done to renovate the building. First, the elevators are terrible. It took 10 minutes for the elevator to arrive in the lobby. And the elevators are very small. The room looked nice at first glance; but, there was a terrible smell in the bathroom. Almost as if someone used it before we arrived in the room. Also, the sink in the bathroom drained very slowly. Another reviewer noted how thin the walls are. I can attest to this. You can hear people in the hallway clearly as if they are right in the room with you. In the bathroom, you can hear your neighbors in the next room clearly through the vent. And there isn't an exhaust fan which would've been helpful for that foul smell we experienced when we arrived. On the positive side they have a social hour in the afternoon with free drinks and snacks for guest. The breakfast they offer sounds good. I'll experience that tomorrow. However, this will be my last stay at this hotel.I have had many hotel stays this year and this hotel stay was the most comfortable. The parking situation was not good but it worked out in the end. The bed was more comfortable than my home bed! The  room was  spacious and a beautiful city view. Staff were friendly and helpful. Great experience over allWe stayed here 8/21 - 8/23/2015. The hotel is beat up. Carpeting is dirty, furniture old and damaged, and stairs between floors of this 30+ floor hotel dirty and narrow - a danger in case evacuation is needed. There aren't enough elevators so wait time to get one can be over 10 minutes. To add insult to injury, they tried to charge valet parking when we did not use this service. They also hosed us for over $60 in long distance charges when one of the kids tried to call our cell a couple of times. Finally the free breakfast was terrible with crowds so large it took almost 2 hrs to get through it. Stay elsewhere. Lots of other good choices.Perfectly located in downtown Baltimore....close to all and the best is that the free bus service for anybody in the downtown area is out front of the hotel. The reason this is important is because parking at the harbor or any where in downtown Baltimore is expensive and hard to come by. I left the car with the hotel the two days, paid the $32 a day and took their free bus service. If you start taking the car out, going from lot to lot you are going to pay $20 for 3-4 hours and the pay to put back in the hotel and you have to deal with the traffic. We had a room with two queen beds and a small kitchen with a microwave. If they give us a kitchen why no napkins, garbage bag or silverware? fridge is a mini so not much room. Room was clean, nice large lcd in room, but bathroom was tight... poor layout if you ask me, no need for the large walk-in closet between the bedroom and bathroom. Staff was very friendly always looking to help, just ask. Free breakfast that included an omlete station...fruit, bacon, coffee, bagels, english muffins, and cereals...very good!!!I stayed at Embassy Suites Baltimore - Inner Harbor last month and found that it still was an excellent place to stay... having excellent facilities and staff.  Customer service is superb!  My attorney, who was on a business trip with me, agreed.Whereas many hotels start out great and quickly show their age, I think this favility has only become better.","Do you like cold showers? If yes, this is the place for you. Stayed here for a conference and out of the 15 people asked, hot water was only available half of the time. No matter morning day or night. That's just not right.BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL HOTEL!!!Very spacious rooms. Here for a special Yelp event. Had an absolute blast. The place is beautiful and classy. The study we were in had the most exquisite Grecian(Roman?) artwork/murals and beautiful stained glass windows. The seat was incredibly comfy and lush. The piano and the pianist were delightful. The staircase was marble and study as well as beautiful.THE BATHROOM WAS LIKE. OMFG. THIS IS A BATHROOM? Fucking marble columns?! This beautiful area to sit and wash your hands in?! FULL LENGTH MIRRORS EVERYWHERE?! Ladies lounge in-fucking-deed. Love it. Seriously just check out the photos. It's a perfect venue for hosting large events.Seriously I would probably never stay here again. Bathroom was dirty when I got into room, and the shower ceiling looked disgusting. (Room 32) The elevators were the worst part of my stay, as it takes FOREVER and I mean FOREVER for them to arrive, and when they do, they can only fit about 5 people. It is the most horrible elevator system. It is close to where we needed to be so it was convenient. But I would not stay here again.This hotel is ok at best. Not worth the price. Jay at check in was wonderful and helpful. The breakfast was good. The room was a good size. However, our rooms carpet had burn marks in it and looked old and dirty. I didn't want my son crawling on it. The room smelled musty. There wasn't many channels on the TV. You have to pay for WIFI and 16 a day to park your car that you aren't allowed to take in and out of the garage. The location isn't that safe, we had people asking us for money and people digging in the trash outside of the hotel. Lastly, my husband wanted to go to the hotel bar after site seeing all day and both nights the hotel closed at 8pm! Really?! They gave us no explanation and suggested he walk down the street to a bar. Ya right and have him get robbed on the way back to the hotel?! Ridiculous! We won't be back and won't recommend this hotel.I gave this hotel 1 star because of the very rude customer service.  I checked in on Friday night ,of course i inspected my room. Under my bedding i found 1 strand of hair. No , i didnt complain since it was only 1 strand.  I did bring my own linen for the bed but i was too tired to put it on completely  , so i just placed it on the bed and lied down . The next day i notice that there was a lot more than 1 strand.  There was so much hair on this big comfy bed that it was nauseating . When the complaint was made, i was totally disregarded . It seemed to be a regular complaint in that place.  I will never stay in this hotel again. . Also, my family was in a room where the tub was stopped up with water backing into the tub from someone elses tub...yuck...it took them 3 days to fix it ...but only after we really showed out.  The 1 star is for  the delish omelet that you have to wake up with the roosters to get to. It was not worth the 189per night  at allNice, clean hotel !   Our room was on the 33rd floor with a great view of downtown Baltimore .  The room was spacious and clean .  I loved the extra touch of a microwave , sink and table which the Embassy Suites is known for . It's within walking distance to downtown Baltimore . The staff was very accommodating and were eager to please .  Complimentary breakfast was great but please get here early  or right before the end of  breakfast because the lines  can go right out the door!  They also had a complimentary happy hour which is a great kick off to any other plans you may have for a night out! However , if you are checking out try to go a half hour before check out because the elevators are small and get filled quickly!  I will definitely stay here again!My family and I stayed here two weeks ago. It was overall a pleasant experience. The staff were friendly. As soon as we checked in, we were informed that there was a shortage of room keys and could only get one per room (4 of us shared the same suite). It wasn't too much of an issue for us, later on they got more. As soon as you step outside this hotel at night, you do have to be careful while walking in the streets as it was a little sketchy. During the week they have something called a managers reception which was around 5:30-7:30pm which was fantastic. They had complimentary cocktails, beer, wine, and soda. They also had chips and salsa, pretzels, crackers, and an assorted cheeseboard. Plenty of seating in this area. The complimentary breakfast was great, made-to-order omelets, eggs, waffles, bacon, assorted breads, juices, etc. The wifi in this hotel wasn't the best, I had to turn it off and use my data plan at times. The one-bedroom suite was spacious and had a mini kitchen. The bathroom was on the smaller side. One thing which didn't affect my family was which we were informed about them shutting off the water for a few hours around 12pm so be aware of that. I didn't swim but the pool looked clean but on the smaller side. The fitness center looked nice with modern equipment. The business center came in handy for us because we needed to print out tickets. They had a mini snack shop by the front desk which was reasonably priced compared to other hotels that make the price of something there five times more expensive. The parking was expensive but I believe anywhere in baltimore parking is like that so its normal. Overall, a pleasant stay.I'm torn how to rate this place. On the one hand, I thought it was in a good location, relatively close to the Inner Harbor. The room was a good size and pretty clean. On the other hand, the shower made loud rattling noises when we tried to change the temperature of the water, and it took forever to get the water hot. We also had a room next to the elevator and could hear every ding and door opening and movement up and down as the elevator traveled between floors.I was very pleased my boyfriend and I were able to snag a room for New Year's less than three days before. Needless to say, the hotel was packed with revelers so it wasn't until 3 am or so before it started to get quiet.Unfortunately, housekeeping came by three times in the morning, and the neighbors kept slamming their doors.My friend just moved to Baltimore. I helped her check into this hotel in the morning - they didn't have her room ready, which is fine. So she checked her luggage into storage, we went to brunch, hotel called us a few hours later saying the room is ready. We get back and guess what?Her backpack was gone from the locked storage unit.We are talking laptop, iPad, iPod, passport, credit cards, books, chargers, all the essentials that a person needs and keeps dear and close to our hearts. They checked the security cameras and clearly recorded an ethnic male entering the room and stealing her backpack. The police were called. Guess what? They already responded to a similar incident, with the EXACT same person caught on camera, a week ago!! Of course, management did nothing in prevention. The two female clerks at the front desk never offered condolences or apologies, in fact even had an attitude/smirk on their faces. Manager was supposed to call my friend, never did. We had to track him down. No offer to reimburse or discount her room, nothing. They did promise some compensation, but there's more value in those possessions than what money can buy. VISITORS BEWARE. do NOT trust this hotel, do NOT trust the people working in this hotel. If you got your things stolen, I would complain HARD to the management. If you left this place unscathed, consider yourself lucky.We loved our stay here. Excellent customer service &amp; great breakfast. Our suite was beautiful, on the 33 floor with a great view. I loved the kitchenette with microwave &amp; fridge. Great location &amp; modern rooms. There is also a complimentary evening  reception that ends at 7:30 (that we missed). This was my first time staying at an embassy suite &amp; I will be returning.Stayed here for the first time ( still here) and it is a fabulous place. Checked in a Little early and Damien said it wasn't a problem and he was so friendly and helpful!He gave me a map circled points of interest informed me there is a hot shuttle (which he said he would be more than happy to call ) as well as the charm circular ( which he said he would show me where to catch it) we opted for our feet and it was awesome. Stayed on the 20th floor, room was awesome! View was breathtaking at all hours! Had a slow draining tub called Damien at the front desk and he quickly sent .someone to fix itVery quiet ! Beds are omg you cnt feel the person next to you move! Cons: women's sauna was a little creepy , had a "" someone is lurking behind the door vibe due to the other women's locker room door lead to another door the men's (opted out for the sauna and locker room) lolTugs: um we walked down around 10 people were at the bar drinking , bartender was very friendly and engaging, didnt see anyone eating although I was starving opted for a water ( place closes at mid night) food is rather expensive no traditional bar foodOh also booked thru Priceline and Inputted the wrong date.. Priceline said it couldn't be modified (will never use them again) but <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> contacted the hotel and explained and it was modified w/out any fees thanks Angela!Afraid I couldn't recommend staying here to anyone. For the price, the complimentary breakfast is rather weak. The from-concentrate orange juice was rather acidic and made me ill for most of the day. The rooms have no insulation to speak of. From my room, at the end of one of the halls, I could regularly hear the elevator chimes, like some sort of perverse high-class water torture as I attempted to sleep.While I am grateful for the existence of the sofabed in the King room, despite being relatively new, it was not a pleasure to sleep on. Approximately the same as sleeping on a large couch. I am not sure what kind of suite Lillie Z. had, but I can certainly tell you that it is not representative of the ""regular"" rooms at this hotel. The bathroom was a cramped little affair tucked away in a corner, not some Grecian-columned marvel.The staff, however, seemed absolutely wonderful, and I give them the highest regards.I stayed here over the summer to watch a baseball game and spend sometime in the city. The only thing that is really bad about this place is the elevators. Not sure if they ever fixed them but they were SO SO SO SLOW when I stayed there. It was kind of pathetic how such a nice hotel could have such crappy elevators. The only other feature that is nothing to brag about is the pool. It's okay. It's kind of located in an awkward part of the hotel, it's surrounded by buildings and a concrete wall, so theres not much sun getting into the pool area. It's also small so not a lot of people can be in the area at once.The positives at this place, however, are the suites. They are SO SPACIOUS and the furniture is so great and modern. I couldn't believe how much space we got and each room is also a decent size, with a TV and a nice sized closet. I almost didn't want to leave the room because it was so cozy.The location of the hotel is really good as well. The are about one block from a little shopping plaza that has a liquor store and a grocery store. You can also catch the bus (go for the free charm city circulator, not the people standing outside the hotel who will rip you off for a ride to the harbor). You can also easily walk to the harbor from the hotel if you want, it's just a straight line down, so getting lost is virtually impossible.I hate to leave the hotel has great service and a great staff! I'll be back and certainly will return! We had the best bunny reunion ever. I can't thank you all enough for your hospitality!I give this hotel five stars due to the attentiveness of the staff. At first glace the front desk area appears cold and unwelcoming.  Do not let that fool you.  We pulled into valet parking and were promptly approached by the valet to take our car.  The valet and bellman (Damien and Devante) were friendly, welcoming, and helpful.  This attitude was continued at the front desk where we were greeted promptly, warmly and professionally.   In fact, I have never experienced such a nice welcome in all my travels.  We arrived early and went to Starbucks that is adjacent to the hotel to wait for our room.  The front desk notified us that our room was ready before the check-in time.  Our room had two queen beds and a nice sitting area.  The room was clean and had everything we needed.  The beds were quite comfortable.  I did not mind the smaller bathroom because there was a larger walk-in closet/changing area.  We did not use the kitchen. The TV worked perfectly and we received free in-room WiFi for signing up for HiltonHonors.  Nice view from the 30th floor.  Room quiet and we did not hear any outside noise.  We enjoyed the evening reception that included free munchies and drinks.  Had a glass of red wine and enjoyed the friendly ambiance.  Bartenders were pleasant and accommodating.  We also enjoyed the complimentary breakfast.  Large selection of good food and the coffee and orange juice were tasty too.   We had a late lunch at the B'More Bistro.  The vegetarian wrap and chicken tacos were delicious.  The pizza was nothing special and pricey but we did enjoy ourselves.  Overall I we enjoyed our stay and will return.We booked this hotel at the last minute after a boat trip. We decided to stay in the area and I was VERY pleased. The hotel is undergoing renovations but I wasn't inconvenienced at all. I was placed on the 33rd floor with breathtaking views of the city. The suite was clean, modern and had all the amenities, microwave, fridge, coffeemaker etc. The shower was hot INSTANTLY and stayed that way until I was ready to leave (I had to be pulled out) :-) The staff was friendly and helpful; check in and checkout was a breeze! Parking was incredibly reasonable. For the price I paid...THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS!!!Very nice embassy suites hotel. Not your typical embassy suites but this may just be better. Amazing views. Immaculate room. Great breakfast. Located convienently downtown. They even have a Starbucks. Staff is extremely professional and helpful. Wish I could of stayed longer.......I WILL BE VISITING AGAIN TONIGHT. HOPE TO HAVE A GREAT TIME AS I DID LAST YEAR.I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel near the Inner Harbor and found this place. Lucky me!Entering the hotel, you are not necessarily taken back, as the registration desk, which is off to the left and is totally understated. However, once you work your way around the corner to the elevators, you begin to understand the quality and stateliness of this hotel. Yes, there are slight indications of wear resulting from the age of the facility, but really in some ways it only added to the appreciation of this hotel.When I got to my room, I was really impressed  the the size and appointments of the room. Straight ahead there were two queen beds, nicely done, and a decent sized work table. To the left was a walk in closet, which also doubled as the entryway to the bathroom. On the far end, an alcove that contained a kitchenette that hosted cabinets, a fridge, microwave, coffee brewer and sink. The bed, from which I am writing this review, was very comfy and blessed with many pillows. There is also a nice sized flat screen TV in the room that provides access to a larger than normal selection of channels.I visited the 4th floor, where they have their fitness room. The room itself was decent sized and had with about 4 machines and a stretching room. The real find, however, on this floor was the locker room complete with a sauna! I can count on one hand the number of hotels I've ever visited with a sauna, but it is the only one I've ever visited where it wasn't part of a costly spa!Off the lobby is a deli, while I didn't enter, I did peak in and was impressed with the selection incorporated into its case.Compared with other hotels in the center of Baltimore, heck you can include nearly anywhere, this place is an absolute bargin in terms of price! Sadly, it will soon become a member of the Embassy Suites family, which means that the nightly prices will likely double. That said, in comparison to many of the other choices available in the center of Baltimore, I'd still consider staying here again.Excellent stay! The front desk was incredibly accommodating, the staff, fright from our first encounter with the valet service all the way through our stay was some of the best we've received! The rooms are clean and well arranged and the location is great! Evan and the rest of the staff at the front desk was amazing! I whole heartedly recommend this hotel!Rooms near elevators--not good. Go somewhere else or insist on a room away from the elevators...","Great location, great facility, great staff.  We had a really great experience here during a graduation extended weekend.  The facility has been updated from the old Tremont Hotel, still a 10 min walk from Inner Harbor, 2 block walk to Purple Circulator bus which gets you to mt. vernon and fed hill neighborhoods. Unreservedly recommend.My company recently booked this hotel for me for a 3 night stay, and I have already let them know to NEVER book me at this hotel again. - Upon check in the ""lobby"" was a single desk with a single person who was tasked with working the desk and apparently answering all of the hotels incoming calls also. It took about 15 mins to get checked in and I don't think the guy said more than 5 words to me since he was constantly on the phone.- once I finally got to my room the TV wasn't plugged in, nor was the telephone. - the ironing board in my room was literally so broken that it couldn't stand up. It also took 2 days and about 5 requests for them to send mea replacement. - The maid service was TERRIBLE. I got fewer and fewer towels each day for some reason, and my soaps and shampoos were NEVER replaced over the course of a 3 night stay. - the elevators are terrible and se,I scary. They take FOREVER to arrive on your floor, or even to the lobby if that's where you're waiting, even though there are 4 of them. Once your inside they move slowly as well. They also beep like heck and refuse to move if there are more than 5 ppl inside.- don't bother calling the valets ahead of time to bring your car around because they say they will and then won't. This happened at least twice.Wish I could give no stars. Elevator was broken for hours had to walk up and down 20 flights of stairs . Even when they got it running it was so slow and packed full everytime I got in it . The air con didn't work and the bed sheets stink of fish . Rank hotel .This place is sooo cool.If you stay here, be sure to walk over and tour the Grand.It used to be a Masonic Temple and is full of history.The women's bathroom is one of the 10 most luxurious in the country, make sure you peek in there.I just stayed here a week ago with family for two nights. They said it's their grand opening weekend, which they just bought the property from another hotel and did renovations to it. When we just pulled into the valet area a dark skin guy came straight up to the hotel and help us and waited patiently for us to get our stuff out of the car and to check in so he can bring our stuff up to our room, he was probably one of the helpful guys their (I wish I remembered his name). Our room was big and comfy for 3 adults. We had a suite so personal bedroom, dinning area, kitchen, decent size bathroom, it was a great room. After spending a 30 minutes in our room we decided to go down to the inner harbor but did not want to drive so we went down stairs and ask for a taxi number they said we have a van to take our guest to places which was helpful and convent. The first night I was sleeping on the bed that was in the couch very uncomfortable. There were no extra blankets in the room so I called down to see if I can I have one sent to my room, the lady on the phone said it will be right up. 45minutes almost an hour still no blanket so I called again and a gentlemen answered and I told him I called already 45 minutes ago to get a blanket and no one has came. After 20 minutes after calling a second time house keeping came with a warm blanket.For managers special was nice they just need to open up more table area for the amount of people that went. It was tight and not enough chairs.Breakfast was nice. The next day we went out to go for a drive. We walk outside to pick up our car from valet. We stood their for a good 20 minutes until we had to go inside to have the front desk call down for our car. After waiting a little over 30 minutes and employee that was talking to another employee the whole time decided to come over and have the courage to ask us if we been help after he knew no one even came over to help us and saw us go to the front desk.Overall the hotel was amazing but the customer service and all the employee's that I did talk to and came across was not helpful at all only the dark skinned man that was outside doing valet was helpful.We booked this hotel as a birthday treat and it was the best choice. Granted there is some construction going on but the helpful staff made an effort to ensure our stay was pleasant and disrupted as little as possible. The location is great, we were able to walk to the inner harbor or get a cab easily, and the views from our room were amazing. I, and my friends, look forward to the next weekend we stay here.Review based on one night stay in a double room suite on the 24th floor:PROs:+ Suites are very spacious (2x bedrooms, 2x bathrooms, dining room/kitchen, and living room)+ Beds are probably the most comfortable I've ever experienced from a hotel.  Super plush and easy to get lost in and drift away+ Walking distance from Inner Harbor+ Free WIFI+ Free complimentary bottled water+ Happy, cheerful staff+ Street noise wasn't too bad on this floor (though the hallway noise from doors seems to come in)CONs:- Mold in one of the showers- A/C control is a bit quirky, but understandable with the sizes of the rooms (1x control for bedrooms, 1x for rest of the suite)- Room service was definitely a sore point.  We ordered desserts and was told about 20-40 minutes (wich seemed like an awful long time for 2x desserts).  After an hour, still nothing.  You know its bad when room service calls you back after over an hour's wait to ask if you still wanted your order.  Molten lava cake and strawberry shortcake was definitely not worth the wait or the $20+This hotel was definitely a surprise for never hearing of it before.   Very impressed with the size of the suite when we first arrived.  Room service definitely took away from the overall experience (even though it was only on this occasion).  The beds are probably going to be the longest lasting memory.  SOOOO Comfy!  Definitely has the Embassy Suites vibe, minus the breakfast.I only attended a conference here so I can only review the conference facilities. The facilities in one word is breathtaking. The first thought when I stepped in was "" I wish I had my wedding here"". The catering from the hotel was also very good and had a ""high end"" feel. The only negatives were uneven cooling of the conference rooms and confusion regarding the two sections of the hotel.Stay: Fri 11/30 - Sun 12/02Top-shelf quality that was so affordable...the attention of the staff was excellent and the rooms surprisingly expansive....the close proximity to the Inner Harbor area was another pleasant surprise, so much that we did not move our car once the whole weekend! We definitely plan to return! ...now the Wife and I are from and live in the city, so the presence of the ""neighborhood"" folk and the panhandlers offering door service at the 7-11 (best hot cocoa!) are no big deal to us but if such is your concern, just be prepared...not at all threatening, just present...but hey, it's THEIR city, we're just visiting!By the way, you can avoid the higher priced valet parking by using the city parking garage right next-door (parking is definitely a challenge!) On the weekend, it's only $5 per day which for us -not moving our car at all- meant only $10 for the whole weekend! (less than one day in the hotel's valet parking)...the challenge though, if you must leave/re-enter the city garage, you must pay again, but even then, it will still be less expensive...A caveat about the price review...I found a great deal on-line, this is clearly a much more expensive hotel at the regular rate...I've stayed in worse &amp; better places.  This was my second stay here in 30 days.First time w/ wife &amp; some of the kids - stay was fineThis time w/ my loudly snoring brother (should have brought my moto earplugs)Same type of room - 2 Queen beds, very comfy within a nice large room.  Big Bonus is they have a kitchen w/ refrig - keep them drinks chillin.Bathrooms could use a make over, due to older fixtures, but everything worked &amp; was clean.I used hotel tonight app to book &amp; saved myself $70. Good StuffStaff friendly - No worriesI had out of  town visitors book a room here through Hotwire as a secret hotel. It was an incredible value, at $56 a night. They were upgraded to a king suite upon checking in. With the Manager's special (free drinks and snacks every day during Happy Hour!) and the hot breakfast buffet, the hotel was such a steal. The staff were incredibly enthusiastic and helpful. Really remarkably so. When we pulled up in the car, the four valets immediately approached and opened the doors. They were standing outside in the cold waiting for guests. And managing to genuinely smile at the same time.The room was not luxurious but clean and comfortable. The downside was the $32/day valet parking.I would definitely recommend this hotel, and find it on Hotwire if you can. It was 3.5 stars on Hotwire. What a bargain.I was here for a conference so I cannot attest to the hotel accommodations for overnight stays.  The conference facility was very nice and the architecture is really something to marvel at.  The rooms are cavernous and there was a bit of a challenge with keeping the temperature consistent but considering the 20+ foot tall ceilings and tons of stone, it's easy to understand why.This building is a restored Masonic Grand Lodge from the days when the Masons were in the money.  The Tremont has done a very nice job with the restoration.  Very nice place.After RUNNING out of the Radisson Lord Plaza Hotel just a couple blocks over because it was DISGUSTING, we found solace when we entered this hotel and spent the weekend here.  Thanks for saving us Tremont, we appreciate it.  We would definitely stay here again.Rooms: Spacious and Clean.Staff: Friendly.Elevator:  About as slow as your 90 year old grandma MildredThis place is very deceiving. It's under construction so the pull up and lobby look completely unlike any of their photos. It was a bizarre check in experience. The room itself is very nice and comfortable. However, maid service never gave us new towels the second day so we had to ask for them and when they did come they were just thrown into the room. Lastly, upon check out, they gave us a bill for $96 stating we used their valet service three times for overnight stays. We used it for 1 hour upon checkin which should have only been $20. Now we have to fight them to change the bill. One more thing - their paperwork in the room says there is dining options but when I called it was busy so then I called the front desk and they said it was out of date information. It's hard to call this one since we liked the room but the service was terrible.First time here and even though we came on what may have been there busiest weekend EVER (2 family reunions and 1 wedding) he staff was still prompt and super friendly. Con - the vast amount of people here has created a slow moving elevator system. Granted we are on the very top floor so I'm being understandable of the wait.The deli attached is great. While on one of those long elevator waits we met one of the staff members and she was super friendly. Went into the deli and she was still on duty. We ordered two sandwiches, got two sodas, two bags of chips and six pack of canned beer (canned coronas who knew) total came to $36.00 and because of her great customer service skills she will be leaving today with a nice tip from us.Back in the room the space is amazing, mini kitchen area when first walk in, a sitting area with desk and around corner the bathroom and bedroom. The bed is very comfortable and well decorated. The room as a whole is clean and well maintained.Will I be back that would be a hell yes.I really loved the whole set up crazy but it had an historic feel to the place the marble and the ambiance was lovely. Might seem crazy but the ladies room totally drew oohs and ahhs from me it was like a palace I felt under- dressed. Would love to see how the outside looks once construction is complete.Had another good stay here, but the place was under rennovation and my room smelled a bit.  Other than that, I had a nice kitchen in my room, the TV was large, the bed and linens were unbelievably comfy, the toiletries in the bathroom were fabulous, and the price was more than right!!!!  Thanks for another great stay!!!My husband and I decided to get away for a weekend and visit the Baltimore Aquarium While in the city we decided to stay at the Tremont Hotel. I was unaware of the renovation until I called a week after making the reservation. I didn't think it would be too bad because they were allowing people to book rooms and stay at the hotel. I was wrong about that.When we walked into the hotel to check in there were loud construction noises. I couldn't believe people were actually having conversations with the employees at the front desk because I could barely my husband standing right next to me.There were four elevators but only two worked. The two that worked too FOREVER to arrive and at one point we decided, along with the two other people waiting, to take the stairs down. We were on the 9th floor and I was surprised by how fast we were able to get down to the 2nd floor. The stairwell, however, is not those who are claustrophobic. The only way to travel on the stairs is single file. Quite frankly the elevators weren't much better. They were cramped and made some perplexing noises. When we were leaving we called for the elevator (going down, of course) and it brought us an elevator going up. We had to take the elevator to the 23rd floor just to go down. It was awful. The room wasn't bad; in fact it was pretty nice. It was very big compared to others I've stayed in. It had a nice TV that rotated so you could watch it either from the couch or bed. I was able to maneuver it so I could watch the TV while dressing the closet area so that was nice. The room was hot so we had to turn the A/C on to get it cool. It still felt clammy even when it cooled down some.The bathroom was right next to the elevator but it was one that wasn't working so we didn't have to listen to it during our stay. The bathroom was ... oddly designed. The sink was at this weird angle and there was a floor length mirror in front of the toilet. I would have understood if there wasn't another floor length mirror in the room but there wasn't. The water pressure wasn't that great and even with the water not coming out at high pressure the tub had some trouble draining. If I showered for any longer the water would have been up to my ankles instead of just covering the bottom of my feet. The towels were comfortable, not like your usual scratchy hotel towels, except they left fuzz all over me.We only stayed for one night and planned on eating at the hotel's restaurant. When we returned from our adventure we stopped at the front desk and asked if they had a menu. No, they didn't. Why? Because the restaurant wasn't open. Luckily I knew they had a deli connected to the hotel so we went there. It looked pretty bare and empty. I had my doubts about them but they proved me wrong. I initially ordered a turkey and ham club with bacon but they were out of bacon (!) so I went with a turkey sandwich with Muenster cheese, and honey mustard. They were out of roasted turkey and suggested pastrami turkey. I was skeptical, to say the least, but they offered me a slice to taste it and it was pretty good. It was a very tasty sandwich and they were very friendly employees. Kudos to the deli next door!Overall, the experience was meh. I wouldn't stay here again and I wouldn't have stayed here if I had known it was under so much construction. The elevator situation was REALLY annoying.We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday and our stay was outstanding. I left a note when booking that the reason for the stay was her birthday, and they upgraded us from the single King room we requested to a full suite with a living room, dining area, and kitchen. The complimentary breakfast was one of the best hotel breakfasts I've had, and the complimentary cocktail hour was fantastic as well. The location is great, right in the heart of downtown and a very short walk to Mount Vernon. The Charm City Circulator's Purple Route has a stop on the same corner as the hotel, providing a fast, free way to get to and from the Inner Harbor, Federal Hill, and Penn Station.Can't say enough good things about this hotel.This hotel is going through some renovations right now and every guest in the hotel knows it.First off, the valet for the hotel is really out of sorts. When we pulled up from the airport, there was a car blocking the entire valet and he was talking to an employee, so we just sat idle in our car waiting for him to move. After a few minutes, he, nor the employee were acknowledging that we were sitting there waiting. Finally, after about 6 minutes the employee yelled at us that the driver had locked his keys in his car and was waiting for a locksmith and we should pull around. When we did get our car in the right spot, we told another valet who was there that we would be valeting for the night, but we were just going to check in, drop off our bags, then come back out to go get some lunch, so don't take the car in the garage yet. He agreed it was fine and told us to come down when we were ready and he'd have our car ready to go.Fifteen minutes later we came down and our car was there, but the valet was nowhere to be found. We waited about 10 minutes for him to finally show up so we could get our keys and we left. Little did we know, the would be our experience every time. At every turn, we were waiting 20 minutes for a valet to show up with our car. Even when we called it in from the room 10 minutes early. They were very understaffed.When we check in, the counter only had one employee there trying to service about 4 people and more and more people kept filling the small lobby. The little store in the hotel, which is supposed to offer amenities didn't have good stock. There wasn't even bottled water available. The rooms: luckily, we asked for a got a newly remodeled room, so it had all the right ""visuals"" or a nice room. fluffy bedding, decent big couch, nice flat screen, granite countertops. But, the room was layed out really weird. The wet-bar area, which was just a small room the held the coffee maker, ice bucket and mini fridge was bigger than the bathroom. Speaking of the bathroom, it was really tiny. I mean the corner sink area was so tiny, there was no room to put personal items on it. The toilet was also crammed between the tiny sink and the decent sized bathtub. A bathroom that size needed a shower stall.A few other things that were crappy: 1 ) the first night we were there we couldn't get any hot water. We called the front desk at 30 minutes later they sent up a man at 10:30 to our room and all he did was tell us to turn on the faucet and wait a while for the hot water. It never came. 2) He was also sent up because it was so hot and muggy in our room and the air wasn't pumping out cool air. He also had a non-helpful answer to that: the air works by sensing if people are in the room and will cool off accordingly. We had already been in our room for 2 hours before he came up. 3) There were only a few plugs in the room and none of them were located near the bed. Two of the four plugs in our room didn't work also. 4) The sheets were itchy. The were pressed, white and smelled like industrial cleaner. I bet at most they were 150 thread count. 5) This is a picky one, but the TV was in a weird place. I mean, you couldn't lay in bed and watch it because it was on a perpendicular wall. 6) Oh, and the music in the lobby was SOO LOUD! 7) only 2 of the 4 elevators were working and this hotel has something like 28 floors. So, you had to wait literally 5 whole minute for the elevator!For the price per night plus the valet fees, this place was awful.","We visited Tremont Hotel over Spring Break, and what a wonderful surprise.  We got a great price from a Living Social deal, so I wasn't expecting very much; however, like some of the other reviews stated:  the rooms are large and well kept.  The entire hotel is undergoing construction, but none of this bothered us because we were out and about all day long.  The person that took our luggage was kind and upbeat, and Damian, at the front desk, is awesome!  In addition, we left our baby's blanket at the hotel, but thankfully Damian, Sofia &amp; Gera, from housekeeping, helped us locate it.  They went beyond their jobs in helping us.  Thank you to the Tremont Staff!We spent five nights at this hotel for my daughters volleyball tournament.  The rooms were spacious, very clean and nice.  The bed was so comfortable with soft sheets and a nice down comforter, I slept like a baby!  And having a mini kitchen was just great as well.  The location is also excellent with walking distance to the harbor area with nice shopping and restaurants.  And of course close to the convention center.But honestly the best part of this hotel is the staff.  Every person greated us with a smile every time we interacted with them.  I know they call Baltimore the Charm city and I can say the Tremont definately has the Charm.  They also delt with two teams of 15/16 year old girls with grace and professionalism.  What a great experience.Stayed here for a work conference.  The rooms are great and spacious.  The best part is the bed.  It is not often that I have a good nights sleep while on the road.  The sheets are ultra comfortable and so it the mattress.While planning a friends bachelorette party, we scored an awesome deal through LivingSocial, paying only $109 for a King Suite.  That's $327 for three rooms, which would've cost us well over $600 at full price.  Unbelievable.Check-in was a breeze.  They asked if we wanted the rooms close together, and I said yes if possible, but instead we were on the 19th, 23rd and 32nd floor.  Not a big deal though.  The rooms were very spacious and well kept.  Decor was attractive and updated.  And man, did they have fantastic views of the city!  I had called the day before and asked if they could provide champagne glasses since we were celebrating and they were happy to accomodate.  Some of the girls checked into one room earlier and when I had noticed that there were no glasses, the phone literally rang that moment with the concierge asking which room to deliver the glasses to, since we had three of them!  Perfect.  Some of us grabbed some food from downstairs and everyone thought it was pretty good.  Tug's had messed up one order, even though they were the only customers in the place, but they fixed it.When it was time to go out, the doorman was quick with hailing us two cabs and made sure the cabbies knew where we were going.  When we returned, they were patient and politely held the door open for us as we, ahem, carried one of the gals in.The beds and sleep sofas were very comfortable and the sheets were fantastic.  I meant to check what brand/material they were but I forgot.There was some minor confusion when we checked out because the invoices we received under our doors showed an outstanding balance but when I checked with the front desk, they said all I owed were the taxes, which was only $8/room.  They will valet your car for $25/night or you can park in the garage right next door for $10.  It's a secure garage so I had no issues with leaving it there.I noticed the scaffolding outside but didn't notice or hear any construction activity during our stay, though it was a Saturday-Sunday trip.My husband and I came to visit this lovely hotel with a Groupon on our anniversary week back in October 2012. The room was cute, the view from the window was great, and the bed was VERY comfy. This hotel was in walking distance of the harbor where we were able to go site seeing and visit the local aquarium. We would of spent more time then 3 days and 2 nights, but it was a bit pricey or we would of stayed longer =)When you walked into this hotel it was very beautiful. The lobby was small however it was nice. The staff was very attentive and helpful. I had arrived around rush hour and the bell hop was eager to assist me with my luggage out of the cab. I had acquired this hotel via Priceline and this name just popped up via ""Name your Own Price"" Option. I had never heard of this hotel but I was not disappointed. The room was very quaint and felt very much like home. A plus was that the hotel was close to area restaurants as well as walking distance to the infamous Baltimore Harbor. I would definitely stay at this hotel again I had a excellent experience.The hotel is great.  Staff is great at check in and valet parking as well even that there is remodel going on. Only down is deli staff which is not owned by hotel but I got package that includes it, staff there dirty, doesn't seem to care about guest or anything.Beautiful, beautiful hotel. It must have been renovated recently because everything looked so beautiful and new, and the interior design was great. Everyone was very nice, helpful and friendly. My stay was very pleasant. Such a great value for a NICE free breakfast and FREE wine every evening!Spacious and clean rooms. Super friendly and helpful staff. Can't beat this hotel for the price.I can't get over how rude the staff is! We stayed in the hotel for one night for a wedding (which wasn't at the hotel).  From the moment we got there we had one bad experience after another with the staff. The room was OK.  It was spacious but definitely needed some updating.  Our biggest compliant was the way the staff spoke to its guest.  Many of our friends staying in this same hotel felt the same way.  We ordered room service and accidentally fell asleep before it arrived.  They said it would be up in 30 minutes but it took over an hour for it to come.  We woke up to someone practically kicking down the door.  The lady who brought it up SCREAMED at my husband for not answering the door right away.  SO RIDICULOUS! I would never ever stay here again!The next time I want to be wildly inconvenienced, made to feel uncomfortable and unsafe, and then patronized for having valid concerns, I'll stay at the Embassy Suites Inner Harbor again. -""suite"" was a lot smaller than you'd expect for the price, awkward set up (you must walk through the closet to get to the bathroom)-great location (easy walk to the inner harbor and short cab to Fells Point or Federal Hill)-only 4 elevators for 37 floors, plan to leave your room 10-15 minutes before you want to leave the hotel-don't bother with the valet, we parked our car on Friday night in the municipal lot next to the hotel and left on Sunday afternoon and it was only $10-staff needs professionalism trainingThis is could be a great hotel, but if you run into any issues you're out of luck. There was something wrong with our door and the way it shut so the lock didn't always catch even though the door would be closed. We didn't find this out until 3am when we returned from a night out only to find our door wide open. We called security and a guy came upstairs with just a piece of scrap paper and wrote down ""door was open."" They didn't even give us the option of switching rooms considering the door was totally unsafe. We were fortunate enough to not find anything missing, but we wanted security to check their tapes to be sure no one went into the room or tampered with the lock while we were gone. As it turns out, THE HOTEL DOESN'T HAVE ANY SECURITY CAMERAS IN THEIR HALLWAYS, and all they could do was have their ""engineers"" reference the lock the next day to see if any maids had gone in the room. The next morning when we went to breakfast we had the same issue with the door even after we took extra care to be sure it was closed. We asked the front desk about it but the security team never told management about the situation from the night before. The manager on duty told us there was probably just something wrong with the door because of the cold. She started rambling about how with concerns about the door we probably didn't sleep well... but she never offered us anything for the trouble we had. I spent an hour in the middle of the night trying to get some sort of answer from their security team about whether or not the lock was functioning and the hotel just brushed it off. I demanded that the security team actually look into this because I don't want someone else having the same issue. The next day they called me with the ""results"" and told me that in the future I should make sure the door closes. Okay, I'll start repeatedly re-checking that doors lock as if I have OCD as soon as your hotel starts valuing their guests' safety concerns.The Tremont is located in the 'safe' part of a sketchy city.  The rooms are spacious and clean, with a large common area and nicely laid out bathroom.  They have a restaurant and bar, but neither are open very late.  There's also an overpriced convenience store on the first floor with horrible coffee.The security guard / parking attendants out front could be a little more friendly when dealing with hotel patrons, and the front desk staff was downright stupid when it came to simple questions.There's a Caribou Coffee, supermarket, and a few small bars and restaurants within walking distance, in addition to the downtown waterfront ten minutes away.  Cabs are very easy to come by in front of the hotel as well.All in all, this spot might be a tad overpriced for some - there are many affordable hotels within walking distance of this one.The hotel is nice- clean room, friendly staff, and the architectural charm was fascinating.However, it seemed like the elevators were slow.overall, it was a nice stay.I signed up two days before actually staying there for a room with two queen beds for my buddy and I.  We showed up at 9pm that night to be told that they had overbooked those rooms and that we get an upgrade.  The upgrade was a room with a king and a sofa bed.A sofa bed?  I'm paying $200 a night for my friend to sleep on a sofa bed?  That really pissed me off.  How that was an upgrade I don't know.On top of all that, there was mold growing all over the ceiling of the closet in the bathroom.  They don't have any fans or anything so the moisture just builds up and rots the place.  So gross.I mentioned it to the staff about my displeasure at the room and the mold and they just brushed me off, please sign the bill sir.I'd rather spend $60 staying outside of the city and renting a car than stay here again.An incredible venue for a wedding reception. My wife and I were married on April 27th in the Edinburgh room.  It was exactly what we wanted.  The event staff  for the venue and our wedding planner made sure everything went as planned.  Cocktail hour was held in the Oriental room and we heard nothing but great things.  The reception was back in the Edinburgh as the staff was able to flip the room relatively quickly.  The room setup was beautiful.  The rooms themselves are great.  The architecture and decor of the venue is something to see.  We worked with Amy and she was fantastic. The food was great.  Our guest pretty much loved everything that was brought out.  I would definitely recommend to a couple looking for a venue in Baltimore.  Not to mention that the bride and groom suite was huge.  Highly recommended.I was here for a week-long conference for work. The rooms are breath-taking - almost all of them retain the old-fashioned Masonic lodge decor; only a few are the more modern, generic-looking conference spaces I'm used to. I will forever remember the Oriental Room with its wash of dark reds and golds - on the walls, the floors, and even the ceiling. The main room where our keynotes were held was just amazing, a cathedral-like room that required a few seconds of awe as soon as you walked in. It was nice, too, that one hallway included a few exhibits on the history of the place.With that said, the old-fashioned huge rooms were a bit of a problem. The Oriental Room, though fashionable, was also kept very dim - not the best place for active critical thinking. The main Masonic room was fine for large keynote addresses but the smaller sessions were swallowed up by the room. The projection screen was fairly useless for anyone in the back row as well. For some reason, the rooms were always set up with circular tables - strange for a conference. I would have expected the majority of rooms to be simple rows of chairs. The tables made it difficult to get close enough to the presenter for each session and gave a haphazard, spread-out feel (though they were great for the few group projects we did).Went to Baltimore for the weekend and stayed at this hotel. We stayed in the studio style suite, which included 2 queen size beds, a kitchen, tv, and a spacious closet. It was just the two of us, but that was the smallest room they had, which to us it's pretty big for just the 2 of us. The closet space was so spacious we could have 2 other people stayed inside. As a matter of fact it seems like they were expecting someone to perhaps sleep inside the closet or something because there were extra blankets and pillow inside the closet.The beds were ridiculously comfortable! The pillows, blankets and everything about it was so soft and fluffy that we both slept an extra hour than intended. If my bed were like that at home I'll be late for work every day. We ran out of toothpaste, which their deli store did not carry. And all the stores around us were already closed, but luckily at the front desk they gave us toothpaste. On our last day we needed a cab to bring us back to the station, but there weren't any cabs at the time of our departure. The bellhop was nice enough to drive us to the station, but it's the same charge as a cab ride.The bar area was pretty neat and they are open until 12AM and you can take your drinks out of the bar. There's also jazz nights on the weekends, which we didn't check out. The gym was pretty nice, but haven't used it. The stay at this hotel was really nice and I would come back here. However there wasn't a nice view from our window, so all we saw was a cement wall and the sky.Did I mention how comfortable the beds were? I secretly wanted to take a pillow home with me, better yet the entire bed!My husband and I loved our stay here. From the fact there are only 10 rooms per floor to the fine service from the staff. Especially Jeremiah, the doorman. The hotel is within a 10 minute walk to the harbor which makes for good exercise. We look forward to staying again when we come back to Baltimore.I can't believe anyone would give this hotel less than five stars. Our stay over the 4th of July was fantastic! The rooms were very nice (especially for the price) and clean, the staff were very friendly and provided excellent service, and the hotel itself is very accessible. We had a problem with the a/c in the room we were in. I called down to the front desk and they sent someone up from maintenance very quickly. Once he determined our thermostat was faulty, they immediately moved us to another room, upgrading our accommodations to a full suite! I was very impressed. We'll definitely be going back.This review concerns only Tremont's reservation system.I sought to cancel a reservation with them. First I sent an email, replying to the emailed reservation confirmation they sent me, and asked for a confirmation of the cancelation.Two days later, after no response, I sent a follow-up email, again asking for confirmation. Two days later, after no response, I called to the number listed on email confirmation. The agent could not ever find my reservation, despite repeated attempts and providing her with all of the information contained in my reservation - confirmation number, name, arrival date. She indicated something about reservations that are made with the front desk aren't necessarily viewable by this ""after hours"" desk, and have to be canceled by the front desk. She asked me to call back on Monday, because it's ""after hours"" for the front desk (on Saturday early evening - really?).  So, in effect, I was asked to make up for the inadequacies in their reservation system, by trying a FOURTH time to cancel the reservation. I refused. I consider this level of service to be sub-par for a Motel 6, let alone a supposed good quality hotel in a city center. Good to know, so I didn't have to actually stay there to find this out.","['went', 'conference', 'pass', 'weekend', 'employees', 'help', 'hotel', 'point', 'conference', 'rooms', 'super', 'cold',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-inner-harbor-hotel-baltimore,Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel,2.5,$$,61,"This is a great hotel with an amazing location.  It's right next to the convention center (sky walkway) and walking distance to the inner harbor, little italy, and other downtown attractions.  Being long time Starwood preferred members, we can't compare to the other local hotels, but I was very satisfied with this hotel.  The staff was very helpful and polite, the room was spacious and clean, the club lounge served hot breakfast with 2 automatic espresso machines, and exercise room was nice as well.  There is a separate room with treadmills and bikes and then another room with free weights and some benches.The pool is just a wading pool and the chlorine had a weird smell to it, but that was really the only complaint.  For me, the location was so nice, having the ability to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  The hotel does give some passes to be able to leave the garage if you need to w/o having to pay for re-entry which is nice.Just stayed at the hotel for two days. The good:  All but one of the staff were very nice. The rooms were decent. Centrally located. Gym was nice for a hotel. Access to Mortons steakhouse or hotel restaurant. Although both were 50-100% higher priced than a non tourist located restaurant.     The bad:You have to pay for Wifi-really!? It's 2015!!Parking is still $27 a night for self park, as a guest. The garage is not directly connected to the building. You have to go to G2 and follow a tunnel to the hotel. The garage roof is very very low. I have an expedition and made it by 1 inch or less. If you have a larger vehicle or a Thule on top there is no way to fit. For 2 days I had over $100 in just tax,tourist tax and fees. That is crazy. The room was NOT well cleaned. My young daughter found dirty panties and shorts under the bed. (Adult dirty). Nice Sheraton, try explaining why some other girls panties are in your room to a 7yr old girl. The swimming pool is a joke. It barely larger than a decent jacuzzi. Deepest area is 4.5ft. I would not recommend for kids over 10 or they will be very disappointed.  The pool was also very cloudy, to the point you couldn't see the bottom. Although nicely located I couldn't believe the large number of homeless that constantly badgered my family, and I come from the DC metro area.  It's that bad.So annoyed. Checked in and asked for an upgrade. They said that would be $30/night unless I joined Starwood Preferred Guests. Joined Starwood Preferred Guests. Still $30/night. Seriously? And still no harbor view. Boooo!Sheraton is the low-end of the high-end hotel chains. They offer decent priced higher end hotel rooms without a lot of the fuss. That is not, however, to say that Sheraton hotels don't have high-end amenities. In fact, the Sheraton Inner Harbor is the perfect example of a mid-range (price) hotel with an enormous number of great benefits. By far the best thing about the hotel is the staff. They are just so darn on top of everything. You have a problem with your AC unit in the room - call the front desk and someone is at your room to fix the issue in minutes. Coming and going from the hotel frequently, I had the pleasure of interacting with the doormen on a number of occasions. They were the nicest guys. I mean it - the staff are great: from the front desk reception to the valet departure, everyone is top notch.The location is also a huge plus. If you have business in Baltimore, the Inner Harbor Hotel offers easy access to just about anywhere. In addition, there is a great morning run to be had around the harbor on the contiguous board walk. Certainly the hotel could use a bit of upgrades (note: They recently upgraded the Club Lounge and moved to a larger space with more food and drink options and a great harbor view), but all-and-all - it is a great place for the business traveler or the family on vacation. The staff are the best part.Trying to keep this short! In sum, having stayed here numerous times, I can honestly say this is the first hotel I try to book when staying in the Inner Harbor area. Having visited nearly every hotel in close proximity, the Sheraton is my first choice. Even if you're not happy with something their staff is on it pronto and will fix any issue you could possible have. I typically stay on the club level however the standard rooms are just as nice. For those who are unaware, they relocated and upgraded the club room to what was likely a suite space that wasn't being utilized as often as they'd hoped. Great deal for us as the new club room (as of Spring 2015) is awesome! So much more space than the old club room! They probably doubled the space and the view is a million times better. Not cramped like the old room. The early morning view of the harbor in particular is just spectacular. Plus those staying across from the club room don't have to hear the slamming of the door as people constantly come and go for early morning coffee. Great move on behalf of the Sheraton! The gym is much better than the comps in the area and parking is plentiful. Also love the pool. Thanks Sheraton for providing a space we can count on!The worst hotel I have EVER stayed at in my life.  Room  Smelled like mold. heating, cooling unit not working, was like 90 degrees in the room. RUDE,UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF. Don't expect any help from the manager he was the worst of all! Was told it was pet friendly brought my 5 lb dog with us. My husband and I went out and when we returned an hour later our dog was not in our room. HE WAS GONE!!! THEY TOOK OUR DOG WHO JUST HAD SURGERY A FEW DAYS PRIAR AND A CONE ON HIS HEAD OUT OF OUR ROOM!! The manager was belligerent, cocky, and he was a LIAR! He said we didn't have the dog in check in which we did.It was like we were in some kind of weird twilight zone. NOTHING and I mean NOTHING about this hotel stay was pleasant! Do yourself a favor and stay as far away from this hotel as possible!Thank you to everyone that works at this hotel! We had our wedding this past Saturday and had the most amazing experience. Special thanks to the Events &amp; Catering Director, Vaneska Adams the chefs, Sam and Mike, Banquet Staff and Front Desk staff for making the entire weekend stress-free for us. Luckily the Orioles were in town and guests were able to walk one block over the next day to watch a ballgame. It was certainly the Best Day (Weekend) Ever!Average Sheraton, seems to be in a little bit dodgy part of town but walking distance to inner harbor and federal hlll so decent options. Rooms are OK, though dated. Overall, a standard Sheraton experience.Every time I stay in Baltimore I stay in this hotel.It is located in the best part of Baltimore the Inner Harbor. It is conveniently located very close to all the major tourist attractions like the National Aquarium. Many fine restaurants are in the immediate area. It is well within stumbling distance of all of the  my favorite local dive bars.On the downside it is on the pricey side so get someone else to pay for it and it is not within walking distance to the train station so you have to take a taxi.My dad was born in Baltimore so coming here always reminds me of him.I'm honestly kind of disappointed in this hotel. I guess I expected more a Sheraton. I was at a conference and stayed for 3 days. My room smelled like cigarette smoke. And other than the pillows being flat once they were slept on the linens and room was fine.  Got a view of the stadium. The front desk staff was not the most courteous. When I made a call to inquire about something I just simply got a ""hello"", I guess bc they knew I called on their phone , but no ""how my I help you"" or anything.  Our valet was attentive and prompt and polite. The grill staff seemed short at times and annoyed to be working honestly. The podiums for the conference were all banged up and dented and scratched. But they had nice chairs. There was a vegetarian meal served for a luncheon and there was only one person at our table that finished the food. Work out facilities were nice.  The weight room could use a good sweeping. I just called the desk and asked for a late check out and they told me I couldn't.  There are 350 people here for this conference and we have to carry around our luggage to meetings. This just wasn't quite what I expected from a Sheraton.All I did was call to check on a reservation and the person who answered the phone was extremely short and rude. He also kept interrupting me while we were on the phone. I hope my stay in a few months isn't awful like some of the reviews I have read. However, after that one phone call, I don't have much hope.If you want to catch something, stay here!!! This place is filthy!!! Room was not cleaned during my stay, and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in days. There was some food on the floor when you get off elevator, and to my surprise it stayed there for 2 days!!! Actually it's still there as I write this review.  I HAVE ONLY ONE THING TO SAY....DONT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!! I will never make the mistake of staying at this Sheraton!!!!!!!!!!!!!They didn't clean my room, and when I tried to get someone to do it they hung on me three times. I'm a platinum spg member so if they treat me this bad I can't imagine how they treat others. Horrible hotel and poorly managed staff.It's been an experience, &amp; we've only been here an hour. We check in &amp; they tell us that the two double bed room for our three people was booked as a king. After a few angry words, we settle on getting a free roll away bed. A little later the desk informs us they are out of beds. After a few go arounds &amp; asking them to cancel our reservation &amp; find us another room, they came back with a much more expensive hotel. We finally agree to take extra blankets (to sleep on the floor) and the room at half price. To make matters even worse, while dealing with the front desk attendant, she had to continue to check with her supervisor three people over. Not once during our issue (even threatening to cancel the reservation) did he bother to come over and address us. Such terrible customer service. And for the cherry on top, we went to get a diet coke from the vending machine in the hall and a regular coke came out instead, and that was our last two singles. Hopefully the floor is comfortable, and guess who won't be back. Otherwise, the room is very nice, clean, etc.Looking at the reviews I was not expecting much but what we found was a truely 5 star experience! The hotel is located one block from the waterfront will shops and restaurants galore. The hotel is luxurious and the bed was to die for. Loved staying here.Staff is really friendly and professional. I stayed in the ""club house"" on the 14th floor and paid a lot for it but it's not worth it- the free drinks and food were not good. Powder eggs and dry sausage for breakfast both days and the evening fair was only cheese and grapes with free sodas. Definitely not worth the upgrade in price.Besides the disappointing upgrade the hotel itself was very typical. Great place to stay if you want to be within walking distance of the inner harbor or the Orioles stadium. They even have a shuttle to the casino if that is something you are interested in.Hubby and I stayed here for my recent birthday weekend in Baltimore. The GoodLocation was within short walking distance of the Harbor waterfront as well as the Water Taxi, various restaurants, Camden Yards, and the convention center.  We drove up from NoVa but didn't need to use our car the entire time.  The room was spacious and clean which is typical of other SPG properties. The staff were courteous and attentive. The BadWhen my husband booked the room, he was told we'd have a king room with a Sweet Sleeper bed.  What we got was a Murphy bed.  Not the most uncomfortable hotel bed, but definitely not what we are accustomed to at SPG hotels. We called to have our room changed, but there were no available rooms so we just stuck it out.I don't expect sound proof hotel rooms, but the walls in this hotel are THE thinnest in my hotel stay history.  And this is coming from someone who has spent countless nights in hotels all over the world.  We could easily hear our neighbors' conversation as well as the TV on both sides in addition to every door opening and closing in the hallway.  I assume they heard the same from us as well. This was particularly perturbing when the kids next door were up at 7AM on Sunday morning when I would have liked to sleep in after being out late on Saturday night.As there are other hotels nearby, I can't say that I'd stay here again, mainly due to the noise level. I like my sleep or else I'm cranky.More accurately, 1.5 stars. I got a sweet Expedia deal (something like $78/night) to stay here recently for a conference at JHU. I checked in around 10:30PM (avoiding a near-death via stampede by a busload of Indian and Chinese tourists, also checking in at the same time). The 7th floor room was adequate, if run down - frayed carpet, visibly outdated bathroom tiling and fixtures, a not-so-subtle musty smell. I wouldn't have chosen to stay there more than one (short) night. I made it the next morning to the gym, which was surprisingly well-maintained for all you LifeFitness treadmill fans out there. Staff are underwhelming. My Expedia deal came with free Wifi, but I spent at least 15 minutes at checkout getting the Wifi fee erased from my bill. Be sure to figure that into your checkout time. This is definitely not one of those places where you can feel comfortable walking out without first double-checking the printout slipped under the door!My girlfriend and I stayed there for one night during a work week. The hotel is clean and simple, nothing tantalizing about it. Thank God for the Morton's steak house otherwise I wouldn't have been thrilled with my stay. We had a server by the name William he was great!!! We drove a few hours to get there, once we arrived it then started pouring. So naturally we wanted to eat and wine down.  We actually didn't even have plans on eating at the hotel. I will admit it was a bit pricey for dinner however I would definitely go there again. I really wish I knew the name of the drink that was off the menu but was the best drink I had in a while. I guess for $18 it should be well worth it.Have you ever watched the ""soup nazi"" episode of Seinfeld? Well I'm guessing it's a  requirement to watch and emulate, for employment considerations here at this Sheraton. The staff here would get upset very very easily, even setting up a wake up call was irritating to them. On multiple occasions the front desk staff would pick up and immediately hang up the phone in phone in a hopeful, yet vain attempt you wouldn't call back. The hotel is noisy and you will get to know your neighbors very intimately. You will get to know their bathroom habits, and hear their arguments. You actually won't have to bother calling the angry woman at the front desk, because you can always count on your neighbor's alarm for a wake up.","Perfect location by Camden Yards.  We were able to check in early.  Staff were friendly.  Bed was a little hard but got a great nights sleep.  Would stay again when in the areaIf you enjoy a broken heater during the coldest months of the year, this place is for you.If you're one of those who like to be awoken by a gurgling drain from the bathroom instead of your alarm, boy, are you in luck. And, if you're one who likes clogged drains and dirty bathtubs with dirt rising from the bottom during your shower, then this place is for you!The staff could not be more rude. I travel for a living and spend more than 6 months out of the year on the road. I stay at SPG's all over the country and can assure you, corporate would be ashamed of this location if they ever knew how patrons were treated. Save your money and go else where!!3.5 stars.This Sheraton has been my home for over 4 months now. Come here every Monday-Thursday and know a lot of the staff by name.+:- Floor 14 and 15 have been upgraded and the rooms are super nice now. Sadly, it's only once in a while that you get one of those rooms.- Gym is very nice, free earphones (get yourself a couple of them)- If you're a status holder you get free breakfast and snacks around dinnertime at the lounge. Nothing too fancy though.- My fave thing though is the location, can't beat a morning run around the harbor!Overall, might be overpriced on some days...I stayed at this hotel for a work event mid July when they were having an extreme heat wave. It was not fun and very humid. Back to the hotel. It is located literally right behind/connected to the convention center. I stayed in  room 1128 which was a corner room with a partial harbor view. It was a pretty good sized room and the view was nice. I loved the king bed. The tv seemed a bit too small for the size room. I did not like the dark brown carpet. It gave me the creeps thinking about what the dark color could be hiding. The first night I didn't have any neighbors or at least they were pretty quiet. The second night I could definitely tell that folks were in the room on each side of me. The walls were not sound proof. I could hear people talking all the time. Not fun when you are trying to get work done. Overall it is not the worst hotel I have been in but not the best. This Sheraton could use an overhaul as well as some other Sheratons I have stayed in. Don't forget to include the meeting rooms in the overhaul.I usually don't write reviews because I am a person that would just brush off minor issues but this I will not brush off. I recently stayed at this Sheraton because my company was in AOTA. The building was whatever, customer service could be better. What made this trip miserable for me was that after my first night in the room, 910, I woke up with hives/rashes and I didn't know why. I asked my co-workers if they had any issues and three of them had some minor skin irritation. We just thought it could be the detergent so that is understandable. I asked customer service up front and they said they would have my sheets changed (they should really think about that option), I was on Benadryl cream and pills all week. The second day I told the manager and he offered to refund my Benadryl purchase and change the sheets again. I showed them my arms and my torso with all the marks but they just apologized without a solution. I stayed there for a week. Slept on the couch and everyday sucked. I came back to California and went to Kaiser first thing and they confirmed these hives/rashes were due to bites...THIS PLACE HAVE BED BUGS. I was sleeping on a bed with bed bugs and they just offered to change my sheets. I hope to never go back to this hotel and will make sure nobody I know will ever go here. Also, their room service food is terrible. Do not stay here. If you have some kind of skin irritation, you might want to leave ASAP.While we were at the Sheraton we spoke with 3 members of the staff, I can't even tell who was the worse, the 2 ladies in the front or the supervisor ! All of them so rude . We asked for a king , they gave us 2 queens , they wanted to charge $80 for parking , yes $80 just because we had a truck (we were moving from one state to another) and the parking lot we left the truck was completely empty, once we told them we were leaving , the supervisor said we had 5 minutes to drop off the keys in the reception ! Really rushed us out, the room was old , we just decided to go somewhere else , element. Such a. Better hotelWe stayed at the Sheraton Inner Harbor to attend a convention. The hotel is next to the convention center and is attached with a bridge connecting the two establishments. During our stay, there were several Baltimore Orioles game and I noticed that a lot of the fans stayed in this hotel too. The Orioles Camden Yard stadium is just 2 blocks from the hotel. There is a Light Rail Station next to Camden Yard and this will take you to and from Baltimore Airport. Also in Camden Yard is the MARC train station that you can use to go to Washington DC. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to inner harbor. As far as the physical state of the hotel, the rooms are dated but clean. You can tell that this hotel need to be upgraded. I recommend this hotel if you need to stay near the convention center and will stay here again if needed.$189.00 per night. Dirty room, portions of the carpeted room look like it hadn't been vacuumed in years. I actually moved some furniture, hoping the staff would clean it, no such luck. AC unit was also covered with dust- oink!What a remarkable property.  It's not just for the blithe, casual dismissiveness of the front desk that makes this a hostile hotel tour de force.No.  It was that my toilet didn't work nor did the television.  Not that I used them at the same time of course.  Wifi in the room?  Random connect and disconnect.   That's for both the toilet and the wifi.The gift shop?  What gift shop.  It carries 4 kinds of snacks and bottled water. I saw more exciting and dynamic offerings in post-soviet era Prague.Picture the worst hotel experience you've ever had, and multiply it by two. That would describe my experience at the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel.This delightful stay began innocently enough. I was able to check in in the morning, which was nice, since I had arrived on a red eye and would be in a business meeting all day, and needed to freshen up. But when I got back to my room that afternoon, there were screaming college students running down the hallway, blasting music in the room next door, lugging beer kegs, etc. I immediately called down to the front desk, and asked that they move my room. I was told I had to come downstairs to accomplish this. When I got to the front desk, there was a line out the door - almost literally - of more college students. I learned that this was like a multi-campus fraternity and sorority party, and the whole hotel was infested with busloads of these kids. (Got a sense of the quality of this establishment yet?)I eventually made it to the front desk and asked for another room, indicating that I wanted to be nowhere near this noise. I was given a new room key, and assumed that was that. When I got to the elevator bank to go to my new floor - the eighth floor - the elevator simply wasn't coming. Ten minutes went by. Finally, the elevator came - but when I got up to my new room, I saw that it hadn't been made up. The sheets were all over the place, the ironing board was out, etc. So now, I had to trudge back downstairs to get yet another new room. This time, I learned that half of the elevators had simply stopped working. WIth hundreds of college kids swarming the place, you can imagine how long it would take to catch an elevator.So yep - I had to climb down eight flights of stairs, reeking of stale cigarette smoke - to get back to the lobby. I barged into the interminable line of college students waiting to check in, and angrily demanded a new room - this time, a clean one.  The only apology I received from the harried, prepubescent desk clerk was free admission to the ""courtesy suite"" in the morning, which would allow me free continental breakfast. Whoopie. I then had to climb UP eight flights of stairs. With my luggage. When I got up to my THIRD room in one hour, I realized that there was no place safe from the hordes of screaming college kids. The hotel ignored them and didn't care. They were paying customers, after all (apparently something the hotel lacked?) So I had to endure people running down the hallway at all hours, loud music, and a teen couple having a loud and inane lover's spat in front of my door at 1 am. DId it not occur to these kids that this was a hotel, not a dorm?? You might argue that this wasn't the Sheraton's fault. They're not the parents of these kids. But it WAS their responsibility to ensure that their other guests were not disturbed, and on that count, they totally failed. So yep - that was my utterly fantastic experience. Never again.My husband and I love staying at this particular Sheraton.  We have never had any of the problems that some other reviewers have had and we've stayed here 3 times.  It's a great location and they allow our dog to come and stay at no charge.  Some other hotels charge as much as $100 a night for a pet, not Sheratons.  The beds are so comfortable and the rooms are spacious.  Yes, it's true they don't have a fridge or a microwave in the room but they do have a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee for you to make.  So the person that complained about not getting a free coffee and having to pay $6 was just wrong.  We even asked housekeeping and the front desk for more coffee and they were very accommodating.We've never eaten at the restaurant in house because we always venture into the Inner Harbor.  Of course the prices are going to be high. It's a famous steak house at a hotel!  Some people are just so...... ugh!  Once our room was next to the ice machine which we heard and we asked to change rooms.  It was no problem at all.  Everyone we've ever had contact with there was very polite.  We'll definitely be back.This is a perfectly fine hotel. I was attending a conference literally a block away, so location-wise, the Sheraton was a no-brainer. Now, considering how much my employer paid for me to stay here ($199 + tax), it probably wasn't a great value, but that aside, I had no trouble with my stay.The room was clean and spacious. Bed was comfortable. Shower had good pressure. Check-in was fast, and staff was pleasant. There was a nice looking flat-screen TV, but I never turned it on. I didn't come to Baltimore to watch TV, after all. If I could get a decent deal, I'd stay here again. It's not the Ritz, but it gets the job done.Our stay here was so horrible, we are ending our relationship with the Starwood Gold  member program. We were given a horrible room overlooking a parking lot, although the hotel was not close to full, no upgrade whatsoever, dirty bathroom(some bizarre ooze on the door) not cleaned even after we complained. A floor full of prom goers-why were they even aloud to be in the hotel?-minors, drunk and fighting in the halls. Required FOUR PHONE CALLS before they were removed. No compensation offered for our awful stay even after contacting the manager and the Starwood program. Never again, Starwood. We love the W and Aloft hotels, but this is the last time we stay at one of your subpar brands such as Sheraton.Horrible horrible horrible.The rooms are clean, the staff was helpful and you can't beat the location if you're in town for a game. They have a Morton's in the lobby and an on site pub. It's a Sheraton so don't expect the service or amenities you'd get at a pricier hotel.Its a Sheraton.  Nice bed. Nothing fancy.Shout out to the super nice staff.I stayed here this week and was unimpressed with the old Marriott vibe (decor in rooms, etc...), slow internet, aberration of a fitness room and uncomfortable beds. Great service (especially in the club lounge) and a Morton's onsite although pros, didn't save this property. I can understand other people's visceral reaction - I'm glad I only stayed one night.Excellent customer service! Very clean rooms, pool, &amp; gym. We had a room with a nice view facing the harbor. Dislike that we had to pay for wifi, charged for parking, and no complimentary breakfast.Good location, good price.  Great staff.  Room ok.The room was large, the bed comfortable, and the a/c managed to keep up with the 98 degree heat.  Location is onvenient for both the Inner Harbor and Camden Yards.Here's what stood out:  Reina, the concierge, who seems to have invented Baltimore and knows everything about everything..  The front desk staff was super helpful.  The valet parking women were efficient and pleasant.Here's where the Sheraton needs some help:  the TV didn't work.  The clock radio's alarm appeared to be on (from someone else) and the only way we could figure to turn it off was to unplug it.  The bed only had a table and lamp on one side, not on the other. The only phone was by the bed, not on the desk.  Did I mention that the 27 inch flat screen TV didn't work?The Sheraton was perfectly fine.  Just about  every hotel chain is represented with 1/2 mile of the Inner Harbor.    Get the best price you can find and go for it.Old hotel.was going through some remodeling at the time.Interior and decor is a little dated.restaraunt is not very good, not my favorite place. breakfast buffett was horrible.I would say this is not a good value but they do try hard!! So staff was very friendly but again Rooms were clean and decent. Bed was nice and firmOverall hotel was disappointing but the location is pretty decent but please eat elsewhere.","Hmmm: The swimming pool was disturbingly filled with particulate matter, despite noting that the Pool Care Log noted 'Clear' for the last 5 entries. Keep young children, the elderly, and immuno-comprimised persons away. We washed the bathing suits 3 times now and the mildew smell still lingers. No ice or vending machines on the floors.Comforting, Great Location.My stay at this faclity was great! The staff was accommodating and the location was a few blocks from city center. Loved it!sheraton inner harbor in baltimore.. front desk..rude!staff NOT helpful!BAD EXPERIENCE!messed up my reservation for a king bed room, got double beds. Fortunately a friend of mine also got shafted in the opposite way so we ended up trading rooms, being right down the hall from eachother.The hotel itself is nice, but the beds weren't doing it for me. I woke up with extremely tense shoulders each morning of my stay.Only convenience is it's location and connection to the convention center. Otherwise I'd definitely stay at the hyatt or the bran new hilton next time.Old tub, sheets crinkly and loose, I could hear my next door neighbor pretty obviously early in the AM.Smoky room (I felt like it was masked by heavy perfume).Although only $70/night I did not enjoy my stay.Free computer usage and water in the lobby area. Walkable to the GALLERY MALL SHOP but stores are lame.Standard room with double bead was nice. Mattress was comfortable. Nothing spectacular. Of note, parking fees are atrocious. I was charged $27 to park for what amounted to 12 hours. Try to find other parking accommodations nearby if possible.There are a lot of things to love about this place. The view from where we were was spectacular as we got to see the harbor simply by opening the curtains. The outside area on the second floor breezeway to the convention center (yes, it's pretty much connected to the convention center) is set up nicely with comfy lounge chairs and tables. The front desk staff was ALWAYS friendly and incredibly helpful. We were able to get an early check-in at no additional cost (which is available only if the room they assigned you to was cleaned out and ready for you), 12pm check out is great, they have a rental car station, garage (expensive but necessary for us at the time so I'm not taking stars away from them for that but $27, ouch), The doormen were really polite and ready to lend a helping hand at the drop of a hat, and our room was great. Beds are comfy, bathroom is nice with a long counter top which was necessary for 2 women to share lol, great coffee, within walking distance (a block) from the harbor, lot's of spaces for lounging throughout the hotel, 2 restaurants inside. I mean it was hard not to love this place. There wasn't a fridge in our room which is a bummer but not a deal breaker. People would prob deduct stars for the lack of fridge and how expensive parking is I know usually I would but they have so much going on to make up for those things that it really shouldn't. Great Customer service, respect, and politeness no matter what the situation is is hard to come by but not here.One of the bad things about traveling from the West Coast to the East, is arriving late at hotels and getting a bad room.  Since I'm Gold Preferred Guest at Starwood, and also had called ahead about my room, I wasn't too worried.  I should have been.Arrived after midnight, and first impression:  no one outside to help with car or luggage.  Once inside, second impression: small lobby and boring!  Nothing got better at the front desk.  When I inquired about possibly getting a better view, I was told that it would be $15 extra for a view of the Inner Harbor.  Come on - as I said, I'm Starwood Gold, and have been Platinum for years - I have NEVER been asked to pay extra for a view.  In Hawaii, Sheraton upgraded me to Ocean Front, no charge and in Seattle, Westin gave me a connecting second room for a friend for 3 nights of my stay for FREE!  So maybe I'm spoiled, but it seems pretty ridicuolus to pay $15 more a night to get a view of the Inner Harbor - it's just Baltimore guys!  And the woman behind the counter is so sticky sweet fake nice, that I want to throw up as she tells me this.  So I get up to my non-view room and it's an ""accessible"" room.  So it's great that hotels have these rooms for people that need them, but they are also the rooms that when they are not needed are passed off on the unsuspecting victims.  The bathrooms are funky - weird toilets and showers and all that.  So not only do I not get a room with a view, but I get the lowest room on the totem pole of rooms.  I go back downstairs, I almost cry, I spill a diet coke - and suddenly a room with a view magically appears, no extra fee.  Why couldn't we have skipped the drama and went straight to this room?  So at least I have my room with the view now, but this hotel still needs help.  The staff all seems like they are just going through the motions.  The room looks like it has some new furnishings, but it's not super clean - there was even dust on the blow dryer.  And the bed is supposed to be ""Sweet Sleeper"" but they don't compare to the Marriott beds that make you sleep in and never want to wake up.  And where are all the amenities for frequent travelers?  Marriott has: bonus points at check-in, upgrades (hint hint) and a concierge level.  What is Sheraton bringing to the table?  Come on guys. pony up!Good location, that's the only thing that is good. My room smelled like cigarrettes and it was small and dark. The bed was awful, the GYM is the worst I have seen in a hotel (old machines and it is the size of a room). The swimming pool has space for 5 people, they should call it a tub, not a pool. On the top of all this, the service was awful. They did not do my room one day and when I asked why, they said it happens. No apology... juts an offer to make my room at 11 PM that I came back from work eager to sleep. Really, by far the worst experience I have ever had in a hotel. Oh, and I am a gold member of starwood so I guess if you are not, you will get an even worse experience.I stayed at this hotel because I thought it was the closest one to the Convention Center.  But it wasn't.  The Hilton is directly connected to the Convention Center.  If I had known that, I would have stayed there.I had several gripes with my stay:-There are no electrical outlets near the bed.  That means that the alarm clock is located on the table across the room from the bed.  That's not a fun way to wake up although, it means that you're less likely to snooze.  It also means that you have to plug in your phone across the room from your bed.  -I was put in a handicapped room and I wasn't even asked or notified prior to arriving in my room.  The handicapped room was OK except for the bathroom which had barely any counter space and felt very hospital like. -They try to encourage green practices like rewarding you with a $5 voucher for every day that you decline housekeeping services.  However, they don't tell you that you can only use their voucher in their restaurant or room service and NOT in their gift shop.  So, who can get away with only spending $5 at a hotel restaurant?.-Their gift shop closes really early.  It was closed by 8pm on Sunday.-The sink gurgled all night.  It was so loud that it would wake me up!  Other people who stayed there also said they had the same experience.  -The walls are really thin.  I could hear full conversations from the people in the room next door and they didn't seem to be talking particularly loud.  I could hear the words they were saying so it wasn't muffled sounds.  The hotel is close to the Inner Harbor area and the Convention Center and the doormen are very friendly.  However I won't be choosing to stay here again in the future.Before we go on, I have to say that Priceline rocks and the whole ""name your price"" thing is great.  This is only the 2nd time I've used it, but I will probably use it from now on.With that said, the Sheraton Inner harbor is a pretty good hotel with good service.  The rooms were clean and we had a pretty decent view.  Its location was excellent for all the tourist trap stuff.  Right before we checked out some guy was having trouble with his keycard.  He asked us if we could help... he had the card oriented the wrong way... but even after getting that right, he couldn't get it to open.  ""Be more assertive"" was the next thing that blabbed out of my mouth.  I had no idea what I meant, either, but after hesitating for a moment, he inserted the card like a man and the door opened.Yeah... that's why they pay me the big bucks.Plain and simple: Satisfied with my stay. My room was nice, the bed was comfy, the concierge was very helpful (thanks again Rena!) and the rest of the staff accommodated where they could. If in Baltimore, and on someone else's tab, I would stay here again... very easy to get to, within walking distance of plenty of restaurants and things to do and the neighborhood seemed pretty safe.I was staying here for a short business trip.  It was a particular comfortable stay at this hotel.  On the day of arrival, I called to confirm my room (I have too many bad experience that they give away your room for late arrival).  I told them I probably would be arriving late, front desk said that's fine, my room would be available when I arrived.  Of course, when I got there...they ran out of the room that I reserved, the only room left was a room with a queen size Murphy bed.  I was so tired, didn't want to fight, I just took what they gave me.  The room itself it's a large suite (it's a dining room which was an extension from the next suite).  It had a dining table, two couches, big screen TV, small kitchenette, bathroom and the Murphy bed.Since it was a extension room from next door, there was a connection door, which did not blocked sound that well and I could hear the family next door.  I laid down on the Murphy bed and watched the Celtics final game on the big screen TV, and I started to notice this humming noise from the vent/AC in my room.  I knocked on the vent couple times, and the humming noise sorted stopped.  I didn't notice it as much once I fell asleep that night, but I woke up couple time the next night cuz it was bugging me. I finally called front desk at 5am, and they sent maintenance immediately to check it out.  Maintenance opened the whole vent, changed the filter, and just left the cover off in order to avoid the humming noise. When I checked out, I told front desk about my complaint of my stay.  She said ""okay"", not sorries or anything.  I called back later to talk to supervisor, she apologized about the inconvenience and gave me some extra award points.Crappy.  Crappy.  Crappy. Crappy rooms, crappy service, crappy location.  Ugh.  I just felt dirty staying here!  Have decided to break out of my Starwood points-hoarding next time I have to be in Baltimore.Stayed three nights for a conference. The room was small and had a strange floor plan, but was a corner room overlooking Camden Yards.  Food at the Sports bar was very good! Try the salads - the chef makes great efforts to prepare them.Starbucks coffee in the rooms. Housekeeping didn't clean the coffee pot every day.The TV worked. Well, at least it turned on. The channels were fuzzy, like it was on an old tv antenna rather than HD cable.  As with nearly all hotel remote controls this one had to be cleaned before use, and the keys still stuck sometimes. (what do people do with the remotes? maybe we don't want to know!)The first night was pretty noisy as there were people in the adjoining room. Afterwards, it was pretty quiet.For Jazzy, at $70 you got a deal when compared to our conference price.~Stayed here at a discount for the Yankees/Orioles game on 9/7/12. Great location and very helpful and friendly staff. You can walk to Camden Yards and the Inner Harbor in a few minutes. I will stay here again the next time I come down to Baltimore to see my Yankees kick Oriole butt!!!I stayed here as part of a Starwood Free Weekend Reward Bonus.  Its located right near the Inner Harbor (which was the whole purpose of my trip).  The room wasn't spectacular, but the king bed was comfy and they did have a flat screen (I just wished the room had a refrigerator to preserve my leftover crabs).  Overnight parking was $24 (unlimited in and outs).Expensive parking @ $28.  SLOW internet and extra fee. Terrible tv reception. No channel guide or hotel/pool/club/restaurant info in the room or on tv.  Room temp programmed for 60F and it took 3 calls to the front desk and a 45 min wait till midnight to get it reprogrammed.  Room smelled like cigarettes. Bartender @ Oriole bar could not find the wine I ordered from menu and offered ""spumanti"" which he tried to assure me ""was the same thing.""  Yeah, well, they both had bubbles.  I tried to order a beer instead but he couldn't tear his eyes off the TV sports news (not even a live game).  Restaurant food just okay, and expensive - take the circulator or walk to Little Italy instead.  Room large clean and comfortable. Convenient location.This was the worst hotel experience ever.  First, the heating unit in the room was broken.  It took three hours on the second day of our stay for this to be fixed (a new unit had to be installed).  One afternoon I came back to the room and put the latch on the door.  As I was going to the bathroom, a housekeeping person came into the room (so much for the security offered by the latch).  We extended our stay by one night due to storm weather.  My (now ex-) wife went downstairs and arranged for the extra night's stay.  The next day I returned to the room and the room key would not work.  I went to the front desk and informed them of the problem.  The employee, Winston (who also turned out to be the manager) seemed to view me as a problem from the moment I approached the desk.  He also seemed to take some strange delight in my misfortune.  He asked for ID and the room details.  The manager said my name was not on the room so he could not let me in for ""security reasons"".  A few hours after my wife returned from her conference.  We went to the front desk again.  It turns out that we should have been issued new keys the day before when the stay was extended.  And, my name was on the room booking (but when they had extended the booking for an extra night, they only put my wife's name on the booking for that night).  Unbelievable.  I will never stay in a Sheraton again after this experience.Spent two nights at the Sheraton Inner Harbor. Location is great. Very near the Inner Harbor (3-5 minute easy walk). Room was fine.Bed was great. I booked a room that viewed the Harbor. Had a great view. Bedroom was perhaps a little small for he price paid. Wi-Fi is not free - which is should be. The Morton Steak House has a great deal on appetizers before 6:30 and after 9:30 pm. Concierge (Rena) was very helpful. Make sure you ask for her to get suggestions for what to do and restaurants.","In my lifetime, I've stayed at a good number of hotels and I've had some fantastic and some disappointing experiences.  This Sheraton would be on my top three of disappointing experiences.   Lets begin with the bell hops, I pull up to the hotel entrance and instead of greeting us, he comes  to me and asks me ""do you need any help?""  Lets see, I have a toddler, my wife, two pieces of luggage and a few other smaller bags.  I would say a little help would have been nice.  I say yes and then he proceeds to load our luggage.  Actually I load it myself and he just watched.  He proceeds to wheel the dolly to the lobby and instead of keeping an eye on it he just puts it next to a wall and walks away.  If my wife didn't keep an eye on it, it would have been easy for someone to take a few of our items.  Now for the best part of the hotel.  The front desk.  I have never met such a misinformed, incompetent and full of attitude front desk attendant in my life.  We approach the desk at 5pm to check in, and we reserved three rooms.  Please keep in mind that check in is 3pm.  The front desk attendant that was helping us (or should I say not really helping us) tells us that our rooms are not ready yet.  I asked her what time check in is, she proceeds to tell me that its 3pm.  I tell her its 5pm, then she proceeds to tell me that the 3pm check in is upon availability.  I think to myself, is she serious and then I proceed to ask her if she was kidding.  She says that she's serious.  I asked her where in the documentation it states that it is ""upon availability"" she looks at the reservation papers and doesn't know so she asks her colleague where it is.  They proceed to point to a little footnote looking for anything that can be related to the nonsense that she uttered and she proceeds to point out something that has nothing to do with reservations.  I proceed to tell her that, the statement that she pointed out has nothing to do with our conversation.  She says there is nothing she can do.  In these situations, the front desk attendant would be apologizing for the inconvenience and would ask if we would like to grab some drinks at the bar while we wait for our rooms to be ready.  But here, all I get it is attitude and a person who insists that the 3pm check in is only really a guideline and if your room isn't ready by the time you arrive after check in time your are SOL but you still have to pay the full room rate.  While the conversation is still happening, miraculously the three rooms we reserved are ready.  This place really is a shit show.  This could have all been avoided but I guess they wanted to test me on whether I would bitch or not about the rooms not being ready two hours after check in.  The room:  Crap, crap and crap.  For the rate we were paying for the less than 350 sq ft. rooms totally not worth it, it was old and somewhat stinky.  Bath room smelled of mold and the ceiling had some water damage.  You definitely want to keep your shoes on in the room.  If you're walking around barefoot you'll most likely contract some type of foot fungus.  Not much more I can say about the room, but not worth it.  There was one incident that stuck out in my mind that really annoyed me more than the front desk attendant.  A young boy was walking to the revolving door but I guess he was caught between the door and the wall of the doorway and he seemed to be in pain, crying, tears, yelling the whole bit.  The parents were helping him up and consoling him.  There were two porters/bell men about five feet from this incident and all they did was stand there and watched.  Instead of going over and helping and asking if they need assistance.  They just didn't care and looked over as though its not worth their time or effort.  Unfortunately this place suffers from ill-trained, lazy employees.  Of course this is a blanket statement and there are exceptions.  But from the the people that I've dealt with and experienced this is my take on the hotel.  The porter that helped us down with our luggage was pleasant and informative, as he asked us how our stay was and we talked about local restaurants.  He helped us to our car and the lobby attendant helped load our car.  I was thinking to myself just as I was leaving the service got better, unfortunately it had to start off so poorly.  I usually don't write this much as I have better things to do, but I wanted my experience here was spectacularly underwhelming.  Spend your hard earned dollars somewhere else where they appreciate you.",,"['great', 'hotel', 'amazing', 'location', 'right', 'next', 'convention', 'center', 'sky', 'walkway', 'walking', 'distance',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/royal-sonesta-harbor-court-baltimore-baltimore,Royal Sonesta Harbor Court Baltimore,3.0,$$$,61,"This was my second time staying in this particular building, my first time being back in 2006 when this building was still the Intercontinental. The good:It's located in the Inner Harbor within walking distance of the southern end of the Inner Harbor and the Baltimore convention center.The Federal Hill area is also within walking distance.Friendly staffClean, comfortable roomsFree basic wifi, but the connection is a bit spottyDecent gym and indoor poolThe bad:Most of my favorite restaurants in Baltimore are in Fells Point, which is on the northern end of the Inner Harbor. Around this hotel, you're stuck with mostly tourist trap restaurants like Bubba Gump.While my car was ok this time around, my car did get broken into in the hotel's parking garage during my previous stay. Overall:Certainly a reasonable lodging option if either the price is right, or if your primary destination is the convention center. Otherwise, I might recommend the Marriott or the Four Seasons on the other side of the harbor. Really a 3.5 star review, but will round up to 4 stars.Location!! I booked this hotel on Hotwire and got a great deal. I really preferred to stay in Harbor East, but couldn't find a deal in that area. Well this ended up being perfect. Inner Harbor directly across the street, Harbor East &amp; Little Italy are a 10 minute walk in one direction and Federal Hill is a 10 minute walk in the other direction. Loved it! We walked everywhere. Our room was a lot better than I expected. There was a large foyer when you walked in with a mini fridge, keurig, full length mirror and closet. The bathroom was spacious with a large tub. Then a nice big king bed, chair, and desk area. No complaints on the furniture or layout of the room. The only problem was air flow! I had the AC on high on the lowest temperature and it was still very stuffy. There was only one ceiling vent in each room and you couldn't even feel the air flow. That was disappointing. I was dying for one of those under the window units that blasts air! The other weird thing was parking. We couldn't figure out how to walk from the garage directly to the hotel, even though it appeared that they were connected. Maybe it was just us. Parking was $26 overnight, which is pretty standard in the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel based primarily on location, but the room was also very nice.Terrible view with dirty window and a wonderful view of construction. Picked the hotel because it was so close to the harbor and was loved by so many other hotel guest.My boyfriend and I came to have a romantic getaway. When we first arrived to the Sonesta, we were treated like royalty. The staff greeted us as if they had been preparing for our visit. After check-in, we went to our room and was amazed of the layout. Then to top that off, the view of the harbor was immaculate. We really enjoyed our night in a clean spacious room were we heard what we needed,...quietness. The bed was so comfortable with soft sheets. Even though we stayed one night, I wish we stayed more. I would definitely stay there again. Thank you Sonesta Royal for having the team you do that assisted with the excellent stay my boyfriend and I had.Check in was at 4pm we arrived at 420pm  room was not available.  The couple checking in next to us were offered 2 free drink vouchers to the bar....we were not offered anything until we said something about it to the clerk..  And we reserved  a large suite not just a regular room so you would think that they wojld be the first rooms to have ready since they are the most expensive.... then we walk into the coffee shop on lobby floor and were looking at the menu board for a few minutes and i asked for two coffees and they told me they were closed....Why wouldnt you say that when we walked in the ???The lobby and bar area are nice but thats all weve seen since our room isnt read uh still... not to mention we planned on showering and getting ready for dinner reservations at Roys Hawaiian  Bistro in harbor east at 7pm...so now we will have to cancel since we wont have time to get ready.....1 hr 15 min after check in time was supposed to be...i will not stay here again nor do i reccomend it to anyone elseWe stayed at Royal Sonesta in the King room with harbor view for Valentine's Day. The room was very nice and the view was amazing. There were, unfortunately, several issues that slightly soured our overall experience. When we initially arrived at the hotel, we pulled in to the valet area and immediately experienced disorganization. There were cars everywhere and a permanent structure in the middle of the driveway that made it very difficult to maneuver the cars. One of the valet drivers actually backed a car into a Mercedes while we were waiting. For the price, $40, we would have expected a higher level of professionalism. When I booked the room I got the Valentine's Day special that included a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. When we returned to the room after dinner at 7:30, they had not yet been delivered. After several calls to the front desk, we received our champagne and strawberries three hours later. The next morning we went to the Explorers restaurant for breakfast at 9 AM. When we got there, there was a line of people waiting to be seated. It appeared that they were extremely shortstaffed and very unorganized. There were only two waitstaff and a manager trying to seat and serve dozens of people. We waited over 30 minutes to be seated and the buffet breakfast that was offered left a lot to be desired. All that was offered was a few hot dishes and stale pastries for $20 per person. There's no free wifi offered either in the $300+/ night stay. For the price, next time I will choose a different hotel.The hotel is beautiful and conveniently located near the inner harbor. Walkable to Royal Farms Arena, The Convention Center and Camden Yards.Great restaurants and bars are also walkable from this hotel.We were checked in quite efficiently at 4 p.m. on a Monday. Our room, which was large by any standard, overlooked the courtyard. Very clean and comfy. The parking garage is next door. $26 for the overnight.We will return!Booked the hotel through Expedia.  We had stayed there before when it was under different ownership and it was great.  This experience was not stellar at all, this time around.The room key did not work and we were forced to have security let us into the room FIVE times, before they decided to change out the lock.  We left a review on Expedia, and Steve, who obviously tries to tend to their social media and online reputation, actually lied and said that after the room key not working, they upgraded us to another suite,  Funny, I don't remember that!  I do remember the hotel being booked solid because we were there for the Yankee game, and we were told that the hotel was completely booked. The hotel room was never cleaned, for the 2 nights and three days that we were there.  The reason was, they had so many guests and not enough staff.  That was straight from the front desk!The best part of the staff were the valets, who were actually awesome, which is the only reason I would give this place 1 star.Bad enough to have a horrible experience, but then for the staff to LIE about what accommodations (on Expedia) they supposedly gave and did not is just down right HORRIFIC.They charged double the normal room rate because the Yankees were in town and told us it was not because of the game, it was a supply and demand ""thing"".  Well, the demand was because of the game, so we got gauged and had a bad experience.You would think the hotel would actually reach out to the customer rather than lying about what accommodations and upgrades they got.  This review never would have been written if they didn't treat their customer bad and then lie about it.Very nice hotel. Room wasn't ready on check in so they upgraded us to a suite. Lovely view of harbor. Staff were very friendly. The room was clean and plenty of towels.I didn't have any parking/valet issues, just parked on the street. We'll probably stay there again sometime. Oh oh oh oh and check out the gym and racquetball - bananas.Very pleased w/ our stay. Staff is kind &amp; courteous.  We are on our 3rd night &amp; our room is very nice.  We have a harbor view king size.  I read that housekeeping has been spotty for some guests so i have taken the time to stop at the front desk on our way out each day &amp; request that housekeeping make up our room while weare out.  I have each time been met w/ a courteous smile &amp; upon our return, we have found our room tidied to perfection. Oh-and I must note, the hallways in the hotel smell exceptionally fresh-I am particularly critical.  The inner Harbor is truly within walking distance.  The Aquarium, Hard Rock, Rusty Scupper, Harbor Boats, Phillips Seafood, the Ripleys Museum-all easily walked to. You can take a water taxi from the Rusty Scupper to Fells Point &amp; then Uber back late night for about $6.We will be back-we booked through groupon and our Saturday night through Expedia-great value.Great hotel with a boutique feel. The salt water indoor pool and hot tub were very nice. Love the gardens and super awesome they keep bees! Happy hour at the bar on the second floor has great specials. Be sure to try the honey glazed wings since they use the honey from their own bees. Just a warning--$36/night for valet parking plus tax makes it almost $45/night. Might be worth looking for another garage nearby for half the price.I would recommend checking about any planned maintenance during your stay, including any crews outside windows.From the time we arrived, until we the time we left, the staff was wonderful.  When we arrived we offered an upgrade by Carmen to harbor view. OMG so glad we did it... Worth it!  In addition, when she found out it was our 37th anniversary we had champagne and strawberries delivered to our room. What a nice surprise!  At check out we had our parking FREE.  It was a beautiful hotel and beautiful view of harbor.  We did not need the rental car because we could have gotten a cab from the airport.  Not knowing the area, we opted for the rental.  For a weekend, there is sooooo much around the harbor to see and do.  We had drinks one evening in the bar with light snack.  View of course was harbor.  Several mornings we ate in breakfast the Explorers Lounge.  One morning we ordered off menu and next we had buffet.  Both were good.Best of the bunch in the Inner Harbor.  Quiet, Quiet, Quiet.  Sound deadening was obviously employed in the rooms.  Clean, with all the amenities you could ever want.  But the staff really shines.  Attentive, professional, courteous.One star for gorgeous views, one star for location. This hotel has them all licked on that. Problem is, they know it. I could have given this hotel four stars. I wanted to. The concept is just stunning - beautiful place. But the service, maintenance and the labyrinth-like maze leave ALOT to be desired. Another hotel billed as a four star and didn't quite cut the mustard. After coming east for a funeral, I decided I would spend my last night here to sort of clear my head and adjust the vibes after a very sad weekend. Check in is a nightmare. You pull in to what literally looks like a large closet, with room for about six cars if you're all very careful. At that point, the valet is there to help (if you want to pay $36.00 per night plus tips - I don't know about you, but I hand my valets five to ten for each pick up/drop off). If you don't want the valet, there is a parking garage that should be connected to the hotel. It isn't. You must navigate a maze of corridors and elevators to get back in. This means no luggage cart, no nada. Very difficult if your bag is heavy. Finally got to the room. Looks nice and clean til you look. Open the cabinet - filthy. The triple toiletry dispenser on the wall had leaked ""coco mango"" conditioner all on the tub floor (dangerous). But the sheets were great and the beds were clean. I was promised a harbor view that I did not get. I got a nice view of a brick wall. All that for the bargain price of $180.00.It gets worse. I know my hotels and I always choose one with an onsite restaurant and bar. This experience is what ensured I won't return to Royal Sonesta, ever. My brother and I needed a nice cocktail to unwind. We walked into the restaurant to find no host. We seated ourselves at a table for two a bit away from the bar which was crowded with loud, obnoxious drunks. Then, the 300 lb waiter came over with menus. My brother said ""no thanks, we'll just be having a beverage"" to which the waiter replied (at 9:30 at night with only one other occupied table in the place) ""Oh, well then you'll have to move over there"" gesturing at the bar. All that remained for seating was a very uncomfortable looking banquette. ""This is set up for dinner"" he explained. Ridiculous. You certainly did not have a full restaurant - and I quickly found out why. When ordering, I wasn't 100 percent sure what I wanted. I was tired and wanted something refreshing. The waiter suggested a mojito. Rum is not my thing. I told him so and said ""Oh, a mint julep would be great!"" He looked at me funny and said they didn't have the ingredients for a mint julep. If you have a good strong whiskey and the stuff for a mojito, you most certainly have the makings of a mint julep. I then had to educate the waiter and explain that a mint julep is simply a strong bourbon whiskey served in a glass which has muddled mint, simple syrup and crushed ice. That's it. That freaking simple. He took it to the bartender, who failed miserably. He's clearly not a bartender, but a beer tender. I ordered an appetizer as I was slightly hungry and it was late. I ordered the brie/spinach ""dip"". This was simply awful. Near frozen brie, with a few spinach leaves mixed in with some microwaved brie on top, unedible toast rounds out of a box and the only good thing: artichoke chips. The waiter's attitude was just ridiculous. He got the standard 20% tip just to shove it in his face. I think because I looked so tired he may have ""wallet profiled"" me. Anyone who frequents high end establishments knows what wallet profiling is. Problem is, your server got it wrong this time. Another downer: playing terrible 80's R&amp;B in the lobby after 9p.m.. Clearly this was not the hotel owners/managements choice but the girl behind the front desk. No one with the kind of money it costs to stay in this dive has listened to SWV since they were 12. Unbelievable. On second thought, thinking about that crappy waiter, it's one star for this low rent ""trying to be high end on price alone"" dive.Clean rooms, helpful and polite staff in this hotel.  Room service food was amazing. Only 3 stars because I felt the room should have been bigger for the price/view (stayed in a king with stated  harbor view but a wall half obstructed the view)I was very pleased. The staff were very friendly and helpful from the front desk to everyone else:-) very clean room and comfortable.This place was very good.BEAUTIFUL hotel! Everything about it was clean, elegant and convenient.  The room was spacious, the carpet was soft and clean and the bathroom was awesome!  (there was a TV in there! and the water pressure--oh  my oh my!)I booked a harbor-front view, which was WELL WORTH the price.  The view at night is so romantic; my fiance and I just sat there, looking at the passersby and the lights of the city for hours.  The parking situation is convenient but very expensive.  $26 for self-parking and $36 for valet.  I believe this is per day, but I am not sure.  The only bad thing about this hotel is the price for room service and the taxes.  I have never in my life paid $60 for breakfast.  I ordered a waffle, french toast and two sides of sausage.  Yes, that was $52---then I of course tipped the staff who brought it up.  WHOA.  If I could change anything about the trip, it would be to get out of my lazy state and go get breakfast somewhere else--the food was not worth it (I don't think any waffle is worth it haha).  The food was the same quality you would get at a local Denny's, so don't let the advertising on the menu fool you (it fooled me.  I expected a giant plate of chef-style food and was delivered a regular waffle with overcooked sausage).The hotel is walking distance from the main tourist attractions such as the aquarium (which is a must see!), the restaurants and bars.  The city is really clean and I absolutely loved just walking around.  Be aware of the hotel tax and surcharges.  I reserved my room for a rate of $159.  After taxes and charges, the room cost came up to $283.  Yes.  I am telling you the truth.  The taxes and fees were almost the same cost as the room.  No, this is not even the ""incidentals"" fee---this is just the tax.  So... With that said... Make sure you ask before you book! If you can, get a room that includes breakfast and possibly is on a higher floor.  A lot of people say they can hear the noise from the street, but we didn't and we were on the fourth floor.  So-- in a nutshell:1- BEAUTIFUL hotel2- Convenient3- Room Service is too expensive and not worth the cost4- Taxes are really high5- Parking is expensiveThe Royal Sonesta was my first choice in a hotel to stay in the Baltimore area. The hotel lobby is was more impressive then the actual room. My room wasn't that great. The bed was amazing, but that was about it. The bathroom had an outdated tv on the wall. That was pretty cool. I did not have the harbor view, but I can only imagine what it looked like. I ordered breakfast in the morning, I have to say it wasn't that great. For $60 dollars I could've had a 5 course dinner for one at a nice restaurant. I don't think I'll stay here again, I would like to explore what Baltimore has to offer.","Pros- Location overlooking the Inner Harbor- TV in the bathroomCons - A rapist friendly parking lot (I had to go through 3 doors / corridors to get to the lobby and the garage's carpeted urine smelling elevator was a nice touch)- Staticy Direct TV channels- Peeling wall paper and outdated carpeting and furniture- A toiletry dispenser in the shower for Coco Mango shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel- An empty refrigerator....all I wanted was water after my Belgian beer heavy dinnerOvernight parking: $26What an awful experience. The room was booked far in advance, then we tried to check in far in advance only to find out that we were subject to long lines, poor service and additional wait times far beyond the guaranteed 4pm check in time. All in all a very disappointing experience and certainly makes me never want to visit this hotel again... Ever.  The location is great but all of the other negatives completely negate the location.From the moment I walked in the staff were extremely friendly &amp; helpful. They had my room ready earlier than expected, which was a very pleasant surprise. The room was big, clean &amp; comfortable. I didn't watch much TV but when I did put it on the reception was a bit fuzzy. Great location, walking distance to everything. reasonable parking rates although I think the hotel prices in that area are a bit expensive &amp; Sonesta was no exception. I would probably stay there again.I would not recommend the Royal Sonesta for a group.  We pre-paid for our rooms and they were not available at check-in.We were in Balitmore to celebrate Carnival and had to miss a half day of festivities due to check-in issues.  Many guests were not able to check in until after 6 p.m.  Simply terrible.This was hands down the worst stay I've ever had at a hotel, and I travel year round for work.  I checked in on Sunday and upon getting to my room turned on the air conditioner.  After about 30 minutes I realized it was not working.  I contacted the front desk and they sent a maintenance employee up.  After checking some things he left and said he was going to look into something in another area of the hotel to try to fix it.  It didn't get fixed that night and I never heard another word from any hotel employee asking if the issue had been resolved. I kept the air set on 66, but the room temperature never fell below 76. In the morning when I took a shower there was absolutely no water pressure.  The refrigerator in the room was also not cold, and the cabinet it was in was dry rotted.  It was disgusting.  I went to work and when I came back to the hotel on Monday it was again incredibly hot. I again called the front deal and they told me they would send someone up immediately and if it couldn't be fixed they would try to find me another room.  After waiting for 2 hours for my ""immediate "" help I left to go get something to eat.  In my way out I stopped by the front desk to find out why no one had come to my room.  The woman working couldn't have cared less about what I was asking her.  She told me someone would be up.  I was gone for about 20 minutes and returned to a still very hot room.  The temperature was at 78 by this time.  I never had anyone come to my room to check the problem, I never even got a call from anyone to see if I still needed someone, I never got an offer to be moved to another room.  When I woke up after a terrible nights sleep because it was so hot I had a note under my door for a free $25 breakfast.  It was infuriating and insulting.  I'm so glad I made the trip out here ahead of the rest of our team.  The other 7 members who are traveling from April 20-May 5 will absolutely be staying somewhere else.  I'm going to ensure that I share this experience with any and everyone that will listen.  I've never been treated so poorly!Was here for a conference.  I originally had a reservation set up for 5 days.  I asked if I could change my reservation to 4 days and if they could hold my bags on the 5th day as I tend to work stuff.  They were really helpful over the phone in changing my reservation.The taxi brought me here and I checked in.  When you enter, it's like entering an old palace with gold and chandaliers everywhere.  Checking in was a breeze.  Complimentary Wi-Fi!  Woo!When I got to my room, it looked a bit dated.  I understand the whole ""royal"" theme to it, but it's more like 1600's in the room.  Yes, the old furniture gives it a royal or old look, but it's a bit too old.  How?The corner of the bed was super dusty.  The lamps are rusty and hard to turn on/off.  In the bathroom, it was a nice touch to have the old feel to it, but too old.  The tiles made it cheapy.  So did the toilet.Taking off some stars as well because the tub/shower combo had hair all over.  Yuck!  Not like long pieces of hair either.  I'm talking short leg hair or private hairs on the sides and edges of the tub.  The showerhead looked rusty too.  I was scared to shower.I just can't justify the high price for a room because it's ""royal"" in whatever way.  I get the decor and color scheme makes it royal, but it's just old.Stayed here for one night and was apart of a large group that purchased 19 rooms. Our Exec team booked these rooms over 4 months in advance and yet when we arrived our rooms were not ready! We arrived around 4pm and I myself did not get into my room until after 6. I find that completely unacceptable.The front desk attendant had a bellman tag our bags and place them in storage but when trying to retrieve them when our rooms were finally ready she did not seem willing to assist as that was most likely not in her job description. I would hope that after guests were inconvenienced this much the staff would do their best to make their stay a positive one.The assistant manager also proceeded to give us the option to go to the hotel bar, ,pool and etc while we waited for our rooms to be ready. I found this ridiculous as these amenities would already be included if our rooms were ready when they were suppose to be.  I don't understand how you would think to recommend your inconvenienced guests to then patronage your hotel bar with no discount etc. I will never stay here again and will be sure to tell my colleagues, friends and family the same.A friend of mine booked a room for his girlfriend's birthday party on a Saturday night. He even informed the staff that that was the occasion. We were unprofessionally threatened by security several times because we were being loud at 10 PM. We checked outside of the room to see if we were indeed loud, but that wasn't the case. We knocked on the two doors on either side of our room to see if anyone would answer. No one did, so we were surprised that there were ""complaints"". I honestly feel like security had nothing to do that night and just kept rounding and stalking our rooms.As for potential housing patrons, the suites are pretty sizable. There's a large jacuzzi and a mini TV in the bathroom. The living quarters are spacious and the big is king-sized. The room doesn't wow you, but again, this isn't a 5-star hotel.Stayed here for 3 nights for business. Overall, cute hotel with very nice staff, but there is definitely room for improvement, and I believe they are already planning renovations. My two cents:Pros:- Not sure if everyone gets free web access, but the free level (basic) was plenty fast- Again, very nice and accommodating staff- I dig the vegetable based soap in the bathrooms- Nice to have a fridge for dinner leftovers- Super comfy beds, though I think the pillow tops need to be replaced (a bit misshapen)- Beautiful staircase and fresh flowers in the lobby- TV in the bathroom. Super cool!Suggested improvements:- Ditch the in shower shampoo, shower gel and conditioner dispensers. They just get in the way and who wants to use mystery toiletries??- Put a coffee maker in each room by default, not upon request- Linens throughout the property are just plain tacky (I believe this is part of their renovation plans)- Creepy paintings throughout the property need to go. Sure, there is a historical element, but at times, I felt like I was in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. (After a few drinks, I think one would feel the eyes in the paintings are following them)**TIP #1: If having the bellperson call a taxi for you, be sure to confirm ahead of time (if you need this) that they accept your credit card. (e.g., if traveling for biz and you have to put on your company credit card).**TIP #2: Use a car service instead of taxi to get to the airport. About the same cost, more comfy of a ride, clean, they have A/C and won't claim their credit card machine is down as most cabbies do.3-1/2 stars, leaning forward because of extremely friendly staff. Every single person I dealt with was professional and very helpful.This hotel is in a fantastic location, the inner harbor in Baltimore. You are right across the street from the harbor and plenty of shopping/eating choices.The hotel itself is fine, but nothing makes it truly outstanding or memorable. Rooms are pretty standard, pretty clean and well-enough appointed, but again, nothing special. One odd note, the bathrooms have installed dispensers for shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the shower. I personally don't care for that, give me my un-opened, fresh little bottles, please! BUT, this is just a personal preference.I think the location is the real draw of this hotel; convenient to all downtown Baltimore has to offer.First, the positives: the recently renovated rooms were comfortable and the hotel is in an ideal location in Baltimore's Inner Harbor...convenient to shops, restaurants, and attractions.Now, the one major negative that has prompted the decision for me to never stay at this hotel again:The check-in process was atrocious, the worst check-in I've ever experienced at a hotel before. I reserved a room with 2 double beds approximately two months in advance of our stay. We were expecting crowds because of the warm weather, Orioles opening weekend, and admitted students events at local colleges. I was willing to pay for early check-in, but the hotel noted that their policy did not allow for that and there was no room. We arrived early, around 11:30 AM, and knew that were most likely too early for our room to be ready. Note that the check-out time was 12 PM and check-in time was 4 PM. The front desk offered to store our luggage while we explored the Inner Harbor, and we returned at about 3:40 PM. The woman at the front-desk noted that our room would not be ready until 4 PM, so we patiently took a seat in the lobby while we waited. We were not upset yet, because I cannot fault a hotel for not having a room available before the posted check-in time. As we were waiting, I noticed multiple parties lining up to check in, and the line was so long that it was almost to the exit door at the front of the lobby. Noticing the time, I decided to get in the line. I have never seen a check-in line this long before, it was insane. As I was in the line, the time passed 4 PM and parties were still getting turned away at the front desk and told to return because rooms were not ready yet. Eventually, the front desk began to say that parties had to wait until 5 PM and should call then to see if their room was available. At 4:15 PM, there were still 5-6 people ahead of me in line. The hotel seemed to completely disregard the fact that some of us had places to be. I even talked to a father whose son was getting married nearby and he had to leave the hotel within the hour, but his room was not available for him to get ready in at the posted 4 PM time. Some families were even having their kids go stand in the back of the line so they would have a back-up option should they be denied a room the first time (my sister did this for us). When I finally made it to the front of line, at about 4:40 PM and after about 50 minutes of standing in line, the only reason I was able to get our room keys was because I told the woman this was my third time to the check-in desk and pretty much demanded we have a room (we had dinner reservations to get to and we had not even begun to get ready yet without a hotel room). Luckily, she gave us room keys, much to the dismay of the 10-12 parties before me who were denied a room. I obviously felt bad for them too! This was by far the most dysfunctional check-in experience I have ever been a part of, and I am not happy that we gave the hotel our money this weekend.I am disappointed because the renovations were so on par and location is so ideal. I will not be staying here again.I'm only reviewing the bar area, as I met some friends for a drink. I got the Berry Martini and it was delicious. The service was great and if you're looking for a chill place with a great view---this is a nice option if you're in the area or having friends staying there.Stayed hear for a week, overall I liked this hotel. The rooftop Basketball court was a nice feature, loved the pool and the racquetball. Room overlooks inner harbor right near inner harbor and Camden yards.Pros: Service, cleanliness of the suite, location, had valet parking, amenities Cons: Bad maintenance of the plumbing,  a malfunctioning Keurig machine, pricey breakfast in bedI am extremely OCD about dust and germs, but this room was super clean, which was definitely a win for me.  The bed felt fantastic, and I loved how they supplied various beverages in the minibar.  As some reviews have already stated, the lobby is much more grand than the actual room itself.  Kind of seemed 'empty' when we first walked through the doors to our suite.  I also paid for the breakfast in the morning, but for the price and the way they presented it, I immediately regretted my choice.  The price was ridiculous! I could've taken us to an amazing restaurant right in front of the hotel with that.  Overall, it was a nice experience.  I paid $181 for one night, and my lady and I did enjoy ourselves at Inner Harbor, but for a 4-star hotel, we expected the drains to be working perfectly.  Just washing out hands almost flooded the sink.  The same thing happened while we were taking a shower.  Probably will go to the Four Seasons next time we visit Inner Harbor.This boutique style hotel might be a hidden gem on the harbor. The European decor really sets it a part from your average hotel. The doormen were friendly and very helpful with taking my luggage to the room. I was able to check in early and even snagged free wifi. I didn't utilize the restaurant or coffee shop, but I'm sure it compliments the hotel.Ideal location with nothing to back it up.  Needs refurbishing (upholstery is dismal) immediately.  At 1 am, the door opened for a guest that was just checking in!The hotel has a prime location near the waterfront and convention center. While it was a little pricey compared to others I've stayed at in the area, the room was pretty big, as was the bathroom, which had a television overlooking the sink. The lobby decorum was nice, especially the big makeshift stairs and library. While I didn't spend much time at the hotel and have little else to say, I will mention that my one disappointment with the place was that a continental breakfast was not included with the room. There was one available, but it was rather pricey.Unfortunately it is just not the harbor court hotel it used to be.  Went to the beautiful bar that used to have wonderful adorned animal prints and furnishings.  They have replaced with typical hotel furnishings and cold lighting.  On top if that the wait staff is below professional that they used to be. Asked us to check our before we even had our second sip of our drink.  No class left here, we will not be back.What a disappointment!!! I booked here over 4th of July weekend and was very disappointed with my ""city-view room"" on the 5th floor looking at a wall across the street (honest. see the pictures). I have stayed at a lot of hotels, for business and for pleasure, and I have to say this hotel is a wanna-be modern hotel riding on the coat tails of some kind of apparent formerly grand reputation. It's not like a motel or low-class hotel, but for a ""superior"" hotel the style and decor were very dated with 'gramma's living room""-style upholstery. The rug in my room was stained in 2 places with something that made the antique roses appear to be consumed by giant black blobs. It was quiet, and the beds were mushy and comfortable is the best thing I can say. Oh, and free WiFi was nice. My friend told me the Renaissance Inn was great, and I very much wished I had stayed there or in Harbor East or Fells Point maybe even. I even booked via them rather than through a third party hoping I would get better treatment as a guest--to no avail. Front desk staff is snooty to boot. Onsite cafe staff and others very friendly though. The rate the hotel was offering that weekend was deeply discounted, which makes me think they had a ton of availability, so why not throw guests a bone with an upgrade to the same class room on a higher floor? If I had paid $400 for that room, I would have been absolutely ill, all over the blob-consumed roses.Nice hotel on the western part of the Inner Harbor, where you want to be in a B'more visit.  Our room was large and well appointed and nicely decorated.  Valet parking is available, though i highly recommend finding a room rate package where this is included in your stay.  The front staff and the valet were friendly and professional.  When we checked in we were well greeted and handed a small package of Berger cookies, which i thought was a nice touch.  You can tell the hotels pays attention to these details, especially when they ask about it in a survey you receive after your stay.  Almost scary how detailed-oriented they are, but it's nice that they pay that close attention to quality of service, which is much appreciated.Overall a nice Inner Harbor stay.  Definitely an option if you're looking for a nice room.","Quite possibly the best hotel experience I've ever had. We got there way before check in and were immediately accommodated by the wonderful Brittany at the front desk. We got a room and mentioned that we live in the area and were here for our anniversary. When we got to our room we noticed we had gotten a room with 2 full beds, not the most romantic but we were fine with it. Not 2 minutes later Brittany called the room and said she realized she had given us a two bed room, would we like a king? We said sure and the bellman came up to bring us our new key. The bellman was awesome and so nice and lead us to our new room which was an amazing harbor view suite. We were speechless. We could barely afford the little garden view room we had initially booked so getting the upgrade was such a treat. Then, to top off what was already above and beyond what we ever could have hoped for, we came home from dinner to a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and a card wishing us a happy anniversary! The room was fantastic. It was huge with a chandelier, jacuzzi tub that could have fit 5 people, a TV in the bathroom as well as the bedroom area. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in and had the benefit of being a king size sleigh bed. The best part of the whole room though was the view. I've lived in Baltimore my whole life and this view gave me a new perspective on the city. It was incredible. Before booking I read some reviews saying that the hotel was decor was dated and dirty. I was able to see a standard room and a suite and found both to be very clean and, I thought, adorable. It's not the typical decor you find in an airport Hilton or one of the thousands of other hotels you can stay at but it's nice. Our bathroom had an incredible rain forest mural all over the walls, the hotel bar is jungle themed with a taxidermy panther and gong. It's different and fun and a little quirky. We loved it.There is so much to say about this hotel.  My husband and I just got married in Baltimore (3/29/2014) and we really loved staying here with all our out of town guests. I happened upon this hotel by doing an inquiry with the Baltimore Chamber of Commerce.  This enabled us to accept e-mail bids FROM prospective wedding hotels vs. the typical wedding where the bride or groom sends multiple e-mails out.  Basically, we had every big hotel in downtown Baltimore competing for our business, since they knew we had contacted the BCofC. This provided us about 30 hotels competing for our wedding contract.  We choose the RSHC because of their online reviews for excellent customer service (TRUE), their heated indoor pool, their beautiful furnishings and decor (I'm an artist and my husband is very artistic, so aesthetics are important to our enjoyment of most experiences), and finally because they offered a better price than the other high-end hotels downtown (who had pools).  The RSHC treated all our guests consistently with gentleness, respect, and friendliness.  Many of our guests are elderly and/or infirmed, so this was very important to our enjoyment - knowing their needs were met and they were well cared for. Whenever anyone needed anything, NOBODY EVER give off a vibe of 'that's not my job.' Rare in today's world.I would like to particularly commend: Tonya, Don, James and the others in their bellhop/valet division who really were outstandingly friendly and efficient, Jonathan the concierge who helped us with our welcome bags and further helped with suggestions about where to eat or shop, Carmen, also from the front desk, who helped my mom with printing and coordinating some travel reservations, and most of all Liz, in their group sales dept., who answered all my various questions over a period of more than a year - both promptly and with high spirits. Liz arranged for an AMAZING upgrade for my fiance/husband to a huge, glorious, sexy, romantic, splendid, plush, elegant suite.  She also arranged for a generous upgrade for my sister and her husband, as a gift from my husband and I to thank them for hosting us at Thanksgiving and to treat them in the midst of hard financial time they've been  having....maybe an unorthodox 'comp' but she made it happen!Beautiful view, but a lot of the room amenities didn't work!  My husband surprised me with a suite here for our 2 year anniversary back in February.  Check in was easy and the view from the room was spectacular, however, the phone didn't work and the light over our GIGANTIC tub in the bathroom was burnt out.  I knew my husband dropped a LOT of dough on this room and I felt  it was unacceptable for such a high priced room t be lacking the most basic amenities.  We addressed them with the staff on our way out for the evening, and when we returned to our room, the phone and light were fixed.  Thanks, maintenance man!!! One thing that really impressed me about the hotel was the bar/restaurant.  Before we hit Fogo de Chao for dinner, we stopped at the bar/restaurant for a drink and an appetizer.  We had the spicy/sweet calamari and I am 100% honest when I tell you that it was the best calamari I have ever had.  It absolutely melted in your mouth.  I also had a really delicious drink there (I don't remember the name but it had Chambord in it and the rim was dipped in honey). Delicious!  I gave the hotel 3 stars because the rooms are very dated (carpets worn, wallpaper peeling off in the bathroom, and the lack of basic room amenities being functional).  It's not a terrible hotel, but when you're paying $550 for one night in a suite, it betta be decent!There are two very separate reviews for this place. The hotel itself and the service &amp; convenience.Let's start with the good. The hotel service was truly excellent. From the second I got there they were on the ball with getting me checked in quickly and accommodated my request for a room on a higher floor. Each time I needed a car from the hotel to meetings downtown, I was able to call downstairs and have a car waiting within 5 minutes. It was very convenient to walk to parts of the harbor as well where meetings were being held or to just grab a drink or some food. The hotel is located right across the street from the water and is probably especially nice in the summertime. It is a little bit of a walk from the center of the inner harbor, but in the summer it wouldn't matter. Overall service and convenience were both excellent in my opinion.Now to the bad. And by bad, I mean the god awful decor of this hotel. What the......  When I walked into my room I literally felt like I stepped into a time machine that took me back to the 1950's. The carpet was maroon red with unbelievably ugly designs in it. In addition to this, the seemingly 50 year old carpet gave the room a musky smell. It was obviously the smell of 50 years of guests staying there. The room was huge, but the lighting was terrible. There were 3 lights and it barely lit up half the room. In this huge room, I'm not sure who thought it would be a good idea to put a 20 inch screen TV on the dresser in a part of the room that makes the TV impossible to see unless you're wearing Harry Carrey's glasses... it was truly weird. The strangest thing of all was the bathroom and how it was completely the opposite of the entire room. The bathroom was brand spanking new and clean to the T. They obviously re-did the bathroom and said F the rest of the hotel room. This hotel is doing itself a huge disservice by not upgrading the rooms. You're better of closing for a short period of time and getting the whole place redone, rather than charging guest to stay in poorly configured, oversized and anciently decorated rooms. Great hotel for convenience and service, but the visual effects kill any hope it has.Decor and bar staff great, front desk staff rude, inattentive and forgetful. We stayed here as part of a wedding party, so after a nearly three hour drive we would have expected a smile and a welcoming greeting. Instead, the front desk was on the phone and we had to wait to be checked in (while our friends were waiting at the ball game for us). Second, there was a $100 per night ""incidentals deposit fee"" charged to our card that the front desk couldn't explain. (We found out at the wedding that NO other guests were charged this fee). Third, we found out that the wedding hosts put together a wonderful gift bag that we did not receive, even though our account clearly showed we were booked as part of the group. No coffee makers in the rooms. Hot water from the bathroom sink a trickle. Slow Internet access limited to three devices only. Room service prices are high but on par with 5 star hotels, however the Sonesta is far from 5 star. On the positive side, Steven at the bar was exceptional. He made great conversation, great drinks and even attended to my girlfriend when her knee was bleeding from tripping on the old streetcar tracks. The decor is nice, very roomy and comfortable lounge with lots of sofas, quiet and quaint. Room was large and LCD in bathroom. Bed was very comfortable. I recommend this hotel have Steven train the front desk staff on customer service and basic manners. Since the front desk makes the first impression, we will likely not stay here again.This Hotel use to be one of the best if not the best in Baltimore at the Inner Harbor, it was and still is awarded the highest rating and they should be stripped! The carpert was horrific the rooms decor was ugly at best the best was great but the rest of the furniture dated and in need of restoration- The need to go floor by floor and totally redo this property I was so disappointed.The front desk was not the best for the start rating either but The valet and bell staff we top notch professionals! I would not stay here for more than 99 a night and I only say that much because of it supreme location to the harbor and ball park(s). I was there for a Ravens game, I was able to walk to the stadium which saved a lot that where the goodness of luxury convenience stopped.Was in town with a group to celebrate Carnival. Upon arrival at the hotel at around 3:45 and the rooms were not ready. I find that very unacceptable. Some in our group did not get their rooms until after 6:00 PM.I've stayed at a number of hotels in the Baltimore area and by far this was the worst.This place should be given 5 stars! The staff was so very nice and sent me a complimentary piece of cake for my bday and a personalized note! Awesome staff and clean hotel with great city view. Everyone was so friendly and nice. I had a great experience and it made my bday extra specialFast, easy, professional check in.  5th floor facing harbor has great view (the bed actually faces the window instead of the TV!) Pricey restaurant and drinks.  Pool, hot tub and gym on the 7th floor.  Note:  don't forget to bring toothpaste; we needed some and they provided a 5g ""tube""- pretty funny!First, I want to say that Tony, our porter, was wonderful. If it wasn't for him, we probably would have left soon after we checked in. We live in Baltimore and reserved a room for two nights to celebrate our anniversary - couldn't get away, so thought this would be the next best thing. We booked a king size bed and arrived to find we had been ""upgraded"" to a queen. There were no kings available, and they kept saying it was an upgrade even though it wasn't. That was really annoying. Then we noticed a memo at the front desk about brown water in the rooms due to construction. That didn't bode well, but we decided to check in anyway. Tony graciously took us to our room and made sure we were settled in - he even filled our ice bucket for us. He was very pleasant and kind, explaining that all the dust and plastic covering the floors in the hallways was due to renovations. He apologized, but we were shocked they had us in a room in a construction zone.  After being in the room a short time we noticed the trash hadn't been emptied and the fridge had someone's leftover drinks in it. Then we realized the toilet was broken and was running continuously. It was close to midnight, so we turned the water off to the toilet so it wouldn't keep us up and called the front desk to let them know what was going on. They emptied the trash and fixed the toilet the next day while we were out. We came back in the evening after a day spent downtown, thinking it would be nice to take a swim. We were informed the pool was open, but that the water was ""colder than usual"" because of the construction so we opted to skip it. Upon checking out the next morning, we discovered a room service charge for breakfast was on our bill. We told them we never ordered breakfast and the reply was ""oh, sometimes they bill it to the wrong room"". Good thing we didn't just pay for it, huh? We explained our disappointment with how things had gone, and Sarah H., at the front desk did offer us a partial credit which was very much appreciated. Our weekend was by no means ruined,  my husband and I can have a good time in almost any situation, but we were really surprised by our experience at this hotel - we hoped for (and expected) so much more. The location is great, we walked all over downtown and really enjoyed being tourists in our hometown, but the hotel didn't provide the respite we had hoped for. I would advise anyone thinking of booking a room at RSHC to triple check and make sure the renovations are completed before making a reservation. Frankly, they shouldn't be open if they can't provide better service. I would hate to see someone visiting Baltimore from out of town have an experience like ours.Friendly and pleasant staff, sometimes in short supply; the rooms are large but a throwback to some distant past, dim lights and stained carpeting complement a horrible decor, with the exception of the bathroom, which was new, but the gold plated everything was garish. NO basic room amenities such as a coffee maker or microwave - just an old empty fridge, and to get coffee in the morning you must buy it at their small espresso kiosk by the lobby (long lines and only one person serving, with prices that will make Starbucks blush with envy...), or at the dining room on the second floor, both very pricey!...Two eggs were $17.00 !!! Hence the reason for the absent coffee maker, I guess.The pool is on the roof, surrounded by neglected outdoor garden, and some view of the area, if you tiptoe up over the wall...They will charge you for parking each night ($36.00). That whole area by the waterfront is very expensive and meant for tourists, much like New York's South street Seaport. The rest of what we saw of the city could use some serious renovations along with this hotel.This hotel is absolutely terrific. I came here with my wife for a mini-moon the weekend after our wedding, and we were very impressed. The bellhop that greeted us was prompt and courteous, the concierge service hit on everything that they recommended for us to go and do (i.e. restaurants and activities). They even upgraded our room to a harbor view suite when they heard that we were on our honeymoon. The one minor hiccup came when we had to remind them that we ordered a champagne and chocolate strawberry package with our reservation that was not ready for our arrival. This is definitely a four star hotel, and probably one of the best bets in terms of service and overall style available near or in the inner harbor.First off, The decor is horrid.The lobby is kind of nice but the room really was ugly.  The carpet is ugly and reminds me of the 1930s and our room had ugly pink wallpaper. The service started off bad. Check in is at 3pm. We arrived at around 6 and our room wasnt ready. I didnt mind too bad because we had a friend staying there and we met up at the bar and waite the extra 20 minutes it took for our room to be readied. The bar was small and the bartender was sort of corny. We got the room on special so the price was decent but I would never pay full price for this place. It just didnt wow me.NOT GOOD.  My Meetup group had organized a trip to Baltimore, for CARINVAL.  There were 36 of us in double occupancy rooms. After the first activities, we went to check in @ 4pm at the Royal Sonesta.  1. We had to stand in the lobby because the hotel wanted us to only use the manager to check in.  So other guests were able to check in before us. Even when there were no other guest we were only limited to the 1 customer service person. 2. One Asian customer service rep gave us the stank eye the whole time.  We were not loud or rowdy.  We hadn't spoken to her she hadn't spoken to us.  She just stared at us.3. At 4pm 3-4 rooms were given out.  15 minutes later there was an announcement that they weren't any clean rooms left.  Come back later, no time frame given.  Since we protested that we wanted a shower, they told us to use the shower by the pool.  They would hold our bags and food and beverage was available for purchase. No complementary anything for the inconvenience or late check out. (side note you need a room key to go into the pool area)4. After returning two hours later, I was asked how well I knew my roommate.  Confused I answered somewhat.  The manager, was trying to give us a king bed.  After she saw the anger on my face she found a double bed room. What I paid for.5. There was no bell man to retrieve our bags, so security had to. He had an attitude because this was not his job and tried to give me the keys to GET IT MYSELF.  I told him that if I got those keys I would go shopping in there for all the inconvenience the hotel put me through.  He quickly retrieved my bags. (I'm not a theft but it scared him lol)6.  The rooms and pool was nice but, our group was scared throughout the hotel.  It would have been nice to be on the same floor.7. On Saturday night we asked the hotel to call a taxi for us.  We were told it be faster for us to just hail 1 outside.  Yeah great have 30 + ladies hail cabs in club outfits. Thanks Royal Sonesta.  When we returned in 1 piece &amp; in multiple cabs we were cheering.  Then a security man came &amp; yelled at us like school children in the most aggressive manner to quiet down.  He later apologized stating another security manner got him upset and he took it out on us... 8. Check out was at 11am, however the maid was knocking on our down reminding us of check out @ 10:30 am.  Hmm they couldn't do that the day before huh. 9. Still needed a credit card for our pre paid room.  Received no receipt for my check out because it was already paid.  I had to ask questions to receive information.  I was told that my charge for the room would automatically be dropped however it took a few business days.The location was good. The next day a new batch of bellmen came in that were very courteous. Those bellmen even help out a stranded member of our group.  I believe one man was named Ernest. However this hotel was a big fail. Royal my behind.Wonderful staff and facility.My husband and I just stayed here this past weekend. Beautiful! We had a harbor view room and the view was great! The room as very spacious and bed was very comfy! Walking distance to everything. The only bad thing I can say if I were looking for one is that you can not check in until 4:00. But they will hold your bags for you! Went to eat at Bubba Gumps before check in and went to Power Plant Live that evening. Perfect weekend in Baltimore!I recently stayed for a long weekend at this hotel and I had nothing but a great experience with the staff &amp; stay. The room furniture is a little outdated, yes, but the  most important things I would say is it's clean, comfy, has a great view plus convenience of the harbor and some very good food. The pool is indoor and is a bit small but the hot tub/sauna was nice and if it's bad weather outside, this is good entertainment for the family. Valet parking is a bit expensive yes, but all Sonesta's in the big cities seem to be this way. You can opt for self parking to save a few $$. The bathroom lighting was a bit dim, not sure if it was the bulbs used or intended to be this way. If you want to see the Orioles play you can walk to the stadium. TV's in both bathroom and bedroom, nice and quiet, just the way I like it. Right accross the street is the Science Center and the stores/restaurants on the Inner Harbor.I stayed at this Hotel recently and was very much pleased.  The service was excellent.  The bellhop was on point with dining recommendations, he was courteous and very attentive.  We checked in quickly and were very pleased with our accomodations.My friend and I stayed here for the night to rest up for our drive to NYC.  It is located across the street from the Harbor so if you're lucky enough to get a room that over looks it like we had then you're really in for a treat.  The view is just amazing and only gets better as everything starts to light up in the evening over the harbor waters.  We had a bay window so it was a great view all around.  The woman at the service desk was very friendly and courteous when we checked in.  I noticed the staircase in the lobby area that spiraled up to the second floor.  It looked very nice and clean.  Unfortunately the pool hours ended at 8pm so we couldn't get in as it was already a bit late.  Our room was very roomy and I am not quite use to having a tv and a phone in the bathroom however it was nice to have in case.  The beds were very comfortable and I enjoyed the break from driving all day to lay on something so soft.  We grabbed a couple drinks from the Explorer's Lounge on the second floor.  It was nice, with couches and tables you can choose to relax wherever you like.  We hung around for a bit and then took our drinks with us back to our room.  I would highly recommend that you grab a bite to eat in their hotel restaurant Brightons.  We were in a hurry to leave early but luckily the restaurant opens at 6:30am and we ordered food to go.  The Chesapeake Crab Cakes Benedict is phenomenal.  It comes with a side of breakfast cut potato's and probably made my morning that much more enjoyable.  A great choice to stay for a night.NOT good for group travel! My Meetup group had organized a trip to Baltimore, and reserved at the Royal Sonesta for our overnight stay. I'd seen the mixed reviews on Yelp before we'd left, but I was still looking forward to our stay at this hotel. So our private coach drops our group of 36 ladies off on the sidewalk (there's no hotel parking lot or garage). We arrived just after 4pm for check-in only to find that not everyone's room was available. So of the 18 hotel rooms we'd PRE-PAID for, only 4 were ready for check-in. Now I'm a fairly flexible person, having worked in the service industry, but that's a bit ridiculous when you already have a check-in that's later than most other hotels! We've just spent the last 3 hours in the July sun and all anyone could talk about was getting a shower! They'd offered to put our bags away in the Regency Hotel NEXT DOOR until our rooms were ready. After squaring away my own bag in a friend's room, we'd decided to go grab some food. Around 6pm we'd returned to the hotel and I was finally able to check in. This completely threw off our group's schedule, so no one was able to return to the city's Caribbean Carnival celebration...the whole purpose of our trip!! The rooms were very nice and the beds uber comfy. I was glad to be given a room with 2 queen beds, unlike 4 of our group members, who were forced to share king beds...a bit awkward since these 4 ladies had never met before this trip!! The location was good, and the staff was courteous and tried to be very helpful in light of the circumstances, but they'd failed where it truly counted.","The hotel and the location of the hotel (physical appearance and location) is great!  The staff is at the total opposite end of the spectrum.  This hotel would improve greatly if they greatly improved the customer service.  My room was not available at check-in and when I checked out I heard other people complaining there room was not ready and it was well after checkout.  Also, housekeeping took my bathing suit and lost it in the sheets and towels.",,"['second', 'time', 'staying', 'particular', 'building', 'first', 'time', 'back', '2006', 'building', 'still',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/brookshire-suites-baltimore,Brookshire Suites,3.5,$$,69,"First off, if I was going to stay in Baltimore again on ""my own dime"" rather than on an expense account, I'd likely stay at this hotel again. However this hotel is really hard to review because it's hard to describe it accurately without seeming negative. My best analysis is that it's the McDonald's of chic hotels. At first glance the furniture seems high end, the art trendy (Frank Zappa pic in the bathroom) and the vibe kind of boutique. But then you realize it's more TJ Maxx than Macy's BUT the room was about $100 per night and exactly 1 block from the center of the Inner Harbor area. In fact it's across the street from the back of the Rennaissance, one of the nicest hotels in Baltimore. From hotel to Inner Harbor walking is about 100 yards or less and there's a parking garage, not owned by them, next door ($21 for each 24 hour period). For that $100 I got 2 free bottles of water, free wifi and a suite with a separate living room with desk, couch, microwave and refrigerator and a bed room and full bath. I also got free breakfast in lounge on the top floor with a great Harbor view. Breakfast is standard free stuff but includes make your own waffles, eggs, bacon, cereal, etc. Occasionally there will be scuff, rust spot or less than perfect item, but I often stay at the Hyatt at $250 per night so it's a fair trade given the price and location.We stayed for one visit to Baltimore And Booked through a third party.Front desk and maintenance staff were very accommodating, that is the reason we are giving them 3 stars. Seems to be an older building with some issues, we were lacking heat in our room, hotel was completely booked so we were not offered another room, repairs were attempted with no fix, we were offered quite a few things that made this a acceptable stay. Location is great. Breakfast was adequate. Come stay here to enjoy the inner harbor,Room was pretty, but a few flaws as well. First room, the heat wasn't working so the front desk quickly change our room. 2nd room bathroom was much more dirty. I guess I can't have it all :(Close to everything in the inner harbor. Definitely a plus. The free purple and green circulator bus ran right out front.Breakfast was pretty good, but needed to be warmed up. Had things like, scrambled eggs, sausages, cereal, bagels, mc muffins, bread, yogurt, waffle machine, oatmeal, fruit, juices and tea and coffee. It was on the top level which made eating breakfast a beautiful view. Gym was right there, just in case you had to shed a few pounds from the breakfast.Modern, clean and convenient location!! Super friendly staff. Hot continental breakfast, clean 24 hour gym and bar on site. All decorations are simple, relaxing and artsy. Comfortable beds and couches, large, flatscreen TVs. Friendly and professional housekeeping service who are willing to work around you. Don't be thrown off by the lower than surrounding hotel prices: This place is a gem!!We stayed at Brookshire for a recent weekend getaway.  It was a great set-up for our family.  We were within close walking distance to all of the Inner Harbor attractions.  Definitely not a five star hotel, but also quite adequate for the price.  My husband, two year old, and myself got the one bedroom suite with the king bed. They had the crib (sturdy, comfortable crib - not a flimsy playpen - yay!) ready in the room. The living room and bedroom were separate with a TV in both rooms and a pull-out sofa bed in the living room.  The kitchen area (fridge, sink, microwave, cabinets, small counter, coffee maker) were in the living area.  The bathroom (modest - regular bath, average size) was in the bedroom.  There were closets in both areas. A small desk, rolling chair, and club chair were in the living room.There was an obvious attempt to make the decorations feel modern and trendy. Some of the fixtures seemed older and in need of repair - i.e. rust in the sink drain, rust on the shelving in the bathroom.  We parking in a parking garage across the street.  It was $21/24 hours.  Our two days (~37 hours) cost $42.  The view in the breakfast area is great.  It's on the top floor, with big windows that look across the harbor.  The breakfast food reminded me almost exactly of what Hampton Inn serves - waffle maker, dry eggs, meat, fruit, breads, toaster, yogurt, cereal, etc.   We had limited interactions with staff since we had no issues, but the staff seemed nice.This hotel met most of our hopes - price, location, and suite-style rooms.  Wouldn't go here expecting luxury or brand new facilities, but IMO it's completely decent.This is a great place for a one or two night stay.  I prefer hotels with a full service restaurant but for my one-night stay in Baltimore Brookshire was perfect.  It's walking distance to shopping, restaurants and entertainment.  The continental breakfast was sufficient to get the day started with my favorite being the Belgian waffle maker.  Front desk staff were very polite and my room was clean and neat with no problems at all.  I'll definitely stay here again.My husband and I stayed here for our anniversary weekend a couple of weeks ago so we could spend most of our time at the inner harbor. The hotel was soooo my style. It had modern decor and cool pictures on the walls throughout. The room was what I expected, but just a bit smaller. It had a nice sized tv, a mircowave, mini fridge, and kitchenette sink. The only thing my husband found issue with was the same thing stated in plenty of other reviews - the picture over the toilet. I used a groupon, so even though the room was really only big enough to sleep in, it still felt like a steal. The complimentary breakfast left something to be desired in terms of hot bar items (eggs, sausage, and oatmeal only), but they also had a waffle maker, cereal, toast, bagels, pastries, English muffins, yogurt, coffee/tea and juice bar. As long as you're not expecting a 5* buffet, you'll have a filling, enjoyable, breakfast. Service was great and they were responsive.Honestly, the only thing that ruined the experience for me was the lack of dedicated parking garage. I understand that it's the city, but the prices were ridiculous and the staff was unpleasant at the garage we parked in. Now, there is valet parking dedicated to the hotel but those prices were even more steep. I would definitely stay again, but probably look into parking a bit further away to save some money and an unnecessary headache.""Great Night's Stay before our Cruise out of Baltimore Harbor""My husband and I stayed at Brookshire Suites the night before we left on a Royal Caribbean Cruise from the Baltimore Port.  The front desk was courteous and professional, the location is a short walk from the Harbor, and the room was large and well appointed, and included a fridge, sink and microwave, nicely decorated and the bed slept like a dream!  Breakfast was on the top floor, it was delicious, with an ""eggs to order bar"" and the view was refreshing.  We wished we had a little more time to spend at the Brookshire, we will definitely return!Stayed her for a quick over night stay to check out the Inner Harbor and general area.. Upon check in the front desk Kelly was very nice and offered me a free upgrade to the One Bedroom suite from my Queen bed room which was apparently a lot smaller..which was a win on my end why not let's go free upgrades rock! lol..The rooms are very nice to begin for the price.. nice large living room with your typical sofa, microwave, large fridge by hotel standard's what looks to be a first for me is two free water's included... Anyone that stay's in a good chunk of hotel's over the years know's the struggle of places charging for a water or giving you one of these small 8 oz water's at best! That actual bed room was nice, comfortable and super clean. The bathroom was a little on the smaller side and a tad dated looking but there is only so far you can go in a refresh of a hotel before it moves into a whole new ball park of price ranges.. don't get me wrong it was clean and stocked which always is a first hit or miss thing some places lack.Upon leaving the maid was nice enough to ask if I needed any water's or how my stay was making sure the room was clean... another industry first in my time of staying in hotel's as most maid's give you the hello or quick nod.. It made me feel welcome and she did a great job upon arrival to the room it was spotless. Parking wise I used the parking garage across the street on the hotel side which was a breeze to use but they do offer Valet. Remember this hotel is only a block away from main Inner Harbor a major plus if your visiting for that reason.I gotta say for a smaller hotel and a first of my stay I was impressed and couldn't ding this place if I tried it was a well rounded, friendly, clean hotel with a great staff for the price.. Give them a shot they deserve in an industry dominated by other big chain hotels.Stayed here for Otakon weekend. The staff were very friendly and greeted us everytime we came in. Which we were skeptical about because we probably had 6 or 7 people in our room lol. But the place is very cute and updated and free wifi!Walking distance to the convention center and the inner harbor. There is also a parking garage close by but not associated with the hotel. Parking was about $20 per day. We also had a handicap person with us so they are handicapp friendly!My husband and I spent two nights in Baltimore, not knowing the area at all we booked a hotel in walking distance to the aquarium seeing as that was the reason for our trip.Upon check in we where welcomed by the wonderful front desk staff, we thought this was going to be a great stay.That night I jumped in the shower, when I got out the bathroom floor was flooded. I'm talking inches on water. I immediately call the front desk and they send housekeeping and maintenance up. They commented on how insane it was that it flooded and on how much condensation was on the walls because there is no fan. I was SHOCKED that the front desk staff didn't offer us a room. The next night I was woken up by my neighbors. I felt like I was in my college dorm again. I could hear them talking, flushing to toilets and banging around. And then at 7:30 was woken again from the banging on my ceiling. Also, the wall paper was peeling off in the room and our bathroom vanity was falling apart.Parking was another frustrating part of the trip. we parked across the street in the garage not knowing how expensive it is because the signage is not accurate. I wish the hotel could  have recommend a garage that was a little more inexpensive.The only reason I am giving this hotel two stars is because of the front desk staff that greeted us and the front desk girl Monday night. Other then that save your time and book somewhere else.I stayed here for two nights with my boyfriend, we were here for the Ravens game. I booked this room two months in advance through Expedia. When I booked through Expedia, I got a rate that said it included all of my fees etc. When we got there, I was told there was a $9.95 PER DAY mandatory destination fee which was for the wi-fi, access to the gym and breakfast. There was also a $50 deposit but you're supposed to get that back after check out. I also thought it was closer to the harbor than it actually was but that wasn't a big deal because the harbor and restaurant were only about a 7-10 minute walk. There are two parking garages across the street, $21/day but that does not include in and out. So we spent $57 on parking in two days not including when we left to park on the harbor. For the price, I was hoping for more amenities. Being from out of town, I didn't realize that this was more of a business hotel. When we book, we always book hotels with indoor pools or hot tubs. The staff was really nice, our room was super hot when we got there. The girl at the front desk told us they turned the heat up thinking it would be colder than it really was so they gave us a fan for the duration of our stay. Overall, we had a good experience especially with being from out of town.I've been here 3 times every year because I go to the dragon boat festival that happens at Fells Point at the Under Armour headquarters. So this year, is the first year our team has come after renovations. It's a nice look. Very modern and a little higher class. I still like coming here because of having a fridge and a microwave and breakfast! (But now they charge you like a mandatory fee of $10 for destination fee? and I don't understand why that's just not included in your total cost if it's mandatory) Anyway, the rooms are all pretty different but have the same components. The room was clean and smelled fresh. Unfortunately, one of the mattress' was sinking on one side. If you're gonna do a reno, why not get new mattresses. Everything else was good. The staff was very friendly. Always said, welcome back when you came into the lobby. Check-in and check-out was quick and smooth. There are trolley things you can use yourself to carry your luggage to your room. I don't think there is a bellhop service.Up to the top floor where they have breakfast and the gym.Before reno, they had a lot more tables and a tv up there. But now, it has less tables and they got rid of the tv so there's even more room, but still less tables. So I don't understand why there is so much space but not a lot of tables/seats. Seems weird to me. Unfortunately, the breakfasts are getting less. There was only eggs and biscuits as hot food. I mean there was oatmeal that didn't look to appetizing. And of course, cereal, bagels, danishes, coffee, juice, waffles, etc. It seems very basic and slightly disappointing. Though it is better than complimentary breakfasts you get at chain hotels.Also the location of this hotel is great. Two blocks from inner harbor and from power plant live (a string of bars). Tip: don't get valet parking, it is super expensive. There's a parking garage right next door that is much cheaper.So I will look forward in coming back here!This is the third time I've been here, as my team always stays here for the dragonboat festival held by the Baltimore DragonBoat Club. The location of the hotel is great, it's two blocks away from the inner harbor and you have easy access to all the shops, bars, and major tourist destinations.The hotel had recently been renovated, and the lobby looks more welcoming, modern, and relaxing. They added a bar in the lobby, which is a nice touch, as it really draws everything together. The staff was extremely courteous and friendly, always welcoming us back whenever we came back from doing whatever we were doing.I don't know if they actually renovated the rooms though, because I don't really pay much attention to that. In general, I think all of the rooms were pretty decent, the bed was comfortable and it served the purpose of housing me over night. I've definitely been in hotels that were a lot worse.They also renovated the sky room (I think that's what it's called), so that there is more space to sit and view the city. They also added a fridge for their complementary breakfast - no more reaching into cold tubs of ice for your yogurt!Overall, I always have a good experience here. The only thing is that I wish they would include bacon or sausage with the complementary breakfast, but hey, I'll take what I can get.This place is a decent price for the location.  It's basically a 5 minute walk to the aquarium and surrounding area.  As of this review, the hotel is dated and the owners know it.  There's signs regarding a multimillion dollar renovation coming in the fall.  The lobby area is nice, but the hallways and living room area and kitchen (suites) is old.  The TVs are flat panel and beds are very comfortable.  The bathrooms are also a bit updated, which is nice.  Having a corner suite is the best because you have so many windows which make the room feel enormous.  I'd stay here again if I need to be in the area overnight again.I stayed at this hotel for a little getaway weekend downtown with a friend. I'm not big on chain hotels, so this seemed like the perfect fit for us. The rate was one of the best in the area, especially in that particular location. The staff was extremely nice and helpful and the rooms were very clean and well maintained. We were very conveniently located next to everything we wanted to visit including Mount Vernon, Federal Hill, and Inner Harbor. We were able to walk to many locations including the aquarium and many restaurants and great pubs. We loved Tir Na Nog (good food and drinks!) and all of the little shops in HarborPlace. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone planning a visit to Baltimore.I stayed at the Brookshire Suites for two nights recently while on business. I thought the price was reasonable and the room size was generous (I'm thinking that the room was likely a one-bedroom apartment at some point). The location can't be beat for access to the Inner Harbour and Camden Yards. And I can't remember ever meeting more helpful and friendly staff. If ever I'm back in Baltimore, I'll be staying here.We had a conference group stay at Brookshire Suites and had such a wonderful experience! Great location and amenities, and the staff we worked with were absolutely great and very accommodating! Christine helped organize our group room block and was very attentive and flexible to our needs. She was fantastic, and we will be using Brookshire Suites again in the future!**Update** After I finished me whole stay I can say the only real problem is the parking.  Every time I pulled in I had a 5-10 minute wait in the cold until someone came out.  When I called down to bring the car around it was a 50/50 shot if someone would even pick up.  If you offer valet, especially a valet service the same price as the 5 star hotels around you, you should have an attendant stationed waiting to take cars at all times.  If you don't want to do that then offer self-park or discounted valet.  To charge the same price for parking as Monaco does is absurd.  They're all but rushing up to the door before you even stop to usher you inside. **End Update**I'll start by saying this hotel is worth the double digit price I paid for a one bedroom suite.  The room is really huge.  Aside from how large the room is and how cheap it is, I can confidently say the staff is really nice and the hotel seems to be incredibly clean.  In addition it is awesome that they take large-breed dogs so we can stay here with our Lab/Hound mix.Now to the downsides: the valet parking is really confusing and around the back of the building.  Its the same price as the parking at the nicer hotels in the same neighborhood that are right in front of the door.  Its really just drop off, and walk around the building to go check in.  You pull into the garage yourself.  There should be a bit of a discount on parking.The facility itself is really, really dated.  They say they're in the middle of updating, so we'll see how it looks when they're done.  If the furniture and decoration were the same quality, but more modern, I would have given them 4 stars.  Not because they're a 4 star hotel, but because they would have been a nice 3 star hotel.  As it stands they are a solid 3 star hotel in location, service, and amenities.  The quality of the furniture and decorations is more of a 2 star hotel.Other plusses: free breakfast and free internet.Once their renovation is complete I'll come back and see if it qualifies them for another star.My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. We called to reserve a room and informed them that we could get a better price on a third party website, so they gave us the manager special. The room was discounted, we received free valet($29) and a $25 gift receipt to use at six locations near by of our choice. This location is pet friendly and doesn't charge a fee, so our little pup was happy to travel with us! Not much of a view of the inner harbor but the staff was very nice and attentive. Overall very satisfied.","Really disappointed. Small, noisy rooms and breakfast that often runs out (eggs and milk were out during our stay and when we just bought our own breakfast at Dunkin Donuts we ran up to grab a knife and there were no utensils out).Best hotel I've ever stayed at. Love the building and the staff! Modern style with a price that can't be beat. When I'm visiting Baltimore I'm not staying anywhere else.the bf and i stayed here for a last minute trip to Baltimore. i guess nobody plans for a funeral but this really has nothing to do with my review, i think...with little time to thoroughly research other places to stay, i was lured by the hotel website's pretty pictures and reasonable prices. needless to stay, if you bothered to pay attention to my 5-star rating, we were not disappointed...we booked a queen suite with a view for the price of almost 100 bucks a night and it was super spacious and stylishly furnished. the bed was cozy comfy. at my boyfriend's suggestion we grabbed a quick bite at the complimentary breakfast the hotel. it was decent and i was able to make myself a faux Sausage McMuffin and grab some juice and coffee. not that i care but the staff were super friendly and attentive enough to make me feel comfortable but not so attentive to make me feel uncomfortable. what can i say, i prefer an unassuming hotel staff.as for the parking, i was surprised about the strict downtown Baltimore street parking that is enforced 24/7. one night we found parking for 9 bucks like 1/4 mile away but that was after midnight and we had to be out of there early AND we had to walk to the hotel in like 20 degree weather. needless to say, we paid to park at the hotel the second night. there wasn't a parking attendant but it was in no way difficult to just park in the drive-up and notify someone at the front desk to park our car. the next morning the car was retrieved right away. easy-breezy...My boyfriend and I stayed here for one Saturday night. We had a work gathering/ party for his company to attend in the city, and with an open bar, we opted to crash at a local hotel instead of attempting the drive home. Especially with this arctic weather going on at the moment. Drunk driving= not cool! drunk driving in blizzard conditions= not cool and really dumb.Anywho, I chose the Brookshire Suites because the modern artsy look seemed like a nice change of pace and the reviews weren't half bad. Plus for the price, it couldn't be beat for the area. We picked a studio Queen room, with the Baltimore lovers package. This included cookies in the room upon arrival, free valet and a free suite upgrade if it was available. The cookies were delicious, free valet was definitely a plus since it's normally $36 a night. Which, is a smidge pricey. We did get a suite upgrade, which is fine, but that came with issues of its own.The lobby of the hotel is really nice, has a unique modern take to it. Check-in was painless, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. After we checked in, we had enough time to go up and check out the room before heading to the party. Room was easy enough to find, on the eighth floor. However, those elevators feel, sound and look like a death trap, and they're exceptionally slow. It's apparent in the renovations of the hotel, the elevators were not included. The room was nice, spacious, clean and had plenty of windows. The view left something to be desired, but hey, Baltimore isn't exactly a pretty city anyways. The downside to the suite was discovered much, much, later in the night after we returned from our party. Apparently, the suites have dual heat zones. However, the one in the bedroom was completely turned off, and despite fiddling with it we could not get it to turn on. For all intents and purposes it appeared to be non-functioning. Thus, the bedroom was ice cold all night. Thanks to the gigantic windows in the room, I'd hazard a guess that it was very close to the temperatures outside. I cranked the living room one up way high, and kept the door between the two rooms open in an attempt to get some heat in there but my efforts were futile.After a very, very, chilly night, we awoke and went about getting ready to check out. When we went to turn out the bedroom lights, we discovered a clear plastic (against white walls) light switch hidden behind one of the bedside lamps. I flipped it assuming it would turn the lamp off, but lo and behold it turned the damned thermostat on. Never in our lives, have we seen nonsense like that, especially since the one in the living room was not set up the same way. Once it flipped on, the screen went berserk for a few minutes, and finally settled on a temperature. As the heat kicked on, the sounds and rattling noises it made were monstrous. Had we figured out how to turn it on in the middle of the night, there's no doubt that neither us, nor any of our neighbors would have been able to sleep over the racket. We left it on, in the hopes that the poor suckers who occupied the room after us wouldn't have to spend a night in the ice cold like we did.Moving on, part of the $9.95 mandatory ""destination fee"" they tack on is free wireless, gym/pool access and free breakfast.The gym was tiny, dated and worn in. Never saw the pool. Breakfast was horrendous, super meager selection, just very cold eggs, stale biscuits and gravy and make them yourself waffles. Plus the standard, cereal and toast bar. No bacon, no sausage, nothing of any value to actually fill you up. Plastic silverware and plates and throw away cups. For a hotel that claims to be modern, and Eco-friendly, the breakfast area is anything but. The tables were all filthy, trash and food bits everywhere. All in all, breakfast was miserable and I'm surprised we didn't end up sick. Our room only cost $118 with the Baltimore Lovers package, plus another $9.95 ""destination fee"" and some more in taxes. Total cost was $146 for the night. Since it was only one night, and it was cheaper than other area hotels, I'd say it wasn't a complete waste of money. However, had we been staying longer than one night, we'd have probably moved to a different hotel, even if it meant a slight increase in price,I stayed here because I wanted to enjoy a concert nearby and didn't want to drive back late at night. It's hard for me to find a hotel which is near the inner harbor, is nice, and is dog-friendly. This hotel fits it all, nice staff and the room was much larger than I expected, almost like a studio apartment. My view wasn't super nice (view of the adjacent roof top and alley), but what do you expect with a city view? The day I checked-in the internet was down due to a storm the previous night. I got back to the hotel late night, about 5 minutes before midnight which was just when the downstairs bar was closing but the bartender was nice enough to stay open for myself and another hotel guest. We all chatted and I enjoyed a beer, then went to sleep. I had a comfy sleep and was happy to have my pampered pooch by my side. Word of advice, the streets around the hotel can be a bit sketchy at night, and being a young female by myself I didn't feel very safe walking the 1.5 blocks from the concert venue to the hotel. I'd recommend walking back with a friend or asking the hotel for a taxi or escort. Overall had a good experience here.The brookshire suites suites was fine for the two nights I was in Baltimore, but was a bit odd. Most of the reason I'm writing is their seemingly bullshit fee structure. We chose the hotel because it was a bit less expensive than hotels in the same area, but once they've nickeled and dimed you the deal is 100% gone.  Their rates include a ""destination fee"" of $9.95 a night. I see people on yelp attributing that to a bunch of things (pool use, breakfast, etc.) and have no idea what the truth is. When we stayed, a sign at the front desk said something about it covering phone calls and bottled water.  Well, it's the age of the cell phone, and you only get 2 bottles of water with no additional bottles even though they charge the fee again the second night. So those bottles end up at about $9.95 a piece in our case. Yikes.  Bottom line: either charge for stuff specifically or raise your prices a little, Brookshire - people know when they're being had and they don't feel good about it.As other people mentioned, the couch cushions were weirdly slippery and There were what seemed like 2 million pictures of the singer from the counting crows.Lastly, our view was of the abandoned building next door. milk crates holding up a satellite dish, a smashed AC unit and broken-into windows.  Lovely...  I know the hotel can't control their neighbors but that detail just capped off the feeling that the hotel was a bit off.I stayed at Brookshire Suites in Baltimore this past June.  I was in town for the world premiere of my film at the B'More QFest, and Brookshire graciously hosted me (and the film's director) during our stay. The location of the hotel was terrific, and it's got a cool, fun vibe.  I was treated to a corner suite on the top floor, so the living area had a nice view (I could see my complimentary yacht parked in the harbor from the living area...just kidding, it wasn't complimentary, or my yacht).  We were able to walk to the harbor and had I worn better shoes, there were lots of nicer little shops around, as well. Prior to my stay, I contacted the manager about vegan options, and unfortunately, their complimentary breakfast was not vegan-friendly.  However, he sent me an extensive list of accommodating local eats, which was fantastic.  When I arrived and walked into the suite, I was so pleasantly surprised.  I've never been in a suite before, and this one was well appointed, clean and simple, yet contemporary and cool. And, bonus, there was a picture of Mama Cass watching over me above the toilet--my own private restroom angel (Adam Duritz' picture was above the couch, swoon).  And bless their hearts, there was a vase of fresh purple daisies (at least, I think they were daisies...I know movies, but don't know flowers), as well as a big, full bag of the most delicious vegan-friendly locally made granola I have ever tasted, compliments of the hotel, as well as a print out of the list of restaurants I had been sent earlier.  I felt so special.  There was more than enough space for me, and the bed was like a big hug and extremely comfortable after some very long flights and days.  The couch, although cool-looking isn't really the kind you'd jump onto to get cozy, or take a nap on because of the size and material (I slid off once...or twice, but I'm not that coordinated anyway), the bathroom was on the small side, and the water pressure could be a skosh better, BUT, HUGE bonus points because this hotel uses cruelty-free shower products!!  I love the thoughtfulness this hotel put into my stay, and how kind and accommodating the staff was.  It's not a pretentious or ultra-luxe hotel; it's a hotel that deserves thoughtful recommendation and one I'd stay at again.  It was lovely that they were a sponsor of the B'More QFest, and I was just happy to be treated as a special guest.Shocked this place only has 3 stars. I'm local but not local (not from Bmore but a little over a hour away) and I will DEFINITELY stay here again. This hotel has class and swag (so what if you hate that word). The staff was exceptional, honestly. Nate or Nathaniel at the front desk was 5 star the night I checked in. The deal I got from Expedia was great. (used current available promo code for installing their mobile app and got 10 percent off an already reasonable rate). The room was f*cking amazing. The staff was excellent. My only issue was out of the hotel's hand and it involved parking. Pretty much everything in the vicinity is garage parking at $16 daily on weekends.The location is so close to inner harbor that I could see water from out 4th floor window.  The front desk and staff were great and their hot breakfast was a welcomed treat the next morning, I'm talking waffle iron to yogurt and eggs.  The breakfast made the extra fee per night worth it.  My only complaint would be the weird pictures everywhere, I know they want a modern look and all the the guy from the counting crows doesn't have to be watching me in the bathroom.The pictures posted on this business are way outdated. They have refurbished this hotel in a tasteful but hip manner. My room was upgraded to executive queen when my 1 bedroom king was not available. The staff are young and serious about providing great service. For my  visit it was a special occasion and the staff here did not hesitate in helping me piece everything together for me. From opening a wine bottle to actually selling me the wine and providing me with wine glasses. My room is very comfortable with a view of the harbor from my window. The bed is nice. They do provide a breakfast every morning which has a little something for everybody. It is not a IHOP restaurant but it does serve the purpose. So far my stay here has been delightful and I will return again and again.We won't stay there never again. I have to say the location is good because is close to the harbor and the staff is very attentive. But they really really need to do something about this place. First our view from the window was a brick wall(im not kidding) and the a/c was not working well so we had a really bad night didnt rest at all. Also they need new windows and remodel the bathrooms. The tvs are nice, new and good size but the room was not that great ugly pictures on the walls. BAD EXPERIENCE!!The one star goes to their decent breakfast service. Aside from that, I was disappointed with my stay based on the reasons as follows:The walls are extremely thin in this place especially when your room is in the corner (which is where they usually put those who booked the hotel with a special rate, I suppose). I got so annoyed with the sound of the door banging shut from my next door neighbor that I decided to change my room around 11PM. Even then, voila, they put me in same room in the corner on a different floor. Thank goodness my new neighbor was somewhat quieter, otherwise I might've tried something interesting.Other cons for this hotel: 1) For whatever reason, they disconnect the phone on the desk so you have to really check the connection and fix it yourself before you can make a call. This happened in both of my rooms. Weird...2) The Hotel staff isn't always present at the front desk. I had to call 2-3 times before someone finally answered my call.3) The biggest reason of all--there is a HUGE lack of professionalism and integrity at this hotel. Why? I booked this hotel as an out-of-towner for a business reason, and I specifically needed a transportation to get to my location. I checked with them at least 4 times to make sure it's comp'd by the hotel and they confirmed that with me each time. When the day came, I had to pay out of my own pocket. I called the hotel, got transferred to the manager who wasn't present, left a voicemail demanding the be refunded for my cab fare only to never receive a call back from them. Wtf? All in all, this hotel is similar to my experience with the ghetto-hole-in-the-wall-from-hell-Baymont Suites and Inn in Cedar Rapids in that, despite the nicely decorated facade, it really is just another motel with a crappy service. Needless to say, I won't ever stay there again.I stayed here for two nights, in a one bedroom king room. Plus points:Great location nearest to harborFriendly staff all aroundGood value on the larger roomsClean, good air conditioningVery soundproofBreakfast ""included"" - see belowValet parkingMinus:A little datedSmall rooms other than the full suitesForced to pay extra ($10!!) for the included breakfast which is total shit qualityLocation is good but difficult to negotiate in a vehicleSuper tight squeeze when parking for valet or loading/unloadingSelf-parking sucksHomeless people passed out in side alleyAnd the big minus: It's BALTIMORE. Don't go out wandering at night even around the hotel. This city is not what I expected. You can't go anywhere without piles of sketchy people peering at you.They know you aren't from around there. Anywhere outside of the immediate inner harbor, stay out of. Don't drive with a visible GPS. This hotel will be undergoing a huge reno over the next year or so... if I ever go back to Bmore, which will probably be never, hah, I would stay here again.Of course, this is *not* a four-star hotel. But it earns the four stars because it does what it is supposed to do very well.First off: location and price. It's an easy walk to the Inner Harbor, aquarium and convention center and Camden Yards is also walk-able if you're up for it. It is diagonal from the Renaissance Harborplace, which is probably the best property in the area. Yet booking a weeknight room the night before only ran me $120, not including $30 to valet. The Harborplace was going for $330 that same night.For such a disparity in price I surely expected letdowns or things that struck me as sketchy. Not at all. The staff was cordial and helpful. The room was clean, the wi-fi kicked ass and the complimentary breakfast - on the top floor, with an amazing view of the city - was passable. If they had a nice oatmeal option, it would've been right on par with what you'd expect at a Residence or Fairfield Inn, or on the concierge level of a Marriott. While this was a leisure trip, I would have been more than comfortable working in the room. Sure, there were funky elements to the place, and I would definitely request a room on a higher floor, as another site recommended, due to street traffic.But Baltimore is a tough hotel town; not a lot of inventory, which drives the prices up, and the surroundings in some spots can be sketchy. With all that in mind, the Brookshire seems like a real find and I'd definitely come back.Hotel was clean (except for a small stain in the comforter, but it was the only imperfection I found so I can let it slide).  The hotel itself seemed clean and the staff was friendly.  The front desk always greeted us with a good morning whenever we were leaving or coming in.  The shampoo and lotion are from bath and body works so that's nice.  Shower pressure was great.  Only negative was that there wasn't enough places to hang towels, so hand towels were just kind of laid on the counter.  Bed was too firm for me and just a little uncomfortable.  Our nice and quiet room was fine.  Free wifi is always a plus too.Breakfast:  Breakfast wasn't amazing, but it has a great variety that you're bound to find something you can eat.  Eggs, sausage, make-it-yourself waffles, bagels, toast, cereal, yogurt, coffee, and juice.  Parking:if you plan to use their parking, it is $29 per day which is horrible.  that's where the minus 1 star comes from.  but the valets themselves are quite efficient and will get your car for you in advance if you call ahead. Pet: we also did bring our dog and the staff was very warm and welcoming to our dog.  however, there weren't any nice additives that we've found in other pet-friendly hotels.  no dog bed or bowls, and only one person at the front desk even mentioned that they had dog treats.I liked this place.  It wasn't a shiny new high rise and didn't have many fancy bells &amp; whistles, but for $109 for a two bedroom suite, it was most acceptable.What really made a difference was service.  It was warm, friendly, down to earth, and extremely accommodating from the valet, front desk folk to the bartender in the cloud level lounge and the breakfast staff.Yes the valet was pricey but we are used to paying much higher prices in Chicago and NY so we took that in stride.  Besides, included in our suite price, was complimentary happy hour which included beer and wine with appetizers (2 drinks p/p), and a full, hot/cold breakfast buffet.The rooms definitely were a bit dated and the ceilings were low, but it was quiet and the bed was super comfortable.  If I was expecting the Ritz than of course I would have been disappointed, but we knew we were booking an older hotel with less amenities than a higher priced chain property.The top level lounge, surrounded by windows, even afforded you a peek of the waterfront.   It was open 24 hours, so guests could read, play cards, or partake in happy hour and/or breakfast.As others said, the location was perfect.  We were going to the Bob Seger concert, so even though this was a stone's throw to the Inner Harbor, it was also a quick walk to the 1st Mariner Arena.  It's amazing how a great hotel staff can transform an experience.  It did for us.Awesome room updated and extremely clean.  Just one stupid destation fee so you pay 9.95 for bottled water and breakfast.Stayed here for the night when Hurricaine Sandy was in town.  My job was putting people up in hotel rooms so that we would be able to get into work =P  Although some of the hotel looks aged, it was a nice hotel overall!  Rooms were very spacious - I had a double, which also had a sofa, coffee table, desk, chair, microwave, and mini fridge.  The bed was comfortable and the sheets clean.  The best part is probably the free HOT breakfast.  There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there were some frozen and non-perishable items in their lobby.This hotel was recently purchased out of foreclosure. The hotel will be completing a multi million dollar renovation this winter. The team is amazing and so will the hotel be once renovated. It's good clean large rooms now, just a bit dated, but clean.We loved the decor. very modern and spacious. The only complaint is that the windows do not block out the loud city outside.","Pros: The location is outstanding, one block from the Inner Harbor. The staff is very friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The wifi signal was strong in our room. Good bang for your buck.Cons: Their ""Baltimore rock n roll"" theme runs thin ... I don't need a photo of the guy from Counting Crows in the bathroom. The breakfast was kinda weak. We got a suite, and the leather couch was annoying (the leather was so slick that the back cushions kept sliding off the couch). We needed to jiggle the handle on our toilet. If this was just a normal hotel with normal decor and furniture, it'd easily be four stars.I read a lot of hotel reviews before settling on the Brookshire, so I knew what to expect when I walked in. I'm still chuckling over the reviewers who were upset about having to lay eyes upon the less fortunate nearby; if you're afraid of homeless people, maybe you should never visit a major city and definitely don't ever visit San Francisco. I for one thought it was a nice change that the area didn't smell like pee. Seriously, the location was great. Safe area, cheap parking and lots of fun stuff to do nearby. A stone's throw from the Inner Harbor, walking distance to great restaurants and shops, as well as the famed Baltimore Aquarium. A short walk to a nearby liquor store got us a reasonable amount of delicious Yuengling (if you're from the area, you know, and if you don't, I suggest you familiarize yourself with this delicious lager). I felt very safe in the area and had no problems.The hotel itself, as has been said, is in dire need of upgrades. The lobby was really pretty and fairly modern, but once I got to our floor I was glad I'd prepared myself by looking at the photos, because the decor is extremely dated. It's clean and looks nice for what it is, but it's reminiscent of a bygone era when taste was in short supply. Even though I hadn't asked for it, we got a suite, which was nice but we didn't really use the living area (except to store the aforementioned Yuengling). Still, it was nice to have a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, and lots of storage space. The bed was comfortable and the water pressure was great and heated up quickly. We had a small problem with the tub clogging, but it was minor.The wallpaper had scuff marks and the carpet was faded, but they're about to start upgrading all the rooms, so I'm sure they'll look fabulous once they're done. I was a little disappointed with the view, but a hotel right on the water was prohibitively expensive. Being close enough to walk there was nice, though. They offer valet parking for $35, which is worth it if you're afraid of city driving or don't know where to park, but all they do is park it in a nearby garage which is $19 a night. It's near the hotel on Lombard (Arrow Parking) and it's about as secure as you're going to get. Leave the car empty and remove your stereo faceplate and you should be fine.I give the staff five stars. Everyone I spoke to was extremely friendly and accommodating, and I never wanted for anything. They have a 24-hour convenience store and complimentary breakfast and in-room wi-fi, but we didn't use any of those so I can't speak to how good they are. When I come back to Baltimore I'll definitely consider Brookshire again.Large rooms, plenty of hot water, and decent enough beds.  We could have used more towels and the place could definitely have been cleaner.  This is an older hotel and it really could use some attention.  The breakfast is fine, but they really good put some more effort into it.  The location is great and they are pet friendly.Room was spacious, nice centrally placed TV, great view to see the harbour. In addition, the staff are very friendly and helpful.The hotel is in walking distance to the harbor but, that's the only positive. We only stayed one night and the bed was clean but everything else looked warn and dingy in the room. Our bathtub had water sitting in it when we arrived. Yuck.Staff great! Rooms are older but they plan to remodel. That is when I will come backThe fabulous:(1) Location, location, location. 2 minute walk to the Harbor, and 0.4 miles from Power Plant Live (where Ram's Head is for you music fans like me). (2) The view from the room(3) The view from the Cloud Club(4) One free beer or wine every night between 5:30pm to 7:00pm(5) The price, at $76.00 per night base and $100.00 per night total(6) Free DSL in the room with no annoying log-in pageThe good:(1) There is valet available(2) Very friendly staff(3) Laid back atmosphere(4) Breakfast provided in the mornings (did not actually eat it)The pppppppptttttbbbbbbbbbb:(1) The valet costs $29.00 per day. Yikes!(2) Lumpy pillows and too-soft mattress*(3) Outdated decor in a tiny room*(4) Occasional sewage-like mystery smells in the elevator* I'll qualify this by saying that I made my reservation for 2 nights through Expedia for the weekend after Thanksgiving about 1.5 hours before I arrived, and Expedia said there were only 4 rooms left. I am guessing I got a bottom-of-the-barrel room.If I had another weekend adventure in Baltimore, I would definitely stay again. You just cannot beat the convenience for the price here.Be ready to be GOUGED. I had a 2 night stay at this hotel and made a reservation through their own website. I chose this place because they did accept pets and the location and the final quoted price was $225.50, which seemed like a good deal. Somehow on this price they left out the pet fee of $35, daily destination fee of $10 (pays for that complimentary breakfast, wifi, and treadmill), daily cleaning fee of $10, and daily valet fee of $36.  This takes nickel and diming to a whole new level and somehow their reservation software included none of it. My final bill ended at $354 for 2 nights and had to be emailed to me since ""their printer wasn't working.""I stayed at the Brookshire while attending a conference held at the (much more expensive) Marriott in the Inner Harbor.  I'm giving it three stars only because it was by FAR the best deal in the area, at least at the time I booked it.  Otherwise, it was basically a two-star kind of experience -- maybe two and a half, tops.On the positive side, the people at the front desk were friendly and helpful.  The shower was great -- plenty of hot water, excellent water pressure, etc.  And there's a free breakfast in the mornings, although I can't say how good it was, since I had breakfast at the conference each morning.That said, the building feels very old and run down.  The rooms need paint and carpet cleaning.  The air conditioning didn't work very well, and even worse, the walls were SO thin.  I mean, most hotels are kind of loud, but this place was amazingly loud -- I could clearly hear conversations in other rooms, TVs in other rooms, etc.  I was also woken up again and again by police sirens and by people walking around outside the hotel. I'd stay here again, honestly, if I had to be in the neighborhood -- but only for the deal.Just dark,dirty and kinda gross (broken chairs,broken coffee maker,stained rug,phone doesn't work). I was traveling for a trade show and had to stay here because I was traveling with a group.The lock didn't work on my room door so I had to put a huge chair in front of the door. My room was located right next to the stairs facing Lombard Street so between the loud sirens and being a nervous wreck I would be murdered, not a pleasant stay. I personally didn't see any ""bugs"" but someone in our group did. The staff was nice and the only reason for the one star.Warm welcome, staff was friendly and available. Bed was comfy. Breakfast was good.  2 blocks from Inner Harbor.  Only issue was there was no fold out bed in sofa as expected when the kids went to go to bed.  They gave us a fold up bed we put on the floor for 1 and thankfully we had an air mattress for the other.  They did give us a refund for their oversight.I stayed at this hotel a few weeks ago and was impressed by the very friendly staff here.I flew in from LAX and my plane landed at 6 am. I got to the hotel at 7 am and they were able to get me into a room with early check in at no cost (which is great since it was 4 am my time and I was dead tired)The have wine tasting every night and a full breakfast every morning for free. Also - Free WiFi and bottles of water. I cannot remember the last time I have stayed in a hotel that did not charge you $4 for the bottle of water they leave in your room.Great prices - nice staff. I will stay here again.Great huge suite I got with a groupon coupon. Large bedroom and living room. Breakfast is included.We had a great experience at this hotel recently. We got a one bedroom suite with kitchen. It was in the back and very private. We appreciated that at night, as it was nice and quiet. My 3 year old enjoyed the coin game. She managed to collect 20 coins over 4 days, resulting in 4 toys from the treasure chest. Our room was clean and the staff was incredibly nice and very gracious. We had a free drink of choice in the Cloud Club every night between 5:30 and 7 PM. There's a nice view from there out floor to ceiling windows. Overall, my eval is as follows:PROS -- Great value overall, inexpensive, great location, super friendly and accommodating staff, flat screen TV's, family friendly (kids and pets alike)CONS -- remote controls were awful, low ceilingsBottom line is that you get a lot of bang for your buck at this hotel. We got a package with discounted tickets for the aquarium, port discovery museum and science center. They have shuttle service on-demand for popular destinations and between the harbor magic hotels. We even got our 3rd night free. So, we ended paying about $200 a night TOTAL (attraction tickets included.) We would have paid $400 EASY for a one-bedroom suite at one of the other Inner Harbor hotels. If you don't need somewhere extravagant and are realistic in your expectations, this hotel is a good value for the money.The price was fantastic but that's pretty much where the ""magic"" stopped... The proximity to the harbour, the aquarium and the various ships was pretty good, as the hotel is only a couple of blocks away from all of those.The front desk staff were friendly and helpful but the hotel itself is very run down. The carpets in the room had a dirty, musty smell to them. The bathroom floor was sticky. (I kept my shoes on the whole time I was there...)There were a couple of burned out bulbs and everything looked old and uncleaned. The bed and the pillows were the most uncomfortable I've ever slept on, and that includes camping and hostels. I ended up taking one of my clothes bags and stuffing that with some clothes to be my pillow.The breakfast was disgusting. The eggs were mushy and tasted like they'd been reheated from previous days.The hotel itself used to be a parkade, which probably explains why it has such a cramped feeling, but it also means the walls are paper thin - including the outside walls. I was on the fifth floor, but the noise from the traffic and people outside was so clear I may as well have been sleeping on the street.This is probably one of those ""you get what you pay for"" situations which, in most cases, is acceptable. Unfortunately, for what you get the low low price doesn't quite make up for it.Stay as far away from this hotel as you can, the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. You basically have to ask ten times if u want something the second night of my stay they turned the air off in the bedroom, with 90 degree heat outside. Watch out for the hidden costs on your bill my room was $99 a night two nights hidden costs the bill was $318 for the two nights avoid this place.I loved the hotel but there is one thing to remember.   Never stay on the side of the hotel with the subway on the street. At 0230 in the morning the bars let out and the subway is 24 hours.  Drunk people + food= no sleep for youI recently purchased a Groupon deal for a one night stay. Me and a friend checked in on Friday night. The Groupon included free valet and a $25 gift card to a local restaurant. Upon arriving at the hotel two cars were parked in the valet location, making it hard for us to squeeze our car in so that we wouldn't hang out on the busy street.  The hotel was beautifully decorated. The decor was purple and the couches were unique. The tree was very nicely decorated and festive. The front desk clerk got us checked in and explained the drink tickets and breakfast to us and we were on our way to our room. The elevators were slow. So slow we considered taking the stairs. The room was smaller than I thought. The decor was a little dated. I was pleased to see that they used Eco friendly products for the toiletries.  Later that night we decided to order a movie. We had to call the front desk to get the restriction for ordering movies lifted. Once we did that we ordered the movie. Being that it was late we fell asleep on it. The next morning I tried to rewind, but that button didn't work on the remote and it shut the TV off. After numerous tries I gave up. I ended up wasting $15.00 on a movie I could have seen on my netflix when I returned home. Around 10:00 the maid started hounding us to come clean the room. We informed her that we were in there and would be checking out at 12:00. Unfortunately she didn't  wasn't satisfied with that. She returned FOUR times even when we put the ""Shh I'm sleeping"" sign out. I really can't comprehend why she would disturb us when checkout is at 12:00. This was a major problem for me. Upon checking out the front desk held our bags while we shopped at the gallery.Over all the trip was great. However the movie and maid situation has me considering other hotels when I visit Baltimore.  The locations is amazing. It is in close proximity to the necessities of Baltimore.Just returned from a Sunday-Monday trip to Baltimore with the family to checkout the Inner Harbor.  Got the Groupon deal and was very happy with this place.We arrived at noonish and were told no rooms were ready, which was non unexpected and understandable.  However, the Manager was there and immediately said to put us in a one bedroom suite on the 11th floor.Like other have said, it's not the Ritz but the room was nice. Very comfy queen bed and a ""not-so-comfy"" pull-out-couch (good for the kids).The shower water was HOT and good pressure and the entire room was quite clean with plenty of towels.My ONLY issue that people need to know is the street noise is very noticable (to say the least).  I am not a light sleeper but I was awakened several times by the horns/sirens and our room was on the top floor facing Lombard St (front of the hotel). The windows were old and the ones that opened were unable to be completely closed due to broken handles and age.  If you are a light sleeper, insist on a ""non-front"" room.The breakfast was like going to a Hampton Inn, which is decent for the price.  The Club Room on the 12th floor is really nice.  Would like to come back for a M-F happy hour.The service was great, from the front-desk to the Valet, to the food staff.Highly recommend this place.The location and price were fantastic, with the Brookshire being way cheaper than other Inner Harbor hotels.  We could see the Inner Harbor from our room, and the top of the warehouse at Camden Yards.  Inner Harbor was a very quick walk from the front door.There is a $10 fee called ""Entertainment fee"" which pays for the breakfast, bottles of water in the room, the shuttle to the other 2 hotels (Pier 5 and Admiral Fell) which runs all day until 10pm, and you can go to anything going on at the other 2 hotels.  We took the shuttle to Pier 5 more than once and had a walk around Little Italy, and also attended their Chocolate Fountain hour, which was on a Saturday afternoon.  The shuttle also brought us to Admiral Fell, which is right in the middle of Fell's Point, so it was a great place to walk around and for nightlife.The breakfast was alright, the eggs were a bit bland and probably powdered, the orange juice was gross, but there were 4 juices to choose from so cranberry saved me.  All three mornings, breakfast was the same exact thing - eggs, french toast, bacon and sausage, as well as cereals, bread and some nice fruit.Our floor's hallway reeked of smoke despite no smoking signs everywhere as well.Overall, I would say it was decent, I would stay here again, the location is perfect and the shuttle is great to get to other areas worth visiting.","I got a great deal on a room here and decided to try it out. The staff were exceptionally helpful. When the television in my room didn't work at 6AM, they promptly offered to move me to a larger suite at no cost. The breakfasts and snackable dinners, along with free drink tickets, make the place even sweeter. The location is ideal for a walking traveler.Let me start by saying i have lived in tents in Iraq without running water and would rather take my family there.  I came to Baltimore because my daughter needed surgery. I picked this hotel because it was close to the hospital. I could not sign in on the first day because of some medical stuff. I called in and explained my situation and they told me I already paid for the hotel so checking in didn't really matter. Ok two days later I show up to take a shower and check the place out. $30 to park are you kidding me? The lady at the front desk lectures me about smoking in my room, while she and the lobby smell like a bar. I go to the elevator and it smells like bad eggs, both elevators. I get to my floor and everything is purple. Yuck! I get to my room haven't showered in three days and get in the shower and feel grosser getting out then when I went in. Remote didn't work and room was to small so I leave and get back to my family. Me and my wife decide it was more comfortable to sleep in a folding chair in the hospital then in our hotel. Find out that the surgery is not going to get fully done now so have to leave the room early. The manager after hearing why tells me not my problem and makes me pay for the full time. Sleep in the street before this hotel. Motel 6 better.I've stayed at this hotel now on two different occasions, it's a great location relative to the harbor and the convention center and it is not nearly as harmful on your pocketbook as most of the other hotels in the area.  It's not uber-luxurious but it is a nice, solid, safe hotel with very professional and courteous staff. They have valet parking but no front-entrance driveway, which can be a little dicey when loading/unloading from your car, as it means you just have to pull over to the curb.  Definitely be careful there.I stayed here with three friends...hmmm...had to be three years ago this coming October.  We were most impressed , I think, with the pleasant, accomodating staff.   We'd arrived from NYC earlier than check-in, but just as breakfast was being cleared; the staff not only hung onto our stuff, but arranged for the remains of the breakfast to be held (We were starving!).  Our wheelchair-accessible rooms were well-appointed, complete with mini-bars.  The hotel's conveniently located within walking distance of most sights; we had no problems except for the rain one night.  The neighborhood seems pleasant enough.All in all, it was a pleasant enough experience that I'm strongly considering staying there again when I return to Charm City this summer.DO NOT STAY HERE!  If you must, bring a Costco-size amount of hand sanitizer.  This was the only hotel I could find that accepts pets, and I wanted to bring my dog to a week-long meeting in Baltimore (now I wish I'd chosen the Hilton further away).  When I arrived, I had no trouble checking in.  I was told I'd receive a dog travel kit (advertised on their website and repeated when I called), so I didn't bother bringing food bowls.  When I arrived, I was told they had none.As soon as I got on the elevator, I knew there'd be a problem.  It looks like it was installed the year elevators were invented and hasn't been updated since (that's also the way I'd describe its performance).  I was staying in a suite on the 5th floor, which had the same feel as the elevator.  It was dank and disgusting.  I was hesitant to put my bags down and I didn't remove the plastic bag from my suits. I ordered room service, which comes from Mo's.  When I picked up the phone and pressed the room service button, it didn't work.  One phone didn't work at all, and it took 5 times on the second to register all the numbers.  The TV was fuzzy.  The remote barely worked, and the channel selection was poor (oh Bravo how I missed you).  I should've picked something up because it took 1.5 hours to arrive and was cold.  The crab cake was filled with shell.  I couldn't eat it.  I went to bed hungry in sheets that had holes in them.  I couldn't stop coughing in the musty air.I told the staff that my dog would be in daycare from 7-7, so the room could be cleaned during that  time.  They told me to put a sign on my door telling staff I had a dog, but didn't provide it (nor did they give me a privacy sign).  I checked in on Monday, and no one cleaned my room on Tuesday.  The shower dripped, and it didn't drain so I stood in a pool on Tuesday morning.  I informed the front desk, but it was never fixed.  The towels were rough.  I'd asked for a robe through their pre-stay especialist service, (although given the accommodations I'm not sure I would've used it) but it never arrived.  Why send me two especialist emails, if neither of the two things I asked for were going to materialize (the dog travel kit and the bathrobe)?  I even called to confirm when I was forced to book an additional day.  By the way, they couldn't modify my reservation, I was forced to make a second reservation for the additional day and they couldn't guarantee I'd get the same room.On Wednesday my room was cleaned, but it smelled like sewage when I arrived after midnight.  I thought I must've forgotten to take out the trash, but I was never able to determine the source of the smell.  It finally dissipated after I turned off the air conditioning.  Obviously in late June, this was a less than ideal option.  When my room was cleaned, my bath mat disappeared never to return again.On Thursday, maid service dropped by at 5:30 p.m. to clean the room.  No, thank you.  Why bother at 5:30?  It took a few times to communicate that I was declining cleaning service.  On Friday, I couldn't get away fast enough!  At a former job, I was sent to an Econolodge, and when I entered my room, I rolled over a cockroach.  That was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, but this was a very close second.  There was no free parking, but there's a garage across the street.  The location is good (especially for the price), but it's still not worth it.  I didn't attend any events, try any food, or take the shuttle.My boyfriend &amp; I came to Baltimore to celebrate our Anniversary. Staff got us upgraded to a nice King size bed suite! Staff was very friendly and helpful. The air condition was broke when we arrived but thankfully, they had it up and running within a few hours. This is a block away from the Inner Harbor and a great location! Parking is on the expensive side...Not surprised by that. The continental breakfast was awesome! They had a make your own waffle station which was SO good! Only problem- you could hear the traffic right outside the window. Other then that- great deal!Parking update. F the valet, its now $34 because they added a 16% parking tax. Your best bet is to park in the garage on Lombard just before you get to the hotel. Their 24 hr max rate is $18.We booked this hotel the day before we wanted to stay there ... we got some last-minute Orioles tickets and wanted to stay at a hotel in the Inner Harbor area. Pros:* With a one-night stay in a king bed room, it came out to about $130 after tax, which was not too bad for a tourist area. * You're a stone's throw away from the shops and restaurants in the Inner Harbor, and about a 10-minute walk from Camden Yards, so it's quite convenient. Cons:* They don't validate parking or provide a lot, so you need to find your own. We parked in a lot across the street (""The Gallery"" for Renaissance Hotels, I think) and wound up paying over $40 for less than 24 hours of parking. They have valet which is about $27, I think (not sure if that includes a lot fee on top of that). * Once we checked in, we were immediately charged an additional $10. I think that only included Internet in the room - which wasn't wireless, you needed to plug into an Ethernet cable - and two bottles of Poland Spring water. * The room was quite small. We were also facing the street that looks out on the Inner Harbor, and there was construction going on for most of the night. That, paired with the regular traffic, made the room quite noisy for the duration of our stay. * The air conditioner barely worked, which wasn't too pleasant on a muggy August night. Not very comfortable. * The television was hard to operate and many channels were fuzzy. * The breakfast the next day wasn't very good. The scrambled eggs tasted like the fake ones you get from McDonald's (maybe made from powdered eggs). * The checkout line the next morning was long, because there was only one clerk at the front desk. Luckily someone else asked if we wanted to do ""express checkout,"" which consisted of us just handing them the printout we'd gotten at check-in. They asked if there was a problem with the bill, we said no, and that was that. Good thing we didn't wait on that whole line for a five-second process. I don't think we'd go back if we can help it. If you're in need of a quick hotel room near the Inner Harbor, and you're not picky, this place will probably do. It wouldn't be my first choice, though.I stayed here this weekend with my boyfriend and booked through living social/groupon. I bought this as a valentines day get away thinking that it would be a nice romantic little getaway. I should have known from the minute I walked into that old run down elevator things would only get worse from there!Upon getting to the hotel I thought how nice the lobby looked, and the use of colors were pretty cool... However, by the time we both arrived to our floor I started to notice things weren't right. The ceiling was so low that my boyfriend almost had to duck down, I thought that I had entered a land for short people, as I am only 5'3"" and I couldn't help but chuckle at first. When we opened the door I found to my horror that the ""Suite"" I had upgraded to for an extra fee (which wasn't a huge deal to begin with) was run down, dark and depressing with little light, and down right disgusting and unclean. The walls were beat up, the carpets smelled funny and had stains, and I kid you not... had water damage EVERYWHERE. The bathroom was even worse, as they had cut one of the vents in half to fit in the bathroom, put a hole in the wall to fit the shower head, and just small and stuffy!  I was horrified and a bit embarrassed that I had taken my boyfriend to this dump! I've stayed in motel 6's nicer than this place! To top it off, the service of this place was just as horrible, it took us 3 hours to get our bags from the valet, and the lady at the front desk seemed drunk in the morning. Please save yourselves from this horrible place!",,"['first', 'going', 'dime', 'rather', 'expense', 'account', 'likely', 'hotel', 'however', 'hotel', 'really', 'hard', 'review', 'hard', 'describe',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-seasons-hotel-baltimore,Four Seasons Hotel,4.5,$$$$,73,"This is a beautiful hotel. I've had two stays now and it's definitely top class. I had a standard room on the first visit and a really nice suite on the second. Kind of crazy that my hotel room had more bathrooms than my apartment! The views are beautiful, the staff is friendly and helpful, the food at Wit and Wisdom is really good, and everything is sparkling new and clean. There's kind of a strange smell in the lobby (kinda like a BBQ smokehouse), but I can overlook that for all the positives that the Four Seasons has to offer.Pro tip: Stay on someone else's dime!The four seasons Baltimore is the highest end hotel in Fells Point. Thus you are surrounded by a certain level of clientele, resulting in decent but somewhat pretentious service. The grounds and rooms are stunning. This location is new and the design is flawless. The spa is gorgeous and my favorite in Baltimore with experience showers, lounging jacuzzis, and heated seats. My actual service (massage) was not too impressive. The restaurants here are hit or miss. Wit and wisdom is overpriced with mediocre food and mediocre service despite having a great chef. Azumi was delicious with several fish overnight shipped from Japan and great service.Second visit to the Four Seasons Baltimore.  This one was considerably better than the previous.  Hotel is still under construction and thus it is difficult to pull into valet, although very busy weekend.  Food in Wit &amp; Wisdom and the late night room service menu were both excellent.  The hotel staff went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of during check-in.  Concierge was very kind, too.The heat experience at the spa was excellent -- make sure you take advantage, as it is available to hotel guests.  Only negative:  The entire time, there was a high pitched frequency in the room that was borderline maddening every time we turned the TV off (which we didn't want on) -- literally couldn't sleep.  My husband heard it, too; definitely electronic, but couldn't figure out where it was coming from (bad LED light?).  Still, a much improved stay versus last time.Stayed here for a long weekend in June, we were on the top floor in a corner room with a balcony. The room was gorgeous and the view of the harbor was picturesque. They have late night room service which was great, we ordered a bottle of wine to go with our pizza from Fells. The hotel is located in Harbor East and within walking distance to all the nightlife in Fells. The pool was perfect to cool off and has a great view of the city. Wit and Wisdom is downstairs and has indoor and outdoor seating. There are mum ours restaurants with excellent food right next door, if you're in Baltimore you have to try Charleston!I was here on September 18th 2015 for the Flip Flop Festivus in Baltimore. I won tickets and the  event was very good! This event is held yearly.. l must say this is a very good event.  They had a parking garage right next door and the parking was under  $10.00 for four hours or less and we all know that is good for Baltimore. ..We parked in the garage that took you straight into the Hotel. The event was held on the upper level and they had two rooms.  One was VIP and the other was where the event was held. They had all types of delightful appetizers and drinks. Two bar areas set up in the  VIP area and another set up st the main event  room.  They had tables available and areas where you could stand and eat as well.  I  must say l was definitely impressed.Now it's time to unwind.  You can bet that's what we did! The reception started at 6:30pm and the main event started a little after  7pm. The music was on point with the Group named Soul Expressions of Richmond VA.  They took it back with some oldies and then played a variety of music that everyone enjoyed.  I also enjoyed every bite of all the appetizers. Omg definitely no complaints at all.. they also had an auction of numerous goodies such as games and events to attend. Everyone there was so nice and was definitely enjoying the event.  We also got a chance to meet others that are diagnosed with the condition of sarcoidosis.  We had a chance to meet the Dr. At John Hopkins who is working to help with the treatment of this condition. I Got a chance to meet some really cool people. Including the main man responsible for making this happen every year. Between the overall event and the dancing and just everything else in general. It was a very enjoyable  four hours.   This definitely was a Success! I would love to attend this next year and give my support.  So Thank you Yelp for making this happen.  l truly do appreciate it!Like every Four Seasons I have stayed at, the service and the amenities of the room were some of the best I have experienced.  Located between the Inner Harbor and Baltimore's Little Italy, it was in a great location.  Parking was available underneath the hotel as either self-serve or via valet at the main lobby doors.  The rooms and public spaces are luxurious and well appointed with great views of either the city or the harbor.  Plenty of restaurants nearby made for easy dining options.  Its expensive and more of a splurge than a routine stay, but what a treat you get for your money!Not a normal spot for me but I couldn't pass up the ""Stay 2 nights, get 3rd night free."" special.  $273/night before taxes was too good a deal.  Great room with an awesome view.I was able to get my company to pay for the stay but I had to make up the difference above the limit. I shouldn't get used to such luxury on business but life could be worse.My hubby and I started a tradition last summer to take a 1 night staycation here each August to enjoy the pool and feel fancy for a day. [Luckily he gets a work discount on the room!]We went this past weekend and it was fabulous, just like last year. You really feel like you are transported to a super posh resort outside of the city. The best part is, it's just a 5 minute drive home the next day feeling refreshed. We checked in at 11 on Saturday, thinking we would get a good spot at the pool, and all of the chairs were already full! We were escorted to the top deck level, which was beautiful, but all in the shade. Wah-wah. We decided to grab lunch at the pool restaurant while we waited. They do have a wait list, and by 12:30 they called our cell and notified us that 2 chairs had opened up. Score!We ordered drinks all day and really enjoyed our time here. The staff pamper you and remember your name. The pool is salt water and overlooks the harbor on one side and downtown on the other. The views are truly breathtaking. We stayed poolside until about 5:30 and then we went to our room and got ready for a dinner date at Wit and Wisdom, the hotel restaurant. I did take off a star because last year when I checked our credit card statement we had an extra charge on there from the Splash Pool bar that was not ours, and it looked like the same thing happened again this weekend! [However, for some reason this time there are just a bunch of pending charges. We should have had 3 charges and there were 7, which scared me! However, once they went through there were only the 3 that we expected, so all is good.] The pool staff are super nice and friendly, but it seems somewhat disorganized there, so check your bank statements accordingly.Enjoying a surprise romantic weekend away.  Who knew I could do that in Baltimore? The hubby did a good job, and I've already been spoiled with an excellent dinner, champagne, and today I'm getting a massage.  The check in was fast, service is excellent, and of course the location is perfect.Not your typical bar to watch football but when you're letting the lady pick the spot, whatcha gonna do?? ..LOL The bar/lounge area properly named (Wit &amp; Wisdom), is what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Modern and down right sexy. The bar menu believe it or not is surprisingly reasonable. We had the wings, jalapeno cheese and bacon dip and tuna tartare. All three were super tasty and highly recommended! I started off with the ""drink of the day"" (can't remember the name) but if you like the Brazilian original Caipirinha you'll love this one. Not quite as sweet as the Caipirinha but just as strong and delicious. Four Seasons drink of the day is only $6 which absolutely cannot beat that! My date who is a walking paradox, runs marathons but loves beer.. Lol Her drink of choice was the Baltimore brewed Heavy Seas ""Peg Leg"", which is super dark like Guiness Stout but way tastier! The bar staff could not have been more friendly or more interactive. They were top notch! So if you're looking for a cool quiet place to watch sports or to have a drink and just talk, this is one impressive bar and your date will definitely give you two thumbs up!My wife and I went up to Baltimore and stayed at the Four Seasons with my in-laws.  We rented a cabana for the day on the 3rd and also attended the Wit and Wisdom party on the 4th.  It was all a great time, and the hotel is a beautiful property, even by Four Seasons standards.  I worked out in the morning and the gym was well equipped; the pool was relaxing, although a bit crowded.  Rooms are beautifully appointed and have some great views of the harbor, especially from the suites. Staff couldn't be nicer. If I could make one recommendation it would be on the food, which was very good (B+), but not great.  The bagel at breakfast was delicious, as was the chocolate croissant, but the brisket at wit and wisdom was fatty, and the fish tacos were heavily fried and greasy.  But these are minor nitpicky things and definitely not enough to detract from a 5 star review.So, I had won tickets to attend Flip Flop Festivus on Friday September 19,2014 at Four Season Hotel. From the time I arrived on the property I was wowed. As we pulled up to valet just to ask a question even though we were not parking valet lets just say we were treated no different. We were given directions to the garage as if we were paying for valet. Parking in the garage was no problem considering we needed a handicap spot. Found on close to the elevator. Great. Stepped off the elevator and exited and went across the street to enter into the hotel. The doorman was pleasant also. Once in we were greeted as if we were millionaires and given directions to where the event was being held. The lobby was just beautiful. Once arriving where the event was being held check in was easy. We were greeted and given appetizers soon as we walked in. The staff here was just amazing. We arrived just after the event begin. We walked around. There was a balcony just off of the event lobby. It was such a beautiful view of the water from the balcony. So relaxing. Went back in to get a drink. I know i going to mess this one up so please forgive me-----The bartender (Seedy) she was located just before you exited to go out on the balcony. She was on point with the drinks. Her selection was great she started me off with a margarita that was just awesome. She was pleasant the entire night and didn't disappoint. Once the presentation begin we were able to get a seat at a table. Inside the room were amazing appetizers. My favorite being the crab mac and cheese. There was fresh salsa, pita, chicken on stick, veggies on a stick, steak on a stick. Ravioli, Meatballs, Salad, and so much more. I got to meet Gheorge Mursean who stands 7ft. 7inches. It was as if everything paused when he entered the room. The band that played and the singer was beyond amazing. It wasn't hard to keep the floor packed. They held a raffle and someone was the luck winner of a stocked wine cooler and gift cards to restaurants in Baltimore. I was able to see survivors of Sarcoidosis. It was just amazing. The also held a auction. This event was live and benefited a great cause. This was a great place to hold this event. I hope that I am able to attend next year. It is on my 2015 list of things to do. Four Season Hotel keep doing what you are doing. No complaints from me.The best Four Seasons property and I have been to many of them. We got a pretty good deal as we were part of a wedding room block. Even with that it was pricey.Valet Parking is $45 compared to self parking at $16. It works out if you have a car and want in and out privileges. As you enter the valets are friendly, helpful and professional. The decor is tranquil, quiet luxury. Even with a bar off the side it is still very quiet. They offer refreshments as you come in and leave. My room was immaculate. Huge closet. Full bath. Overhead shower. I don't know if every room was a suite but mine was without requesting an upgrade and it had a lovely view of the water. Just stunning.  I would like to come back just to stay in the room without having to run around for a wedding.Stayed here over night (Saturday To Sunday) for a wedding. The staff were extremely accommodating. The wedding was held in the hotel and was nothing short of amazing. Bell boy took our bags up to our room offered us water and to even go get ice.  When we returned to our room that evening our bed was turned down, slippers on both sides of the bed, fresh towels.  They even folded our clothes. When we checked out again the staff was incredible and prompt. We will definitely stay here again!!!Staff - Very PleasantRooms - Very SpaciousBar/Restaurant - Wit &amp; Wisdom (in-house) - great drinksSurroundings - Plentiful as in Restaurants, Stores-Retail and there is even a movie theater playing current up-to-date movies and a Starbucks nearbyStay overall - I plan to stay here again (their customer service is on point)Excellent in every way. Room was very well thought out; amenities were excellent. Bathroom roughly same size as a shitty Mandarin we stayed at the following night but much more useable and convenient. Nespresso machines in Four Seasons rooms are all one needs to know in making a luxury hotel choice.One of the beat hotels I ever stayed at! Hotel staff is so helpful and so friendly! Rooms are really nice and  beds are comfortable with nice views.  Personalized greeting on tv nice touch!  Pool and hottub are amazing.  The small things at this hotel make a huge difference- passing out frozen berries at pool, free bottled water, cookies, infused water and turndown service.  The relaxation room in spa is very relaxing. I highly recommend staying at four seasons.  I can't wait to come back!Did not stay here.  Went to the bar..Wit and Wisdom.  Lobby is elegant and gorgeous.  Lots of glass art and lights that are worth walking in to examine.  Location is right on the water.  Great views of federal hill and the harbor.  See my review of Wit and Wisdom.Great hotel, everything is still very new. Staff was great, pool is awesome, vibe is great. Room was perfect, very modern decor and heat in room amenities. The location is right on the harbor and within walking distance of all the tourist related spot as well as Camden. I travel often and this place is top notch. I would recommend it for anyone willing to spend a little extra money. The only downside, and it's a small one, is that the street it is located on can get very congested at times. Once it took 15 minutes for our taxi to travel 2 1/2 blocks.they are great here. Customer service  is amazing! they really went above and beyond to make us happy. This will always be my go to hotel in Baltimore.","Checked in and were told we'd be upgraded to suite but when we arrived at suite there was no balcony as we requested.  Went down to pool while husband got us moved to original too with balcony.  But no chairs at pool so pool hostess said I could eat at he bar only no tables at bar.  Did I mention there aren't any regular chairs at the bar?  Also very mtv spring break vibe going on.  Defeated and starving I figured I could go sit on my balcony only there is only 1 chair to sit on and it is a straight backed chair.  Seriously?  Just sent husband in search of food outside of hotel.  2 hours at this hotel and very disappointed.Worst hotel service I've ever experienced. On the first day I stayed here I had three people knock on my door asking to fluff my pillows. Then for the next 3 days it took 2 and a half hours for room service to bring a bottle of water and over an hour to get fresh towels. Even when we went to the pool by the time we got out the staff had seated someone in out seats on top of all our stuff. How does that even happen??? For the price you pay the service here is completelyTERRIBLE!! I wish I would of booked my stay at the Mariott. I mean a motel6 has quicker  service.The way they have selective treatment at the hotel is very disturbing to me in particular the pool management and some staffWonderful property in a great part of town! The pool is an amazing place to hang during the day. The service can be slow at times especially when the pool is crowded. Otherwise, the service has been good. Also, a great place to take kids!This is by far the best hotels for business travels! Everyone in every department is genuinely nice and makes it an experience when You come to visit. This is a five star hotel for a reason! They have everything you could possibly want! I'd HIGHLY recommend coming here if you have the budget of course.This past weekend I stayed at the Four Seasons in Georgetown for the first time. The experience was just amazing. The Spa and Gym are big but are not like the Ritz Carlton's Equinox where it is a public gym and can be completely packed all the time. The reception area was as expected, beautiful. The aspect that sets the hotel apart vs. others is the service and hospitality. Specifically Michael Chase the Concierge. We had several dilemmas and he took the time to actually help us figure out each one. Michael was able to get us into the best and most desirable restaurants in the city at specific times and with only a few days notice. Even when our stay had concluded he continued to help us figure out our plans for the following weekend. Service like this is the real reason that there is no question in my mind I will stay at the Four Seasons from now on when I am in Washington D.C.When you first look at their prices, it can raise some eyebrows. It is the price of some people's monthly mortgage. However, after your stay here...you realize it was worth every penny. Every detail is scrutinized and perfected. If you are worried about something, they already took care of it... if you forgot something... they already have it coming to your room before you pick up the phone. Sometimes, the bellmen address you by your name as you get out of your car for a more personalized service. It's the finest hotel you can stay in Maryland. While we were waiting to check in, they brought out a red flyer cart full of small plush toys for the baby. While we were leaving, the bellman brought out another toy and two bottles of water for the trip back. It is located close to some limited upscale shopping but close enough to walk to neighboring tourist areas if you don't mind a 15-20 minute stroll.Absolutely fabulous customer service. Extremely professional and courteous staff that does not no the word ""no"". Clearly lives up this hotels reputation.We stayed at the Four Seasons for the July 4th fireworks. We (2 Adults and a 19mo. old boy) showed up earlier than our check in time and had no problems getting our room.  We received complimentary cake lollipops for our son after mentioning it would be his first time seeing fireworks.  The valet were extremely helpful and attentive to my requests,  Greg from the front was particularly nice to my family and even found us while eating to give my son a stuffed animal.  I requested a late check out so I can enjoy the pool and Brunch at Wisdom &amp; Wit (another review but in short - fantastic).  The pool bar and infinity pool overlook the harbor and quite relaxing although very small and you want to show up early for ""premier"" seats.  I typically try to stay at 4-5 star hotels and this one is the very reason why, Although the Marriot and Pier 5 are within 3-5min of a walk away and also very suitable (location wise);  I believe the service you will receive here at this Four Seasons is second to none.  It is a 7 minute walk to the Aquarium. 4 minute walk to a Whole Foods. 1-7 minute walk to all sort of restaurants.  We ate at Wisom &amp; WIt, McCormick and Schmick's, and the Aquarium Grill)Oh.... the pillows are very thin on the bed and needed to be doubled up if you're like me and like them a bit firmer.This  hotel was amazing. We absolutely loved our room the service and the professionalism of the staff.   I was treated to a weekend getaway for my birthday from my wife and well worth the surprise. The room was immaculate. The bathroom was amazing separate shower and bath and water closet. It had marble throughout and a  in the bathroom mirror. The closet space allowed for garment bags and suitcases with a privacy light  so as not to disturb other sleeping guests. The view was impeccable. We stayed on the top floor and had a view of the entire harbor. The technology that was vested into just this one room was above and beyond. There were no Do Not Disturb signs but simply a button to push at your bedside that  on a red light at your door that relayed to the staff to not intrude. We enjoyed every moment of our stay.The surgeon I work for surprised myself, his wife and 4 other women in our office with a spa day and I must say it was the best surprise I've ever had. As soon as we pulled up we received complementary valet for being a spa guest. We arrived at the spa and there they were greeting our party by name as soon as we walked in. We loved the relaxation room. After a dip in the jacuzzi I had a cup of cucumber water and could fall asleep to the beautiful view overlooking the harbor. The robe and slippers were also so comfortable. My massage was amazing. I've never had a male masseuse but he was very professional and gentle as I requested my massage on the light to medium side. By far the best massage I've ever had and I get them on a monthly basis. We then had a great lunch at Wit and Wisdome. The grilled shrimp salad was delicious. The shrimp were large and so flavorful. Everyone in our party enjoyed their lunch. All in all we were there for about 5 hours and had an amazing time. I would have stayed all day if able! Thank you for pampering us and making our day one we won't forget!The hotel is beautiful,  the bed is comfortable. The amenities in room are not up to expectations for a four seasons hotel. Arriving late, check in was smooth  the desk very friendly and courteous. The room was very clean and neat - aside from one not so clean ""rag"" left at the side of the bed. The problems began the next morning. At some point the television switched it self on to the menu of hotel services. No big deal.   I awoke around 4:45 to find that the television channels were not available -  when you attempt to change channels the TV would reboot for lack of a better word.  Being so early and the fact that I was planning on an early start I did not want to deal with maintenance at this point.  So I just moved on. The Nespresso machine was the next issue.  Choosing to make a short coffee  I was unpleasantly surprised by the fact the water would not stop on its own and I needed to pull the plug out of the wall  to make it stop.Sadly, when checking out shortly l afterwards, no offer of any sort of compensation (I.e. discount on current or future visit, or even a voucher for a free coffee at the coffee bar on the premises).In short, it's one of the nicest looking hotel in the area and if everything worked properly would have been a great stay, but the high prices don't equate to the actual expectations of a flawless experience.Would absolutely recommend staying here.Oh yeah, this place is NICE. We have stayed here a few times as special treats...it exceeded our lofty expectations each time. It's not  a picnic traveling with a two year old...however, this place has made her feel special each and every time. I made advance arrangements for a feather-free room, crib and fridge (careful...rooms come with refreshment sensors with built-in sensors which charge you if you even jostle them). Even though I am a Marriott Platinum Elite member, they NEVER get my advance requests right, even though they are saved in my profile. But at this hotel, not only was everything perfect, they even set up the crib with baby supplies (moisturizer, baby oil, diaper, wipes, etc) and a little stuffed animal. They even pulled out a wagon at check-in to let her pick out another stuffed animal (she got a jellyfish and stingray this time, crab in the past). There was a welcome cookie in the shape of a crab, and two pails of Parmesan popcorn and cokes to welcome us as well. Wow.On top of this, the service was refreshingly friendly and efficient...no attitudes or snottiness even though we were dressed like bums. Carmen at the front desk, Garrett the parking valet, and Greg the bellman were all standouts. The room was amazing...stunning water views  and attractive modern decor which was elegant and luxurious (in direct contrast to the modern decor at W hotels which is uncomfortable with poor function). The  down alternative duvets and pillows were impossibly soft and fluffy...I've never slept on a more comfortable bed in my life...unfortunately, it has ruined all other beds for me.If I were to nitpick some things (and I always do), I was somewhat surprised, considering the relative newness of the hotel, that some things were falling apart. The heavy glass door to the water closet was missing one hinge such that the door torqued when closing...and a wall hook for the luxurious robes fell off the wall. Finally, turndown service was hit or miss...sometimes no music, no slippers, and never any chocolates. These were minor issues, though, as we felt pampered and were oh so appreciative of our treatment. The location in the newly developed East harbor was fantastic. I can't wait to come back!Everything here was perfect. From the valets and porters, to the front desk, to the room itself, we felt welcome and comfortable at every point. Very friendly and unpretentious. Gorgeous room, comfortable bed. The bathroom has a rain shower, a TV in the mirror, and a phone next to the toilet. Robes, safe, L'Occitane toiletries... they thought of everything. Great location, too: Easy walk to the National Aquarium and the rest of the Inner Harbor, and all the bars and restaurants around Harbor East. Highly recommended.guest accommodation is definitely a 5! =) This is my first time visiting Four seasons for an event. I got a quick tour of the fitness and spa/pool area and I""m already convinced that I will love this place if I had the opportunity to stay overnight.Employees make effort to be extra friendly and helpful.  I had a great experience with the PR rep AND the front lobby reps. I parked in their garage thinking that the odds of getting my parking pass validated would be easier if I went with valet parking. Wrong! The parking garage is through the city so makes validation difficult since it has no direct affiliation with the hotel.  I told the PR rep my situation and explained to me the situation and that I may have to pay for it but she went ahead and signed my pass hoping that it would help. I took my question to the front desk rep and an [attractive] gentleman appeared out of no where and offered me the validation pass. The entire team seemed to be on point to ensuring guest is satisfied and indeed I was.Four Seasons Baltimore CongratsFor all you worldly people no this location can not hold a flame to ATL or Bora Bora but its a step in the correct direction for Baltimore. When I arrived at the hotel the valet was beyond courteous and attended to my needs like a mother &amp; a newborn. Once I told them I was there for a massage valet immediately mentioned valet was free as a result of my scheduled spa services. Once out of the car I received full instructions on how to reach the spa. I stopped past the concierge desk to first inquire on my upcoming stay. The desk attendant was polite and appeared to have some interest in why was I staying, business, play? I advised her that my future stay is for my birthday however r today I was having a maternity massage. OMG she was elated as if she were expecting. I adjourned to the spa- where I was greeted with fresh water with lime slices. Once in the back the attendant quickly ran through the locker and relaxation area. I was not rushed but she had to get all the information out including showing me that awesome pool they have been hiding -yummy.Pregnant brain forgot the name of the masseuse but not his hands. He rubbed my muscles with just enough pressure. Very patient with the changing of positions (unlike my husband)during the massage. All in all I have to say the Spa alone was out of this world. Can not wait to go backI come here for all my business trips and I love the four seasons. How can you not??? It's got the best of everything. I love their bed and everything about it. I sleep like a baby when I'm there. I can't wait to go back again!Awesome porters, front desk crew and staff. Great comfortable rooms. TV in mirror in the bathroom, great waterfall shower. Very comfortable bed and amazing views.  TV didn't work but after a tech came a couple of times it worked fine.  Only bad thing was the food. The food staff was great, but understaffed and poorly managed. Had lunch outside by the pool and waited about an hour and a half for simple meals.  Wasn't the waitstaff fault, but you could tell they were running around aimlessly.  Plus the food was disappointing. Even room service late at night was pretty awful. Overall a good hotel. Impressive roomsStaff was great and everything was on oar with price. I would recommend. Location is great also.","Extremely nice hotel, but verrry pricey. We booked a hotel package so luckily our parking was free because valet prices are crazy. They greet you right when you walk in and walk you over to the front desk.  This hotel is also PET FRIENDLY for dogs under 25lbs which is amazing.. and you don't have to pay an extra fee. They even offered to send up a dog bed and food bowls for my dog which she loved!  The partial water view room was HUGE.  It had a huge king size bed and a living room area. The bathroom is also massive with double sinks and the best part about it...there is a built in tv in your mirror with surround sound. Its amazing. I also am a big fan of hotels that have turn down service included. Its so nice to come back to your room and have it clean before you go to bed. We would definitely come back again for a special occasion.Let me start by saying the stay was very regular.I expected a little more the room was nice and I loves the tv in the mirror it's no Andaz or Ritz Carlton.The breakfast gave me the runs.My man and I stayed for just one night and I left all my makeup products and my makeup bag at least 600.00 or more worth of makeup.The first time I called the lost and found and the lady that pick up was a jerk.So after crying and throwing a tantrum speaking with my sister she was like you need to get manaGment in the line.I called back and the Manager Derrick Lockhart found it and shipped it to me the next day.Im very appreciative that it was returned and un touch.So I'm giving him a 4 star the hotel it's self is about a 3 The food and the lack of hospitality is why I rate this place so low.Besides that it would've gotten a 5My favorite hotel in Baltimore. Bar none! Stayed for one night to have birthday celebration dinner with my special someone. Top class service is apparent when the hotel staff helping bring the luggage calls us by our last name. Also upon walking in to our rooms you see your names being welcomed in the big screen tv.Walked out of the room to have dinner at Roy's and upon coming back there was a small cake waiting in our room with happy birthday sprinkled all over the plate it was served in. Been to a few fancy hotels but the service and the room of this 4 Season definitely ranks among the best hotels that I've been in. Too bad it was still too cold to be enjoying the outdoor infinity pool overlooking the inner harbor.This is definitely a better 4 Seasons than the one in DC since its newer and located in a quieter part of town. I love everything about this place. Will definitely be my go to hotel when in Baltimore.I have hosted my wedding here, been here on spa date, and dinner and every single time I get the same results.... WORLD CLASS CUSTOMER SERVICE.  From being greeted and remember by the valets and front desk staff, to the service I have received from every aspect of their service.  If you are every planning an event, call Martha and Natalie in Sales.We were here for the Sarcoidosis Charity Benefit Flip Flop Festivus. This review is only for the actual Four Seasons, not that event (which was wonderful). Overall this is a nice Four Seasons hotel, typical of the chain. Luxury and class and bit of pompousness which I like. We had a second floor ballroom with a private lobby area. The best part here was the balconies on the back of the lobby area right outside of the ballroom. They overlooked the water right above Pier Six. It was beautiful up there and the ballroom was equally well maintained. The food was relatively good, with some stations set up and roving waiters with appetizers. The panko crusted mac and cheese was a crowd favorite. My only real complaint here was the bar service. It was open bar and we tipped appropriately however after three drinks in the course of almost two hours for me and my girlfriend, the bartender said we were a bit intoxicated and needed to slow down. I know my limit and also wasn't driving that evening, as we choose not to risk it. While I respect the bartender keeping patrons safe and not letting drunk people be overserved, it seemed to be a more of a ""I want to save the house liqour and not serve anymore"" more than a ""Let's keep people safe.""We SO enjoyed our stay at this Four Seasons- they made our romantic getaway weekend celebrating an anniversary especially memorable with 5-star service and expert attentiveness.  I must commend Preston Rooks, a Les Clefs d'Or Concierge and Trey, for their help and feedback on Mister's restaurant choices, reservations and guidance on what not to miss whilst in Baltimore.Our corner room was spacious, comfortable and so FAB, it was hard to leave every morning.  I loved the shower and TV within the bathroom mirror (I MUST have this in my bathroom).  Our King bed was AMAZING.Working out in their immaculate gym made me feel toned and fit- what a posh place. We'll definitely return to Baltimore and to this Four Seasons.One of the nicest hotels I've ever been in. The TV in the bathroom mirror is incredible. What truly makes this hotel special is the staff. Everyone looked you in the eye and greeted you. The people at the doors always rushed to open them. And when I brought up Baltimore the staff lighted up with positive remarks about their city. It's a great place to visit!We switched hotels to the Four Seasons after a terrible experience right next door. They completely saved our trip and brightened our day. There was even a little bag of candy saying ""we hope your weekend gets better!"" when we got to our room. Best hotel experience ever!I am here for a business trip and glad I came across this hotel as others close to my work were booked.  It is a beautiful hotel and service is great.  The staff goes out if their way to please you. It has amazing views and restaurants and shops are just footsteps away.  Great place !!!Everything about the Four Seasons Baltimore is superlative.  I loved the beautiful room with a sweeping view of the harbor and a balcony.  Enough good things cannot be said about the staff, who were without exception friendly, responsive, thoughtful, and welcoming.  I travel extensively and have been fortunate to stay in many wonderful hotels.  The Four Seasons Baltimore will always be at the top my list.  I cannot wait to find the next reason for being in Baltimore.  Oh, wait, I just did -- the Four Seasons!I have been to Baltimore, MD twice with my girlfriend in the past year or so and both times stayed at this hotel.  Both times we had a pleasant experience at this hotel from the courtesy of the staff to the quality of the rooms.  The first time we had a city view room which was nice but the harbor view room the second time was definitely better.  My only complaint was that the pool's bar was located outside our corner room so it blocked half of our view of the harbor.  The valet here is good as well as the self parking garage.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning to stay in Baltimore.Exquisite service, lovely accommodations, very costly food and drink but oh so worth it.THE BADCell reception in the hotel is just horrible. Not very conducive for business which is highly unexpected for a new hotel. I heard multiple people at the meeting which I attended complaining about it on multiple devices and networks. Also, the tap key card lock in the elevator is cumbersome. I missed my floor 4 times trying to get the card to allow me to select my floor. I get the security, but the same method is used on the doors at the rooms. How much security do you need?THE GOODIconic lobby and uber-friendly staff. Kelli at the front desk is cute and awesome! The rooms are HUGE and the bathrooms are the best. 2 headed shower options, in-mirror TV. Could not be better. They also do 2 days of free Wi-Fi which helped with the reception issue.The gym facility is huge and has tons of options. The pool deck is ideal with a view of the bay complete with a bar and infinity pool. Awesomely designed.Overall I'd say this is a great hotel. Can't go wrong with brand new.This is a fabulous hotel with impeccable service.  We arrived at 1:00 PM and went to the pool while our room was getting ready.  Upon arrival to the pool you are transported to a vacation.  There is a wonderful bar/restaurant, an infinity pool, a reflecting pool, hot tub, and amazing views.   Children are permitted but clearly discouraged.  They had music going, but it was not oppressively loud.  We ended up staying at the pool for several hours talking and people watching.  It was clearly a ""scene.""  I then received a call that our room was ready and that our bags had already been brought up.  The room was spacious and modern.  We had dinner at Wit and Wisdom.  The food was spectacular and I highly recommend the lobster pot pie.  Spend the extra money and stay here!!Maybe I'm just used to the Best Western, but this place was amazing.First of all, the staff is there to please. I needed a little space for a small ceremony because the weather outside was looking questionnable, and they hooked me right up. The icebuckets are filled in the room when you arrive. When you turn on the TV, it greats you by name. We checked our bags with the bellhops while we went to the pool, and they took the extra step of taking the leftover cake we had from the ceremony and putting it in their roomservice fridge. The bed was comfortable, the roomservice food was delicious, the view was great, etc, etc, etc.The pool is amazing. Staff members are constantly refilling water glasses and when you get out of the pool, there was always a fresh towel waiting for us.If you can swing it financially, you and your significant other should do their romanting getaway package.WOW, that's all I could say as I entered my room and glared at the television while it said ""Welcome Mr. Adams and Happy Birthday Leah!"" I was there to celebrate my girlfriend's 30'th birthday and it was probably one of the best experiences I have ever had. Special occasion or not, this place knows how to treat people from start to finish. From the moment I entered the hotel, I was royalty. Great staff, great location, amazing rooms with phenomenal views. Pay the $500/night it costs and be prepared to experience luxury.The Four Seasons is pricey however, it is pretty much as good as it gets. The staff is very polite and helpful. The rooms are very elegant and comfortable. Most of them have a great view. The pool is awesome. I stayed for a weekend and planned on going out and seeing the city however I could not get away from the saltwater pool with beautiful views and fantastic service.Again this hotel is pretty pricey however you get what you pay for.This place is amazing!  An oasis within the inner harbor!!!!!If I am ever staying overnight in Baltimore again it will definitely be at the four seasons! The hotel staff was amazing ... friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. My wife and I stayed in one of their suites, and it had the most amazing view of the harbor I have ever seen. I think the guy at the front desk said something like 80% of their rooms have harbor views! The restaurant wait staff was great; attentive without being overbearing. The Sommeliers were able to pair up our meal with excellent selections from start to finish. The bartenders there are world class (mixing different herbaceous ingredients to make tasty cocktails) and friendly.Bottom line is ... if you have the scratch to spend, I highly recommend the Four Seasons Baltimore.I got married here in the end of April. Simply impeccable service from beginning to end. My family, guests, husband and I were treated so incredibly well and all of our needs were attended to. A special shout out to Martha Morningstar, who made our event an incredible success.","I really love this hotel. There isn't much to say about it that hasn't been said in other reviews. Fantastic location, fantastic rooms, fantastic staff. Check in was fast and easy, they were even able to accommodate us when we arrived early. We chose to self park instead of valet which was easy and convenient since valet was almost $60 for one night but it's to be expected coming from such an upscale hotel. I will definitely be returning to the Four Seasons.Really great area to stay while in Baltimore. Some shopping, but plenty of restaurants and 4 blocks from the Italian area if you want great food.Like every other 4 seasons I've stayed at the staff is trained very well, the rooms have great appointments and the bed was very comfortable.Some people have mentioned the poor cell reception in the hotel, and yes it was not great.If you love coffee, then you have to try the Lamill coffee from California. Even the decaf tastes like the real thing, and they have wonderful pastries. The staff there was as friendly as the hotel staff. Not so with the Michaell Mina bar and restaurant.Better places you can walk to for a glass or wine or cocktail, and with better service.Wish the hotel would take over that part so it would on a par with everything else the 4 Seasons does.Stayed here September 16-20 for the first time visiting from Seattle. The hotel was as nice as expected and we enjoyed our time here, for the most part. First, I will say what I liked and then what was not so great.What I liked:-Beautiful lobby, fully-stocked gym with a nice view, great spa with amenties available to any guest (manicurist was friendly and did a nice job), lovely room (floor plan and decor), fantastic Michael Mina restaurant.What ruined our stay:-The bed. Simply put, it was horribly uncomfortable. I can't say it enough, I was confused and unhappily surprised the entire time and how uncomfortable the bed was. My boyfriend and I kept wondering if maybe room service forgot to put the mattress pad on because there's no way such a nice hotel would have such a hard bed. It was like sleeping on wood. Mind you, we stayed in one of the executive suites, so it was an above average room in the hotel, which further made it confusing to us. My shoulder started hurting after our second night and was sore for a few days. Finally, on our last night I decided to bring it to the concierge's attention and he seemed utterly perplexed by my mention of the bed. About ten minutes after getting back to our room the phone rang, it was the concierge, and he said a bellhop was on his way up to bring something that would make it more comfortable. The guy showed up with a down comforter with no cover. We put it on the bed and tried to lay on it, but immediately jumped off because of the prickly feathers that were sticking out of it. In the end, I turned my big pillow to lay vertically and slept on the pillow the rest of the night. Sadly, I don't think we will choose Four Seasons again after this experience. A comfortable bed is one of the most important features of a hotel, especially when you are on vacation looking to relax. The beauty of the hotel did not outweigh the discomfort of the bed.I was in town for a meeting at this hotel.  It's fairly new and everything seemed like it was running smoothly.  The staff was fantastic, from the time I arrived at the valet all the way to check out.  It's what you expect from a Four Seasons, but I still noticed.  My room was great.  Spacious and clean with a great view of the harbor.It's a beautiful place, top-notch service, great location. On a rainy day, you can sit in the bar/restaurant area on some comfy chairs and look out the windows at the harbor. What more can you ask? Well, this review would have had more stars if, as I was writing a couple of Yelp reviews in my room after lunch, a maid hadn't opened the door to my room without knocking. WHAT? When does staff enter a hotel room without knocking? Besides that, a great place.Awesome hotel! Spent our first night here after we got married. Room was well portioned, there's a TV in the bathroom and service was impeccable. We told the bellboy we just got married. Next thing we know, when we came back after dinner, they were sending us a bottle of proseco and a plate of cake &amp; chocolates! We ordered breakfast to be delivered to our room tomorrow and again the staff was very pleasant, food was delicious. Valet parking is very expensive (I think it cost us $40 for 1 night) which is expected from this establishment. The hotel itself is not as fancy as some other Four Seasons I've been to but is very elegantly decorated. We didn't use the restaurant, spa, gym/ pool, etc so cannot really comment on that. Highly recommend this place for special occasions in the area.The hotel is gorgeous, but the service is not where it should be yet. I was there for a conference and there was drilling and construction noise that could be heard throughout the day. Getting ice took 3 phone calls and an hour and a half. There are 2 mediocre beers available at the bar. Parking is $40/night.No seriously, this place is the REAL DEAL. Elegant without being over the top, attentive but not tip grubbing. The beds are wonderful, as are the views from the rooms. The spa is worth visiting if only for the steam room, the sauna, and the ludicrously soft bathrobes. The cafe coffee is responsibly sourced and the baristas are as knowledgable as people who make their professions in coffee should be. The whole experience was just wonderful; totally luxurious without the feeling of total extravagance or tacky excess. I hoped to go back one day (when I have the dough...)First, a truly stunning hotel right on the Inner Harbor and in the heart of the scene in Inner Habor East.  Having stayed often a Four Seasons Hotels I was very disappointed in the bar service.  The bartenders appeared very disorganized, took quite awhile to get served, and an indifferent attitude toward guests.  There are better alternatives nearby.Just spent 7 weeks at the Four Seasons Baltimore while my DH was being treated at Johns Hopkins.  With all the stress we were under, the staff did everything in their power to make our stay as easy and welcoming as possible, and they fully succeeded.  They made us feel like part of their family.The staff is responsive to every request, and no request is too small or big.  We were delighted with our stay.This Four Seasons has amazing customer service and provides guests with a luxurious, comfortable stay. The hotel itself is inspired by Asian interior design is beautifully located right in the Inner Harbor. Many of the rooms have views looking out over the harbor. I highly recommend the spa as well. Whether you're on business for a night or looking for a romantic getaway, I cannot speak highly enough of this Four Seasons.An unbelievable experience with all the luxury you could ask for.  The service is amazing.  The rooms are topnotch; basically an upscale apartment.  Every detail has been thought of.  Harbor East is a very nice area as well.I stayed for the Yankees - Orioles series and had a terrific time at this hotel.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to treat themselves when staying in Charm City.Staff very nice, views of Harbor exceptional.",,"['beautiful', 'hotel', 'stays', 'definitely', 'top', 'class',
