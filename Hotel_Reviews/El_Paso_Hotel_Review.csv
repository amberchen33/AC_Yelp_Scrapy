http://www.yelp.com/biz/chase-suite-hotel-el-paso,Chase Suite Hotel,3.5,$$,15,"We relocated to El Paso and someone recommended this place. I sure em glad we listened. This place made this transition so so easy. From they're front desk customer service to the housekeepers and all the staff were friendly. The rooms are spacious, we were in a two bedroom suite with a mini living room and kitchen, the family enjoyed the space, we weren't cramped at all ...  The breakfast and light dinner made it very affordable for a family of four. Oh and let's not forget that they are pet friendly at $10 a night!!!!!!!! All in all I highly recommend this place.Old reviews and pictures for Chase Suite Hotel made me a little weary about a stay here, but my boyfriend and I won a night here and they said it was in their newly renovated rooms so I was all on board.We made it to CSH shortly after check-in started and I was helped as soon as I walked in the door. In just a couple of seconds I had two key cards and a map. We drove over towards our building and realized we wouldn't be able to park in front of our actual building, but on the side of a different one. I will say there is adequate parking for the lot though. If you actually had a lot of luggage that you needed to haul to your suite, you can pull on to a tiny road they have that follows the back of the lot and unload.The renovations are great! As far as I could tell, they're not done with all the rooms so you could end up in a room that has yet to be redone. The outside of the buildings looked like they needed some renovations too, but nothing crazy... just a new coat of paint.Our room was pretty nice and they did a great job of sectioning off the ""bedroom"" from the ""living room"" and kitchen. The bed was a king sized, clean, and adorned with down pillows... just the way I like it. The kitchen was equipped with all the plates, glasses, silverware, and utensils we could need as well as a new stove, dishwasher, microwave, full-sized fridge, and two bar stools at the oversized counter. My only gripe about the whole room is that the drawers in the kitchen aren't on a track. I nearly dropped all of the silverware on the floor. The ""living room"" is a small sitting area in front of the fireplace. Nice! I really liked the bathroom and it looked like they redid the floor as well.I didn't try out their wi-fi because who uses their phones and laptops during a staycation? But I do know that it's available and they give you the password as soon as you check in. As far as the rest of the amenities go, they have two pools, a jacuzzi, a Continental breakfast in the morning, complimentary happy hour on Monday-Thursday, and free access to the nearest Planet Fitness (about six miles away).Out of all the amenities we did try out the Continental breakfast. Unfortunately, this, I wasn't impressed by. They had a good variety of choices... four cereal options, yogurt, bagels, bread, orange juice, coffee, tea, scrambled eggs, and potatoes. I didn't try the scrambled eggs, but the potatoes were cold. The flow was good, but it honestly just felt like the staff put the least amount of effort towards the breakfast and morning experience. There was one lady that was standing behind the counter the whole time doing a crossword and she would occasionally look up and say ""good morning"" only to return to her crossword again and never engage in conversation with those standing only inches away from her waiting for their toast to be done. She actually didn't come across as that friendly either. At one point my boyfriend went to get a bagel and the tongs had disappeared (someone had put them inside the bread case on the bottom shelf... not easy to see if you don't bend over) and she started yelling at him. I understand using tongs, but clearly he wasn't aware there were tongs and there was absolutely no reason to yell. A man came over (possibly a manager) and placed tongs on top of the handle (doesn't really seem like a good place for tongs) and within minutes they had disappeared again. I think the breakfast staff could've been a lot more welcoming and involved with those staying at the hotel. Would've been nice for them to ask how our stay was while I was waiting for a bagel or start some small talk or give me some insider scoop about the El Paso area (hey, they don't know I live here). It wouldn't deter me from staying here again, but it also doesn't entice me.I've checked the prices for these suites and they're doable. A night is less than $100. It isn't fancy, but this is a good hotel for someone who is planning on being in the area for a bit because of the amenities in the room. Instead of going out to eat for every single meal, you can cook in your room. And I mean actually cook, none of that microwaved TV dinner stuff. Overall, a good hotel with wonderful renovations done! I'd stay here again for another EP staycation.My gf and I were excited to have won a 1 day stay at this hotel by liking their Facebook page. I had stayed there previously a few years ago and was not impressed the first time there. Well its free and we needed a Staycation so we jumped on it. The hotel was promoting their newly renovated units so I was hopeful. Check in seemed very quick and off we go... first impression was the parking. Parking was only located on one side of the complex so we had to walk past a few building to get to building 18. On the way there.....I was concerned because I could see numerous repairs needed on the buildings leading to building 18. Did I mention I am a facility expert? Nonetheless, the repairs would be obvious to anyone. Upon our arrival to unit 1823, I was happy to see new paint and the exterior of the building in order and suggesting that improvement were made. Once inside, we were happily surprised. Everything had been redone and done so with good taste. The kitchen, bath, living room and bedroom was all modern and upgraded. It was very comfortable. They are definitely on the right track. We slept great! The next morning we decide to enjoy the complimentary continental breakfast to guage the full experience. It was typical with eggs and potatoes, juice or coffee, and some cereal or bagels. I was hoping for some meat on the menu or a way to order something but not happening. There were two personnel working their but seemed preoccupied with their crossword puzzle to greet visitors and make them feel comfortable. At one point I attempted to get a bagel and the tongs were missing. I opened the bagel door and surgically removed a bagel ensuring not to touch others. This is when the woman (employee) looked over and in a louder than required  fashion stated, ""use the utensil"". I was a bit embarrassed but explained that they were not there. She should have given me the benefit of the doubt. She then located some and placed them on the door. The next person used them and when complete laid them inside on the food. She didn't correct him although she was right there. I couldn't help thinking that my method was more sanitary. Why use the tongs if you just going to lay the handle on the food. She does need to work on being friendly and courteous. The overall experience was really good but as a disclaimer....only building 15 and 18 seemed to be complete. Hate for you to visit and not get the same experience. I hope they keep going with the renovations.Absolutely terrible, could not be worse!! Old, run down, and disgustingly dirty. Think I'm exaggerating??? See the pictures I posted (eg., hair on bed, dirty coffee mugs, cigarette burned counter in supposed non-smoking room). We ended up demanding a refund and going elsewhere. Disgusting!!I reserved my room for work purposes over a month in advance. Upon arriving around 5:00 pm to check in, I was informed they were waiting for me to arrive. I was informed there was no room available, as there was a gas leak. I understand these things happen and head towards the other hotel where they reserved a room for me. However, I'm a little agitated they did not call to let me know I could not check in. Upon arriving to the second hotel, the outside is not attractive as it has rusty doors and yellow caution tape around the pool. The next day, I was called and asked if I would return. I explained I would because the hotel chosen for me was not comparable. Thinking I was complementing them, they thanked me. I proceeded to explain it was not a compliment. I was upset. Upon arriving at the hotel to check in I voiced my disapproval again. I was told it was out of their control and sent to a room which reeks of smoke, is old and out dated, and dingy at best.The shower tub does not drain and the curtain floats in the water. After digging through towels, I managed to find one without hair on it. The floor was soaked, be sure to put a towel down. The hand towels were covered in black marks. Just awful. Since I have left I have contacted the office 3 times asking for proof that I was sent to another hotel, as I need it for my work records. It still has not arrived...3 days later and a call each day.I was VERY disappointed with my entire interaction with this hotel. I had booked and confirmed eight rooms for a basketball tournament. All eight rooms were secured with a credit card and I had a confirmation number for each room.  3 days before check in, I was told that they could no longer accommodate us, other guests had decided to extend their stay. As most other rooms that would accommodate families in the area were already booked with such late notice, I was forced to try to work with Chase Hotel.  Of the eight rooms that I had confirmed, they were only able to give us 4.  We were offered rooms smaller than those booked and confirmed, requiring families to split up.  Several families found other accommodations so we reluctantly accepted the rooms.  After checking in, we found the hotel to be extremely dilapidated.  Each of the 6 rooms had a sofa that was so disgusting that it had to be covered with a blanket before one would sit on it.  Coffee makers were missing carafes, drawers were missing, counters peeling, doors would not close and everything was just generally run down.  Despite having to sign an agreement for each room about noise levels, one patron outside of our group was playing music well into the night and yelling to his friends.  Repeated calls to the front desk did not stop the noise.  Dog excrement lined the sidewalks and was not cleaned the entire three days of our stay.  The front desk clerks were friendly and helpful with directions but the management was rude in dealing with cancelling confirmed reservations.  They did not respond to repeated phone calls or emails and were generally unprofessional.  With the number of hotels in this direct area, save a few dollars and go to a hotel that is clean, not falling down and treats a customer fairly.If it had a better breakfast, it might be 5 stars.  The room is big, the TV is nice, it has a full kitchen and a spacious bathroom.  It's nicer and better equipped than my apartment in CA!  Hands down my first choice for a long stay in El Paso.On my way to Austin from San Diego I needed to stop and rest for the night and I decided to stay at the Chase Suite Hotel. My room was spacious, clean and relaxing with a full kitchen, a fireplace, living room area and large restroom. The hotel was clean and quite with friendly staff. I would highly recommend for anyone to stay here and will be staying here again the next time I drive to California from Texas. The whole process was effortless and a great value when you compare the competition which were priced $50 to $80 more per night.I don't know what the bad reviews are about. I was actually nervous because of  them.Yes the place is a little old but this is a great place!They picked me up from the airport. I got my own studio apartment. Very clean. Fully furnished. The kitchen is completely stocked. I needed to go to the mall, and they drove me there and picked me up.They also do complimentary breakfast and dinner. I mean hello! Where elese do you get all that?The staff is very helpful and there's a little community here. I think people stay here for long terms of times and I see why.The place is pretty good for the price. A nice studio, full kitchen, sofa bed,comfy bed. If i was with family id come here. Theres a nice pool right outside my suite. I just fell in love how the small space was set up to be everything you would need. Very friendly staff.This place is very nice. Couch, kitchen with dishes and cooking pans, flat screen tv, very comfortable bed. Excellent customer service. I locked my room card in my room on accident and they had no problem giving me another. Make this your place to stay if you're in el paso, texas.This is a very nice place with awesome customer service. We are military and moving here. We stayed with them for over a month and they helped us out many times. We got a great deal and they even saved us the tax in the bill. They also have free breakfast and dinner during the week. The food is pretty good and helpful when your out house hunting. I would highly recommend staying here if your military and have a family. They have 2 bedrooms and kitchen and living rooms...it was awesome!!Being pregnant I'm highly sensitive to smells (not saying they smelled bad, but chemicals give me headaches) and the hotel receptionist was very understanding and let me try out four hotel rooms till I was satisfied. I highly recommend dealing with Victoria S. she went above and beyond what one would expect; a diamond in the rough.First room they give me had a leaking roof, switched us to a new room . The new room had the entire carpet soaked from the water heater . To top it off, sheets were stained and towels had urine stains on them. This place is getting run down with the ghetto contract workers that stay there for extended periods. Our neighbor was out until 4 am drinking/ smoking  and yelling on the phone at 4am. Beer bottles everywhere , disgusting !  Mario the manager was very apologetic and offered to get me a new room. Save your money, and time . Stay elsewhereThe place is a little old, but the facility an accommodations  was well worth the price. Stayed for 11 days, breakfast and dinner was included. Place has two pools and grills are provided for residents to use.",,,,,"['relocated', 'someone', 'recommended', 'place', 'sure', 'glad', 'listened', 'place', 'made', 'transition', 'easy', 'front',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hawthorn-suites-by-wyndham-el-paso-el-paso,Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham El Paso,2.5,$$,19,"We had a family event and had a good experience.  The rooms are nice, size is average, breakfast was hearty and is remodeled nicely.  Only thing i would say that if you do leave your room late morning, be sure to call lobby to let them know your room is free to be cleaned.  We left late one day and it didn't get cleaned.  Not a big deal, just called and they came and did it.  Extremely close to airport so made it nice to not have to drive after 2 long flights.  Would stay here again.Not looking forward to my stay, but I may update this review after I check-out.  My reservation was booked from a third party and my room is the ""standard"" room given for that reason.  I am on the side that doesn't look like it was recently renovated.  I understood that I would have a kitchenette inside the room, like in the photos online; ""No, sorry that costs extra."" Though the bathroom counter space is the same as the photo online.  Adding some shelving would be helpful, especially for stays over a week at a time.  On the flip side: I am looking forward to the warm breakfast in the morning and the woman that checked me in seemed nice.The lady at the front desk was nice but for this hotel having been newly renovated... the sink was cracked, the carpet wasn't the cleanest, the wallpaper was coming off the walls and there was a huge, dead cockaroach in the doorway of the woman's restroom in the lobby.FUCK THIS PLACE AND IT'S SHITTY EMPLOYEES!I travel for work, I'm constantly on the road going from hotel to hotel, city to city, and it's always ideal to find a hotel with a laundry room. So I go downstairs to get quarters the lady gives me five bucks in quarters, half of the $10 roll that they come in. I do my laundry, but the shitty washing machines don't wash my clothes properly so I have to use more money to do it again, then I go downstairs to ask for more quarters to dry my clothes and the same cunt who gave me quarters the first time gives me this stupid look and tells me no, she's all out of quarters, and proceeds to tell me that there is no manager on site to help me. Instead of making an executive decision to help one of their customers, the dumb bitch is all shoulders, I ask her what she suggest I should do with all my wet clothes, again all shoulders. She apologizes but her fucking apologies are not going to dry my clothes. Fuck that Ellen DeGeneres looking bitch.I wish I would have read these reviews first. I actually picked this hotel over another because it's a Wyndham. HUGE MISTAKEI booked on orbitz and arrived after an 8 hour drive. I had the confirmation, but they couldn't find the reservation. Orbitz called, tried to fax and email them 3 times and the hotel didn't receive it. Orbitz refunded me and the girl at the desk offered a slightly cheaper rate due to the inconvenience of waiting over 30 mins. Unfortunately, her manager has no idea what the hospitality business is about. He kept talking to her under his breath about me until I called him out and asked if there was an issue. I handed him my temporary debit card (mine had a fraudulent charge so I was waiting on it to be mailed) &amp; he wouldnt run it because it didnt say my name. He got HIS manager who was also arguing but finally ran the card. He asks me to sign the receipt but its $20 more than what the girl offered and when I asked why, he reluctantly changed it and literally said the dreaded ""well, that wasnt OUR fault."" Also, I travel for work and asked about their rewards program. The manager literally said ""you wont get any rewards"" while hes standing next to the brochures for wyndhamrewards. When I pointed it out, he said ""oh yeah, I think you can sign up with your email or something.""Rooms are small, badly need upgraded and the elevator is hardly safe. Can't wait to call Wyndham tomorrow.If you're looking for a budget friendly hotel, this hotel is not bad. It's not quite walking distance from EP airport, better to call and take their free shuttle. The first room I had was newly renovated, the second room I had was still in the process of being renovated.... The bedroom was newIy renovated, but the bathroom looked like something from the 80's. I think they are trying their best to finish reno's, but you can't really tell. I loved how the bathrooms had a heat fan on top of the ceiling, kept me warm when coming out of the shower. The doors of all the rooms seem old, definitely need to change them and the light pink colour. Other than that, wifi is strong, breakfast was better than your average chains and friendly staff.Excellent hotel, rooms are clean, quiet &amp; well furnished.. Beds are comfy, rooms comes with Refrigerator, free wi-fi &amp; Microwave.  AC thermostat/temperatures worked perfectly which can be a problem even in the best of hotels.    The young woman who checked me in named Lupe, was friendly, professional &amp; made me feel welcomed.  Also a Thank you to Kimberly who I believe is an assistant manager.  She was very kind &amp; helpful.  Excel location city wise &amp; perfect if you want to have some wine or beer with the cattle barons rest(excel Salad bar) just across the parking lot, as well as Applebee's and not have to be concerned with driving.   I had lived in el paso for 14 yrs and had stayed in many hotels throughout the city over the years.  I would easily stack this hotel against any of the top hotels in the city.I'll be honest - my biggest complaint about this place was with the housekeeping staff, which is a first for me. I don't think I've ever stayed in a hotel or motel anywhere, of any size, where getting your room cleaned took SO long for such a mediocre result. I stayed here for almost a week during the Sun Bowl, and would leave the room for 3-4 hours every morning to get some coffee, only to come back to a room that had not been cleaned, even though the sign was remaining on the door. One time - fine, but this was the majority of the days. When I called for housekeeping, a rude lady showed up at my door, walked in without saying a word, then walked out saying, ""Ok, one minute."" 10 minutes later, a nice older lady came to clean my room. About 40 minutes later, it was done, minus the vacuuming, which I asked her to skip because I needed to nurse my baby and wanted to do so in private. The few times housekeeping did come to the room while I was gone, the room always smelled like cigarette smoke - no idea why, but very disappointing for a non-smoking room. The front desk staff members were friendly, and the place is close to the airport. I definitely wouldn't stay here again with a young child. If you have a slightly-outdated hotel, the one thing you have to do is keep it clean.We have never had any problems here! When we aren't at home you can find us checked in at this hotel. The staff is very nice, polite and extremely helpful. The rooms are always ready and well kept! The only complaint this time around is the strong smell of cigarettes in the hallway although all the rooms are clearly marked nonsmoking, but I guess some people just can't read our simply have no respect for others.I reserved a two bedroom suit about a month ago, when arriving after a 24 hour drive I was told it was not available. They had double booked it even though I had paid in advance. The staff did not seem interested in helping fix this problem at all. Finaly after about an hour of arguing in the lobby the agreed to give us two mini suits at the same rate as the two bedroom suit. When we went to our room, they were not the mini suits but the standard two queen bed rooms. I went back down to the lobby and they said they would not give us the mini suits unless we paid the full amount. After another hour they agreed to charge us at the same rate as the two bedroom suit. We did get a nonsmoking room like we asked, but it was right next to a smoking room and our rooms smelled like cigarette smoke the entire time we where there.We had an excellent stay recently at Hawthorn Suites on Boeing.  Staff was great, room was nice and comfy. Here's my complaint.  Cleaning staff parked where perhaps guests should park (in the shade I might add), all day, leaving us to search for a space as we came and went throughout the day.  Paying guests should have first choice for parking and staff should have a designated area to park.What a nightmare. Yes, this hotel is under renovation, but it is unfit for guests. Trash lines the hallways, the rooms are only marginally clean, there was no telephone in our room....just a few examples of the blatant disregard for the paying patrons.Usually, when a hotel is under serious remodel, the owners care enough about the customers to close the building until the work is finished. It is clear that is not the case at this filthy, borderline dangerous, hotel.After reading reviews I was kicking myself for booking this hotel. But my experience went really well. I arrived at the hotel a little after midnight for a three night stay, yes the front of the hotel and lobby area are under construction and honestly that's the only affected part I saw. The guy at the lobby was very nice and accommodating trying to find me a non smoking room since I booked through priceline. The room was clean, small, and had all the essentials. There was no trash lining the hallways, rude house keepers, or loud construction. The only negative I did experience was my key card didn't work but that was taken care of quickly. It's a great hotel, right next to the fort bliss and the airport. I'd stay here again.Fairly Clean, comfortable beds, good price and close to airport.  Staff was friendly. Property was somewhat oudated, but had very nice look to it. There was water stains on the sealing right above my bed. It was raining and I feel sleep praying I would not be woken up by dripping water from the sealing. The next morning I was still dry. We cheerfully got ready for our trip, boarded their author shuttle and had a pleasant coversation with the driver on our way to airport.  All in all its a good place to stay if you have a really flight tho catch.To be honest we never got a room. I reserved a room through the hotel website.. Lots of construction going on.. The person behind the desk was a complete ass.. He wAs rude and lazy.. Couldn't find our reservation.. I gave him our confirmation number and he said we didn't call in to secure the room.. Apparently after you reserve a room you have to call and verify that you want it.. It wasn't even past 20 min past deadline .. He continued to tell us ha had no more king rooms only double rooms.. Complete lies through every website I could still get King rooms I even called to check this time.. Management needs work.. It wAs blessing  the Wyndham suite we got was cheaper and beautiful and huge separate bedroom :) that is the only thanks they get .. Thanks for sending me to a nicer hotel ..The rooms were really small, the bathroom sink wasn't draining, and the kids running up and down the hallway drove me nuts! But on a brighter note, the ice machine was close to my room, they have an indoor pool, they have free breakfast with yummy waffles shaped like texas, Free WiFi, and most of all the staff was very friendly! The shuttle took us to &amp; from the airport, as well as to &amp; from the restaurant &amp; mall! As long as you request it ahead of time or if they have it available!Just arrived...1st king room was tiny...I mean tiny like the king bed filled the room with virtually no room to spare.  The staff was so sweet when we asked for a larger room which is wonderful.  And, the next room was much better in size.  Sadly, the hotel is so run down and icky...the pleasant staff just isn't enough to keep me here for the week.  Just booked a different hotel for the rest of the week.  For the same price I have found much nicer and newer accommodations. I cannot recommend this Hawthorn Inn and am very disappointed that Hawthorn/Wyndham would put their name to it.We stayed here one night as we were driving cross country.  Our room was small, but clean and comfortable, it had a fridge and a microwave.  There was free high speed wifi, and breakfast.  The breakfast is what took me by surprise.  They have two Belgan waffle irons that made waffles the shape of Texas!  They tasted even better than they looked!  They also had all the fixins for breadfast burritos - eggs, hash browns, sausage patties, salsa, cheese, jalapenos, on flour tortillas.  There was 4 kinds of fruit juice, instant oatmeal, cold cereal, bagels, blueberry muffins, and fresh oranges and bananas.  My kids each ate a huge breakfast that would have cost me $40. to $50. had I taken them to a restaurant, and it was fast and convenient.  When we checked out, we were on our way in good time.  The price was right, and the value was excellent.Not a bad place to lay your head. It is convenient to the airport and the room was clean. It is an older hotel so some of the fixtures and carpet are showing their age a bit. But hey, the TV worked, the A/C worked and the water was hot. Bed was pretty comfy but I drug my tail in at 4:00 am so I am sure the floor would have felt nice. You could do worse, and I have, for a lot more money!",,,,,"['family', 'event', 'good', 'experience', 'rooms', 'nice', 'size', 'average', 'breakfast', 'hearty', 'remodeled', 'nicely', 'thing', 'say',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-el-paso-west-el-paso,Hampton Inn & Suites El Paso West,4.0,$$,17,"Nice service from the staff. Clean, quiet room with functional air conditioning. No freeway noise in spite of proximity to I-10. These places are so predictably good, it's tough to say anything critical. Christy C noted this place has proximity (RFID) cards. Small imperfection: the exterior door closest to I-10 has a fussy card reader. If you're carrying stuff in and hands are full, this is a small hassle. El Paso has a 17.5% hotel tax rate. This is the highest I've ever paid. Not that this is Hampton Inn's fault, but it's a bad trend.Solid Hampton experience.Location is right off the freeway (without the noise) and next to Rudy's! If you're not a Texan, Rudy's is the best chain BBQ you will ever have. Trust.Rudy's also has a tiny convenience store inside, but there is an odd wall between the hotel and Rudy's that you have to go around to reach it.Getting to the Hampton from I-10 eastbound is easy; it's on the feeder. Getting to it Westbound involves turning into the Holiday Inn parking lot behind Rudy's. There's no signage to this effect.Service is good, but not anything super special. The rooms use RFID cards, so instead of sticking your card in the door, you just hold it up to the reader and the door unlocks.Shower was great. Wifi was slow but adequate. Bed was comfy. :-)This is a newer hotel. It is very clean. The lobby, the dining area and the rooms look and smell clean. Also the rooms are quiet. Interstate 10 is right next to it but I did not hear any noise. The employees I encountered were pleasant. Only complaint is 3 of the 4 ice machines did not work. And the one ice machine that did work was empty because it was the only one providing ice for the entire hotel.Ok hotel...except for the fire alarm going off at 12:30 at night and having to stand in the parking lot till  1:15 in the morning.Nice service and nice new looking hotel. Room had a good clean appearance and bathroom was tidy and clean.  Bed was nice and comfy as well. Right offOf I10 and next to Rudy's.Wow, this hotel sure gets a lot of 5 Star Reviews.  I would be giving this Hampton Inn 5 Stars too if I was ranking them against the rest of the Hampton Inn's that I stayed at. Compared to other Hampton Inn's, the rooms here are larger, the staff is excellent, everything seems new/clean, the hotel at night is peaceful, and their free breakfast is pretty damn good.  I had my own parking spot, which is a perk for being a Diamond member.  However, I didn't use it since there's plenty of parking and regular parking was closer to my room.  By far, this is the best Hampton Inn that I have stayed at.  Peace Out!!Great hotel. The staff were extremely helpful and kind. Room was clean and welcoming. Gabriel, Meagan and David located and shipped an item that I had left there. They did so with soothing ease efficiency, even driving to drop off at FedEx Office!I strongly recommend Hampton Inn to anyone traveling through El Paso.Fantastic hotel with a great wheelchair accessible room!  After traveling for 9 hours and it getting late, we needed to find a safe place to stay in El Paso (though we were trying to get past El Paso due to it being so close to Juarez.)  I was *more* than pleasantly surprised with the room we got (Rm 318) and it's size!  We had two queen beds with a separate living room area, a nice size refrigerator, microwave, 2 flat screen TV's, a long mirror, and nice desk, with hi-speed wifi.  For the low price, I'd stay here longer if I could!  I highly recommend this hotel to anyone!  Clean, courteous, and safe.  Oh!  And, after talking to the maids, they have to change the duvet covers every day!  That's a plus in my book!  AND, they have fitted sheets!  Finally, I'm not waking up in the morning sleeping on a bare mattress.  This has been a great experience all around!  Thank you!This place is beautiful. Really cool vibe and a great room. Excellent breakfast and great location to get around El Paso. Top Notch at a very low price!Very good servicre.I called same-day and booked a room (using my Hilton points) and we were immediately accommodated.  We got exactly the room we asked for and when we requested early arrival (early check-in) they were so helpful that she got her housecleaning staff to get our room ready before it needed to be.  That is great service!I did note that on Sat morning (very early, like 4am), the staff guy was quite rude and seemed very annoyed with the 20 or so guests who were awake that early and wanting coffee (they have automated machines that have coffee all night) but had no receptacle to put their trash in (ie. mixing sticks, empty packets of sugar).  When I kindly asked him if they had a bigger trash can, he said curtly to me ""use the one outside"" and walked away.. I was actually doing him a favor because since the little itty bitty 32oz trashcan they provided by the coffee pots was already overflowing, it was now piling up on the coffee table and I was helping clean it up.. with that attitude, he can forget my thoughtfulness and clean it up!Besides that, clean, modern, well maintained hotel and great reception staff during the day.  I'd come back again.I've stayed here multiple times over the past few months and have had pleasant experiences. The hotel is clean, staff is friendly, and breakfast good. I will return when/if I am in the area again.A few things to note:- The card readers on the outside doors are hit-and-miss; it's frustrating when they don't work- The bathrooms in normal rooms have showers only- The treadmills are of good quality but have a 60 minute timer limit. If you want to run longer than 60 minutes, the machine will need to be resetOne last important item: Although the hotel breakfast is good, go to Rudy's across the parking lot for delicious and inexpensive breakfast tacos. Do it and thank me later.This is THE best Hampton Inn that I've ever stayed... and like Adam P., I also stay in a lot of properties. (And more specifically, a lot of Hampton Inn properties....)I had a very late arrival (around midnight) due to the late flight that I took. But the front desk attendant was very friendly and welcoming. There are 4 floors to this property. Mine was on the 3rd. The key card that they give  you is a ""Saflok"" card. So it's the kind that you just wave over a a little disc thingy to unlock. Upon entering I saw the upgraded light switches and the Privacy and Clean room buttons. Nice!! (Man, this isn't typical for Hampton's... more like 5 * properties have those buttons...)But then I stepped a little bit more into my spacious room... yes, very spacious... and I found the extremely comfortable bed, a nice sofa and coffee table, comfortable &amp; roomy desk area, and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was nice and spacious as well! Nice large shower area, no bathtub -- which is a-okay with me! Granite countertop... nice Kohler sink. Then downstairs for breakfast. Gorgeous open area for eating with large vaulted ceilings. For complimentary breakfast, the food was actually very good! They had this ""bagel topper"" item... which was pretty tasty with egg, cheese, and I think sausage. Oh, and I was happy to see at breakfast the plates and utencils are all tater-ware, 100% biodegradable -- just like the kind at my local Whole Foods in PHX. Nice touch Hampton Inn.... :)Always complimentary coffee (I think 24/7).... and complimentary WiFi. This property has to be pretty new... everything looks great. Great decor!The only thing..... is that this is pretty much on the far West side of town. It's kind of a drive to other parts of town.It is right off the 10 Interstate; so if you're road tripping on the 10 through El Paso, I would definitely stay here!BTW, the photos on the Hampton website do not do this place justice!!Summary based on 1 stay:--ok business oriented hotel, close to I10--pricier than average--ok free breakfast, but items like fresh fruit not replenished--helpful staff--aircon more quiet than average--ok work space for laptop BUT--internet wifi unusably slow--parking dumb, requiring steping over median strips in lot--only a couple of restaurant choices for later night dining nearbyWe stopped here on our drive back to TX due to heavy traffic along I-10 E from construction, but I'm really glad we did! The rooms are clean and well-maintained -- almost seemed like a new hotel! They have scanning keycards for the room keys, instead of the usual inserting key cards. Free hotel breakfast runs from 6-10 AM, and hot items are served. They had sausage patties, cheese omelets, and french toast sticks the morning I was there, as well as make-your-own waffles &amp; pancakes, fruit, coffee, juices, cereal, oatmeal, and breakfast pastries/bagels.  Gas station and a Rudy's next door are a plus!Best Hilton property in EP price wise.  Only thing is it is far from the middle of town.As a business traveler, some things are more important to me than if I were traveling for personal reasons. This hotel had many positives, but one glaring negative. Positive attributes include: clean rooms, property in above average repair, several trash cans in each room, below average noise coming from both inside and outside hotel, and consistent water pressure and truly hot water. This property is either fairly new or completely remodeled recently.The one glaring negative for this hotel was very, very, very slow Internet speeds. For those travelers who know what latency is, latency for the Internet at this property was 2,000 at times. The fastest Internet speeds I realized during my five nights were about 500 kB (1/2 of 1 meg). With Internet speeds this slow, and latency that was extremely high, it was virtually impossible to connect to the company network using VPN tunnels and RDCs. While I understand that many guests can be accessing Wi-Fi at the same time, this is 2012, and there is no good reason why this hotel does not have sufficient bandwidth and/or backhaul to provide every guest with adequate and reliable data speeds. No reason at all. I would only consider staying at the Hampton Inn in NW El Paso again if I had strong assurances that decisive steps have been taken to address the Internet speed and latency issues.Other thoughts: If Internet speed and reliability are not important to you in the least, this is a good hotel to consider. Also, while I saw an exercise room, indoor swimming pool, business center, and know there was a breakfast in the morning, I did not use these facilities or services, so I will not offer a review of them.Stayed November 2012, traveled on businessThis is probably one of the nicest Hampton's I have ever stayed at, and I have slept around a lot....hotels...seriously!  Anyway, the hotel is practically new with a very attentive and friendly staff.  Furnishings are tasteful, and my room has been cleaned very well both days.  Breakfast selections were okay, but hey it's free right!  Wi-fi signal was pretty decent.  Stay here, you shouldn't be disappointed.",,,,,"['nice', 'service', 'staff', 'clean', 'quiet', 'room', 'functional', 'air', 'conditioning', 'freeway', 'noise', 'spite', 'proximity', 'places',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-roof-inns-el-paso-2,Red Roof Inns,3.0,$$,19,"Pro:*Friendly staff*Fast wifi *HBO movie channel (watched Divergent, Maze runner...)*Room has safe! *Good water pressure and very hot water*Lot of plugs and outlets, desk has both USB and regular outlet. Bedside table has extra outlet attached to. *24 hours coffee in the lobby, microwave too*clean *very comfy pillows Con:*Heater temp set high as 78 only. I kind like it to be hotter. (When it's 30 degrees outside)If you book from Hotwire, this is most likely the hotel you will get.I had a good stay here while driving back to Fort Worth from Los Angeles, CA. While I usually stay at the Residence Inn off of I-20 (they were booked), I settled on this Red Roof Inn. For one night, I wasn't disappointed. Cost was between $55-63.First, the entire property seems to have been newly renovated. My room was on the end corner of the second floor, and it seemed to have been nearly the size of a suite that you would see at a SpringHill Suites or something. The floors were hardwood (no complaints) and clean, as well as that of the bed. The walls weren't paper-thin (another good thing), and there was an elevator available to access my room. Usually in low cost motels/inns like this, having an elevator on property is usually 50/50. This is quite convenient for those that are traveling with family members or friends that don't like walking up stairs.There was a sufficient amount of parking towards the rear of the property. The front area of the property is a bit misleading, as you will think that this is the only place to park. I didn't notice too many places to eat within walking distance, yet I do know that such venues as Dunkin Doughnuts (for coffee), Starbucks and others are within a 1-1.5 mile drive via I-20 and some local roads. While Red Roof Inns in general do not offer breakfast for their guests (no exception here), the coffee choices were not bad. Further, the front desk personnel were also quite cool and easy to deal with.Altogether, I had a good night's stay at this clean property while energizing for my final 9+ hours of driving back to Fort Worth. I'll certainly stay here again, if necessary.Red Roof Inn here in El Paso is a no frills hotel. the room is clean, very clean. the chair to sit and do my computer work exceeds many of the fancy hotels. I really like that. the TV it's a big flat very nice. the bathroom with granite counters is fine. it just has the minimum soap and shampoo, the towels are adequate, not the softest ever, but adequate. the price performance is excellent. so as a no frills hotel Red Roof is looking upNo, this isn't a diamond in the rough. It's tired and odd. Front desk guy seemed out of it. Double booked my fucking room and some guy was trying to get in like 20 minutes after I checked in. I left to get food only to return to find my key deactivated. Now I get to return to the front desk from the third floor with shit in my hands. The only reason for the 2 stars are the proximity to restaurants and the strip club next door. Fuck the hotel.Worst staff on duty,   they lie about  there price  from the sign overlooking the freeway,  they rather  send u away  then to take a third party reservation,  then the host tells me Why did you come back,  I told you I was not giving you a room his word, since when dose a dirty foo like that get the balls to act as if he is the owner , this place looks like a 3 to 4 star hotel but now I know why it's a 2 start should  be a 1 start , advice  get new staff  then u can charge 80 a night , I would have paid it if I was greeted with respect as I came inI mean an inn is an inn right? This one was typical, nothing horrendous, nothing special. Let me warn you though ladies, this place is located not next to one but TWO strip clubs (excuse me, gentlemen's club). Perfect place to spend our anniversary right? Haha luckily for my boyfriend we went boot shopping beforehand and he was let off the hook :)Good value for the price. Our room was $65/night. The room was clean enough and the check in staff was friendly. Free wifi. No pet charge so our pups were FREE! There's also free coffee in the lobby in the morning.My review is on the king suite. We arrived at this location after a cross country drive. We were exhausted and anxious to shower. When we checked in, we got one of the last available rooms. Our room was the handicapped access room as well as a king suite. It was spacious and clean. The bed was comfy and had plenty of pillows. Maybe this location isn't the best choice if you are going to want a fancy breakfast. It worked very well for us as we only wanted a hot shower and good night's sleep. I like the new Red Roof remodel rooms with no carpeting and no dirty, gross comforters. I would stay here again if I am driving through and needing a few hours of sleep.Very disappointed in the room, the hotel states all rooms were remodeled but ours didn't look like it. The shower would back up and it would take forever for the water to drain. Their were brown stains on bathroom walls. The AC unit would cool room down but would make a lot if noise when you would turn it on. The room walls need better insulation, we could hear our neighbors bumping music and other inappropriate noises.Pros:Stayed last night, weekday rate of about $56 plus tax. Large room, office chair/desk. Hard wood floors. Microwave, safe and fridge. Flat screen tv. Good toiletries (Pantene shampoos). Free coffee. Clean and comfy bed. Located near a lot of restaurants.Cons:My room had only one mirror which was in the bathroom. No big deal for me, but might be a big deal for families..?My AC unit knob was broken, couldn't turn the temp up. We were freezing! So we turned it completely off, but luckily, we didn't sweat during the night.Hotel is right next door to a strip club. This wasn't a problem for my husband (LOL!), but it might be a problem for families.Overall, it was a pleasant stay for us. I wouldn't mind coming back again.Not the greatest place to stay, but the rates are not too expensive (about $50-60) per night and we basically needed a place to stay for our trip to Houston from San Diego. No frills here. Beds, tv, coffee, but no breakfast (not even continental)! They messed up on our reservation. I asked for a ground room floor for handicapped since my Dad has a little difficulty with his knees. They did find us a ground floor room, but the smoke alarm wasn't hooked up. Don't think we'll be staying here again!We are frequent guests at Red Roof Inn across the country. Last night we stayed in El Paso East and had an awesome experience. The room was great, the property was well maintained and best part was the service we received. Andy, the overnight shift front desk is the main reason for 5 star rating, he was super polite and helpful, I was in the lobby sitting and observed Andy handling check ins in the late evening line a pro, he also arranged for extra towels and was a pleasure. We chatted for a few minutes, this hard working young man is an asset to the location..,keep up the good work Andy!!! Honorable mention to Gilbert who checked is in.Bare bone basic.Bring your own everything!Not enough towels, no coffee maker, blowdryer, space or  customer care.Wont stay here anymore regardless of thier price.Booked advanced for the trip back in Sep 2013, on their website shows newly re-modeled, but not really, got the room that so old, very dirty shower has crack and a hole on the wall, carpet and bed sheet are dirty too, end up went to Spring Hill Suites next to them! Beware!!Stayed here the first night I arrived in El Paso, I planned on staying for 12 days but checked out the next morning. If you are just looking for a crash pad for the night, this will suffice anything for an extended period I would look elsewhere if I were you.So, I had been driving for 9 hours headed from Phx to Austin.  It was 3 am and I was exhausted..  Finally stop in El Paso and hit up the Holiday Inn Express (mostly so I could say I am not a _______ but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.)  They wanted $160 for a room that I needed for 5-6 hours max..  NO THANKS!  So, down the road a mile, found the Red Roof Inn.  Wasn't expecting or needing much, just a bed and a shower..For the life of me, I cannot recall the name of the gentleman that helped me that night..  But at 3am he was very cheerful..  Quite the opposite of the near zombie state I was in.I asked him for the price, was quoted something in the range of $60, and asked for any discounts.  He hooked me up with the AARP I believe..  Saved me $15.  He then walked outside with me to find a place for me to park my truck and trailer.Had I needed a place to sleep on the drive back, this would have been my first choice.  But, alas, I drove straight through..Great value for the money.  Very cute, recently renovated room with flat-screen TV, mini fridge and free wifi.  Nice desk for setting up a laptop.  Very clean.Decent motel to crash at. Don't expect to use the filthy shower though. Everything else was clean enough. Walls are very thin though. Didn't mind it much but it wouldn't be our first choice next time thru El Paso. It was cheap (~$65 for a king room)...Nestled snugly between a gentleman club and industrial park sits The Red Roof Inn.  Its pretty much is what you would suspect... the internet is good and the free coffee is palatable compared to other hotel lobby coffee I've tried to digest.  I recommend you request a non-smoking room and head to the Las Palmas Shopping center for dinner or a real cup of coffee).",,,,,"['pro', 'friendly', 'staff', 'fast', 'movie', 'channel', 'watched',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-el-paso-west-bartlett-el-paso,La Quinta Inn & Suites El Paso West Bartlett,2.5,$$,20,"My family and I stayed at this hotel last night and we thought it was pretty nice. The receptionist was very friendly. We brought our dog here bc I found it on the bring fido app. They were nice enough to even give us doggy bags. I would recommend to someone else. Also Chilis, Texas Roadhouse, and Krispy Kreme are in the same parking lot.While the young man working the front desk in the evening was very polite I believe that is just about the only thing I can say nice about this hotel. Except they do have a security guard watching the cars. They need it! Not a very nice area. The rooms are disgusting to say the least. One step up from a gas station bathroom. A park bench might be more comfortable than the beds. The rooms smell. The carpets are as such you wouldn't dare take your shoes off.  However we did make it though the night. Gotta wait and see if we ""catch"" anything for the filth. Stay at your own risk.The Hotel is dated, but the price is right.  We upgraded to a master suite for under hundred dollars, plus we had our dogs with us.  The location has dining choices close by, including a Texas Road House, Chilis, and Krispy Kreme if you do not feel like driving for a mealA dead Texas size cockroach (at least 2 inches long) in the room and a lot of baby ones cruising around the bathroom. Yikes!!!!!!! This La Quinta is in serious need of a fix up. There were a lot of broken stuff in the room and I just couldn't take advantage of the free breakfast after seeing the roaches.I'll start off by saying that I booked this hotel through hotwire and when I saw all these negative reviews on Yelp and Tripadvisor I was traumatized.  But after checking into a room, the images of a run-down old shack quickly disappeared. The room itself was spacious and had a nice flat screen with all your favorite cable channels.  There weren't peeling paint as another reviewer stated or growing mold in the showers, so that was a big relief. But most importantly, the bed was large and comfortable which really is the only important thing when staying in a hotel. However the bathroom lights and toilet were really loud and the hallways did reek of smoke.  I'm really sensitive to smoke, so that's definitely not cool :/ Breakfast. Whoever said that their breakfast sucked probably has overly high standards. From my visits I had a freshly toasted bagel with cream cheese. And had we not been in a rush I probably would have made myself a fresh waffle from their waffle maker. The orange juice was from a machine but honestly this is a pretty great selection for a hotel of this caliberFor a economy hotel, this definitely deserves 3 stars.There are two La Quintas almost next to each other in this area so need to be aware of which one you're booking.   I'm an awards member so they upgraded me.  Room on second floor.  Bed was very comfortable queen.  Room was quiet of street noise.  Internet worked very well but that may be a function of how full the hotel is. But even though the room looked great when I checked on after a three night stay I noticed wall wear and a very noisy bathroom vent. These are not deal breakers but there was no business center to use to print out my Southwest boarding pass. That's a big negative for me.lots of good restaurants on Mesa and in the area once you get away from the interstate.I'll stay here again even though the absence of a business center is a big negativeNo water pressure, ac unit was broken, ants on the floor but hey I am just here to sleep. Bed was firm and tv worked. What else could I ask for? Ha...06/15/13WARNING: There are TWO La Quinta Inns right across the street from each other. I accidentially went to the wrong La Quinta when the people across the street kindly told me that this occurs all the time. Whoops. I guess I was just too excited to go to bed after my long drive.This La Quinta was great. It had a nice flat screen TV, wireless internet, and all the basic ammenities you could want. Also, the best thing about here was the free continental breakfast although I could not help notice that this one lady was hoging up the waffle machines. Breakfast was served from 6-9am.Very ghetto. But a wonderful flat screen TV. And the Otis Spunkmeyer muffins at breakfast are pretty good. The bathroom fan is quite strong too.Faces the highway and the traffic noise is high. The expired milk at the breakfast bar poured out in large sour lumps into my once pristine lucky charms. We alerted the lady about it and she only threw away the ones that were one week expired, even though the lumpy one was from the batch that was only one day expired.I believe the other la quinta is the one our climber friends recommend so we'll try that next time.Solid marks for clean, inside doors, and pet friendly. The rate for my stay was less than a lot of other nights on this trip.We have stayed here multiple times while traveling to/from CA to TX. We are always exhausted and don't care if it's a luxury hotel or not we just need a room for the night that will accept pets. Unfortunately, this particular La Quinta has gone further downhill on each visit. We arrived late and all they had available was a smoking room, not usually a big deal, a little odor but we get past it. I had to use my inhaler as soon as I walked on the door!!! I continued using it all night. The room was so gross! To the point that I didn't even take my clothes or socks off and my socks were black from walking on the carpet! The worst part though is our poor dogs (who are treated for fleas) left the hotel itching and scratching and sure enough they had fleas!!! I called the hotel to inform them and they said they would treat the room but you never know, it was obviously infested! Obviously, we won't stay here again.Oh where to start. I have stayed here twice. I try to give everything a fair shake. Ok let me start off with one word. Dated interior. Many have been remodeled and this one is not only in need of updating but MAINTANCE! Elevator- Button on first floor is litterally cracked and broken to the point where I got shocked a few times when calling the elevator.Laundry- For all you folks out there that frequent this chain it is very typical that the Laundry is on the third or fourth floor. Don't ask me why, it just is. I expect this so it is not an issue with me.Interior- as stated before in desperate need of a facelift and maintance and this would go for the appliances too. I had to keep pushing the mini frig around to make it stop grumbling and keeping me up all night.Another not so impressive little incident. I forgot a very expensive item in the room. I was half way back home before I realized it. I called and the front desk person said they would ask housekeeping to check the room for it. They came back and said it wasn't there. I asked him to check the room himself and he promptly told me that he had. I then told him that I knew exactly where I had left it. I was told that he could only go by what he had been told by the staff ( remember he just said that he had checked the room himself!) He said that if I was certain that I could call the police and file a theft report. I told him that I would turn around and come back to El Paso and to let his manager know I was on my way back so that we could do this. I also told him that i knew the device i had left due to the GPS tracking device in the item which is activated even when the unit is not turned on and that it was indicating it was at the hotel address. WIthin seconds I was told that they had now found it and that house keeping was coming with it. I turned around to retrevie the item and when I got there I got an apology from the person that I had spoken to on the phone when I told him that the GPS devices sure do come in handy! He told me that he was sorry and that it was not him that had gone to check the room ( again remember he originally said he had!) This got me off to a really rocky start with the chain that is a preferred vendor for my employer. Needless to say that this location has lost my business and I will look to stay at one of the other locations that has been renovated.Not as new &amp; updated as other la quinta hotels I've stayed at. But, if you've been driving west for ten hours and still haven't left Texas, this is an okay place to sleep. Pillows were soft &amp; the drapes made it way dark. It's right off i10, across from another La Quinta.My only gripes:- no hot water (was room temp, even after letting it run five minutes)- Did not have HBO &amp; half of the channels were in spanish- Looked very vacantLike I said, this place isn't ideal for a romantic get away. You shouldn't be looking in El Paso anyway if you want that.Room looked clean. Nothing in disrepair. Well maintained. Wifi works, but kinda slow. They turned the AC on before I arrived which was good.  Considering how hot it gets in El Paso, that in itself warrants an extra star.  You do not want to spend the next few hours trying to cool down a room that was hot as a furnace upon arrival.I want to start this review off by saying that I now am rest assured that the entire city of El Paso is doomed. The stay here started off horrible. The shower head in our first room was torn out of the wall and the water pressure was so high that it flooded the bathroom. We were moved to another room, which we thought would be better, but we only traded up to trade down yet again. The sheets had disturbing stains and the sink and bath wouldn't drain. To top it off, minutes after I checked out I realized I left my leather jacket in room and called wanting to come right back for it, they claimed my jacket wasn't found which is impossible , being, I walked from room to car and nowhere else. So, I assume their employees are thieves.Stopped on the way back to San DiegoPRO:Nice RoomNice Customer ServicesGreat BreakfastGOOD A/CLots of good places to eat, entertain, and shop.CONS:Across the street from another La Quinta Inn and SuitesPOOL VERY DIRTYBathroom was moldy around the top off the showerLaundry was on the FOURTH floor and my room was on first.Overall, It was Just okay. Second worst of my La Quinta stays at this point.It has a roof and a bed. But this was no comfortable place. I wouldnt come here.If there were less than 1 star, this hotel would earn it!  Take a bath in 6 inches of water---brush your teeth in 6 inches of water!  AND Dirty AND  poor customer service from the front desk.Located roughly 10 minutes west of downtown El Paso right off of I-10, The La Quinta is clean, is in a safe neighborhood, and reasonable. As with all La Quinta's, they are pet friendly and give you a free Continental breakfast in the morning. The La Quinta is older than some and is a little bit run down. However, all in all, it was a nice spot to stay for a reasonable price.Our carpet was dirty and the a/c didn't really cool at night. We had to let the manager know about the problems.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-and-suites-el-paso-airport-el-paso,Hampton Inn & Suites El Paso-Airport,3.5,$$,20,"Very nice hotel!! upon arrival they served evening snacks until 7 pm. Apparently they do this Mondays through Thursdays. The snacks at this location consisted of Nachos and some vegetables. There was also Beer and Wine as well as Water and Lemonade. I'm on the road often and this is one of the first hotels I have seen do this. It was very nice and very welcoming. Rooms are spacious and clean and the staff was very friendly.This is the hotel that made me realize that not all hotels within a chain are created equal. On my travels I typically try to stay at a Hilton brand hotel, and within the Hilton family, I favor the Hampton Inns for their reasonable pricing and free breakfast. They're (generally) nice enough that you don't feel that you're at a seedy place yet not so expensive that you feel that you've wasted money if you don't spend all your time at your hotel. The quality of this Hampton Inn and the way it is managed however, has made me reconsider the Hampton Inn chain, and perhaps the Hilton family as well. To be fair, this Hampton Inn is pretty standard in terms of what you get. My complaints about the hotel itself are minor: The elevator is in a weird place (not centralized), the pipes are noisy so it sounds like your toilet is automatically flushing at random times as water is being forced through the pipes, and you can hear the cars on the highway if your room is facing the highway. My chief complaints however, are with how this hotel is managed:1) The people who work here do not know what they are doing. Before booking this hotel, I saw that my credit card was offering a rebate for spending a certain amount at a Hampton Inn by a certain date. My planned trip to El Paso was a few days after the expiration of this offer so I called the hotel in advance asking if I could pay for my room in advance. They told me that it would not be a problem. So despite seeing rooms for cheaper in El Paso, I booked here in hopes of getting my credit card rebate. A week before my stay, I called the hotel asking to prepay and was directed to billing. They told me sent me a credit card authorization form to fill out and fax back. I did that. A few days later, not seeing any charge on my card, I called them again to make sure that they would charge my credit card before my rebate offer expired. They told me they could not charge my card in advance. The COULD NOT TAKE MY MONEY. Really? The person I called before I booked told me I could. The person who send me the damn credit card authorization said I could. And I guess they were just lying to me. Or they didn't know what the hell they were talking about. And so I stayed at this hotel and didn't get my credit card rebate. I feel cheated because I found a cheaper rate during my stay and didn't book at that hotel because I wanted the rebate here. 2) I suspect the house cleaners will take your moneyMy brother came with me on my trip and he had a significant amount of money in his wallet. When we went out during the day, he forgot his wallet in our room. But I left a do-not-disturb sign up to waive cleaning. When we checked out and went back home, he realized that only he only had half of his money in his wallet. The only time the wallet left his side during our trip was when he forgot it in our hotel room. So this is the only time the money he brought with him on our trip could have been taken. I strongly suspect that house cleaning came into our room anyway to snoop around. They were smart enough to only take part of the cash from the wallet so that we wouldn't immediately discover the theft. 3) No Hilton Honors pointsA week after my stay, I see that they have not posted the Hilton Honor points for my stay, despite such points usually posting after 48 hours. I read the fine print on the Hilton website, and apparently not all Hilton hotels participate in the Hilton Honors program. This Hampton Inn is probably one of them. So I spent a lot of money I didn't have to spent, didn't get my credit card rebate, lost a lot of money, and didn't get any honors points. Worst Hampton Inn experience I've ever had.Its a hotel.  They have beds.  They have breakfast.Place is really in need of a remodel.  Bathroom door is all chipped up and doesn't close properly.Probably a 2.5 but I rounded up (not sure I should have)We recently were passing through El Paso and needed a room for the night. I called a couple of hours prior to our arrival and Sarah was very pleasant and extremely helpful.  On arrival, the check-in was quick and the room was fabulous!Two weeks later, we happened to stop in and not only did Sarah recognize us, but she even remembered our names!A very clean, comfortable hotel and the service is fabulous!  A complimentary breakfast is provide in the morning, and it definitely exceeds the average hotel breakfast.First night and beds were ssoo relaxing and comfortable. Rooms are clean and stocked night and morning staff all friendly!  complimentary buffet is amazing and variable. So far loving it..Quick bullet points...Pros:-Located close to the airport-Close to El Paso' main freeway (I-10)-Great staff-Fitness Room w/free weights and a couple of treadmills-Quiet, especially at night. -Price-Located near restaurants and the mall-Microwave, TV, and Fridge-Honest housekeeping.  Have yet to loose anything-Hilton Honor Points and free stuff-Free WiFiCons:-Breakfast is just your basic precooked liquid eggs, sausage, oatmeal, waffles, and toast.-No room service-Rooms are small, but still comfortable. Even though I prefer to stay at the Hilton Garden, this Hampton Inn has become one of my regular hotels when I'm in El Paso.  The Hilton Garden Inn, which is right on the other side of the freeway, is nicer.  It's just way too crowded.Went to visit for a quick weekend trip to see a friend. I was very pleased with my room. It was clean and fresh when we checked in. They put us in the far back which I was a little irked with initially but glad later because there was a loud crowd staying on the same floor. Breakfast was great.  Lots of variety and the waffle maker was a hit with my dad! The lobby is a bit small and it was a busy weekend so it seemed like a busy restaurant. We checked out super early on Sunday and was halt the was already fresh coffee. I was hoping there might be some breakfast but it was too early. Front desk attendee was amazing she found us 4 muffins to go! That's service!  We'll definitely staying there again.  Only reason I didn't give a 5 star was because of the loud people on our floor.The best low budget, non 5 star or 4 diamonds (whatever rating they receive) ..BEST Hotel I have stayed at in years.Last year I stayed here because of a wedding. The service was sensational, nearly perfect for low-budget hotel. I even high fived the front desk lady. I still remember that, I'm sure you have never high five someone at the front desk. Anyways, This hotel doesn't have room service, but it has a small mini-mini-snack store for microwaveable food (Rooms have microwaves), beverages and more snacks. Rooms are very very clean, up-to-date. Comfy too!Now, I would write more but for what I have left, Mel C. has written a bullet point review that summarizes the rest.(Thanks Mel C.)We decided to stay at this Hampton inn on our way home. Very happy we did.  Front desk staff are very friendly. Room is nice and clean.  They put us in the odd number rooms so nice and quiet.  When I asked for a good Mexican food place they recommended L&amp;J. Then offered to have the shuttle take us and pick us up when we were done.  So happy the have a shuttle.  Was awesome to have them take us and pick us up so we didn't get lost and could have a wine margarita at the restaurant.  Driver was very friendly and when she picked us up offered to take us to the mall.  Made the wife very happy!!  Haven't had the breakfast yet but I'm sure it will be within Hampton standards.  Will update if it's not. But will definitely stay here again when we drive through.I don't recommend this place. It's outdated and kinda dirty. We found a bed bug at room 430 and yellow trailing residue on the wall. We all freaked out and told the manager. The manager was apologetic about it and was told he'll have somebody look into it and he did.  He upgraded us to a suite but it's not impressive at all.We left immediately in the morning (we checked in at 1am). We didn't even consider the free breakfast.Easy convenient location with lots of food and shopping options very close.  The hotel was cute and the rooms were just perfect for what we needed.  Everything was clean, nothing in disrepair and the rooms were very comfortable.  The complimentary breakfast had many options and everything was tasty - cereal, waffles, oatmeal, breakfast rolls, little breakfast pizzas on mini bagels, sausage and more.  We were very pleased and would definitely stay again.I stayed at this hotel for four days for business. I will start with the excellent happy hour from 5:30-7:30 daily. They provide vegetable trays, popcorn, chips &amp; salsa, fruit juice and a keg of beer everyday. They change the entree daily, examples hot wings, chili &amp; cheese and chicken nuggets with fries. The food was outstanding. The staff is courteous and attentive to all your needs. Great hotel in the hottest city in the USA.So, you're probably wondering why the hell anyone would go to El Paso right?  Frankly, so am I.  The only reason I went there at all was for a weekend leadership conference.  The conference was actually at the Marriott but I can get discounts at Hilton Family Hotels so, of course, I decided to stay the nearest one.Anyway,  my friends and I were given 5-star, no, make that 6-star service even before we left El Paso Airport.  Because of work, we had to take a later flight so we didn't even land until 11:30 at night.  When I used the courtesy phone to call the Hampton Inn for a shuttle, the guy on the phone greeted me with ""Are you  Ms. Young?  We've been expecting you.""  I've been to a few hotels and have never received personalized service at that level.The hotel is small with only four floors and about 140 rooms.  The decor of the lobby is very cozy and reminded me of a large den complete with fire place and comfy sofas.  The rooms are a bit on the small side but they're sparkling clean and the beds are VERY comfortable.I can't say enough good things about the service we received from absolutely EVERY person that worked at this hotel.  They all embodied the level of service I expect to receive from a Hilton Family Hotel and I couldn't have been happier.  In particular, their graveyard shuttle driver (Oscar) was so nice and drove us wherever we needed to go without ever having a poor attitude or complaint.Some other highlights that made me fall in love with the Hampton:*Free 24 hour shuttle service within a 3-mile radius*Free business center use (24 hours)*Free breakfast from 7 a.m. - 10 a.m.*In-room mini fridge*In-room microwaveIf you ever find yourself in El Paso, The Hampton Inn by the airport is definitely the place you want to stay.  You will not regret it!OK please. Only one laundry in the hotel. Food is ok (microwave chicken nuggets). Rooms are not bad...Not great, but not bad.good hotel, good location right off I-10.  nice clean room as i would expect from a Hampton.Breakfast is ok but not great.  Nothing too impressive.  Location was a little weird and hard to get to depending on which way you come from.  Could have been 4 stars maybe because they do have FREE BEER from 5 to 7pm on at least some days.  Other than that it was pretty meh.Having just had a wonderful stay at the Hampton Inn in Sierra Vista, AZ, this location just didn't stand up to the comparison.  Everything was just a bit off.  The room wasn't quite clean.  The breakfast wasn't especially good.  The common area was a bit cramped, and the ""business area"" was an open countertop with three computers in the lobby.  All in all, disappointing.You know how some hotels say they have a shuttle but it's a hassle and you end up just calling a taxi. That is not the case here. Their drivers will chauffeur you around like you're starring in your own music video. Everything else is nice too. My room had a Juarez view. That's the way I like it.Staff pleasant. But air condition doesn't work I'm rooms 301 and 418! Have switched rooms already but too tired to keep switching.",,,,,"['nice', 'hotel', 'upon', 'arrival', 'served', 'evening', 'snacks', 'apparently', 'snacks', 'location', 'consisted', 'nachos',

The lady who was in charge of the food was very nice. I am very glad I stayed here.Another Marriott family suite hotel, located on the fairly suburban side of El Paso. This one is adjacent to its sister hotel, the Fairfield Inn.This location has decent amenities, including an outdoor pool and hot tub, an enhanced continental breakfast, and a room layout that features either a king bed (best rate) or two queens (highest rate) with a desk and separate seating area. The bar area in front of the room includes a microwave, fridge, and a sink, and the bathroom is sensibly separated from the closet and bathroom sink, unlike the illogical set up we encountered at the Springhill in Flagstaff. Hey, there's even a full length mirror. Where this hotel loses points for me is in cleanliness, for one, because the bathroom tiles had dirty floor and shower grout and caulking, and the carpeted corners in the room looked unclean. As another reviewer noted, the sheets and towels are worn and dingy, and I'll add that so are the bedspreads. The beds are comfortable, however, and the price was reasonable at around $125/night.We had AC problems in the middle of the night in August, when it started switching back and forth between AC and heat and smelled like it was on fire. There's no setting for this, so I just turned it colder and hoped it would keep cooling. Not a restful night. The desk manager wasn't very friendly or helpful when we had questions about our stay or our rewards program, but I will say that the entire staff seems to be fluent in Spanish. Lots of international travelers flowing both ways across the border here because it's right next to Juarez. It was my first time staying overnight in El Paso, but I might try to find something in nearby Las Cruces, New Mexico next time to see if it's a little less hectic.For a Marriott property this is definitely a disappointment the rooms need up keeping our The shower was a big dirty when we got into it definitely room for improvement however the location was OK the staff was friendly checking was normal the continental breakfast is pretty much that just microwave food! A bit of a disappointment to be a Marriott propertyThe only reason i wont give the 5 stars is because they were serving breakfast in a very rude manner.  maybe because they were mad cuz of alot of people.  but if your going to accept a soccer tournament to check in. u know there is going to be alot of people eating breakfast. you need to have a plan ready to get the lines going quickly.  other than that the rooms were very clean and very organized.  registration and check out went smoothly. i also heard the cleaning ladies say ""k cochinos los muchachos dejaron un cochinero"". that means that my players were nasty and left a mess. but as the coach i made sure no mess was left. anyways i aint mad but employees need to be careful on what they say. business is all about customer satisfaction. but overall i would stay again. nice place and good price for my team.Easter weekend provided us the opportunity to head to the border. We reserved our room online and this is actually my second time staying at this hotel nestled in northwestern El Paso. The area is quite with your locals shopping or eating at the nearby restaurants and it is in close proximity to IH-10. The rooms are clean, spacious, comfy beds, free wifi and offers free breakfast buffet the next morning filled with bacon, eggs. Waffles, cereal and pastries. Overall a great stay and all for $100 a night, not a bad deal. Till next time El Paso.Stayed April 2015Weeding out the good Marriott properties over the Internet can be hard.  This one is clean, but built like a cheap trailer.  The towels and bedsheets are old and browning.  The walls so thin I could hear the guy on one side snoring and the other side fighting.  The faucets are coated with gunk and and the shower head pulls out of the wall.All this for $20 less than the full Marriott down the way.Hotel is not allergy friendly. They bake cookies with nuts. With no sign on door or notice on website. Front desk is rude.This hotel has lost the ""new factor"". Which is to be expected after time. I have been staying here twice a year since this property opened and this was the first time it felt a bit run down. Towels are no longer bright white and fluffy. Paint is drab and walls have holes in them. This property also charges for toiletries that are typically complimentary. Very convenient location.I love traveling to new places. It is not just the sight seeing, new restaurants and foods and better weather than home but upon return home you see things differently and begin to notice at home and at the office things you took for granted all those years.  I like how in the bathroom at home the toilet paper dispenser is within reach. I don't know what design or construction constraint existed in my hotel room's bathroom when it was built that put the paper dispenser just out of reach when sitting on the toilet.  My arms are not long enough to stay again at the SpringHill. Lucky for me there was not an embarrassing fall while reaching for the prize wipe tissue.  Sure the SpringHill suites was clean and the staff nice. I liked how there was a Keurig K-cup coffee maker in the room even though I don't drink coffee. A black tea K-cup was provided along side the coffee. I disliked the alarm clock set an hour earlier than the local time my entire stay.I have to admit, I was quite nervous staying in El Paso, Texas right across the border!  I was encouraged to keep driving but I had to pull in as I was dead tired and barely functioning.  I was driving from Phoenix to Orlando, Florida and my thoughts of making it the first night were off, by about 2 days :)Anyways, this hotel was a little gem.  The guy working at the front desk was super fast and friendly and without even asking he gave me a room with a view and a military discount.  It is situated by a main street with tons of restaurants and a very short walk to Walmart.  For El Paso, it felt very safe.  The room was brand new looking and smelling and seemed very modern.  The TV was great and the bed was super comfortable.  They had a great breakfast in the morning that was included in the price.  If you so happen to find yourself in El Paso and need a room, this is a very comfortable hotel.I'm a platinum elite Marriott member and have stayed over 150 nights in Marriott's this year.  I have seen my share of hotels and I have stayed in all 3 Marriott properties here in El Paso. I think they all have different perks. This is a great and SAFE location. Walmart is across the street as is a Cinemark movie theater and a classic MUST VISIT Mexican restaurant, Leo's. Its on Tue west side of town which is a bit of a drive (for El Paso) to downtown, etc. You can take 54 through the mountains for a scenic drive or to avoid crazy traffic.I stayed here for 2 weeks and had a great stay. Workout facilities are a bit lacking compared to others, but the jacuzzi and pool are quite nice. There is a Fairfield in the same parking lot for a different look that has free breakfast.DO NOT STAY HERE if you are a business traveler.  This is my third and last stay.  I am a rewards member and I like this brand, but their internet speed is atrocious.  They are always packed, and they don't have nearly enough bandwidth at this particular property.  DO NOT STAY HERE if you need Internet.  In addition the LTE network is also very thin here so not even your own connection will save you.I have stayed here multiple times. Very clean.good breakfast. Fitness center. A little loud due to being near a highway but that wasn't really an issue. Overall good experience.This place opened up a couple of years ago. And we were one of the first guest the hotel had.So, on our trip back to California we stopped again, because it was a nice place and we prefer to stay at SpringHill suites because they are constantly nice.Well, I am sorry to report that this nice new hotel just a couple years ago has lost its appeal. The hotel clerk was not customer service friendly, I dealt with her twice. The shower in our room didn't work right and the wall paper is peeling among other maintenance problems that should be addressed.To top it off, the pool was freezing, we had stopped at many hotels and enjoyed the heated pool, but this place just couldn't manage to do that. So enjoying the pool was out. Yeah I know El Paso is hot, but it was May. Staying somewhere else next time.We have stayed at this Marriott a few times, we were very pleased with the service until now. The front desk clerk named Sheryl was very rude to us from the moment we walked in. She snapped at us for asking a question about a charge, she also argued with us until we walked out. Will NOT be staying at this Marriott anymore!I was looking for a non sketchy hotel and found this little gem via Priceline. It was a first staying with this chain and it rocks! The room was spacious and cozy like a studio apt. Good breakfast with all the hot fixin's like waffles, sausages and cheese omelettes while including the cold fixins of fruit and cereals. Best breakfast value! I would definitely come back to this place again.It's always a pleasure to stay at a Marriott. This SpringHill Suites is in a pretty decent location with quite a few amenities nearby. Check-in was fast, simple, and easy and the staff was great. Oh, and Wi-Fi was free too!This is basically an upscale Motel 6.  Everything seemed ok until about 5am when I was awakened by 18-wheeler trucks shaking the shower and making too much noise along the highway which my room faced. There was some strange knocks on the same wall where my headboard was and I could hear pipes rattling around 5am. I could also hear the neighboring rooms shower running and drawers closing. Of course, I asked to switch rooms after only one restless night of this. The room itself was crammed and small even for 1 person.  The comforter in the bag had black smudges on it so it clearly hadnt been cleaned.  The shower still had soap residue and the lighting was bad in the bathroom area.  FOX and NBC channels went completely out at 7pm and ABC didnt work at 7am.  I called and the front desk was aware of the problem--which really sucked by the way.  When I switched rooms, the guy at the front desk said most people dont like being over there by the highway side. Then why would you put me over there then I thought. I'm an elite member. Breakfast was disgusting. The boiled eggs were brown looking, the sausage patties looked like they were 3 days old and salmonella covered, and I guess it was honeydew balls swimming in some kind of water, and there was no waffle maker.  The eggs and croissants were the only thing I could stomach. Very disappointing and not the typical Marriott breakfast quality at all. Id have been mad if I had to pay full rate for this. It is clean, and the location is decent to where I needed to be. There is a very small fridge but no freezer area within it which I was hoping for. The front desk personnel are really nice.   I think for the city, this is probably considered a nice area. It was mediocre at best. Nothing upscale and nothing section 8 looking.  Theres a bunch of fast food and low-end type eateries around which I dont eat at. I stopped at an Albertsons not far from the airport prior to my arrival which Im glad I did. I havent seen any commercial grocery stores in the immediate area.  It is close to the sunland park mall area where there's much better eating options and a Sprouts farmers market.  There is a Walmart but no CVSs or Walgreens anywhere. This will suffice for the few days im in own.  Hopefully I'll never have to come back to El Paso again for business but if I do, Im gonna have to stay somewhere else. I need peace and quiet when Im trying to sleep.What a deal! Clean, easy to find, and a great price.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gardner-hotel-el-paso-2,The Gardner Hotel,2.5,$,9,"For a cheap, quickly accommodating place, I was quite happy with my stay at the hostel. It obviously wasn't a five start hotel, but for 23 bucks i was given sheets and great service. I was given a room that had two bunks and could sleep four people to myself so there was no need to get a locker like other hostels. Sink in the bedroom and a shared shower and bath down the hall. I walked around the area in the evening and felt pretty safe. Good little restaurants in the area, and interesting history as well. When I came back, I was locked out but the front desk man quickly came running to the door to let me in. He told me he locks it after a certain hour to ""keep the ugly people out."" I told him thanks for letting me in, then.If you like hanging out at the bus station, you'll like this place. My husband picked the place because it was historic and the oldest hotel in El Paso. The downstairs was very cool and using the old elevator. But there was also a shabby quality that felt not so much hip and cool, but rather seedy. It's clear that the owner has tried to keep it up and running but with minimal input. In our room, curtains were falling, blinds, we're filthy. Not sure if there is AC or not but we could open the window. Our shower didn't work. I requested of my husband that we move to a different place for subsequent nights.Do you like the hairs of random strangers to grace your minimalist towel?Do you like when bugs magically appear in your bed over night?Do you like when the throbbing bass from an Adele dance remix wafts its way from the gayborhood into your hostel room on the third floor?Do you like when a hostel inexplicably has free wifi on every floor?If so, this is perfect for you!Also, lock your door at night. There are some interesting characters renting rooms month to month.I have had an actual nightmare about this place.bathrooms are shared and covered in mosquitos where as texas has the highest rating of west nile in the countrymen bringing prostitutes into the hotel as we were trying to check inno air conditioningnot cleannot well litnot safewindows above all doors so anyone of the creepy people that live there can push them in and crawl into your roomDO NOT STAY THERE GO BY THE AIRPORT FOR THE SAME PRICE!!I do not know how it got good reviews. I saw dead bugs along with hairs everywhere in my bed.Quirk El Numero Uno: There appears to be two websites. The old Gardner Hotel is one part hotel, three parts hostel. Depending on which you're looking for defines which URL should best suit you. Here's both:Hotel: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gardnerhotel.com%2F&amp;s=31aede267eecb9f254caa84656b6f53482e6848849346326a396436bc1587429"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">gardnerhotel.com</a>Hostel: <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elpasohostel.com%2F&amp;s=111b51c365ff433870f5927ef4a2463c7abcee0de912391f82a8f5589b814b3c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">elpasohostel.com</a>Quirk Secondo: There is a dramatic difference between the workers in the morning and in the evening. Reviews on hostel sites support this, as they almost all either love their experience or hate it. I asked around during my own stay, and it's pretty much been narrowed down to someone (or more) on evening shift that is the bad apple. Ergo, show yourself up 'n check in before the afternoon/evening. That should perk your experience immensely.Third: Hostelers be warned, this is one of the more pricey U.S. hostels. It comes in at over 25-bones. There was no free WiFi when I was there, although they had an Internet kiosk that you could pay to use. The kitchen is open to use, but you'll need to bring your own food. Lastly, the dorms are nothing fancy... and are more than a bit run down.Positives: This isn't the El Paso shelter... which is more of a prison than a safe haven. The hostel's location truly is superb. It makes an excellent launch point for almost any trip you're planning within forty or so miles. Also, El Paso has been consistently ranked among the top three safest metro areas in America. That ranking doesn't take into account the lithium content in the water reservoirs, or the corruption of the police force, but it's still a great place to wander around. Just remember that Ciudad Juarez--which is just across the bridge--sits on the opposite side of the safety spectrum.NOTE: I've never stayed in one of the private rooms of the hotel section. I hear they are clean, well kept and quite luxurious. I look forward to seeing a review from someone who's stayed in one just to hear back on the actual costs and if it's worth it..I was in town for a job interview and didn't have much to spend, so I took a chance on the hostel despite the reviews.  I must concur with others in that it is not the cleanest around, but in all fairness, i dont think the place is actually dirty, it is just visibly old and not well updated. It had a bed and a shower for a reasonable price, which was all I needed.  The place is not terribly charming, but the staff was friendly and accommodating.  I suspect I was one of few guests at the hostel- hardly saw anyone else.  If you are looking for a social place look elsewhere.  This is really just meant to be cheap housing for a brief period.  The basement has a kitchen, couches and a television and seems like it could be a decent place to congregate if the hostel had any guests.  The rooms are tiny and poorly lit, the bathroom is suspect, but if you go in expecting bare minimum facilities, you are set.Need to stay somewhere in El Paso for a few nights? Look no further than the Gardner, a hostel with character! You'll feel like you're taking a step back in time. This is a must for all you history buffs and fans of the ""Public Enemies"" movie, because this is the hotel where John Dillinger stayed in the 30s when he came through El Paso. The lobby has a vintage phone booth and switchboard, and a display case with lots of photos from a bygone era. The elevator is 70+ years old, and still works; it's like the ones you only see in old movies. Rooms are a bit small; I didn't care because I only needed to sleep. Free Wi-Fi in all rooms. There is a downstairs TV room with hundreds of channels. When I stayed there on Memorial Day weekend, I was able to lounge on the sofas and had the whole room to myself!  Front doors are locked after 10:00; you need to ring for the attendant on duty to open it up.  Walking distance: Bars, Dance clubs, Downtown El Paso (interesting art and history museums), and the border to Juarez Mexico. Also there is a wonderful Holocaust Museum nearby, well worth a few hours of your time. Also, if you are a movie buff, you have to check out the nearby Fellini Film Cafe, a coffee bar/restaurant/art-house video store that shows classic/artsy movies here on almost every night of the week. You could easily spend 2-3 days here without a car, but I would recommend one to see more of El Paso, or if you are doing road trips to Carlsbad Canyons or Roswell, New Mexico. If you stay here, the staff is very helpful.  This is the only place I stay when I am in El Paso.The only downfall is that they were painting all the hallways when I was there (May 2009). I'm sure they have finished by now.Disclaimer: I stayed here 8 years ago! I was driving cross country from LA to NYC with a friend who was moving from coast to coast. We were all about cheap yet interesting accommodations. This was our first night and I don't recall what side we were on but it wasn't luxurious or safe feeling so I am guessing the hostel side. In fact, we moved the room furniture in order to barricade ourselves in. Yes, we were that scared. Young and silly? Probably. Little did we know at the time it wouldn't be the scariest place we stayed during our adventure however. Obviously we survived but from what my hazy memory recalls I wouldn't want to stay there again. But hey, this was 8 years ago so you never know!",,,,,"['cheap', 'quickly', 'accommodating', 'place', 'quite', 'happy', 'hostel', 'obviously', 'five', 'start', 'hotel', 'bucks', 'given', 'sheets',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/coral-motel-el-paso,Coral Motel,4.0,$,9,"Inexpensive | Good location for climbers $If you're visiting El Paso to check out the Hueco Tanks Park, I recommend staying here. It's perfect for your budget. It's quiet, clean, a little dim, but we had no problems. The bathroom is a bit run down, but this place is decent.I recommend this place for any climbers that aren't camping in or near the climbing areas. Staying at this place is about 45 minutes away, near the airport, close to quick shops and good, cheap food, and you get a nice bed and a shower. Can't complain! We took 2 rooms because we went with our friends -- buddied up.We're looking to stay here every year in November for our annual bouldering trip :)This is a pretty cool old joint. Yes, ""Old"" being the key word. However, it still has everything you need, i.e. internet, HBO, a toilet &amp; a shower! What else do you need? Oh yes, it has a decent bed &amp; the sheets were clean.It's the old school motel where you park right in front of your room &amp; it's under cover as well. So very convenient! And at 45 bucks per night, what more could you want? If just passing through &amp; you need a place to take a load off, this place won't let you down.We were traveling and stayed at a different hotel in El Paso that my husband thought was fine but I found it to be kind of seedy. We found the Coral Motel in the lonely Planet guide and it had decent reviews on Yelp. This place was very clean, and very quiet. Staff was friendly. For a simple motel at a reasonable price, this was perfect and I would stay here again.If you need clean , but outdated , vintage motel - this place for you. A bit laud , in the morning , low clearance rain guards at front doors , so if you have tall truck , ask for height , or park in the middle of parking lot.Well, pricier than expected but very quiet and clean.  Checking in and out was the easiest I've experienced, amenities not existent but honestly; perfect for what we needed.Location was central to everything we did, parking was dedicated for your room and getting in and out of the parking lot was graciously simple.After reading the reviews we stopped and checked in. Good idea for someone who is looking for a clean well kept affordable nights stay. Staff was courteous and amicable. Room was clean. Parking in front if each room has plenty of space. Staff said they shampoo the rugs every 2 weeks and we saw that two were getting done. Safe place to stay. Walking distance from good food as well.If you are looking to spend a night or even a few nights at an affordable, yet clean place this is it. The staff are extremely helpful. I stayed for one night on my way to California. I had a Uhaul with an auto-transporter. The guy who checked me in helped me park the truck and showed me my room. He even turned on ESPN for me. If I'm ever passing through or staying at El Paso for a short period, I'm definitely coming here.Cool ""vintage"" motel in El Paso. Easy access to freeway, groovy rooms, free parking and internet.If you are looking for a nice hotel: somewhere where you are tempted to lift extra bottles of their free shampoo off the maid cart because they are giving out such quality stuff, the Coral Motel isn't for you.If you like kitsch and need a cheap, safe, comfortable place to stay the Coral Motel is probably a good bet.  There isn't much to the rooms, but they were relatively clean, and the beds (there were two in our room) were comfortable enough.  The shower had good water pressure, though we noticed that both the tub and toilet were very low to the ground.  Odd.  Lots of kitschy, old details too: elaborate headboards, a dial on the door for maid service, nice neon sign outside.  For one of the cheapest places to stay in El Paso, the Coral Motel is a good choice.",,,,,"['inexpensive', 'good', 'location', 'climbers', 'visiting', 'check', 'tanks', 'park', 'recommend', 'staying', 'perfect', 'budget', 'quiet', 'clean', 'little', 'dim', 'problems', 'bathroom', 'bit', 'run', 'place', 'decent', 'recommend', 'place', 'climbers', 'camping', 'near', 'climbing', 'areas', 'staying', 'place', 'minutes', 'away', 'near', 'airport', 'close', 'quick', 'shops', 'good', 'cheap', 'food', 'nice', 'bed', 'shower', 'complain', 'took', 'rooms', 'went', 'friends', 'buddied', 'looking', 'every', 'year', 'annual', 'bouldering', 'trip', 'pretty', 'cool', 'old', 'joint', 'yes', 'old', 'key', 'word', 'however', 'still', 'everything', 'need', 'toilet', 'amp', 'shower', 'else', 'need', 'yes', 'decent', 'bed', 'amp', 'sheets', 'clean', 'old', 'school', 'motel', 'park', 'right', 'front', 'room', 'amp', 'cover', 'well', 'convenient', 'bucks', 'per', 'night', 'passing', 'amp', 'need', 'place', 'take', 'load', 'place', 'won', 'let', 'traveling', 'different', 'hotel', 'husband', 'thought', 'fine', 'found', 'kind', 'seedy', 'found', 'coral', 'motel', 'lonely', 'planet', 'guide', 'decent', 'reviews', 'yelp', 'place', 'clean', 'quiet', 'staff', 'friendly', 'simple', 'motel', 'reasonable', 'price', 'perfect', 'need', 'clean', 'outdated', 'vintage', 'motel', 'place', 'bit', 'laud', 'morning', 'low', 'clearance', 'rain', 'guards', 'front', 'doors', 'tall', 'truck', 'ask', 'height', 'park', 'middle', 'parking', 'lot', 'well', 'pricier', 'expected', 'quiet', 'clean', 'checking', 'easiest', 'experienced', 'amenities', 'existent', 'honestly', 'perfect', 'needed', 'location', 'central', 'everything', 'parking', 'dedicated', 'room', 'getting', 'parking', 'lot', 'graciously', 'simple', 'reading', 'reviews', 'stopped', 'checked', 'good', 'idea', 'someone', 'looking', 'clean', 'well', 'kept', 'affordable', 'nights', 'staff', 'courteous', 'amicable', 'room', 'clean', 'parking', 'front', 'room', 'plenty', 'space', 'staff', 'said', 'shampoo', 'rugs', 'every', 'weeks', 'saw', 'getting', 'done', 'safe', 'place', 'walking', 'distance', 'good', 'food', 'well', 'looking', 'spend', 'night', 'nights', 'affordable', 'yet', 'clean', 'place', 'staff', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'night', 'way', 'auto', 'transporter', 'guy', 'checked', 'helped', 'park', 'truck', 'showed', 'room', 'turned', 'ever', 'passing', 'staying', 'short', 'period', 'definitely', 'coming', 'cool', 'vintage', 'motel', 'easy', 'access', 'freeway', 'groovy', 'rooms', 'free', 'parking', 'looking', 'nice', 'hotel', 'somewhere', 'tempted', 'lift', 'extra', 'bottles', 'free', 'shampoo', 'maid', 'cart', 'giving', 'quality', 'stuff', 'coral', 'motel', 'like', 'kitsch', 'need', 'cheap', 'safe', 'comfortable', 'place', 'coral', 'motel', 'probably', 'good', 'bet', 'much', 'rooms', 'relatively', 'clean', 'beds', 'room', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'shower', 'good', 'water', 'pressure', 'though', 'noticed', 'tub', 'toilet', 'low', 'ground', 'odd', 'lots', 'kitschy', 'old', 'details', 'elaborate', 'headboards', 'dial', 'door', 'maid', 'service', 'nice', 'neon', 'sign', 'outside', 'cheapest', 'places', 'coral', 'motel', 'good', 'choice']",[],[],[],[],"[('place', 10), ('clean', 9), ('motel', 8), ('good', 7), ('room', 6), ('parking', 5), ('need', 5), ('staff', 4), ('amp', 4), ('old', 4), ('looking', 4), ('coral', 4), ('park', 4), ('well', 4), ('rooms', 3), ('perfect', 3), ('front', 3), ('night', 3), ('quiet', 3), ('decent', 3), ('shower', 3), ('nice', 3), ('staying', 3), ('cheap', 2), ('yes', 2), ('location', 2), ('food', 2), ('safe', 2), ('every', 2), ('bit', 2), ('cool', 2), ('found', 2), ('everything', 2), ('affordable', 2), ('free', 2), ('getting', 2), ('passing', 2), ('simple', 2), ('climbers', 2), ('checked', 2), ('maid', 2), ('low', 2), ('lot', 2), ('recommend', 2), ('hotel', 2), ('shampoo', 2), ('bed', 2), ('reviews', 2), ('near', 2), ('toilet', 2), ('comfortable', 2), ('nights', 2), ('truck', 2), ('vintage', 2), ('walking', 1), ('rugs', 1), ('still', 1), ('fine', 1), ('yet', 1), ('access', 1), ('somewhere', 1), ('outside', 1), ('pricier', 1), ('pretty', 1), ('weeks', 1), ('areas', 1), ('friendly', 1), ('details', 1), ('auto', 1), ('choice', 1), ('joint', 1), ('tanks', 1), ('little', 1), ('complain', 1), ('dim', 1), ('school', 1), ('helpful', 1), ('extremely', 1), ('laud', 1), ('morning', 1), ('someone', 1), ('stuff', 1), ('stopped', 1), ('reasonable', 1), ('quick', 1), ('went', 1), ('buddied', 1), ('husband', 1), ('right', 1), ('easy', 1), ('idea', 1), ('sign', 1), ('traveling', 1), ('year', 1), ('close', 1), ('odd', 1), ('tempted', 1), ('amicable', 1), ('kitschy', 1), ('planet', 1)]","[(('coral', 'motel'), 4), (('you', 'need'), 4)]",[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-el-paso-airport-el-paso,La Quinta Inn El Paso - Airport,2.0,$$,13,"Booked a room at this hotel because it was close to the house we were moving into and they accepted pets free of charge. The bed was very comfortable and with it's proximity to a major highway and airport it wasn't too noisy. The room was not satisfactory, especially with the price we were charged. The carpets had stains that were easily removed, there was a bad odor, the toilet had trouble flushing anything solid. The worst part was the shower went from hot to cold several times during a normal 15 minute shower. The traffic to get out isn't that great either. I wouldn't stay here again.Because pictures can say so much more.....no working electric plugs in bathroom...gfi that won't reset....let's go swimming. ......nice parking lot. .....The reviews on this place are very correct. It sucks. It is very dated The attempts at updating and repair are fat short of what could be expected. Who ever is in charge has spent a lifetime receiving participation trophies....and believes just trying is enough. We travel for work and spend a lot of nights in hotels. I am very glad someone else had to pay for our 3 night stay here. I saw that one fellow (in the reviews)offered to pay for your stay if your unhappy.....hope he is rich if he is to be held to his word.Pass on this place....the many unhappy reviews are very spot on.....I edited this to include pictures cause. .  .....they explain the nausea so well.Not this LaQuinta! Even if you've noticed that LaQuinta has slowly declined in quality over the years and you still don't mind, you might want to pass this one up. Myself and a coworker stayed there just recently and both of our sinks and both of our shower tubs were clogged. He also found pubic hair in his sink and, in my room, a prior tenant had apparently knocked over a candle and spilled wax all over the floor and on the side of the box spring. Yes the prices there are quite reasonable, but I think it's time to go Motel 6 instead.The only real negative I had about this hotel was the location was pretty scary- Not far from Juarez. However with that said, the staff was great, the room was nice and the breakfast was one of the better ones we enjoyed on an 8 day trip.The have a roach problem the manger was rude. Charged my credit card many mistakenly times. I tried to talk with the manger about  it he refused to give me what was owed to me. I had to call The corporate office. To get things settled. Would never stay again west side is a better stay. I wouldn't give one star I had to, in order to post the review. I hope they see this review and change things.Room 147 mold smell could choke a cow!Woke up with a headache I got to believe from it.  This is an old road side motel they slapped a coat of paint on.  Stay far away!Was happy to hear about the price. Not happy with two full size beds instead of two queen beds. It's hard when you are coming in from out of town at midnight and you, your spouse, and your baby are tired. Not the best of feeling to open the door and see these beds. Plus,  I did not know that smoking hotels still existed. Then dead bolt did not work either. Im the kind of person who needs to make sure all locks work. Specially when the rooms have an outside door, and it looks like some kicked open the door or something. I always thought La Quinta were nice, but i guess theybare nolonger what they use to be. Other than that the employees were nice and th e rooms were clean. Thanks but no thanksIt's the preferred hotel closest to the east Juarez boarder Toll entrance, it's nice &amp; the employees are very hospitable. 3rd time I've stayed here for several nights and each time resulted in a good nights rest in a none smoking room. Cons: Although I've always booked a smoke free room. They some how manage to put me twice in a room that has a slight hint of cigaret smell lingering all over the room. Pros: After I kindly discussed the discomfort issue with the front desk, they kindly moved me away from the smoking side, to a completely none smelly room. Without any hassle what so ever.Pros: I noticed they allow pets to stay at the hotel as well. I saw several people with dogs. Good to know!Pros: They have a nice size pool to do back and forth laps in. Pros:  They have a small Gym room with several treadmills, Bike, elliptical, etc...Pros:  They have free breakfast. It's so worth it!On my last trip I forgot my $80 memory foam pillow and didn't notice until the next day. I called 2 days later and they said they will check the lost and found &amp; with the maids and call me back. Pros:  They found my pillow and the manager mailed it back to me, free of charge!  (I live in San Diego)I'll most likely use this place for every business trip I take. And refer friends too.We had no intentions of staying here, but we got stranded in El Paso when the car rental place had no cars (!?). We called to get a shuttle from the airport and it came quickly.  The people checking us in were very friendly.  Especially Clint, who helped me deal with Expedia to cancel the other reservation we couldn't get to.If only the quality of the room matched the quality of the people here.  The room itself was nothing special but was clean.  The sheets were fresh and the bed was comfy.  We were pretty happy until we saw the bathroom.  The bathroom could have used some bleach and I'm not sure how, but there were black scuff marks on the side of the tub.  Overall, it was a fair experience.  I'd be willing to give it another try because the staff was so great.Doesn't deserve a star! Was given a smoking room after I requested a nonsmoking room and after walking into the room, being surrounded the smell of smoke, seeing cigarettes in the ash tray and the nasty filth all over the room I returned to the front desk. When I walked in to the front desk and said ""Yeah, that room won't work. I need a nonsmoking room or I can go somewhere else."" I was told that if I didn't leave that the cops would be called and I would be removed and still charged for the room. If you want to be lied to, stolen from per say, sleep in filth, then this place is for you. Other than that.....stay away from here!We had just driven 14 hours from Los Angeles and checked in at 9:30 and went straight to our room. As we opened the door, the air conditioner was on, but the room was hot and stuffy.  We figured it may have just been turned on recently, so we gave it some time.  It never cooled down.  We called the front desk and they said they would send maintenance up to check.  We waited an hour and nobody came.  Called again to ask when maintenance was coming and they said ""Oh, he just went home for the day.""  We requested another room, but because there was a music fest in town, they were entirely booked, but tried to offer us a $10 discount. We tried to tough it out and sleep in the room.  About 3:30 in the morning we awoke to several 20-somethings outside talking/laughing loudly outside our room.  This went on for at least half an hour until we couldn't take it anymore and my wife got up to ask them to keep it down.  At this point we were wide awake and decided to leave less than 7 hours after check in.  I don't know if this is a common occurrence at this place or not, but we will never go back.  They did refund our money for the night though.  I suppose that's something at least.  They should have only booked the music fest people on one side of the building and left the other side for reservations and walk ins.  I feel sorry for anyone who was actually trying to sleep in the hotel that night.Looks can be deceiving but in this case they're right on. I might stay here again but it's not one of my favorite stops along the way. I especially didn't enjoy the dumpster pickup at 7 am. You can see Juarez, Mexico, murder capital of the world, from the southern rooms. It will probably make you not want to spend much time on the outside of your room, though I didn't feel particularly unsafe. The room was a half step above a Motel 6.  The 20% discount at Denny's next door was nice. That's a noticeable discount. Lots of shopping nearby (by car). Lobby seemed nice.we called in advance cause my husband and i were going to be doing a 13 hour drive through the desert.... we wanted to make sure that even though we were arriving late (around 4:30AM) that we would still have our room once we arrived and a late checkout the next day.  Once we arrived the guy at the counter told me we didn't have a reservation. and that we never called... being absolutely EXHAUSTED... this did not help my increasingly waning mood.  He spent 20 minutes tippity typing on the computer, and telling me that we were a ""no-show"", and that they don't have late checkouts. FOR REAL?!! Anyway... eventually we got our room... but after the day we had, we did NOT want to deal with douche bag mcgee at the front desk. Room was ok. Service... blah.ADDENDUM:  WE DID A SURVEY ABOUT OUR STAY, AND BECAUSE OF OUR RATING, THE GENERAL MANAGER REVIEWED THE TAPE OF OUR CHECK-IN, AND ISSUED US A COMPLETE REFUND FOR OUR TROUBLE...

http://www.yelp.com/biz/country-inn-and-suites-by-carlson-el-paso,Country Inn & Suites by Carlson,4.0,$$,17,"I came into town for work. My room was very good. The hotel is very nice. Plenty of parking and it's very safe.I ate at the restaurant and had three drinks. Service was excellent.I'm from Los Angeles so I know good Mexican food. I've also traveled throughout Mexico. The salsa is better than my mom makes--I couldn't get enough of it The ribeye steak was acceptable. But I kept going back to the salsa and Long Island Ice-T's.It was too cold to use the pool although I thought about itI would most certainly stay here againThe service was excellent but both the front desk and in the restaurant and barGreat place to stay in El Paso.Friendly helpful staff.  Clean rooms.  Quiet and card-gated for additional security. Little extras like a charging port to recharge assorted devices together on one desk instead of the typical scattering throughout room seeking plugs for multiple items. Close to the Interstate but to my relief, although I was on an outer perimeter, I heard NO Interstate,  parking lot or noise from other guests. My room had a refrigerator to store my travel snacks  and water.  Breakfast was included and offered hot selections such as eggs sausage and oatmeal, plus a nice assortment of fruit, cereal and breads. I even grabbed ice and coffee to go.They even offer room service.  I glanced at the menu and saw a decent selection had I wanted something.  I wished I hadn't checked in right after eating because they had an apple cranberry chicken salad that would have settled better than the Truck Stop junk I wolfed down in the car shortly before stopping.I was absolutely thrilled with my stay and will definitely stay here when traveling between Austin and Phoenix.Worst hotel stay I've had in a while. Family of 4 in double bed room, found out all they have are full size beds (according to call with front desk)...my wife and I can, and have managed on a queen before but a full is ridiculous.  They were also very stiff and uncomfortable beds...my kids tossed and turned all night.  I travel a lot and don't expect a ton from hotel rooms, but I'll definitely not stay here again.It didn't help that there were no additional bedding or pillows in the room and only a single set of towels total; this is simple stuff the room should come with.Country Inn &amp; Suites has quickly become one of my favorite hotel chains! I so enjoyed my recent stays here on a road trip to Los Angeles. This location in particular has a southwestern villa style to it which adds some local charm. I love the organization of the buildings and rooms so you're not directly next to someone else. The rooms are staggered in a way so it feels like you're in a private cabin. The beds are SO big and SO comfortable. Each room has a couch or lounge chair along with a desk + office chair. The rooms are very modern and clean.Free WiFi and free breakfast! The WiFi here was always spot on and fast. The breakfast was better than most hotels. Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fruit, toast, the whole nine yards. The eggs could use some improvement - they were pretty runny and seemed like they must add milk to make them more fluffy, much to my chagrin. During breakfast they have several 'servers' passing through ready to bring you anything that's missing and it's also implied that you should tip after your meal, even though it's 'free'. The front desk service here is superb! We ended up signing up for a Carlson rewards card. Would definitely recommend staying here if you're in El Paso!This hotel was a decent value:  $80/night (plus the unavoidable $13 tax, fee, tourist blah blah charges/night).  $280 for 3 nights. The hotel offers a 24/7 Shuttle which was offered to us, but didn't take, because I have great relatives willing to cart us around!The location was excellent for us:  Right off I-10, 1.7 miles to Sunland Park Casino, 5-10 minutes to Downtown (we arrived in El Paso by train). The airport was 25 minutes away (we picked up a rental car).  Nearly every fast food chain is nearby, as well as one of the better malls, Sunland Park Mall. We didn't partake of the bar (closed at 10 pm on Saturday night) nor Room Service (4pm-10pm only).  We didn't need housekeeping either, but of course, still left a gratuity. We're pretty low maintenance travelers. The security here is good requiring a room key card for access to the property. Our room must have been recently renovated because there was a slight smell of fresh paint. No worries for us there.  The decor was new and modern. The beds and pillows were very comfy. They seemed new. The bathroom was sparkling clean and likewise seemed newly spiffed up. We did have a blow dryer, but didn't use it. The complimentary toiletries were numerous (the usual items plus mouthwash, make up removal towelletes, lotions, etc.).  The complimentary breakfast had hot items (scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, biscuits and gravy one day of three, waffles, oatmeal), mini breads/pastries, cereal and beverages in a very nice, large, bright lobby area.  We tipped $3 for each of us each time we ate. This breakfast was a great start each day for us. Wifi in our room (building 8) was excellent enough for us to do our company employee payroll online. The 40-50 cable channels on the 40-inch flatscreen were adequate for us. Parking near our room was perfect; about 20 steps. Towels were plentiful enough for the two of us. The coffee maker, microwave and a bigger than average room fridge were perfect. We saw an iron, but no ironing board. We didn't have a room safe.  There was no writing pad or pen. None of these things were an issue to us, but may be to some. Our stay was generally excellent, but I took away a star for the following:The room lighting could have used one more lamp. The ice machine closest to our room wasn't working so we had to find an operational one. The porch light was out, the duration of our stay.  And finally, it was a bit of a maze to get to the Lobby from our room. The assisting signage is fine for daytime, but can be problematic at night. Overall, we would absolutely stay here for the same rate!I searched for a good deal during our trip from San Diego to San Antonio and I came across this place. I read some other reviews and compared them with a few other reviews across the way and down the street. Praying to find a decent place to rest. I found this place. We checked in at the front lobby and I admit, it looked very nice! We headed for the room twisting through the maze of hall ways a bit confused after driving for so many hours, we finally found the room. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in the room. It smelled and looked clean. The bedding was fresh and fairly new. The bed was comfortable and I liked the pillows. The mini fridge was turned down too low. I turned it up full temp and by morning my ice tea was almost frozen. Since it was 45 degrees out this Dec. 20th. We turned the heater on. It worked great pumping out plenty of heat. The only problem was that it was kinda loud and I am a medium to light sleeper. I did manage to sleep for 6 hours before it woke me up which is pretty good for me. We called for guest services and they arrived within minutes. Great service! Very prompt. I am Feeling satisfied with this stop. I would recommend it. Room 4201 was good besides the small trek from the car. Happy camping!! <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> $71 for a Saturday night.We stayed one night during a road trip from Los Angeles to Austin and were SO happy to have found this place. It was $79 a night including a pet fee for our cat. We got a king bed that was unbelievably comfortable and exactly what we needed after 12 hours of driving. The lobby area is really fancy and newly remodeled; they said earlier in 2015 it was completely re-done. The rooms as well. I don't know what they looked like before but they are top notch now. The check-in staff were really friendly. We didn't use the pool or gym but they both look top notch as well. We will recommend Country Inn to anyone stopping through El Paso and we will certainly stay here again.We checked in after driving all day, we checked in around 8pm. Front desk and lobby were excellent. We got our keys and headed to our rooms and everything was fine. We decided to order food around 850pm. The front desk clerk told us the kitchen closed at 10pm, so we ordered something simple. we got our food at 1050pm. They told us that there was a party done stairs, after we called and asked where was our food was. We order mac and cheese and shrimp pasta, once again something simple because we knew the kitchen would be closing soon. not only did the order come late, they didn't give us forks!!! we had spoons!! for linguine!! why would you do that? anyway,the guy had to go back and get it, he came back 15 mins later!!! He was very short with us, as if he was mad that we had called back to ask for such a thing. He handled me my receipt and got out of dodge.There was also 1 towel in the bathroom. No rag, no soap.Also for those who bring an apple tv or ps4, just know the tv won't switch to any other inputs, unless you UNHOOK the cable coax.Internet is horrible, i just stayed at the radisson where it was phenomenal, and after reading reviews here i was thinking it would be very similar, but boy oh boy was i wrong. I will never stay here again. I would rate it a one star, but the bartender was awesome and the front desk clerk was on point, but overall,this place left a sour taste in my mouth. Don't stay unless you have too, at least at the el paso in texas.Not happy at all. Internet connection is extremely slow, food was delivered hour and a half after was ordered, was brought without forks and napkins soaking in the sauce. We were still charged for a food. They gave us ""complimentary"" sloppy joes because of that, but they were spicy and too saulty, we couldn't even eat them (Outstanding  Staff.  Great price $80+taxes. Free breakfast. Manager's special 6-7 PM. One of a kind high end Country InnWhat a beautifully appointed well run hotel.. The renovations are fantastic and the service impeccable.Full service with 3 meal restaurant and a lounge. complimentary WiFi and hot breakfast served on real china not styrofoam. I'll be back!The location is about 8 miles from downtown El Paso and sits right on Interstate 10. The area is safe and suburb like with a nearby mall and restaurants. We arrived at 11am on a Sunday thinking there was no way we were going to get an early check in, but they accommodated us. The lobby is newly renovated and modern. Free continental breakfast and the lobby does have a bar. The rest of the hotel is divided into sections, some of which you have to drive your car to. All rooms have an outside door. No elevators. This was a struggle trying to carry two 50 pound suitcases up a flight of stairs. The rooms do look a lot better on the website but they are remodeled and fairly clean. The noise level is quiet for being next to the Interstate but you hear every door slam from other nearby rooms. The bed was comfy and I appreciated the nice shower and good water pressure. The price was right at under $100 a night and I would stay again.We loved our stay here. The price was right. The location was great with many convenient stores near by. Located near the freeway, but you'd never know it because it was very quiet. Didn't like being put upstairs but, meh. The A/C worked great! Since the hotel is non smoking, a suggestion I would make would be to put cigarette containers outside, or you'll end up with butts everywhere or worse people putting them out on the walls outside. Just preventive maintenance. Another suggestion would be to make sure the housekeepers wipe doors down and check the recliners for cleaning. They are doing a great job otherwise because the room was very clean! The carpet was very clean to the naked eye. We will be back!!Having traveled to Louisiana and back to California this has been the best place we've stayed at. It's amazing really nice and comfortable and the staff is really nice and accommodating. Would definitely recommend to others traveling through this part of town.From the moment we walked to the front desk we were treated as valued guests. The room was comfortable and spacious. Slept soundly in the king size bed. Also, we ate a filling dinner in the restaurant. Fish and chips (or sweet potato fries in my case) which was delicious. And my husband had a jalapeno burger and fries that he stated was great too. Would stay here again.Appeared nice from the outside but beware not to get stuck with room not renovated as I just did. A/C doesn't blow cold air, TV screen is wavering, room carpet has major stains. Also room did not have shampoo or conditioner. Found empty bottle of Ensure on nightstand as well. Will be taking with the front deskThe most amazing secret paradise in El Paso!!!! The hotel is amazing... Like being at a resort! Beautiful landscaping... Gorgeous rooms...and fantastic resort style pool!!! Food is phenomenal!!! Added bonus... margaritas are delicious!!! Stay here!!!

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-el-paso-airport-el-paso,Holiday Inn El Paso Airport,3.0,$$,15,"While I was reading the Yelp reviews when I was staying here, I had to double-check the address to make sure I was in the same place. Wow, I thought this Holiday Inn was pretty cool.There are three blocks of the usual mid-level name brand hotels facing this stretch of I-10 &amp; the airport, and I'm guessing they must do those weird hotel shuffle things, when one place completely exchanges their building &amp; identity with another. You know, when you come back a year later and go, ""Huh?""In any case, this particular Holiday Inn sure looked like the newest building on the block to me - big, bright, cheery, a happy staff, and an immaculate room with a really comfortable bed. And that's just frosting, because my cake is all about the big three for free: Parking, WiFi, and a hot breakfast that won't make me puke. It's how I filter my hotel searches online. And among the five hotels that popped up for this unexpected overnighter in El Paso, this place also had the best price, using my Triple-A card. And there's a 24-hour Taco Cabana &amp; Walgreen's in the same parking lot. I'm pretty much a fan of ""Score!""The staff at this hotel is exceptional, they go out of their way to accommodate your needs to make your stay comfortable.The rooms are spotless as well as the hotel. Not in airport but 2 miles away. On highway so ask for a higher floor.Hotel was nice... But...Breakfast staff was rude. Found used lube in my friends room. NASTY!!! When they went down to complain ""the only thing they could do for them was to reimburse them $25."" Took over an hour to get towels sent to our room. Shower went ice cold halfway though my shower. Was told I couldn't get a room key because ""they had ran out."" I had called and asked if they could send someone up to clean our room around 3pm (was told they would send staff up to do so) then called to confirm sending someone an hour later (was told again they would send someone) returned to my room 2 hours later to find out no one had done so. When I went down to ask the manager about it he informed me they had sent their cleaning staff home at 2:30.Definitely not worth paying the $136 a night. Won't be staying here again.This Holiday Inn is conveniently located 10 minutes from the airport.  It's freeway location made it easy to spot from a distance. I walked through the front doors and was greeted by friendly hotel clerks. The decorations inside resembled classic Spanish style buildings with a full lounge area and bar. The pool and gym were inside the main entrance of the hotel. Once inside the room, it was obvious they took great care of the rooms. I normally find that hotels have a funny smell but my room smelled fresh.  On day two I went to the gym and found two treadmills, an elliptical machine and a set of weights. Small but adequate.  The customer service was average. There was nothing that stood out. Overall a good experience.This hotel is decent enough but they have insanely loud music every night until 2 am. I couldn't sleep. Tonight the have a full on DJ in the lobby... It's literally like having a room at a nightclub. We got our money back and went to a nearby hotel. Would never, ever come back here.This is strictly based on their customer service for reservations.  I called in today to the 800 number to set a reservation for hubby's bowling tournament going on there at the El Paso Convention Center this year.  I asked if there was a bowlers discount and the young man told me I had to call to the El Paso Holiday Inn directly.  Broken English but understandable however he kept interrupting me.  Called the Holiday Inn directly in El Paso, must have been busy because I waited on hold for a while however that I can get over.  Young lady named Suzanna answered.  Sounded young and unsure of herself.  I let her know the dates we were coming and that we were there for the USBC Nationals and asked if there were discounts for the bowlers.  She fumbled verbally at me then asked me for my phone number and said someone would get back to me in 5 minutes.  That was 2 1/2 hours ago.  We called Ramada, spoke with Arturo (excellent and very helpful) got our room booked with everything we need as well as getting a very nice little discount.Do not be fooled. The way the hotel looks from the outside is nothing how the rooms are. From the outside this hotel looks nice and modern, but the rooms are old and not very nice. Lets put it this way, the thermostat in the room was probably older then I am. When I arrived the room had cigarette butts on the floor and stunk like cigarette (in a hotel that is supposed to be smoke free). The decor is just so outdated and old fashioned. There are many other hotels in El Paso that are less expensive and have a lot nicer rooms. On the positive side the manager is really nice and was very helpful with everything, it's not her fault the hotel rooms haven't been renovated. The lobby is also very nice and there is a bar inside.Am currently staying here on business. I am very happy with the suite room, it's spacious and well-equipped with a microwave, mini-fridge, and individual coffeemaker. King size bed is one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. HUGE HD TV in the room. Internet can be spotty.Join the Priority Club for Holiday Inn and get free breakfast buffet or 2 free drinks daily. Close to major highways and many restaurants. The restaurant in the hotel has fantastic service and the food is fairly tasty for a hotel restaurant.Only downfall is the presence of Teddy's Flame Room downstairs, which can attract some interesting clientele, but fortunately I am staying on the opposite side of the hotel from it, so it hasn't affected my stay too much. Staff has been attentive and maid service has been more than adequate.This was nice. Staff cool (meaning not overly friendly but sufficiently helpful and available). Better said, The room I stayed in was nice. No complaints. It was clean, cool, smelled nice... everything you expect from a $100+ per night hotel room. But I don't remember breakfast being memorable. (That could be a good thing...)pet friendlystaff provided me with current promos. very informative and pleasant.received free vouchers for drinks at the barplenty of free bottled water.inexpensive stayThis is really a little above your average Holiday Inn.  This is not an express so the establishments got its own charm!!  Right behind a Starbucks too, so that's gotta be some extra brownie points!!  But the rooms were nice, it fit the price, they had a nice pool.  They gave me free booze all week so that in its own is 4 stars!!  In other words, other then it being in El Paso, Texass...  it was a comfortable stay!!  Recommended, indeed!I went here and lasted 5 minutes.Totally NOT for me..lol. Everytime I think about that place I hear Missy Elliot's "" Get your freak on"" playing in my head.Good place to stay, fast check-in and check out. HD TV with HBO, Discovery, ESPN and other channels in every room. Streaming videos on demand. Clean room, clean beds, overall a good place to stay. Starbucks right next door.Very nice hotel! The lobby and other common areas were very clean and bright. The front desk staff was very attentive and friendly.Make sure you tell the front desk people how often you want your bed sheets changed. I stayed three nights and my bed linens were never changed. When I asked at the front desk about this, they said it was the guest's responsibility to request fresh linen.Don't go out for breakfast. Have it at their breakfast buffet. It's not the least expensive breakfast but the food is awesome! Everything is fresh and the service is great. For your entertainment, there's a lobby bar and Teddy's Lounge is connected to the hotel. They were doing karaoke the night I visited. There's also a Starbucks next to the property - an easy walk.Need to read something ""bad""? The ice machine on my floor didn't work. The wall paper in my room had a huge rip in it. This is definitely a great place to stay!This place was terrible, the only redeeming quality was the shuttle driver. Too expensive to get a place with stains on the hallway carpet, molding coming off the baseboards and an awful smell outside the hotel.",,,,,"['reading', 'yelp', 'reviews', 'staying', 'double',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-and-suites-el-paso-airport-el-paso-2,Holiday Inn Express & Suites El Paso Airport,4.0,$$,13,"Literally so happy we decided to stay here. They have this Monday night football social with cold cuts, chips, and lemonade. After a long trip, it was so nice to just come in, fix a sandwich, and head to bed. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable.The staff is amazingly sweet! Valerie, the director of sales, was so nice. She took time to tell us about spots to visit in the town and was just overall super hospitable. We plan on staying here again for sure!All I can say is WOW I stayed here 3 nights. I hesitated to stay at a express but man I'm glad I did.  From Friday 19-21 it was nothing short of comfort. The person that was preparing the breakfast he was so helpful so friendly and suggested some pretty awesome places to go and to eat. Adrian at the front desk make sure all our needs were met. I thought I was a model show because the people here are all well very attractive. And yet their hospitality was top-notch. Management at this hotel is doing something right and I hope he/she does not stop. I've stayed at some pretty nice places including Fifth Avenue in New York and I have never come across such clean, friendly staff at a hotel. Keep up the great work!I highly recommend this hotel its new its clean and the staff is very friendly!! There is a restaraunt an bar onsite so you dont have to look far for food if your from out of town! I think the price for this hotel is well worth the stay!! In fact its a steal of a deal!! Ask for Jessica or Mary they are the best!!!Very impressed with this hotel. At the price I expected a lower standard but pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness, accomidations, included breakfast, and the comforts afforded to higher costing hotels.First time staying here. When I checked in it took a while because the guy was new and he tried to tell me I had to pay more when I already had a locked in reservation with a certain rate. He told me I needed to speak with a manager in the morning about it. I can go on about some of the comments he made such as eluding to me ""smuggling in a pet"" after he told me about the no pet policy and I told him that I did not have a pet with me. The next morning I spoke wisdom wine else who took care of it so no biggie. The toilet in my room (402) felt unstable. The sheets on the bed are relatively thin and the housekeeping staff sometimes play loud music in the morning so on the one day of my work week where I could sleep until 8 it was ruined. But 4 stars because the staff were all friendly, professional, and courteous. The free hot breakfast has a variety of hot and cold options. The dining area is clean, spacious and inviting. The gym is 24/7, small but clean and have a variety of cardio machines and a few free weights. Nothing fancy but it gets the job done. The airport is about 1.5 miles away approx 8 minute drive. There is a hotel shuttle and apparently it goes other places than the airport. I took the shuttle to the airport for my departure and there were two gentleman on there who were going to Best Buy so there must be a radius. I was displaced from my coworkers on this trip due to last minute reservations so this place is not my first option but if I had to stay here again, I would. There is no nice welcome for being an IGH member like with HiltonHonors but.... oh well the free breakfast makes up for it to me LOLClose to airport. Large dining room for continental breakfast. Suite rooms are very nice. Rooms are clean beds are comfy and every thing is in great shape. Kitchen living room and bathroom are all in great shape and clean. If I ever fly in here again I will definitely stay hereMy wife and I were supposed to be driving through El Paso to get back home to San Antonio but had to stop here and stay the night as a winter storm had made road conditions dangerous along I-10 in Ft. Stockton. Checked in late and for only one night but everything was comfortable and clean. Attentive front desk staff, security guard walking the premises and a helpful breakfast crew. The room was just adequate but the bed was very comfortable and that is really all I care about on an overnight stay. Checked in, slept, ate breakfast, and then left. Good experience overall and price seemed comparable to other area hotels according to Priceline.Clear, comfortable, standard Holiday Inn Express. You know what to expect and they don't disappoint. No restaurants within walking distance, and the airport shuttle and breakfast operate late on weekend mornings, (had to get a cab to the airport for a 6am flight). Still, more than adequate. Note that rooms on the north end have a lot of highway noise,Exceptional customer service and great breakfast!  The room itself is quite clean and has everything one might need except a fridge.  Wish we had te to check out the pool though (7am-10pm operation times)Nice hotel. I am a raving fan of Holiday Inn and I will say the service I received as a late arrival was great. The rooms are clean, building is clean and I will stay here again. Breakfast is your typical pre-processed food but the coffee was fresh. I have no issues with this location and would recommend to the traveling family or business traveler.I had a good experience here, but its a Holiday Inn Express, so how high can you really rate it? Breakfast starts at 6:30, which is a bit late for me. Much of the breakfast food is pre-processed. There is no restaurant or bar.Recently constructed, so it looks new and clean everywhere.So far so good! Rooms are nice the pool is clean and the service is with a very nice smile. Im happy!So clean! We would definitely stay her again.",,,,,"['literally', 'happy', 'decided', 'night', 'football', 'social', 'cold', 'cuts', 'chips', 'lemonade', 'long', 'trip', 'nice', 'come', 'fix', 'sandwich',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/ramada-el-paso-el-paso,Ramada El Paso,3.0,$,22,"We have stayed here many times, and have been happy.  The rooms are spacious, with a kitchenette.  The rooms are usually clean, but if the are not they will find you another room.  If you are nice to them they will be nice to you.  It is not as close to the border as people have said, please don't get the wrong idea.  Yes, it is very close to the freeway. But most of the rooms are quiet.we have never had any problems here, and sometimes we have a trailer full of stuff.  The hot tub is usually enjoyable. But we usually avid the pool, because it is too cold for my liking.  The breakfast is enjoyable.Very good quality room for $60/night. We truthfully didn't expect much, but were pleasantly surprised. (Arrived on 5/8/15, departed 5/9/15). The hotel is not located in too great of an area, its right near the border, so we didn't venture around too much at night time.The room was spacious and didn't feel cramped. We stayed in a non-smoking room which included a King-sized bed, kitchenette (equipped with an electric two-burner stove, sink, full size refrigerator and freezer, microwave, and coffee maker), dining table, living room area, a large flat-screen TV, and a nice bathroom.We settled in our room and everything seemed to be in working order until we tried to use the stove. The burners would not work. We called the front desk (around 10pm) and they came to take a look at our stove. The front desk employee told us he would need to contact his maintenance guy and come back to try and get it fixed. We waited about 20 minutes before the same front desk employee (not maintenance) came. We were a little puzzled that he was the one doing the fixing, but he ended up getting the burners to work. For some reason, they were not connected.... strange. But nevertheless, our problem was taken care of.Everything else in the room was fully functional. The kitchenette does not include any dishes or silverware, but I think they are available upon request, although, I am not certain of this. (*Please double check with them directly, if this is important to you!) We brought our own, just in case. The shower/bathtub was a good size and there were plenty of towels in the room. The flat screen TV was very clear and had a lot of different channels to choose from. I liked how the TV could be moved around on the mount so you can view it from all areas of the room. The King bed was very comfortable and we woke up well rested.Our stay included complimentary breakfast, which is offered between 6-9am (I think?) in a small room located across from the front desk in their main lobby. Once again, we weren't expecting a whole lot of choices, but there were proved wrong again! They had Yoplait yogurts in various flavors, small danishes, bagels and cream cheese, muffins, oatmeal, eggs, and you could even make your own waffles. For drinks, you had a choice of orange juice, cranberry juice cocktail, coffee, or tea. We enjoyed our breakfast!The only thing that put a damper on our stay was the attitude of the girl working the front desk that morning. We had a little confusion at check-out about whether our AAA discount could be applied to our stay. I mentioned her that I had contacted someone at the front desk the day before and they ensured me that the discount could be applied. She said that she had no idea and that I would have to call Wyndham directly to find out. I asked her if she had that phone number and she shrugged her shoulders and was absolutely no help. I was irritated that she didn't even try to address the issue or look into the situation. So instead of leaving on a happy note, we left frustrated.BUT, for the most part, we liked this place.We stayed 2 nights here and received the worst customer service EVER.... Stayed in a room which the lock on the door was broken, hole in the wall where door hits by the front door, rips in the furniture, missing picture on the wall, broken baby glass food container in the fridge and to top it off the front desk lady was accusing us to have done all this and was rude about giving us a new room... I will never ever EVER stay here or any other Ramada ever again. People here hate their job and you can tell. What a waste of money.We really enjoyed our stay at this property, rooms were well kept and staff was courteous and helpful. They are also pet friendly, which is a huge plus especially in the El Paso area.I will definitely stay here again.This place was alright. I stayed for one night and it was just okay. The rooms look like they were trying to be renovated, but it was a major fail. Granite countertops with peeling paint on the walls along with little nicks and holes. The front desk didn't seem welcoming, but like I said, I only stayed here for one night. Oh, also the side of the hotel I was placed on is directly next door to the Harley Davidson store so there was quite a bit of noise.... And the hotel is located right off the freeway on a busy Main Street. They do serve a continental breakfast but didn't stay long enough. I left b4 the sun came up. Would only come here again if I have to.Room itself was nice, but the grounds and area left something to be desired. There was a gym, but the door didn't close properly leaving the cold air (34 degrees  outside) to blow in. Yes, a gym should be kept cool, but that's a bit much. Many men hanging out and/wandering around. One asked me which room I was in and what I was doing for the evening--i gave him a look and he didn't ask again. A couple of them were watching my car with such interest that I moved it. Did not feel safe. Breakfast was a so-so continental one, but its free.Thanks ramada. I never understood, how you can be so lazy to just leave the body's after killing them. Really hit the spot. So very disappointing. Please keep a cleanse environment.We stayed here 02-07-15. I thought it was in a bit of a sketchy area when we arrived but we had no issues. The room was just okay overall. It was very spacious. The TV had something wrong with it. We asked to be moved &amp; an employee swiveled the tv and fixed the picture sort of. It would still go in and out. Room 208 needs a new TV. The kitchenette was nice, but had no pots, dishes or silverware. The fan in the bathroom made a loud obnoxious noise. The bed was comfortable though. The noise levels were minimal. Not a bad place to stay if you have a budget.Bedbugs make for a bad nights sleep and the breakfasts leave much to be desired.  The beds are hard but you get used to them.  This is definitely a two star motel.What a dump.   I'm traveling from AZ to San Antonio, TX and decided to stay here the night.  It sits on a loud road.  When I was given my first room, it smelled so foul.  Then I tried to turn on the lights and half of them didn't work.  The TV screen was fine on 30% of the screen and 70% looked like an invasion from Mars.  The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows and sheets were incredibly cheap.  The shower was grotesque but the water pressure was great.  Honestly, the only reason to come here is the rate--$80.  I don't know why, but in El Paso, hotels that are normally quite inexpensive are expensive and this was the only place that didn't cost around $150.  I would have been happy to pay an extra $70 for a nicer experience.Clean. A good value for what you pay. The service left a lot to be desired. But that might be the norm for the area. The options to here are $10 less but this place was worth the extra $10.  the only problem we has was that when we arrived a few hours early to check in they charged me $20.  Overall it was a good experienceRooms are nice &amp; super clean. Comes with coffee in room &amp; kitchen with stove top an large fridge, huge bed, couch. and its pet friendly !  We had been driving all night and they let us check in early, which was nice of them. Continental breakfast was empty by 9 am and they didn't put out anymore wafffles :''''(. Great experience tho, especially for the price.People with disabilities, beware! I checked out both 'accessible' rooms and they were identical: door keys refused to work, toilets were small &amp; not ADA-acceptable. Bathroom space was SMALL. The two ice machines are outside at the far ends of the parking lot and one was broken (Mexico's border is very close so wandering around the parking lot looking for ice was not my favorite thing to do at 10 PM). The room was clean and cheap (82.00), but we wouldn't stay here again.Well here is my update on our stay at the Ramada El Paso.  I can not say how surprised we were!  The king room was fabulous.  Clean, homey feeling.  Smelled wonderful when we walked in.  Almost felt like a studio apartment really.  Had a nice sitting area with a couch and the flat screen TV could be angled to face the couch or the bed.  Fridge and freezer, two burner stove, 4 cup coffee maker with coffee provided, creamer and sugar as well as 2 paper cups, nice size vanity with good lighting, microwave, hair dryer.  Our remote wasn't working properly and we needed some extra towels and those were both taken care of promptly after a call to the desk.  The complimentary breakfast was so much more than just the typical muffin and coffee.  Choice of yogurts, muffins, danish, bagels &amp; cream cheese, waffles, eggs, coffee, tea, orange and apple juice and a few more items.  Took advantage of the hot tub and after a long drive that was a nice treat.  Swimming pool was not heated and it was just a bit chilly for a dip but on a hot summer day it would be great.  Our only complaint and it's not really a complaint was the young gal at the desk.  Not very personable.  Very business like, which in most cases is a good thing, but no smile or friendly attitude.  Did nothing wrong so I can't fault her in her ability to do her job but a friendly disposition would have been nice after a 1200 mile trip in.  Same goes for the gentleman checking us out.  Professional attitude but not very friendly.  My husband put it like this ::  ""It was as if we were bothering them.""  Again not a big deal since we enjoyed our stay in all other aspects.  So for $59 a night I would HIGHLY recommend this Ramada.Wow - what a hidden gem in El Paso.  I've stayed at several places in the El Paso area over the years and all but one was $40 or so more per night and only half as nice.  I'm super impressed with the nice room layout, full kitchen area and the nice sleeper sofa would be great if I ever had more family along.Really enjoyed my stay here.  Very reasonably priced for what you get.  It had a full kitchen with large refrigerator and stove, table and chairs.Arrived in El Paso after a 4 hour drive from Albuquerque around 9:30pm. Wasn't expecting much considering what I paid for. But, when I opened the door to the room I was surprised how nice it was. Kitchen, little living room area with a couch, and a brand new bathroom. You could smell the newness in the air. The shower was so relaxing and comfortable. I love this hotel. Wish I didn't only stay for a night.Not a picky guy and in the military, but this hotel had hairs allover the bed/pillows (not ours!), it was disgusting. I called in and told them about it, so they moved us to another room and there still hairs (fewer) in the bed. We just decided to stay since were so tired and got there at 9pm. I drove 8+ hours and before that I woke up at 5am to go to work. Good thing is we brought our own bed sheets/blankets/pillows for the long trip from Fort Hood to Las Vegas. If you don't plan on bringing your own bed sheets, you can call the front desk and ask them. Ill give them a 3 star, because even though there were hairs in the bed, they still were nice and tried to move us to a cleaner room. We reserved online and paid $59 for a night with free breakfast.Worst experience of our 15 day road tripArrived 3/29/2013, departed 3/30/2013.We booked a non-smoking king, accessible.  Room 126 had the non-smoking sign ripped off the door and the room had been smoked in very recently.  We moved to 159 that had no towels.  At about midnight, sewerage boiled up in the bathtub creating a couple of inches of, well, you know.  My wife called the office.  The girl said she would call the manager and we could move to another room.  There were no other accessible king rooms.  We waited to see if the effluent would drain and it, eventually, did.  We finished the night.The female who handled the checkout came just short of calling us liars.  She took our number and said she'd have the manager call.  I will not hold my breath.  Regardless, the conditions and treatment remove Ramada from any future travel plans.Ok first of all the sign says Ramada .....  Don't let that fool you cuz this is ghetto Ramada.  Thank god I brought my gun or we would have had to have taken turns ""on watch duty""  upon driving in, going to check in to our room all seemed ok  so far so good  got to the room which appearance seemed ok  the problem is all the occupants (and/ or residence) seemed to be hookers and/pimps and drug addicts/dealer lurking around in the darkness.  We literally had to arm ourself (bring a gunfire all u non gun people) just to get ice  I haven't seen any bugs but I assure u a thorough search was made by the Gf.  So lesson learned just becuz there is a good name on the sign doesn't mean it lives up to standards. Hell for all I know they stole the sign ......All I can say is gun at bedside round in chamber sleeping just fine tonight.","Besides the one roach on the floor, I don't think it's so bad. Cheap, 32"" Tv, kitchen area, nice size rooms. Bring your own covers and pillow, just in case.Where to begin. Pulling up to the hotel it looked nice and the lobby looked fancy. Our first issue was the clerk needed to stop while checking us in to answer the phone. Apperantly it was someone that just checked in and was not happy the pool was closed even though it was advertised as being open and heated. The clerk was very rude in the way he handled the situation and I gathered from the converation the person was going to checkout and leave. As we got to our room we could see the age of the building and how the older exterior was painted over without being repaired. The steps are old and need to be replaced, you can see the age in the wood. Our room looks ok but the floor is as bumpy and uneven as a fairground fun house. There is actually a spot in front of the sink that feels rotted. The bathroom is so small you have to step around the toilet to open and close the door. The cleaning staff speak no english. We were trying to ask for a new do not disturb sign because ours blew off and in trying to point at what we needed she was going to use her key just to let us in a random room. Lastly, the first night, there was a bunch of people partying out in the parking lot at 11pm and then the next day there were people having arguments in the parking lot for a good part of the afternoon that just left an uneasy feeling with us. Oh and the sink was stopped up.",,,,"['many', 'times', 'happy', 'rooms', 'spacious', 'kitchenette', 'rooms', 'usually', 'clean', 'find', 'another', 'room', 'nice', 'nice', 'close', 'border', 'people',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-el-paso-el-paso-2,Residence Inn El Paso,3.5,$$,12,"Stayed one night on my way to San Antonio. Nice clean accommodations. Quiet and relaxing. Breakfast was delicious as always. Residence inn never fails to impress!!!I always try to find the best things to say about people but in this case there are no words which can positively describe this experience. It's late and we drove from Houston TX heading back home to the Central Coast, CA. Decided to snag a Hotwire hotel deal for the night which offers super great rates (using them since 2004) Upon arrival the front desk was unmanned. We waited 17 min for the receptionist to show up. When she walked down the hall no explanation or concern was given for her absence. I advised we booked a Hotwire deal and her attitude was as if I kicked her in the back. She was abrupt, didn't smile, and refused to offer a room with two beds verses a bed and sofa bed. After 40 min of trying to reason with her I finally called Hotwire and the representative there found her so unreasonable that he canceled my reservation out of frustration (he called her and they went back and forth for about 15min trying to convince her she has the power to make the change).Finally once the reservation was canceled we walked across the parking lot to holiday inn where we were welcomed with smiles and laughs (see my review) I DO NOT under ANY circumstance recommend this hotel!!!!!!!If you're in town for a long stay, this is an ideal place as you have a kitchen in your hotel suite/room, living room, separate bedroom, they offer a warm breakfast every morning and dinner three nights out of the week. If your room is not clean to your standards, tell the front desk, they will fix it! This place is good at ensuring you're as comfortable as possible!  Location is ideal to many restaurants, not far from the theater/museum district and the scenic drive. I will be back on my many future trips to El Paso.The rooms in this Residence Inn meet expectations: clean, roomy, and with enough room amenities to be comfortable for weeks on end. One thing that was really obvious to me on both visits was that the customer service at this location is very, very good from the front desk agent to the sales rep + GM that you see at breakfast.Although I stayed at this location twice on a Monday, I wasn't able to take advantage of the manager's reception in the evening. This is held from Tuesday-Friday after 4 PM, I think. Even though I missed the manager's reception, the breakfast was sufficient and very palatable. No complaints here, and there was enough food to take with you on a long road trip. The parking outside was good, and the location is just off of I-10 (exit 24B?). Also, there is a Wells Fargo, WalGreen's and Taco Bueno within walking distance.I'll definitely return to this location. Well worth the $$$.Yay for pet friendly!  and they only charge the same as a typical guestroom.  You can't beat that!Typically, any Residence Inn you stay at is basically the same.  This place is the same.  Not good but more importantly, not bad.  Located right off the highway, it offers easy visibility to spot it, but really could easily miss it while driving.  A typical service road gets you to it, but don't miss it cause it's a long way to the turn about.  The hotel itself served its purpose.  Friendly staff and quick check-in.  I could stay here again.I had stayed at the Courtyard up the road a bit the last time I had to travel to El Paso for business.  This time I decided to try the Residence Inn because I'd be here all week.CONS:I had to wait at the counter for 15 minutes before being checked in because the person was on the phone.  The manager in the office did not come out to assist.The breakfast is OK.  They do have some fruit options, but they weren't ripe. Other than that, it's the yoplait yogurt if you want a healthier option (and that stuff is loaded with chemicals and sweeteners).PROS:This Residence Inn is superior to the Courtyard El Paso Airport, in my opinion.The rooms are clean and well-appointed with all my technology needs. I have outlets anywhere I could need one for charging my laptop and phone.  The rooms have been updated recently, I think, because it all looks new and they have the new lamp and TV styles Marriott is going with lately.The kitchen is fine, clean, and has what I need for a business trip.  The shower pressure is adequate, and the water gets good and hot if you like that sort of thing.TV channels are sufficient for what I need.I'll tell you what I love about this particular room (212): it is not only near the elevator, but it's on the side of the property near the back - the way the terrain is here, I have utter privacy and can open my windows and leave the curtains open without worrying about anything or anyone peaking in!Staff is friendly.All in all, I am pleased with this hotel and will stay here in the future for business trips in the area.NOTE: I am giving this a 'pricey' rating, but it could be just the weekday rate for business travelers.  I hear the weekend prices are much more reasonable.I've been here for three days and I'll be here for another ten days or so. My stay here has been great so far. Comfortable beds and a pleasant front staff. I left my key in my room twice because I'm the Simple Jack of hotel room keys and they were cool with it. Even joked around a bit because I'm an idiot.The thing I like best is that they're about the price of a regular hotel room, but have a full kitchen with fridge, stove top (sometimes an oven), dishwasher, and sink, etc.Free wireless internet, free decent hot breakfast, and socials in the evenings with free dumpy Bud Light!Residence Inn has become my home away from home. I definitely find the room rate and value to be pretty consistent. The staff is very friendly and the location is great.Nice.  But $100 charge if you bring a pet. That is absurd. I could see something like $20/day upcharge but a flat fee of $100 is absurd.Great rate and great front desk service.  The morning breakfast was perfect for us on the run.  The rooms are still a little dated (tube T.V.s, older furniture, etc.) but the hospitality makes up for it.Booked my son a room here using my hard fought for Marriott pts. Gave him a handicap room that made the shower impossible and had an air conditioning unit outside the window that kept him awake all night. Won't return points because my son was too embarrassed to complain and to tell me I booked a DUMP!",,,,,"['night', 'way', 'nice', 'clean', 'accommodations', 'quiet', 'relaxing', 'breakfast',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-inn-and-suites-i-10-airport-el-paso,Comfort Inn & Suites I-10 Airport,4.5,$$,15,"Nicest Comfort Inn and Suites I've ever seen - rivals most Comfort Suites. Great rooms and the best hotel breakfast I've seen in a long time. I mostly skip them, but this one was very good in the nicest breakfast area I've seen - a spacious 3rd floor area.My husband and I are currently staying here. We're close to the airport and 1-10 highway and we can't hear absolutely no noise. Bed is comfy. Breakfast is good. You can make your own pancakes and waffles. Rooms are clean and updated. Nice lobby area, we were told Monday - Thursday they free beer and food between 5-7,I believe were the times. They have computers and a printer. Only thing that sucks is the parking. We'll stay here again though.Newer furniture and carpets, clean rooms, friendly staff.  The room was easy to sleep in and comfortable enough to spend a few hours catching up on email.Hotel staff was nice. Parking lot a little small but found parking. Room was super nice and breakfast was decent. All in all everything I expected with a little extra. Would stay again.Pro - The room is clean and staff is very friendly. A con for me is having no refrigerator in the room. I only stayed for a night before heading back to California. Hoping for a restful sleep as I have 12 hours to drive back home. Annoyingly waken up by screechy floor and a weird sound..almost like a vacuum sound. It went on and on throughout the early morning. Most likely will not be staying here again.The staff was very helpful, provided me with some last month mite toiletries. Large variety of breakfast items. They had a free beer and pizza night which was nice. Rooms were a little cramped and we got ""top floor"" view of an accident lawyer billboard.Clean hotel, comfortable rooms and a small fitness room that's great to get your legs moving. I come to El Paso every week or every other week and I like staying here. The staff are very friendly, there is a shuttle that can take you to near by restaurants and the airport. I'm into fitness and sometimes it's hard to get away from work when I'm in El Paso so the fitness room works perfect. There are some cardio machines, free weights and a cable machine just to keep you active until you can get back to your regular routine. Free breakfast and wifi.Was I at a Westin, or a Comfort Inn? Since no one was falling all over me for a tip, I guess it was a Comfort Inn. That's about the only difference that i could tell other than not having a lounge. Oh and that the luggage carts are not exclusive property only to be used by the bell people, and only having valet parking available at 60 bucks a day.james y pretty much said it all.Best hotel for the price but prefer nobody else to stay here before the rates go up.Very nice - rooms are clean, hotel is 100% smoke-free., lounge area downstairs has a fire place... Will stay here again if the need arises. The ONLY issue I had was finding the blackout curtains - they are the same color as the walls &amp; right up behind the sheer curtains so when you've been driving a long way &amp; tired, you can't really find them. Like me. I finally discovered them about a 1/2 hr before my alarm went off.I Stayed 4 nights last week for business in the area.  The hotel grounds are nicely maintained with rock and gravel landscaping.  It shares a property with a Holiday Inn where you can use their pool (indoor/outdoor) and hot tub.  There is a neat bar with some entertainment in that complex as well.  The hotel is in a convenient location that is very close to the airport and restaurants.My room was clean and equipped with a serious air conditioner unit.  If you want the room cooler, you can make it that way in a hurry.  The bed was comfortable and I had good night's sleep.  Some of the light switches were in illogical places and it took a little time figuring out what switch lights what area.  The bathroom was a little cramped.  The shower had nice hot water and good pressure, however, the tub barely drained and I was standing in ankle deep water at shower's end.I will stay here again.  If it wasn't for the Choice Hotel points, I would probably try the 'sister' Holiday Inn across the way to compare.Great hotel. Service is great, room is comfortable. Happy hour and breakfast included. Safe area of town and close to the airport.Stayed here passing through El Paso. Arrived @ midnight. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Staff was friendly and pleasant.  Woke early and continued on the road. Sorry I couldn't stay here  longer and enjoy the facilities. Hotel has modern decor and was pretty clean. Beds very comfy, scarce parking but great location next to I 10.  Downside was breakfast. Not greatest quality ingredients overall. Waffle maker was best part, eggs were synthetic tasting, sausage tasted greasy, coffee was good.This is a decent hotel and I would return for another stay. Would have given four stars if breakfast quality was a notch above.This is highly reviewed on tripadvisor. I'm usually skeptical of glowing reviews, thinking it must be some kind of racket. However, after looking at photos of other nearby hotels, this looked the most modern and chic (compare to the Marriott which is stuck in the last century). I'm glad I made the choice to stay there.Staff is courteous and attentive. Decor is modern, layout intelligent, and everything is sparkling clean and new. Price is low, I'm assuming because of nearby competition, but they don't cut corners. Rooms are comfortable, clean, and well stocked. I'm astounded at the value and can't possibly imagine you'd get a better room for the money elsewhere in El Paso.Slight negatives, it is near a freeway, so it's noisy. But same can be said for all the other hotels in the area, so consider it a minor heads up. It is also hard to access, so try to call ahead of time to get proper directions.The best Comfort Inn I've ever stayed at. Everything is new, convenient location off I-10, it looks clean, smells clean, and even has a good workout room with db's and a new cable machine. I would recommend this to anyone - business-person, family, or traveler.",,,,,"['nicest', 'comfort', 'inn', 'suites', 'ever', 'seen', 'rivals', 'comfort', 'suites', 'great', 'rooms', 'best', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/super-8-el-paso-airport-el-paso,Super 8 El Paso Airport,2.5,$,17,"For the price, it's not bad! It's not dirty or gross. The girl at front desk is friendly and helpful. The rooms have a microwave and fridge. Free shuttle to the airport. The one thing that does suck about this hotel is the very strong deodorizer smell. We tried airing it out, but it's way too strong. I gave this place four stars because it meets my expectations for a cheap place just for sleep.Pros: cheap, safe, quiet, nice front desk guy, overall clean. Cons: bed stand in middle of room, ac cover fell apart when we went to use it and had to reassemble to make it work, dirty towel left on other bed stand,But the worst was the TOXIC room deodorizer (?) or whatever nasty chemical used in the room.   We had to ask for another room because the first room was impossible to even be in.  It was like a mix of baby powder and cheap perfume.  Our eyes burned and we could taste it in our mouths.   The front desk guy gave us another room and the chemical was there also, but at about 1/2 the dose.Great hotel clean room good size bed a few minor thing like tv chanels not enough and some you cant see another bad thing is that the room service started great until the last day they too like 4 hrs to even clean my room until we complained and the room up top too much noise like foot stomping but overall great comfy placeGreat value and convenient location! Enjoyed the clean rooms and breakfast in the morning! Staff was courteous and accommodating. Thanks Super 8!While driving a truck over the road I broke down in El Paso, was told it would be at least 2 days to fix, I was told by my company to find a hotel. I had my little puppy with me so I called Super 8 they said bring her on they accept pets. They sent a shuttle to pick us up from the mechanics. They arrived quickly, got to the hotel and was actually surprised by how clean it was. It's not a 5 star new hotel by any means but it fit the bill for a $50 a night hotel. Was what I was looking for. A clean, safe quiet place to rest up and relax while waiting on my truck to be fixed. The crew at the front desk were very polite and helpful. Check in only took a couple minutes and again like I said it's surprisingly very clean. Would have no issues staying here again if I had to stay in El Paso againI booked the room through Sams club travel and paid for the room there. We show up to the hotel and they said they need a card for incidentals. So we provided a card for that. Next morning we check out and finally make it home. We see there is a charge from the hotel for the cost of the room as well. They said Sams Club didn't pay them (there's a charge on the card from Sams Club as well). They said that once Sams club paid them they would remove the charge. it's a month later, we keep calling the hotel, some rude ass lady keeps answering the phone says we need to talk to the manger and the manger will call us back. We call every other day and still no manager. So now we're charged twice for a cheap ass room. Horrible customer service. Should've known better. STAY AWAY!!!!Excellent customer service. I got a spacious clean two queen bedroom with soft comfortable beds. Everything looked clean and the hotel itself looked safe and was well lit. I would definitely stay here again.The room looked alright, but I woke up with my shoulders, neck and chin welted with bedbug bites. Afterwards I saw two bedbugs on the bed.  The manager refunded my money later that day.  So I paid for the night with a couple week's worth of itchy bites; not worth it.Big Texas sized cockroaches up in here. Rooms are clean enough, but I swear that was the first time I saw roaches the size of rats.If I could give zero stars I would. The rooms are tiny and musty. The continental breakfast consisted of warm milk, stale bread, runny waffle batter and what I believe was suppose ti be frosty flakes cereal but was crushed dust. The maid was breaking up the bread and feeding the pigeons at the entrance to the breakfast area...which you know means pigeon poop on your shoes.  Don't stay here. Cheap but not cheap enough. I was quoted one price and charged a different price.  When I provided proof of their special offer, the Manager and a front desk clerk named Neil said ""that isn't what they meant to quote me"".It has a bed and we got a room for $41, so you can say it fit our needs.  Do not be fooled by the ""deluxe breakfast"" advertising,  unless toast and dry cereal is a special occasion for you. The broken water fountain made it seemed a little more ghetto than it actually was, but all in all it was alright.The staff was friendly, but the rooms could use some good cleaning. I had to switch rooms because the first had a broken TV and dirty pillow cases. The new room was slightly better, but had signs of neglect as well. Breakfast is more of a snack rather than a meal.Terrible the door to my room was broken and I got bitten bed by bugs don't stay here unless is an emergencyI really showed up here on a whim, grabbed my stuff up to my room, and shut myself in for the night, so I can't say that I got to see much of the Super 8 grounds other than my front facing hotel room. In this I mean that I didn't see any hookers, but that's because my curtains were closed and I left quickly the next morning. I can only give insight into how my stay went, so here's the dirty (er, actually the clean):One- the room was very clean and I had no complaints about the towels, tub, toilet, bedding, etc. In fact I was very pleased with my $40 night. Two- I experienced very little noise and I slept very well despite moving the table in front of the door because I was feeling a little paranoid (hey I'm a young, attractive female; it's what you do).Three- I was very happy with my complimentary breakfast the next morning of waffles, oatmeal, apples, yogurt, and toast. (I took extra stuff for snacks on the road. Shhhh!)Four- The attendants working the front desk were very helpful the night of my late arrival, and the next morning upon my departure. For a Super 8, I couldn't ask for more.However: when the night attendant asked me where I wanted my room, in the back or in the front, I asked which was a better location, to which she responded either. She did however place me in the front of the building (directly behind the main office), so I did not see anything beyond my front facing doorway. Could there be a troop of hookers roaming the grounds? Maybe, I just didn't see any.there is a bug in my bed, show head is on goodHorrible! Hooker infested hotel. We had been traveling from San Diego to San Antonio and it was getting late so we decided to stop over. Expedia had this hotel rated 4 out of 5 stars. Nothing could be more misleading. We pulled up and checked it. The front was old and outdated , but clean enough. We got our key and proceeded to drive to the back set of buildings. First thing we noticed was a group of ""women"" (ladies of the night) running around.. It was almost 11pm. My husband wanted to leave immediately. I persuaded him to continue on and check out the room. We never made it in the room- as we rounded the corner by our room- several intoxicated men were rolling around fighting in the grass area in front of our room. That was all we could take. Went back up to the front and asked if they had any other rooms in the front of the motel. They didn't and couldn't refund our money since we booked online. This is NOT A FAMILY motel. Disgusting. We found a much better hotel across the highway.decent for the money. But it is Super 8 and on the Eastside &amp; right on I-10. A bit run-down but not bad for the price. Breakfast was actually pretty good.

We have used other hotels in the past(we travel for business) and continue to stay at the Fairfield Inn because of the great service. Great hotel!Just like Springhill they bake cookies with nuts and are not allergy friendly. However the front desk staff is friendly.I'm a platinum elite Marriott member and have stayed over 150 nights in Marriott's this year.  I have seen my share of hotels and I have stayed in all 3 Marriott properties here in El Paso. I think they all have different perks. This is a great and SAFE location. Walmart is across the street as is a Cinemark movie theater and a classic MUST VISIT Mexican restaurant, Leo's. Its on Tue west side of town which is a bit of a drive (for El Paso) to downtown, etc. You can take 54 through the mountains for a scenic drive or to avoid crazy traffic.The lobby is nice and clean, the room was not as big as others but clean. Bed is comfortable and its pretty quiet being very close to the freeway.There is a Spring hill Suites in the same parking lot if you're staying longer than a few nights.  You can't go wrong!!!Updated and clean.  Walked to a movie theatre next door.  Will stay here again as I love anything Marriott.Clean, quiet, professional and great location off the interstate however not so close that its noisy (granted I was on the north side of the building). I'm pretty particular when it comes to hotels. I prefer locations on the outskirts of the city where things are clean, newer, well maintained and close to dining. Fairfield as usual met my expectations with this stay. I highly recommend.I have stayed here multiple times. Very clean.good breakfast. Fitness center. A little loud due to being near a highway but that wasn't really an issue. Overall good experience. Lots of amenities nearby including places to eat and shop for necessities.Clean, nice and a great staff! Yummy breakfast as well.  Clean rooms and a great indoor pool.  There is a movie theater, good restaurants and Walmart within walking distance.  Very safe neighborhood!Ok well let start off as its in a decent/safe area the location is well lit and next to alot of places to eat within walking distances. The staff was nice when i checked in! They recognized my platinum elite marriotts and even gave me options to where i wanted the points to go! On the rewards or something from the market....sadly no beer in the market. It was starting off really good. Next was the room it was clean and roomy enough with a good view. Now here comes the bad which is sad cuz this was going so good cuz as of late staying at different marriott location have been a disappointment! So once again no lotion in the room i like the lotion in the room after a shower cuz i get dry skin. Ok no big deal im getting used to no lotion it seems marriotts cuts the corner there...now here is the biggest kicker went to the bathroom and put the toilet seat down and there was dried piss all over the toilet seat!!!! Lost a couple of stars for that one!!! Well that sucks next stop tomorrow will be Tuscon, az hopefully the marriotts there will be better!!!Pros:Friendly staffComplimentary breakfastLaundry facility onsiteFree wifiIndoor poolCons:Thin walls ( I can hear the person upstairs walk/stomp &amp; hear the alarm clock from the room next door)Very very thin walls.  You can hear every thing in the other units, everything!  We have five of us in this hotel in five separate rooms.  Everyone complained about the noise thru the walls.  I could hear every foot fall of the person in the unit about me.  My wireless internet was crappy but my coworker said his was excellent although he did find a roach in this bath tub.  The breakfast was eh.  Belgium waffles, hard boiled eggs, English muffins and bagels, microwavable McMuffins and omelet pitas.  I stuck to the fruit.  Gym has dumb bells up to 50lbs.  2 tread machines and a elliptical.  No TNT on the tvs though.  Good location for restaurants though.  Jaxsons, Chili's, Famous Daves...all within 2 mins of the hotel.  Walmart accross the street is 24/7.  Movie theater next door.hmmm. where to start on this little gem. as ive mentioned before.. i travel a lot.. for work.. so ive stayed in my fair share of hotels.. my preference is Wyndham .. with the secondary being Marriott.. this trip my husband was with me, we pulled into town late on a tuesday and for some reason unknown to even the hotel staff in multiple locations.. many places were booked.  we finally found a room at the fairfield and booked the suite for 2 nights. for the room itself, i have little complaints. just the a/c was extremely loud and about a foot off the edge of the bed.. it gets annoying when its blowing directly on you while you sleep.  now for the good part :)  as a rule of thumb.. i NEVER indulge in the ""free continental breakfast!!"" no matter what place im at.. its just.. no. i cant. id rather have my shower.. get my starbucks and go get actual breakfast later... my husband.. :( well, he is not as strong willed as i when it comes to food. annnnnddd unfortunately, he had to pay dearly for it.  he ate 3 hard boiled eggs and some fruit from the lobby while i was showering... by the time i was done with my hair.. make up and getting dressed (2+ hours... vanity... i know.. shhhhhh!!)  he was laying on the bed talking about not feeling well.. very shocking from someone who will say hes fine when hes not! so i let him lay there and about 30 minutes later all hell breaks loose... i do not need to explain the details to anyone who has encountered food poisoning.. just know.. an hour later we were spending our day in the ER...  before checking out i went to the front desk and let them know what was going on.. got a sprite from the little shop for him and asked to speak to the manager... the manager was RUDE and almost made me act in a way i wasnt proud of when i tried to ask her was anyone else complaining about breakfast and the only possible way he could be sick was from that.. we were on the road.. so the only thing we ate the day before were chips!  she said its not possible it takes 24 hours for food poising to set in.. i told her.. she is not a doctor nor a food borne illness specialist so it was doubtful she was qualified to make that call.. she was hearing none of it.. so i just left it at that.. good thing is.. they got it under control.. despite spending 10 hours in the hospital and missing work... overall.. i will NEVER stay here again.. and for the money there are much better places with friendlier staff.. not once did the manager try to help in any way.. oh wait.. she did offer to call the paramedics. thanks b****. ill drive him myself..Great newer hotel on the west side of El Paso, TX that we hit up on our way into TX and back out of TX on a recent road trip.  Friendly staff, nice, clean, large-ish rooms, clean and quiet.  The morning breakfast area can get a bit nuts, but that is normal with these places and the ""free breakfast"".  If we are passing thru EP, we will certainly stay again.Stayed her for two weeks. Great rooms, recently remodeled. Some noise from the freeway, but not much. Breakfast was quick, good and service was expected.. Only downside was windows didn't open so tough to air out room and that the towels were old.Brand new place on the west side of El Paso (which might be a little bit on the outskirts of the city for some folks).  Honestly, we were super happy at this place.  The staff were especially friendly and gave us free cookies and good dinner advice.  Lightning fast free wifi in rooms and on free computers in lobby with free printer.  Comfy rooms with big tvs, Pantene bath products, nice beds, well functioning a/c, semi-lame sheets, and a great pool/hot tub.  Five star for its affordable price.  Four star if you're used to staying in fancy places.  The breakfast was more than adequate-- offered waffle machine, hard boiled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, jimmy dean breakfast sandwiches, juices, coffee, and bananas/apples.",,,,,"['hotel', 'nights', 'last',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-el-paso-airport-el-paso,Hilton Garden Inn  El Paso Airport,3.0,$$,22,"This is a very nice property.  I was a bit surprised.  Much nicer than the University HGI.  That statement is not based on location cause as you know this hotel sits near the UGLY view of El Paso.  Since you are not looking out the back window, I could care less about the view.  Its all about rest and cleanliness to me.  The room was clean, modern and nice.  The lobby and computer area, workout area all nice!  All Clean.  When I printed the computer's printed.  When I asked to fax something they obliged.  I didn't eat in the cafe but it looked much nice than any HGI that I have ever seen.  Oh, a nice touch is a nite light in bathroom.Hilton Garden Inn El Paso AirportThis hotel always seems to be booked and I don't get it.  The hotel is clean, the lobby is gorgeous, you get a fridge &amp; microwave, and the staff is fair. But those are the only pros.  I had a tough couple of nights staying here because the bed I had was uncomfortable.  I know, you can adjust your bed's firmness.  I did and that still didn't do the trick.  Actually, it wasn't working.  It also didn't help that my king size bed was two singles put together.  Guess what? Sleep in the center of the bed and you'll end up sinking right down the middle.  Other issues I had was a weak Wi-Fi signal, treadmill was busted, parking is scarce, and the room's heater is loud.  Obviously, I won't be staying here again.  My advice, stay next door at the Homewood or across the street at the Hampton InnOne of the worst stays as 7 year Diamond HHonors. REFINERY! Smells and views are atrocious. Beds are not Hilton standard and are horrible and rock hard unless you change the dial and roll to the middle to sleep in a hole. Drawers from TV stand open in the night and the bed frame sticks out 5"". GM, Adrian Perez spent his opportunity to make things right by holding his hand up in my face stating that the bed frames are HGI standard. HGI changed these beds out years ago.After 11 hours on the road we finally got at the hotel. We were very tired and I was travelling with a 10 years old and a 5 months old baby. When we made the reservations we asked for a crib for my 5 months old and they said it wouldn't be a problem. Well, there was no crib in the room. We asked for one and they brought us a crib that we had to put together. When we asked for help putting it together we were told to read the instructions. Well, we did! Then we had to call and ask for a bedding sheet. While assembling it we notice it was very dirty and with stains. We had to clean it ourselves. :-(Just very annoyed that they didn't have a clean crib ready.Don't totally understand why people are so negative about this place.  It's 5 minutes from the airport and has very easy access to the highway.  Room was exactly what you would expect from a garden inn and totally acceptable for a business traveler.Internet is free and decent speeds.  I would stay here again.I can confirm other reviews about the oil refinery. It is literally next to the parking lot.  Having never seen one up close before, I actually enjoyed the view.  If life gives you lemons, make lemonade.First impression Pros:  Hotel is clean.  I didn't try the restaurant or bar but it's nice to have the options available.  The hotel provided two complimentary water bottles and additional bottles are reasonably priced which was very appreciated especially considering the hot weather.  First impression Cons:  the entrance is confusing as you walk right into the restaurant section.  It's not easy to identify the check-in desk.  It took approximately 15 minutes to check in as the lobby desk was empty and considering the time of day and the number (4) of employees that saw us waiting, the wait shouldn't have been as long.  Room review:  the room was very clean and inviting.  It was my first time using the 'sleep number' bed system they have and I didn't care for it at all.  In my opinion, the bed felt too much like an air mattress.  The adjustable number bed crowd I'm sure would love it though.  The beds(mattress) and headboard are not a good match as the pillows kept sliding down to the peace between the mattress and wall.  I adjusted this by laying down further down on the bed, a taller person would probably have their feet hanging off the bed if they took the same step.  There is a single serve Keurig machine with plenty of choices (4) for coffee and tea.  Wish other properties also had one.I was quite disappointed with the level of service received during our stay. The accommodations were mediocre. My complaints are as follows:1. Room service was terrible. After waiting 40 minutes for a quoted 20 minute order time, our food arrived cold and our order was wrong. Not only did we receive an incorrect side on one of our orders, but we also received an entire additional unordered entree. After we explained the order was incorrect, the deliverer quite reluctantly returned the unordered dish to the kitchen, and then took an additional 15 minutes to return with our *somewhat* corrected receipt- though the unordered entree was deleted from our total, the percentage based service charge was not amended. Furthermore, they actually delivered a shattered ketchup bottle with our order, leaking ketchup all over the place. The staff was not apologetic in the least about any of these errors. 2. Upon check-in, my card was of course swiped for incidentals (the room itself was purchased on Price line). After being explicitly informed that there would be no charge and that it was strictly for liability purposes, I discovered a $49 charge that apparently ""everyone"" receives for incidentals that is to be returned upon checkout. This has still not been refunded to my account. 3. The refrigerator in our room emitted such a loud, high-pitched whining noise that it had to be unplugged so that we could sleep. Of course, this meant we could not keep any of our room service leftovers. 4. The thermostat in our room seemed to be broken. If we turned the AC on, it would not stop running. So, we were forced to choose between uncomfortably warm or uncomfortably cold. We chose uncomfortably warm. 5. The beds were quite uncomfortable.6. The morning of checkout, our key cards stopped working several hours before checkout time, requiring an additional visit to the front desk. 7. This is the first hotel I've ever stayed at that charged for breakfast. 8. Upon checkout, the receptionist, Jessica, refused to provide me with an itemized receipt displaying the return of the ""customary $49 incidental hold."" I'm beginning to believe that is because she is full of it and it will not be returned. So what can I say about our stay that was positive? Hmmm. Well, the staff was friendly, even if incompetant. And the coffee was good. I have literally had more enjoyable stays at Budget Suites. I doubt I will ever stay at a Hilton hotel again.I stayed here last night and it was super cool.  I usually stay in Hilton properties and this one is on par with the quality I expect.  We checked in late in the evening due to business, but the check in was smooth and I really liked the room.  The beds are adjustable for firmness - which was GREAT given the fact that the Hampton Inn over in Jurarez I'd stayed in the night before was rock hard.  Great breakfast, fresh coffee - works for me as a tired business traveler!Pretty sure that at $179, this was my least expensive Hilton brand option other than the suggested Hampton Inn in Juarez. Juarez? Thanks but no! It's not clear why El Paso properties are so expensive. It's not part of the oil boom like San Angelo. Standard HGI and I confirm that it is indeed off a weird service road. Have to wonder how many wrecks happen under the highway so be careful.I'd stay there again mainly to watch my expenses. Nothing wrong with it. Plus the Cal Poly football team was there too. (Yes, it's taken me from the beginning to the end of football season to finish this review...)This HGI is right off I-10 - and is a reasonably priced option near the airport. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are updated and the lobby has the new HGI configuration.There is definitely a bit of freeway noise if you are on that side of the hotel but if you're blasting the AC, you won't hear it. The location is a bit weird to get to since it is on the feeder road near a street that is a two-way, which makes for a weird turn if you are headed in anywhere but east. The only other complaint is the breakfast area awkwardness - the set up of some of the large chairs is not very conducive for eating.Overall, this HGI gets a pass and I would stay here again if I was in the area.Have you ever wanted a sub-par hotel experience AND be threatened by the ""El Paso Mafia""??? Well stay here and it can be all yours! If it was between staying here and cutting off my arm, I'd be a one armed man.Check in process was great, rooms were clean and modern, hotel interior and exterior were clean, staff was friendly, the food at the restaurant was not good, location was good and safe.This hotel is not quite three stars.  If I could give it a 2 1/2 star I would.  So let me start with the good:Newer hotel.Great room ratesQuite for being right off the interstate.Rooms are clean.Fridge and microwave in room.Not so good:Right next to a refinery...and I mean RIGHT NEXT TO.  Staff is not very friendly.WORST BED I HAVE EVER SLEPT IN.At check in we went to our room.  We got to the room and looked at the beds and one of the beds had a large lump (bubble) in it.  There is no way we could have slept on it.  The beds are adjustable for firmness and we tried to do that thinking that maybe that was the problem.  We were unable to fix it so we called to the front desk.  The front desk clerk sent the maintenance guy to look at the bed.  He was unable to fix it and had us call to switch rooms.  The front desk clerk told us to come to the desk so she could switch us.  When we got down there she grilled us like we had done something to the bed to make it do that.  (we were in the room for 5 minutes)  We told her the maintenance guy told us it was broken and she proceeded to tell us that he said there was nothing wrong with the bed.  I advised her he was the one that told us to switch rooms.  She was just very argumentative and annoyed that we needed to change rooms.  This made me very unhappy.  Anyway, we switched to a new room and the beds adjusted like there were supposed to but even the softest setting on the bed is horribly hard and uncomfortable.  I am not sure who decided these beds were a  good idea but all four of us in the room were very uncomfortable.  It is unfortunate because the rooms are nice.Don't eat the food!!! There was a worm in my salad, a hair into pasta and my cheesecake was warm and had a gross fruit sauce on it. Spare yourself the bad experience and eat at a restaurant outside the hotel... Don't even get me started on the splatter stains on the wall next to the bed... EwwwwThe badThis hotel does not participate in triple Hilton Honors points:-(It only has one cloths Washer and Dryer!The food is over priced and not very good.My toilet has a bunch of scrapes in it so it looks like there is always ""poop streaks"" in it, my pet peeve.No DVD player, limited TV channels, refrigerator is small and doesn't work well, myself and other co-workers have had to throw away food.Small room and below average for the price.The goodDecent staff, comfy bed, has a krueg with coffee given daily, clean room, close to a lot of things to do.Jelique Ayala the Asst General Manager is fabulous!  She took very good care of my extended family when we were in town for my father in laws funeral.  She knows her stuff!!!  I highly recommend the Hilton E Paso because of Jelique!The good: Friendly staff, Clean rooms, great breakfast. What more do I want right?The bad: It neighbors a refinery and your room stinks with what I'm sure are carcinogens. My whole family woke up in a stink room with sore throats.Who builds a nice hotel on top of industrial wasteland?Stayed here on a business trip.  I usually love the Hilton chains.  Boy was I disappointed.  I found a booger in my sheets and I was grossed out to say the least.  I complained to the front desk, they comped my room for me that is the only reason I am giving them 3 stars.Wonderful staff! Nice clean rooms, excellent breakfast and overall a nice stay. Will definitely come back when in town!No Bible in the rooms. Freeway noise. Air conditioners run fan non-stop. Only one washer/dryer for entire hotel. One-way street is awkward. Great Internet connection. Nice breakfast. Excellent staff.","No one wanted to serve me breakfast.The room was clean, the night clerk was excellentGot up in the morning wanted breakfast, was willing to pay the extra $11 for breakfastSaid good morning to the desk clerk and who I thought was the breakfast hostess.  The hostess ignored me and kept watching tvGave up after a few minutes waiting on someone to come make omeletteTold desk clerk I guess they didn't want my $11When i came to check out, she said the hostess said no one was thereI guess I was invisible or the tv blinded herAnother awesome room and fantastic service.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-el-paso-east-lomaland-el-paso,La Quinta Inn El Paso East Lomaland,3.5,$$,23,"This review is from the Southern Cali.Truck Driver-Robert.. Pay Attention y'all because staying in motels &amp; suites is  what I do while delivering loads to different cities in the U.S.A!!! First of all- This is 1 of the Best suites I've stayed in thus far!!! It deserves ALL 5 stars for its Value-Location--Cleanliness-Comfortness-and amminities!!!! Flat screen T.V.-Iron board&amp;Iron... Micro &amp; Fridge...cold A.C...and a bed that you Won't want to get out of!!!! I must mention the Great service that I got from (Janet) at the front desk..very Professional &amp; Courteous she was so ""Big Ups to her for a Fantastic job""!!! Had NO problem parking my big rig ONLY 2 doors away from my room &amp; that's also Thanks to Janet!!! I must say that for the LOW price for the room that I received A really Great Value &amp; I will DEFINITELY come back to stay at this location again very soon!!! So people if you doubt my review- Call Janet&amp; reserve ur room&amp; IF you don't TOTALLY agree with my review then I WILL PERSONALLY REFUND ur money!!!! Look for further reviews from ya boy!!!! ...Peace&amp;I'm out....I have always liked staying at La Quinta hotels. So as I am traveling across the country 8 months pregnant, I felt if I booked La Quinta for all my stops I would be comfortable. Unfortunately not this time, this is the worst experience I've had at any hotel. I am wondering if they are individually owned as this doesn't seem to be the La Quinta standard I am used to. My husband and I took our dogs out and when we came back to the room our keys didn't work, went up to the front desk 3 times before being told it was the door and we'd have to wait for the manager to arrive and fix it. So we ended up waiting a good hour just to get in and handed 2 more keys, that's it. Now if I am a manager of a hotel and have an issue like this with someone, I would be doing my best to make it up to them so they continue to stay. Nothing was done or offered, feeling pretty bummed about that. I have 4 more nights of traveling and La Quinta hotels booked, I have canceled tomorrow at La Quinta and am going to try someone else. So whether you're a fan of La Quinta or not, I'd recommend staying away from this one. **Update** Upon checking out this morning my husband was told there would be no charge for our stay. Thank you La Quinta for restoring my faith in you!We stayed here based on the good reviews this place received. I'm an avid traveler, so I've stayed at A LOT of different hotels, from shitty to BALLER! May be I'm just pampered by Hamptons and HI's, but this is one of the lower end LQ's I've ever stayed at. I think the best thing about this hotel is it's proximity to shopping and eateries. Pros: Off I-10, so you can jump on the highway. My bed appeared pretty clean. Cons: AC didn't work in first room. AC BARELY worked in second room! Was ignored TWICE when I approached the front desk by the hostess. No hand soap provided. Found a razor blade on ice machine within a child's reach by pool.If you don't really give a shit and are gonna be in and out, fuck it, stay there. If you're used to a higher level of comfort and service, move on down the road to a Hampton or HI Express.We stay at LQ a lot in our travels and chose this location as it was the highest rated in the area. We were traveling with two teenagers so opted for the two room suite. This establishment far under exceeded what we have come to expect from this company. The hallway and room was worn. The only way to our room was a narrow steep staircase- a challenge with heavy bags and an ice chest. There were no linens for the couch bed and no rollaway bed available. The bathroom was cramped, short on towels and had a small single bottle of shampoo. In the morning, the very small breakfast room was completely crowded, barely stocked and had lines down the hallway with seating for only a few. The price at under $100 per night for this size room was good, but ewww....so not worth it. On our way back, we'll find another option.Good stay here. Room was comfortable. I was happy for the price. Good location to base and the airport and lots of food places.If we needed to, I would stay here again.{Great price for a decent room! Ask for a discount if you're military. Allows pets, no fee.}Comfy bed, clean sheets, clean room, and bathroom. Super quick and friendly check in. Decently quiet rooms on a weekday night, besides freeway traffic. Seems like a safe location to me. Conveniently located off freeway, near shopping and food. Few restaurants within walking distance, too. Great wifi connection; I had no issues uploading/downloading files and no spotty connection. Points off: Towels are thin and rough, water takes a minute to warm up... but for an overnight stay for $60 - it'll do. Wouldn't stay here more than 2 nights to be honest. No areas for dogs to go to the restroom besides the back strip of rock along the fence. Mini fridge is loud. For some reason this place made my chest tight and made me cough. I'm not asthmatic or sure sensitive so I'm not sure why! Makes me wonder what's in the walls.The room is clean and their customer service is excellent, as it should be. It is outdated, looks sketchy and run down. Beds are comfortable and the flat screen is adequate. Mini fridge and microwave in the room and is adjacent to a Denny's. Definitely not for light sleepers as it is off the interstate and has some idling Semi's in the wee hours.  But, for the price &amp; the cleanliness, worth it.For around $70 you can't beat this. It's very clean and comfortable inside. If you're looking for the most bang for your bucks, this is the place! Room had TV, 2 beds, microwave.This place is absolutely horrible. Horrible service and horrible room!! The toilet was broken throughout the 4 days I stayed!! I had to continually tell the desk to fix it, and they never did.What a horrible place to stay. My husband and I were here over the Labor day weekend and there weren't any people when we checked in. That soon changed as the sun was setting. Once we got back to the hotel the pool was crowded with people including kids. Loud Spanish music was playing on a huge boom box with the bass turned up all night long. A barbecue grill was setup along the sidewalk with large pots of what looked like menudo. It was like a college frat party. We were expecting a good nights rest. We awoke at 4:40 am and there were people right outside our door speaking loudly and still partying. No respect for those who might still be trying to get some rest. I cant believe hotel management would sllow this yo go on past a rrasonable hour. The room itself was very old. We moved the night stand to plug in an extension cord, and it looked like it hadn't been moved in months. The tv was plugged into an outlet that was not functional. Maintenance is completely lacking in this hotel/ dump. If you can drive away a few miles to stay at a decent, clean place...do it.Reasonable prices and rooms are what you would expect for the price. All staff was friendly and helpful including the manager. Breakfast was great!! very clean cafeteria and food was fresh. Our stay was short lived but first impressions mean the most. Def staying here on our next trip from C.A to Houston.Great location since its on our way to San Antonio from LA. Has mini fridge to store ur road Trip snacks and drinks. Microwave ,closet and small table in our double full comfortable beds. Room #141.Great dane friendly without weight restrictions or quantity or deposit.Not much of a place to let them relief themselves though.Small bathroom but ok if it makes up in the room size . Heated pool though outside its @ 20 degrees.Price for us on Saturday was 65 w/out tax. I'm impressed and will come again next time! Free wifi and free brkfst too! But if u miss breakfast  Denny's is in the same parking lot for a quick walk on over to save you on gas. Show your room key for  20% off your tab.Meh. Typical slightly rundown interstate hotel experience. Small, pretty dirty, but served its purpose. My biggest gripe is that our AC didn't really work. Even set to full blast, the thing would turn on for 60 seconds, off for 20 minutes. That is surprising to me because it still is in Texas and it is still warm in February. Oh, we also had to hold down the toilet lever to get it to actually flush and the shower would not get above mildly warm. Yuck. I would not stay here again.Not a five-star hotel but good for the price.  I'd say average for a La Quinta.  The room was clean except for a purple stain on the carpet.  No smell of cigarettes like another reviewer reported.The late-night front desk guy was super friendly.  Pet friendly.Slight noise from the highway and the A/C but wasn't bad at all.This place was a bit rundown, but it was cheap and did the job if you only need a place to stay for the night.The room was adequate, it served the purpose. I was a little concerned about bugs and fortunately there weren't any. I'd stay again if I were in El Paso.Very pleasantly surprised by this location! The room, pool and breakfast area were very clean. No funny smell in our room and the staff were very nice. Not that I normally care, but I did notice that our curtains and bedspread were updated for a more boutique look. Pet friendly, even for large dogs, but Like someone else said, itty-bitty potty area. I say a fair trade for the price!This was our stopping point on the way to California. Room was clean, a/c was decent. It would get a higher score, if not for the un-clean shower (strange hair, gross).Very surprised.  I didn't have high expectations from what I heard about El Paso but the hotel and even the city itself has really grown.  The hotel was very clean and pretty modern.  Free parking and even breakfast!  The location is a bit hard to get around places but with a GPS it isn't a problem.  Also, it is outside the downtown area so if that is your destination, it may not be the best place to stay.However, very affordable and clean are what makes this place worth staying!Went out of their way to make our stay amazing after our van broke down. We appreciated them so much!","The guy at the front desk is pretty retarded but the manager lady was pretty friendly, wtf do you expect at a La Quinta. Pet friendly! Always a plus.I wasn't expecting much since but we didn't need much....just a clean room for a night as we made a cross country trip from AZ to FL.  Unfortunately, I didn't even get that.  When I walked in the first room we were assigned, the smell of cigarettes nearly made me throw up.  I asked the guy at front desk if it was non-smoking and he said it was but that people break the rules all of the time.  Fair enough, he can't really prevent that.  He was very nice and switched us to another room.  It appeared to be much better....had a slight musty smell but nothing I couldn't deal with and seemed clean.  However, when I took a shower the next morning, there was a lady's razor in the shower and clumps of long black hair along the shower walls. BLECH!  I cleaned it out the best I could and showered because it was 430am and we needed to get on the road but it grossed me out.  I told the front desk when I checked out that they needed to do a better job cleaning the rooms in the future.  Let's hope they do.This hotel is the very definition of a find that will make the deal-hunting travel planner salivate. My party of four got a room with two beds for $52 each night - for a Friday and Saturday night! Very conveniently located along I-10 for the east-of-airport section of town. The room was extremely clean, and though I can't vouch for the quality of the beds (I yielded them to my companions of more discriminating tastes and volunteered to rough it on an air mattress), all other aspects of the room were Aaron tested, Aaron approved. The cable scarcely provided us with 25 channels and the archaic room keys were punch-hole cards that looked like they could snap in half if carried in one's pocket, but the continental breakfast waffles were bountiful and the front desk amicable, so huzzah for this economical gem of a motor-hotel!",,,,"['review', 'southern', 'truck', 'driver', 'pay', 'attention', 'staying', 'motels', 'amp',

I was unaware of their military discount until their staff mentioned it. So they have a big thumbs up from me, haven't had the breakfast yet but it seems promising. Nice lit parking lotNew, clean, great beds, and pillows and friendly staff.  Highly recommended and only 20 min from the airport.My husband and I stayed here on 9/17 for a night on our road trip from Tucson to Austin. I am very particular about cleanliness at hotels and this Holiday Inn passed the test. It's not fancy, but it was comfy and clean and brand new which is all I needed to break up our road trip.  The front desk and house keeping staff were friendly. We had the continental breakfast before we hit the road again and filled up on toast and cereal.Usually I stay at Hilton properties but due to the extraordinarily exorbitant rate at the Hampton Inn next door I stayed here and was not disappointed. The hotel was nice and clean and fresh. I had the opportunity to stay in three of their rooms over different periods and all were very nice. The reason there is a missing star is because of room 409. For some reason all of the outlets turned off when the entry light switch was flipped off. This included the light on the night stand between the beds and the tall stand up light in the corner. Ridiculous that they made the room that way. It is not right and they should know it. So don't get room 409. The other rooms that I. Was in didn't have that issue and were finest I think it is a single room issue. The treadmill was tired and worn as it would surge and pulse but there is room to run outside. The local neighborhood with the trail can be run creatively to get a 5k or for the more adventurous you can run to New Mexico and back for a 10K.Wow, staff is Terrific!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nice and clean! Good breakfast!

Scrambled eggs with ham or just scrambled eggs, biscuits, gravy, sausage links, fresh fruit, yogurt, bagels, bread and some mexican dishes as well. Coffee was on the weak side though. The rooms were good for a 2 star hotel, had to get a King size room at the beginning and it was a little small, I'm traveling with my wife, son and boxer. The next room was so much better with two queen beds, however the toilet had to be unclogged once, it was flushing very slow.Parking was good, they have cameras everywhere. The pool was also good, well at least my son enjoyed it. The tv reception was not all that great and the free wifi was good but a little unreliable. The staff was absolutely great. We will definitely stay again, but have to tell you to reserve your room quick because they sell out fairly quick.Room was wonderful. I spent four days there, before and after the Bataan Memorial Death March, and was really impressed with the low cost (reserved through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FChoiceHotels.com&amp;s=d8392470625abc2e23c9579395c83468ff1d39cb7947f03ce88eb63911bab1a5"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">ChoiceHotels.com</a>); large, soft, and comfortable bed; nice bathroom; and proximity to LOTS of food options. Would definitely stay again during my next El Paso trip.This is the loudest motel you can find to stay in. All the airplanes landing and taking off fly above the rooftop just a few yards. The roads in front and to the side are always filled with the loudest vehicles with the loudest mufflers. Walls are poorly insulated to deflect the sounds. The shower in room didn't drain very well and requested it to be fixed, with no luck a week later. An error between housekeeping and front desk allowed for some strange innocent people to barge into the room late at night, waking me up and not to mention scaring us. However, the room is clean and the  rate was great. Everything else is just overriding the quality of this not so quality inn. I will never return here to stay after this job ends. Not my best stay at a usually great motel chain.GIANT roach on ceiling!! Gross!Doing a cross country trip and arrived super late and was leaving early so just needed a place to rest our heads.  Would never stay here otherwise!!!Was in town for a family event.  Was pleasantly surprised at the room cleanliness and the size of the room.   It has all of the basics I needed and was satisfied with the value.  It seems to be older but is well worth the cost for the traveler who doesnt need to stay at a Hilton.Was really impressed! I was skeptical of this stop, due to previous reviews; but I was splendidly surprised! Room was super clean, ac worked and lots of towels. A bit of a misunderstanding with our room, but not hotel's fault. We went down to breakfast at 8:30am and ending time was 9:00. The buffet was full and they were still setting out more. Great service, great rooms and so affordable!5 stars?! WTF was that reviewer thinking?! My colleague booked this room and when we pulled into the parking lot i seriously thought I was staying at the Bates Motel. The place was uber shady. The door lock looked like a monkey with a pogo stick could break in. I could actually see the light from outside through the side crack in the door. I was totally skeeved out and even cut short my trip after one night. The ""breakfast buffet"" consisted of menudo and no tea. Not my cup of tea even if they had any. I would never stay here again.The room was clean but need a little repair.  Great breakfast with a wide variety of choices from maneudo to pancakes.  The staff was also very friendly.Stayed overnight in El Paso and, while I was not impressed with my experience in the city in general, this Quality Inn location definitely worth spending a few more dollars than at the Travelodge down the road or similar.  Friendly staff, clean room, and the breakfast buffet was pretty impressive for what we paid for the room.",,,,,"['let', 'start', 'favorite', 'part', 'breakfast', 'scrambled', 'eggs', 'ham', 'scrambled', 'eggs', 'biscuits', 'gravy', 'sausage', 'links', 'fresh', 'fruit', 'yogurt', 'bagels', 'bread', 'dishes', 'well', 'coffee', 'weak', 'side', 'though', 'rooms', 'good', 'star', 'hotel', 'king', 'size', 'room', 'beginning', 'little', 'small', 'traveling', 'wife', 'son', 'boxer', 'next', 'room', 'much', 'better', 'queen', 'beds', 'however', 'toilet', 'unclogged', 'flushing', 'slow', 'parking', 'good', 'cameras', 'everywhere', 'pool', 'also', 'good', 'well', 'least', 'son', 'enjoyed', 'reception', 'great', 'free', 'good', 'little', 'unreliable', 'staff', 'absolutely', 'great', 'definitely', 'tell', 'reserve', 'room', 'quick', 'sell', 'fairly', 'quick', 'room', 'wonderful', 'spent', 'four', 'days', 'memorial', 'death', 'march', 'really', 'impressed', 'low', 'cost', 'reserved', 'com', 'amp', 'target', 'rel', 'com', 'large', 'soft', 'comfortable', 'bed', 'nice', 'bathroom', 'proximity', 'lots', 'food', 'options', 'definitely', 'next', 'trip', 'loudest', 'motel', 'find', 'airplanes', 'landing', 'taking', 'fly', 'rooftop', 'yards', 'roads', 'front', 'side', 'always', 'filled', 'loudest', 'vehicles', 'loudest', 'mufflers', 'walls', 'poorly', 'insulated', 'deflect', 'sounds', 'shower', 'room', 'drain', 'well', 'requested', 'fixed', 'luck', 'week', 'later', 'error', 'housekeeping', 'front', 'desk', 'allowed', 'strange', 'innocent', 'people', 'barge', 'room', 'late', 'night', 'waking', 'mention', 'scaring', 'however', 'room', 'clean', 'rate', 'great', 'everything', 'else', 'overriding', 'quality', 'quality', 'inn', 'never', 'return', 'job', 'ends', 'best', 'usually', 'great', 'motel', 'chain', 'giant', 'roach', 'ceiling', 'gross', 'cross', 'country', 'trip', 'arrived', 'super', 'late', 'leaving', 'early', 'needed', 'place', 'rest', 'heads', 'never', 'otherwise', 'town', 'family', 'event', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'room', 'cleanliness', 'size', 'room', 'basics', 'needed', 'satisfied', 'value', 'seems', 'older', 'well', 'worth', 'cost', 'traveler', 'need', 'really', 'impressed', 'skeptical', 'stop', 'due', 'previous', 'reviews', 'splendidly', 'surprised', 'room', 'super', 'clean', 'worked', 'lots', 'towels', 'bit', 'misunderstanding', 'room', 'hotel', 'fault', 'went', 'breakfast', 'ending', 'time', 'buffet', 'full', 'still', 'setting', 'great', 'service', 'great', 'rooms', 'affordable', 'stars', 'reviewer', 'thinking', 'colleague', 'booked', 'room', 'pulled', 'parking', 'lot', 'seriously', 'thought', 'staying', 'bates', 'motel', 'place', 'shady', 'door', 'lock', 'looked', 'like', 'monkey', 'pogo', 'stick', 'break', 'actually', 'see', 'light', 'outside', 'side', 'crack', 'door', 'totally', 'cut', 'short', 'trip', 'night', 'breakfast', 'buffet', 'consisted', 'tea', 'cup', 'tea', 'never', 'room', 'clean', 'need', 'little', 'repair', 'great', 'breakfast', 'wide', 'variety', 'choices', 'pancakes', 'staff', 'also', 'friendly', 'overnight', 'impressed', 'experience', 'city', 'general', 'quality', 'inn', 'location', 'definitely', 'worth', 'spending', 'dollars', 'road', 'similar', 'friendly', 'staff', 'clean', 'room', 'breakfast', 'buffet', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'paid', 'room']",[],[],[],[],"[('room', 15), ('great', 7), ('breakfast', 5), ('good', 4), ('clean', 4), ('well', 4), ('staff', 3), ('side', 3), ('motel', 3), ('never', 3), ('loudest', 3), ('buffet', 3), ('quality', 3), ('impressed', 3), ('little', 3), ('trip', 3), ('definitely', 3), ('rooms', 2), ('late', 2), ('worth', 2), ('surprised', 2), ('front', 2), ('night', 2), ('quick', 2), ('tea', 2), ('cost', 2), ('parking', 2), ('really', 2), ('lots', 2), ('however', 2), ('place', 2), ('com', 2), ('son', 2), ('size', 2), ('needed', 2), ('super', 2), ('next', 2), ('friendly', 2), ('door', 2), ('hotel', 2), ('inn', 2), ('need', 2), ('also', 2), ('eggs', 2), ('scrambled', 2), ('looked', 1), ('chain', 1), ('proximity', 1), ('queen', 1), ('people', 1), ('satisfied', 1), ('rest', 1), ('ending', 1), ('four', 1), ('reviewer', 1), ('still', 1), ('cut', 1), ('enjoyed', 1), ('giant', 1), ('slow', 1), ('rooftop', 1), ('ham', 1), ('cup', 1), ('thinking', 1), ('much', 1), ('bagels', 1), ('seems', 1), ('outside', 1), ('actually', 1), ('better', 1), ('setting', 1), ('location', 1), ('innocent', 1), ('colleague', 1), ('town', 1), ('coffee', 1), ('march', 1), ('rel', 1), ('wide', 1), ('food', 1), ('stop', 1), ('misunderstanding', 1), ('early', 1), ('mention', 1), ('walls', 1), ('boxer', 1), ('barge', 1), ('desk', 1), ('amp', 1), ('part', 1), ('paid', 1), ('bread', 1), ('service', 1), ('skeptical', 1), ('overriding', 1), ('like', 1), ('always', 1), ('large', 1), ('went', 1), ('fixed', 1)]",[],[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-paso-suites-hotel-el-paso,El Paso Suites Hotel,2.0,$$,34,"Ah yes...this place. Where to begin. Well..let's start with the first thing anyone looks for in any hotel: decorum.To the manager's credit, these people were very open and upfront about their multi-million dollar renovations which are still currently ongoing with an estimated completion date of November 2015. I found it rather humorous the way they ostensibly threw in the term ""multi-million dollar"" in front of renovations. Made it seem that much more epic...as if to suggest this place is destined for greatness. And perhaps it is. I just kind of looked at like this: they most likely got taken over by new management who, at some point said, ""this place needs a major makeover!"" ...and the rest was history. Because judging from whatever was left of the original decorum, this place VERY MUCH needs a renovation. Having said that, they should not even be renting out rooms right now...not until the renovations are complete anyway. But with an ECD of November '15, I sort of understand why they are anyway. Everyone's gotta make a paycheck, after all.Ignoring the aforementioned, let's talk about practical amenities. Now, it was mildly annoying the way they had to sporadically shut off the water for brief periods of time during the day due to said renovations. What was far more inconvenient was their shoddy WiFi service. Seriously, this signal made 3G look like fiber optic broadband. I was honestly searching the room for an Ethernet connection (since I carry a cable with me everywhere I travel), but came up empty. So I was stuck suffering with intermittent WiFi with a token which had a 24 clock on it; which meant you had to inexorably renew your pass for their connection. This may seem like a minor thing to complain about. But when you take a minute to consider how many dealings we conduct via the Internet (I.E. bills, important emails, signing digital documents, organizing other finances, etc..), this becomes a major show stopper! I shouldn't have to walk across to the local IHOP to obtain a decent signal.Speaking of computers, I should throw out one caveat: there is a business area where you can print documents as needed...but there is little to work with. Firstly, you'd better not have to print any documents which require download, because thanks to their security settings, you are not permitted to download anything. At all. Not even a PDF. Also, the printer isn't even wireless...which means you can forget about printing anything from your smartphone. These guys might want to consider renovating that business area, too.Finally, let's discuss the room really briefly here. The A/C unit was loud as hell and honestly felt and sounded more like a swamp cooler. We had the thermostat set at 65 the entire time, yet the temperature never got lower than 74 degrees. The room had two sections. So the bedroom felt nice and cool for the most part, whilst the living room felt like there wasn't any A/C at all. I honestly didn't know if one of the filters was clogged or if we were literally just working with a swamp cooler.Interesting side note: I'm actually traveling for business related purposes and had to move my family in the process; hence why I needed such a large room. When the opportunity came to seek more accommodating pastures, we packed up our stuff like a family on the run and booked out of that hotel ASAP and proceeded across the highway to go stay at the Residence Inn (expect a review on them in a week or two). As for the El Paso Suites..The suites themselves are actually decent...they resemble very modest studio apartments, which is putting it lightly. I like that there were two sections, though that part could have been executed much better. I detested the fact that such a room only had one tiny bathroom. And we won't even discuss the fact that their toilets had very weak water pressure...as did the sinks. Overall, let's just say I'm glad that I didn't have to pay full price for the room. I'm also eternally grateful that certain circumstances made it possible for me to check out early. Because quite frankly, if a hotel is undergoing heavy renovations the way this place is, they should not be renting out rooms until complete. Let me paint the picture for you all: would you want to stay in a hotel that features no complimentary breakfast because they have less than half their lobby in tact, has a giant tarp wrapped around the part they're doing construction on despite being able to see it all through the transparent elevators which creak each time you use them, and the subtle grains of debris from said construction at the bottom of a pool that probably shouldn't be open to the public at such a time? Sounds about as appealing as staying in an abandoned crack house. Do yourself a favor if you happen to be in the El Paso area seeking a large suite: stay in one of the establishments ran by the Marriott.This is a very nice and affordable old hotel. I liked the big room with lots of counter space and courtyard views. There was a small leak in our room that didn't bother me as it dripped right into the sink. My husband went down stairs to get us some breakfast, but he was stopped in his tracks- wasn't allowed to bring the food upstairs. The kitchen ""guard"" literally took his plate from his hands. Seemed a bit unnecessary and rude. We're not slobs. Other than the sucky breakfast bar and leak, I liked the old hotel.Think twice about this place. We used Expedia for any hotel on El Paso and they gave us this one. This place is going through major renovations and no one should be allowed to stay there. We went through two days of no hot water and the outlet in the vanity area not working. We made numerous complaints but no fixes. It was nothing but a nightmare and ended up leaving prior to our week being up. We scrambled for another hotel and luckily found a Hyatt close by. The hotel staff at El Paso Suites Hotel was courteous but were unable to remedy our problems, I don't find them specifically at fault. I will NEVER use Expedia again. The hotel should have never had any rooms open during the renovations and Expedia should have never pushed us towards this hotel.I would have given this a ZERO if i could have!  Anytime you have roaches coming out of the vents!!!!  Run!!!

LOVED IT...The guy in front did not want to honor military discount as I'm the spouse, but when he found out I had drove from Los Angeles with a 2 &amp; 8 year old boys....he said he would give to me. The room was beautiful. Breakfast was good.Staff was helpful....The reason why it's a 4 is the room had no way to keep door locked. There wasn't a stopper. My 2 year old kept opening the door. I had to move an ottoman in front of door.Other then that, it was clean, beautiful, all up to date. Would stay again.Very outdated,  and dirty. Also very loud. As of this posting,  major construction was going on. The hotel's website indicated a complimentary breakfast,  but because of the construction none was provided.Is there anyway you can give a place negative stars?1. Please find another front desk person. This guy was rude and could barely speak english. The guy in front of me was also pissed and I dont even know why2. Rooms are old and smell like cigarrete3. They havent done any maintenance since 19944. They dont care about service or guest's satisfaction5. Dont order dry cleaning service they will mess up your clothing6. I could go on and on. Please dont stay here... Dont be fooled by the 3 star rating on priceline... It is not 3 stars!Do not stay here.  Priceline rates this hotel 3 stars but its not even a 1.  The exterior looks bad and the area looks shady.  The courtyard looks ok.  I was happy when I seen the size if the room compared to the 4 star we recently stayed at.  Then it went downhill from there. We didn't get any hot water, followed by an alarm where we had to evacuate  and now no air conditioning.   We are still here and can't wait to check out tomorrow!My wife and I stayed here for two nights while visiting family after securing a great rate via Priceline. We were both very impressed by the convenient location, spacious rooms, beautiful atrium, and the simple, but welcome perks (complimentary happy hour &amp; breakfast). I'll get the few negatives out of the way first. The El Paso Suites is not what I'd call luxury lodging. The technology in our room was a decade old or so and it's not a place where you go to be seen. (remember you're in El Paso, not Scottsdale)What it is, however, is a fantastic property for the price and more. Here's my breakdown:LOCATION -- easy on/off freeway access with shopping/restaurants/gas stations a very short drive away...it's basically just off the frontage road of the interstate, so you'll be driving most everywhere you go, not taking romantic strollsLOBBY/EXTERIOR/ETC. -- The beautiful atrium is the star of the property...very impressive, especially for a hotel of this value...though a bit old school, all the public areas we saw were spotless with tasteful decorROOMS -- This is a full-size suite with two big rooms in each room...the TVs were circa 1995 and the view was of another motel parking lot (from our second floor location), but the beds were comfy, bathroom was clean and efficient, and, again, there was plenty of room to stretch out. POOL/GYM -- Too bad this isn't an outdoor pool as it might be a bit more appealing to soak in some El Paso sun...it's an indoor pool usually occupied by kids though, so we chose to skip it...the gym was small and a little warm, but we put the cardio and weight equipment to good use and were very satisfied.PERKS -- TWO free drinks per person per day is their complimentary happy hour...yeah, it's Franzia box wine or Miller Light, but if you don't mind a blue collar beverage in a blue collar city, then it's a very nice touch...the free breakfast was surprisingly good...not just a stale continental breakfast, the eggs were cooked to order, salsa was excellent, and the lighter fare (yogurt, fruit, etc.) was well maintained also.STAFF -- Everyone we interacted with was friendly and we saw constant attention to keeping the public areas clean and tidy. We will certainly look to stay here again during our next visit!Rooms are absolutely huge for the price!!! Although they are severely outdated, TV is outdated, bathroom outdated, lamps outdated. The hot water was fine in my room. BUT BE WARNED if you like ice cold hotel rooms DO NOT STAY HERE! The AC says its at 65 degrees but it feels like 75 at least. Tempted to go buy a box fan... Although, I would stay here again for the huge rooms for the good price.Former Embassy Suites when 1970?  The rooms are horrible, rented two rooms based on photos,  very deceptive. Rooms have old window doors and front is all windows anyone could break in.  Balcony door was taped closed could hear traffic all night and don't expect to get air in winter, only heat. shower took forever for hot water then would not turn down. This is a negative 5..Horrible. .oh they do have a creative Web person...Did not sleep well here at all!  Record hot day and they conveniently withheld vital information: the air conditioner system for the whole place was TURNED OFF for their renovation!  Wasted time and energy and valuable sleep waiting for it to kick in.  The breakfast was lacking in portion size and NO SECONDS!  In summary, this place chooses their bottom line over your comfort.  Avoid!I Realize this is an old hotel,  but since the rates ate still high,  it should have kept it's standards up as well.  NO WIFI, even if they claim to have it.  Breakfast was blah, and I called housekeeping for 30 mins before anyone would answer,  then when I finally got someone,  I had to GO get my own blankets and pillows from the front desk. ... yeah. I hope along with the renovation,  they renovate the staff as well.Terrible hotel. Sheets were stained and the entire room just felt dirty. Was supposed to stay two nights. Checked out early. I travel for work VERY often and never felt the need to write a bad review.These reviews are ridiculous! For $85 you get a king size bed, an extra room with a couch and fridge, a beautiful view of the city and complimentary breakfast. I have been traveling from Seattle and have stayed at 3 hotels all for the same price range(actually more expensive) and I could only afford days hotel and travel lodge. This place is in that price range but it is a much better deal. These reviews are from snobby people who should have spent there money going to a five star $300+ resort.We got a deal on priceline, and it picked El Paso Suites. The Hotel is old, rooms need updating. But It's livable. What I didn't like is the breakfast. Wow. They give you a ticket to get food. You wait in line with all the other customers. I waited 15 min, my parents 20 min. The breakfast wasn't worth the wait. It was also very little. Go to IHOP next door, and I hate IHOP. I don't know why they don't have a buffet. Are they afraid of people eating too much? Come on. Eggs are cheap folks. Raise some chickens if you must.They need to: - Refresh the hotel: Carpets, design, TVs- Get a breakfast buffet like other hotels.My wife, son, and daughter were just turned away from this property at 11:00 pm, after trying to check into a prepaid room. At first I thought there was a language issue with my wife, but my daughter's English is perfect, and so it was definitely not a misunderstanding. The debit card they used was ""declined"" for a charge of $50. My card had been declined earlier in the day as my bank thought the charge to be suspect. The plane was late and it was after hours for contacting the bank. My daughter had $300 cash and they refused to accept any amount, instead keeping the prepaid Priceline fee and sending them away. Any business that feels that it is within their rights to take their customer's money and refuse to provide the contracted service will not last long. If their policy is that a cash deposit (more than double) is unacceptable, the right thing to do would be to provide a full refund. To the person who turned away my family, remember, it's the customers who fund your paycheck. Nice job, probably get your name on the plaque again next month.WARNING!!! do not stay at this hotel!!! I just got back from Staying there in El Paso and I had the worst experience.  This USED to be the Embassy suites, BUT the quality has gone down to a Big fat ZERO!!! When I arrived, the room that was assigned to me 327, had a serious electrical shortage when I got up to turn on the AC at 3:00AM a loud noise followed by sparks and smoke ensued...it was the most frightening experience ever.  But wait, the hotel never bothered to check it out.  They just moved me down stairs to room 120. The room I moved into had cockroaches, the AC did not work properly, the cold water in the shower came out very hot!!! the TV in the living area did not work, the pillows were as hard as a rock and the room itself was gross dirty.  The Treadmills did not work properly and the work out room was very hot - air con, And El Paso can get very hot in the Summer...And last but not least, OMG the ""free"" breakfast was horrific!! a doughnut and coffee would have topped their crappy food... Not at all like the Embassy suites it used to be!!! Had I not gotten a good deal with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpriceline.com&amp;s=e5cb2f2bc2fd4f19545ac52761ccc6e744725ffbab4068c6876732ed40961d01"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">priceline.com</a> I would have checked out in a heart beat.  But I did not have the time nor money to stay elsewhere as I was there for a graduation.Oh and be warned!!! if you have a problem, they will tell you that they cannot help you because you went through a third party to book the room...WHAT the hell...but I picked that hotel.  And never did management call me to see how I was doing after that terrible fire shortage.  This place is a royal dump!!!And when I called priceline to inform them of my ordeal, they called the hotel and the hotel idiots denied everything and anything-unbelievable!!! Priceline is still trying to follow up and see if we can get some sort of compensation...This management is in the wrong business.  They think they can jack people around and still make money -NOTRumor has it they are selling out within the year and the new owners will be converting it back to the Embassy suites-Awesome blossom!!!!  Otherwise these bozos are going to go out of business real soon!!!!  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This has to be the oldest Embassy Suites I have ever being in, the exterior sign was faded, and basically everything was outdated.  The TV in the living room was a flat screen but the one in the room was the old ones.  Normally the manager's reception offers more than chips, and pretzel mix with the well booze but this place sets the bar at the minimum.  The only thing that saves it from the bottom is the fact that the internet speeds were pretty good, and even though the shuttle was suppose to only run at the top of the hour the staff called the driver, who has other assigned duties, and she gladly came down to drive me to the airport in the morning.As mentioned in other reviews this hotel, mainly the rooms themselves, is not up to what frequent travelers equate to the Embassy Suites name.  Yes, the rooms are suites.  They are in badly need for a renovation though.  TVs are out dated, AC is noisy, and the carpet is older than the dirt on it.  In my opinion my room was clean.  Then again, I'm a bachelor and live alone so my opinion may be suspect.Also, I am guessing this is one of the older Embassy Suites as it doesn't have a bar/restaurant and a rather small Breakfast/Manager's Reception.I didn't have an issue with the staff and room service was decent.  So I think a quality renovation could bring this hotel up to snuff.(On a side note:  I would like to thank the staff for having the 4 bikini clad young women sun-tanning in view of the Exercise Room while I was working out.)","I'm am a huge proponent of ""you get what you pay for"".  Only want to pay 90 dollars a night to stay in SF = Travelodge conditions with a sharps container in the bathroom.However, for Embassy Suites...it is definitely not worth it.  We paid almost 200 dollars for a king + sofa couch.  NEVER opt for a sofa couch instead of two fulls.  Like everyone else said, this hotel is old.  The card key would never open on the first try, the whole hotel reeks of cleaning chemicals, and we were missing a remote control.Perks: the complimentary breakfast and cocktail hour (which we missed).  Don't be tricked by their marketing antics to lure you in.  Hilton, I expected more from you.Where to begin? Awful, just awful. All I need out of hotel is: NO bugs, working heat, hot water and working refridgerator. Those are fair requirements, yes?Day 1: I called earlier that day to let them know I would be checking in late because my first flight was canceled due to mechanical issues. I arrive and someone canceled my reservation. Mind you, my job handles all my travel plans and that late in the evening. The office is closed. So that added to my frustration. The front desk clerk ""R"", was an inconsiderate... Anyway, as soon as I mentioned I would go to the Radisson my reservation was in the computer and I was in my room within five minutes. I get to my room and see the 20 year old TV's. I hate that, but sometimes those are the cards that are dealt. After 12 hours of flying/layovers I am ready for bed. Thankfully, I didn't unpack that night. Day 2: I woke up at 6am and went to the bathroom. I see insects scurrying around the bathroom when I pop the light on. It's time to get another room. I am greeted by very accomodating, apologetic, pleasant staff. Unlike the not so gentlemen ""R"" from the evening before. They move me to a room where at least one of the TV's was an LCD. I look around for any tell tale signs of insects. All looks good. Time to go eat my made to order breakfast. ""Hi, do you have any boiled eggs?"" ""No"", the chef responds. There goes my breakfast. Later, but before I go to the grocery store. I stop and ask the clerk on duty if it would be possible if I bought a dozen eggs if the kitchen could boil them for me. ""No"", she says. I bite my tongue, an amazing feat in itself, but I am thinking to myself. ""Made to order my arse!""That should give anyone an idea of how the rest of the stay went. I haven't mentioned the consistent rudeness of ""R"" throughout the stay. It's already well liquor served. They have to water it down too? The fridge that didn't work. The hot water that got room temperature. The heat that worked when it felt like. The not all the way sealed windows/doors that could have only been caulked by kindergarteners.The one year and three months overdue elevator inspections.The peeling wallpaper.The water stained ceilings. Frankly, Hilton should be ashamed to have their name attached to this location. I've stayed at many lesser name hotels in my travels that were better than this. I have informed my office about this hotel and we will no longer be staying at this location. I recommend the same for anyone looking to stay in El Paso.I had to call 5 times for a shuttle to pick me up from the airport and waited almost an hour.  The hotel is only 5 minutes away.  The service was terrible, the location was awful, but the rooms were clean.  I booked on Hotwire and it said 3.5 stars, but 1.5 is more accurateThe hotel had a urine odor, I think from the indoor pool. When we got into the room it was outdated. The blanket had a few holes and the sheets were stained *gross*, there were clear wrappers on the floor and the shower curtain was on the dirty side as well...That's what happens when I don't book where we stay!Seriously underwhelming experience for the amount of money paid. WiFi is $6/day for crappy signal and paltry bandwidth. Shower never got above lukewarm even on full blast. Property is sandwiched on an asphalt swath between an insurance cube farm, IHOP, and a LaQuinta. Bottle of water at gift shop=$3.50; walk 200 yards to Circle K, same bottle=$1.19.Cooked to order breakfast? The only cooked to order item was an omelet. Want pancakes, sausage, or bacon? Some grossly undercooked rubbery substance is pulled out of a chafing dish.Cocktail hour however worked well. Beer, wine, well drinks, and soft drinks with a big bowl of bar mix.Do not leave anything in the ""living room"" part of the suite. It is clearly visible through the thin gauze covering the wall to wall window/door.Staff was polite and cheerful, but they seem overwhelmed with the fading starlet quirks of this hotel.This is by far the worst experience our family has ever had!! We had 4 of us staying in a suite because we were in town for a funeral, on the website to book the room it wasn't easy to find where to put how many guest were staying. Little did we know that upon check in they would charger per person after the 2nd guest. When we asked if they could still honor our rate the manager said no and the human resources lady was quick to say they will cancel our reservation if we want to go somewhere else. WOW! Since we had no where else to go that would accommodate 4 of us comfortably we were stuck in the El Paso Suites Hotel situation. We decided to check out the ""managers reception"" where they had only miller lite and red or white wine, cheap vodka would be $2. No appetizers that a normal managers reception would have. Continuing on, our second day they did not have hot water starting at 10am, they put a notice on the door at 9:30am and weren't expecting hot water for several hours. I feel a phone call to all guests would have been necessary for this, a note 30 min before is just not adequate enough. 2 out of 4 of us were able to have an actual hot shower and when we asked if they could credit us, again the not so friendly human resources lady said she would see what she could do...we got our bill and nothing was done, not even a phone call. It's obvious this use to be an Embassy Suites, it urgently needs a modernization remodel. The rooms are terribly outdated. I will not be coming back to this hotel again and I will not be recommending it to anyone.Very friendly staff during the week. Drivers are helpful and friendly (Julio rocked!) Great Managers Happy Hour! Gym left some to be desired, pool always had kids in it but calm during the day. Prices were reasonable - cheaper on weekends. Thank you!!We stayed in August '11 and was VERY disapointed, especially for the price.  They gave us a very subpar room the first night but when I complained they gave us a little better room and completely comped our 1st night.  So they did try.This hotel is not as awful as some people claim. Yes, it could use some renovation but I did not have a bad experience here.Can someone queue the Adams family theme song? Cause that's what you will feel like when you stay here. This is probably the most outdated embassy suites with a creepy haunted house feel to it. Even when you enjoy your complimentary breakfast hope you like eating in the dark.   The suites have a store front feel to them which is great if you want to pretend you run a law office but otherwise I like my hotel to look and feel like a real hotel with some privacy.Very sub par Embassy Suite, especially for the price.  Outdated facilities.  Manager's reception was decent.  The bartender makes a decent bloody mary.  Saddest breakfast I've seen at an Embassy Suites.  My room wasn't cleaned too well either.  Dirty clothes from the last guest were still in the room!  As unsatisfactory as this joint was, and the fact this was in El Paso, I can't believe the price...$150!This is an old hotel with no on site restaurant or lounge. Rooms are really not that updated and some may find the glass room doors less secure than the usual wood doors. Work out room is pretty decent and the free breakfast and Happy hour is nice. If you're a Hilton points collector, you may eat to check out the Homewood Suites just down the street. That's my plan when I return to El Paso.Helpful front desk.  Nice breakfast.  Nice happy hour.  Room was dirty, filthy sheets, piping hot, extremely loud because of the highway, and jammed pack with border patrol, Army units, etc.Place needs an update.  Sliding glass doors on balconies are ""glued"" shut so they cannot be opened.  The noise from the interstate comes right through the worn balcony doors as does the wind. New closely located hilton properties are much nicer.",,,,"['yes', 'place', 'begin', 'well', 'let', 'start', 'first', 'thing', 'anyone', 'looks', 'hotel', 'decorum', 'manager', 'credit', 'people',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/radisson-hotel-el-paso-airport-el-paso,Radisson Hotel El Paso Airport,3.5,$$,25,"The rooms were pretty standard. Not brand new, but clean and with the amenities I wanted, including a coffee maker and mini fridge.I didn't use either pool or the fitness room. They also were nothing special, but looked fine.But the stay is a winner based on service. The staff was friendly. The shuttle driver gets you back and forth to the airport super fast, and will also take you anywhere within 3 miles. Then you also get a full breakfast (from the menu to your table including chorizo and egg omelets and such) and happy hour daily. Happy hour is chips, salsa, popcorn, and your first two drinks. (Beer, wine or soda.)And the location is great for the airport. It's the closest hotel not on the airport property. Of course it's not a location for walking around town, but you can take the shuttle to a restaurant and back.We were in Hawaiian embassy suite by Hilton last week and comparing to that hotel, price is fair. Room is clean and there is everything that you may expect for $80/night hotel. However, there are couple of issues that makes me not to come here again. - finding parking spot at night is difficult. - breakfast service is TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, and TERRIBLE. Only 2 waiters for 115 people. It took 1 hr for us to get what we want. Even if you like the environment stay away from this hotel if time is important for you.Just a weekend in town getaway with the wifey and kiddos. So far it has been pleasant despite it being practically filled up, its been quiet, pool was empty and clean, same for the jacuzzi. Nice and relaxed. Forget that I'm still in El Paso. Friendly staff, professional and courteous. Bed is extremely comfortable. Received complimentary breakfast tickets as well. Highly recommend for any out of towners that looking for a quality hotel that wont break the bank. Very reasonably priced for what you get. We like to stay at hotels from time to time. Just started being a tradition, kids love it and we don't have to worry about picking up after ourselves.I have stayed at this hotel 3 times on business, and I have to say that it holds a special place in my heart. The staff exudes warmth and friendliness and appears to truly care about all of their guests. I must mention a few people in particular: Janie at the front desk overheard that we were celebrating the birthday of a colleague, and upon our return to the hotel after dinner had arranged for a plate a desserts to be waiting for my colleague at his room! Not every person goes above and beyond like this, and we really appreciated the gesture. Lyka greeted us with such genuine warmth, and enthusiastically recommended a place for our birthday dinner. Eddie was the shuttle driver who patiently drove us to shopping and our dinner location with patience and warmth. Thank you for a great experience every time I come to El Paso - you offer a uniquely warm service.I'll just lay out the Pros and Cons for you. PROS: pretty sure it's walking distance from the airport, unless you're lazy as shit, or have a disability or 500 bags,then hop on a FREE Shuttle.complimentary Happy Hour!! Friendly employeesClean roomsFree breakfast. Not some crappy continental breakfast either. A legit, order what you want off the menu and they serve it hot, breakfast.Several Wi-Fi optionsI LOVED the shampoo &amp; conditioner they provide in the rooms. We had dinner here and the food was DELICIOUS!CONS:those Wi-Fi spots can be iffy.A basic tub/shower that seems kinda small. I recommend this place if you have to stay in El Paso.We celebrated our 24 year Anniversary here and had a Great Night. The Bar and Grill was awesome. We had the wings and beef nachos. Excellent drinks. I had several including the Irish Car Bomb and the wife enjoyed her Blue Azteca. We received two free breakfast tickets and the breakfast was great we had the omelette. The servers were Great and very nice . We had a 4th floor suite which was Awesome. Only issue there is no ice machines on the 4th floor and the 3rd floor machine was outta ice. Awesome time with my Sexy Mrs's.Beautiful looking hotel, nice rooms. Feels clean and fresh. But for work, this place was a disaster. The wifi was free, but I couldn't even connect to a single webpage! Worse than dial-up. I ended up using my phone to search for a wifi coffee shop.Again, nice place to stay but not for business.Poor customer service is beyond infuriating. We checked into our room 2 AM in the morning to find that the toilet wasn't working. The next morning the stopper for the bathtub wasn't working also. When we checked out we informed the receptionist. She advised that we should have informed the front desk the night before about the issue. Really? At 2 AM when undressed, the last thing you want to do is to get the toilet fixed or move all your stuff to another room. The room should have be pre-checked by maintenance staff and we should have got a voucher or some token discount for the inconvenience. Instead we are advised to contact Priceline. How is it their problem?I really liked this hotel. In fact I give them 4 stars only because the walkways to and from the terminal aren't well marked which made what seemed like an easy walk to the airport a little less easy.Still, the hotel was clean and the staff friendly. Gym and pool were a little dank and dark though. Restaurant was pretty amazing (try the Fajitas!)Not much else within walking distance. I think there was an applebees or a chilis next door and a few gas station convenience stores down the street but thats about it. Still between great rooms and a great restaurant this one gets an easy 4 stars from me.Horrible, simply horrible! We had charges to our room we did not make. Come to find out, someone bought tons of drinks at the bar, and charged them to our room. If that wasn't enough, they forged my boyfriend's signature. How did they know our room number and boyfriend name enough to sign it similar to his? Spoke to management, and there was no sense of urgency. We were advised we needed to wait until tomorrow. Very unprofessional and horrible taste in hospitality.Love love this place so convo eminently located.  I recommend or bucks when booking you'll save .  Military discount too.  Very nice request the rooms with the glass doors they are nice .Hotel is very close to the airport; you can see it from the pick-up area.  A shuttle came and picked me up.  The driver said they had 24hr service and would take you anywhere within 3mi of the hotel but I just used them for the ride to the hotel.  There is an Applebees and Cattle Baron restaurant in the same parking lot.Room was clean, spacious, and the bed was comfortable.  I didn't spend much time on the free WiFi but it was usable on my tablet.  Free made-to-order breakfast was included but didn't stay to try it.Accommodations were a great value almost as nice as the $200/night hotel I stayed at in Austin the follow night.I've stayed here a few times.  Hotel is nice and clean and well updated.  The staff here is what really makes this hotel shine though.  Almost everyone here is very well trained and know their job and it shows.  Comes across as the kind of service you'd expect a much more expensive hotel.  The staff at the front desk might be the weak point in the chain though.  They're nice enough but don't seem have that same level of training everyone else does.Other things I like about this hotel:-The free breakfast is made to order and several options available.-The complimentary shuttle does more than just airport runs.  They'll take you to local restaurants and pick you up.  Great if you're stuck here without a car like me.-Evening happy hour.  Complimentary beverages and snacks.  Two drink limit and chips and salsa or popcorn as the snacks.  They do it every night which is good.Hotel has a contract with Southwest Airlines I believe.  Several pilots and flight attendants can be seen eating breakfast everymorning I've been here.The most comfortable Radisson Monkey ever stayed in...This place was great. I had just gotten in from an all day drive and not only did we get a great deal from Expedia but the lady at the front desk recommended a great Mexican food place which I will not forget. Simple as that. Close to the airport, I'd say middle class neighborhood and I definitely felt safe.THE WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER. When my sister &amp; I checked in at 9 on a Sat. night there was no restaurant, bar or room service open.  The half witted young man at the front desk then ""dropped"" my credit card (that he demanded for ""incidentals"" altho with no mini bar in the room and no restaurant bar or room service what could those be?) down a ""hole"" and said he couldn't find it.  He told me I could come back down and get it whenever he found it.  Two hours later he said he hadn't been able to get it.  He hadn't called maintenace because ""they didn't have a maintenance crew.""  He refused to connect me to a manager.  When the manager eventually called me she said they did have a maintenance crew and she had ""just called them.""  She brought the card to my room in the middle of the night.  This morning there was a mysterious (fraudulent) $50 charge on it that the rude young woman on the front desk refused to remove claiming it was for unexplained ""incidentals"" -- what incidentals?  Terrible service.  Idiots who work there and rude to boot.Convenient, clean, quiet, big rooms, and very close to airport.  The staff was excellent, the amenities top notch, and the service was on par with higher end hotels.  The gym was one of the best gyms I've ever seen in a hotel.  There were indoor and outdoor versions of everything (pools, hot tubs, sitting areas, etc.) so the hotel was great for all seasons. Although not quite a resort, you could do everything you needed to do without leaving the premises.The beds were very comfortable.The building is obviously a bit on the older side and the bathrooms are fairly plain, but everything was clean and the service was great.I brought a large group to this hotel, contracted the rooms, and was very pleased.  The manager catered to our needs and I will definitely come back here again, with a group or by myself.The free breakfast (open from 5 AM to 10 AM) was to-order off a menu and the food/service was good.  They routinely messed up the orders, but I honestly didn't care when all was said and done.There are large meeting rooms and a large atrium for social events.You can walk to the airport from here.  And Applebees and the Cattle Baron (steak restaurant) are in the parking lot.Even though I'm convinced I saw a ghost here (feel free to message me for the details), this hotel is a great option for business travelers, families and casual travelers.  For starters, the location is amazing. It's literally 200 yards from the airport, but situated in such a way that somehow you don't really hear any noise from the airplanes. Perhaps it's because it's a small airport so there's just not that much traffic? Not sure, but it's never been a problem for me.  Because of the close location, the shuttle takes less than 5 minutes to arrive and has always been staffed by a friendly driver, eager to provide recommendations on local hits.  The shuttle will also take you anywhere within a 3 mile radius, which includes numerous restaurants, 2 different malls, Target, Costco and Walmart!Rooms are big and well-maintained, each equipped with a flat-screen tv, nice coffee maker and independently controlled thermostat.  Most rooms also have a fridge and microwave (you might need to search for it- sometimes it's hidden in a closet). All stays come with a complimentary breakfast which is prepared just for you in their restaurant. You get a choice about about 10 different entrees, which include an awesome omelet and really good steel-cut oatmeal. Coffee, juice and soda are also included with breakfast.  The hotel has a daily happy hour for all guests which includes free chips and salsa, popcorn, and 2 complimentary drinks (draft beer, house wine, or soda.) It's a nice perk at the end of the work day. The Radisson has both an indoor and outdoor pool and hot tub, both of which are clean and well-working. The 24 hour fitness facility is also a great perk!  All the beds are Sleep Number, which contrary to popular belief, I've never found to be that comfortable. No dig on the business, I just don't like the beds. Perhaps you will :)And free wifi. For your entire stay.So as I sit in my room typing this with no Internet service or television you may be able to sense what the tone of this review will be. Apparently there is a cable service provider problem which I fully understand happens. What I don't understand is how they deal with the issue. Let me start from the beginning. Attempt to check in at the Marriott next door but was turned away because they were full. Marriott front desk staff courteously called the Radisson and inquired about rooms. They informed me all they had left were ""deluxe"" suites at $198 per night. I felt stuck so I took it. What was strange was when I arrived to see a fairly empty parking lot and not much activity in the bar and lobby. This was confirmed also the next day when I overheard the front desk staff offer a ""regular"" guest room to someone checking in to be closer to another guest. This is when I discovered the Internet and television were out. I had to leave the hotel and work from a Starbucks all day to get done what I needed. I then returned hoping all would be well, not so. I figured the front desk would be amenable to a reduced rate but when I inquired they looked at me like I had 3 heads. I believe the response was ""we pay for the service  and its not our fault it's down."" Guess what, I agree its not your fault. What is your responsibility is to insure an excellent customer experience. If that means a rate reduction when you can't meet your commitments so be it. Am I way off base here? This property could have turned lemons into lemonade all by how they addressed this problem. Let it be a lesson to all of us in customer service.WON'T BE BACK!!!!!!!My third stay here in 2 years and time to express my feelings.The staff are great. The facility and its maintenance are horrid.My first room (had to get moved due to lack of water thanks Notre Dame football team) had a toilet that didnt flush, hair dryer not working, and half the lights in the room not working.I then got moved to a ""business class room:"", bigger but with a poor thermostat. temperature swings didn't allow sleep. by the time, I turned on the TV, there were only 12 stations, half in  Spanish and nothing outside of networks. There's a a Marriott next door that will get my business next time.","We checked in on what (in my opinion) was the worse night/morning of the year...it was 3 am and snowing in El Paso...who knew it snowed in Texas?!?! Anyhow, we picked this Radisson because it looked nice and was on top of the airport. The room was clean and up to date with a flat screen TV, free WiFi etc. Remember, I said it was snowing so it was very cold and the room was about 60 degrees when we walked in...once I realized it took more than my lame college education to figure out the thermostat I called the front desk...did I say we checked in at 3 am?...they sent maintenance he managed to turn the heat on and as soon as he left the heater started knocking...as in loud knocking...repeatedly. I was too tired to called the front desk and managed to sleep through it. Other than that it was about what you can expect to stay in a hotel as such.Hotel was nice. Service was excellent. They will take you anywhere in a 3 mile radius. Sleep comfort bed only had two settings. Hard or soft.  Heat was set at 71 but went up to 85.  I woke up drenched in sweat.  A little on the old side but it was convenient to airport.Wow! I have been to El Paso for 4 different visits over the past 2 years and this was my first time staying at the Radisson.  I sure wish I had tried it on the previous visits...I wouldn't go anywhere else.  The accommodations and service are wonderful. The sleep number beds are very comfy, the bedding is luxurious. We were in a small (not deluxe or lux) king room since I booked at the last minute...but, it was still roomy enough for hubby and I, super clean, and nicely appointed. The complimentary drinks and breakfast are fun as well as yummy.  All of the  staff is top tier all the way from the desk to the services.  Finally, the gym is truly awesome for an airport hotel...Outfitted with commercial quality equipment.I was there for a 2-day trade show. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially the banquet staff. The food was pretty good. We had a ""box lunch,"" which was delicious and fresh. The first night my group arranged for a reception. The appetizers were really tasty and flavorful. The bacon-wrapped shrimp was a huge hit. The hotel hosts a Manager's Happy Hour giving every guest two (that's 2) free drinks - Woo Hoo! The bar staff was very and fun too.The rooms were nice. I only stayed one night and didn't spend much time there. They have those adjustable beds where you had to pick a ""sleep number."" The control to my bed didn't display the numbers. I thought I had made the entire bed as firm as possible. Nope. One side was firm and high, the other side was ultra-soft. I rolled over and there was a noticeable drop. After I stopped laughing, I fixed both sides to be equal and slept very well.The only thing I didn't like was the check-in time became a moving target. I arrived at 10:30am, knowing my room wouldn't be ready, and was told I could get into my room at 1pm. Well, 1pm became 1:30...1:30 became 2, then 2:30, and finally checked in at 3pm. Not sure what caused the delay. If it's supposed to be a 3pm check-in, they should've just told me.They have an on-site restaurant and bar.  Breakfast was good. It's table service with hot breakfast cooked to order from a select menu. There is a full menu available too. From what others told me, lunch was good as well. There is plenty of parking in the back, and the hotel is really close to a lot of restaurants and some shopping. I'll probably stay here if I'm ever in El Paso for another overnight stay.9/12/1010I ordered dinner in the bar while watching football. The Philly Cheese Steak sandwich was small compared to the $10.95 price. Go elsewhere for meals.They promptly picked me up at the El Paso Airport with one phone call. My room was on the first floor, with a French door opening out to the outdoor pool / jacuzzi area. It was very nice. It had a King-sized Sleep Number bed, which was interesting. When I laid down on it, I realized it was nothing more than an expensive air mattress with a lot of padding on top! I won't fault the Radisson for it, but a Tempurpedic would have been much more comfortable! Despite the hotel's location next to the airport, my room was very quiet. The Manager's Reception in the bar was a blast; you get two free drinks (beer, wine or soft drinks). They serve a full, cooked-to-order breakfast in the morning (included). The hotel has beautiful architecture and public spaces, and all of the staff members I came into contact with were friendly and helpful. The Radisson El Paso was so nice, I wished I could stay longer.",,,,"['rooms', 'pretty', 'standard', 'brand', 'new', 'clean', 'amenities', 'wanted', 'including', 'coffee', 'maker', 'mini', 'fridge',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-el-paso-central-el-paso-2,Holiday Inn Express El Paso-Central,3.5,$$,23,"This was the second time I have stayed at this location.I was upgraded to a King Suite.  The room was very spacious and the bed was really comfortable.  The staff are friendly, helpful, and seem to enjoy what they do.  The breakfast is the standard I see at all Holiday Inn Express hotels.This location offers chips with homemade salsa and soft drinks in the lobby at 5:30.  The salsa is FANTASTIC .I usually stay at The Doubletree on my trips to El Paso, but it was all booked up, probably due to the visit from Il Papa.  My secretary put me in the Holiday Inn Express instead. Not bad...not bad at all. The furniture in the room was a little weird, but I got used to it and it was very functional.  It appeared to be pretty new. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a clean as a pin. What impressed me the most was the lobby (recently updated, it appeared), and the breakfast area.  It was super clean, modernly appointed and decorated, and the food was actually pretty decent...they had the egg omelette thingys that were pretty good. Great coffee. The staff were very nice. This hotel was walking distance to several decent bars. Overall, not a bad place to stay.I have stayed at many 3 to 5 star hotels, most in California. This hotel took much pride in their customer service. My stay was exceptional and everything i needed to a microwave, at no charge, even to providing the dolly for my luggage was brought to my room. I even arrived at 11 o'clock in the morning and they provided me a room by 11:30 My stay was on February 20, 2016 .I did not get the name of the gentleman that answered the phone every time that afternoon and evening but hands-down he was the most pleasant and accommodating staff member I have ever spoke to on the phone. I was treated like royalty! I must've had one of the renovated rooms I was on the ninth floor and it was a very nice room for an extremely low price. Shuttle service to the airport was also provided which was FREE!Its like a mash-up of the St. Frances Motel in the movie Big where Tom Hanks cries himself to sleep and a real Holiday Inn Express. - Room's carpet and paint were still off-gassing, I kept my door open for a hour to reduce the smell- Halls and stairwell look like something from a procedural crime drama, scary- Thermostat in the room was 72 degrees or off.  Take it or leave it- Lobby and room had been recently remolded (++)It could get two more stars with a little more training and completing the renovation.  I will try it again in a few months.The hotel is in a great location with parking close by but the rooms are outdated. Some of the rooms are updated and nice, make sure to ask for the renovated rooms cause the old ones should be discounted.Something I just realized: I'm a lot like William H Macy in 'The Cooler.'We're both kinda ginger-y, we both show signs of premature aging, and everything we touch breaks or mysteriously reaches a state of disrepair. It's a gift really. I came here, checked in, took the elevator up to my room, tried to come back down and it was broken. I brought some leftover back to my room, wanted to put them in the mini fridge, it wasn't working. I start fudging with the mini fridge, trying to get it to work, then not only is it not working, but it also starts making an internal noise that sounds like there's a little man inside sandpapering the icebox. Le sigh. Or as some would say in El Paso, 'El sigh.' The hotel itself was fine, I think I just got a lemon... which is what usually happens to me. The staff were beyond friendly. Truly. Hats off and 5-stars to them. Richard, the shuttle driver, was just about the nicest man ever. He was exactly the kinda guy you want to pick you up from the airport when you've just spent the last 5 hours on 4 different flights and could use a little cheering up. When I arrived the woman at the front desk (who the sign told me was the general manager) was no different. Just as sweet as can be and she even let me check into my room 4 hours earlier than the regularly scheduled check-in time.  I loved that the hotel had a shuttle that'll take you to/from the airport or anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel. And I know normally when hotels say that the shuttle is almost always mysteriously unavailable when you want to use it, but that wasn't the case here. In fact, I saw my previously shuttle driver (Richard) in the lobby the second day of my stay and he practically chased me down to see if I needed a ride. I was actually kind of sad to say no and that my friend was actually waiting out front for me. The hotel is pretty run of the mill otherwise. They have a really small outdoor pool just off the lobby, though it was closed for winter during my stay. My room overlooked El Amigo Bail Bonds and I could see all the way over to the famous Juarez 'X'. They have a continental breakfast in the morning that I never woke up in time for, but on Thursday evening I got back to the hotel early in the evening and their was some sort of left over buffet set up in the lobby. Most everything had already been ransacked, but I did manage to gank a cookie... that was burnt but in the good way. I wasn't even hungry but I couldn't help but scarf it down. The have free wifi and the TV had basic channels, a few cable one likes MTV, VHI, and all the other ones that used to be educational but now only show ridiculous reality shows, and HBO. The little paper slip that had all the channels and numbers on it was pretty badly stained with something yellow. That was kinda gross, but of course I still picked it up and put it on my nightstand because my love for TV is stronger than my gross-stuff gag reflex. What I didn't enjoy was that the elevator (that broke basically as soon as I got there) wasn't able to be fixed during my entire stay. They still had one other elevator, but it was so slooow having to wait for every floor and everyone else staying at the hotel PLUS, all the construction guys were using it so you basically had to take the stairs unless you had an extra 10 minutes to wait, and wait, and wait. And what I REALLY didn't enjoy was being woken up every morning from the sounds of my room walls shaking and the sounds of drill and buzz saws and other noises that make it impossible to sleep, work, concentrate, etc. Not ideal. Also, the shower head and water pressure suuuucks but I'm also kind of a hotel water pressure snob so it might be fine for others. This isn't my first choice of place to stay when I come back to El Paso, but it's in a decent area, within walking distance from a few cool spots and ranks as a solid 'OK' in my book.We enjoyed this hotel tremendously. 1. The staff is extremely focused on Customer Service2. AWESOME pool (nice and warm3. INCREDIBLE free BreakfastIt would be 5 stars, except there were NO towels at the pool! What else is new? This is a typical problem at these hotels... NO FREAKING TOWELS AT THE POOL!!!!!There are old rooms and new rooms. make sure you get a new room. the showers are weird but other than that it's a nice hotel in a good location and the staff is very helpful when they want to help.I believe this was my first ever Holiday Inn Express experience, so maybe the rating is more out of uneducated expectations.  Let me give the positives first; free breakfast and wi-fi and girly bath and body works amenities.  The negative, I was scared out of my mind by a homeless man in the parking lot on the way in (not hotels fault) which gave me an unsafe feeling from the get-go.  The furniture in the room was beat up and the gym equipment barely functioning. The omelet that I got out of the breakfast buffet was frozen.  And lastly, it is across from a bail bond building.  I would give it 2 stars but felt the staff was too nice for that.Nice hotel clean comfortable. Good transportation to airport and convention center. Rooms nice clean, big TV, small pool but its downtown so its cozy. A little loud from the highway, but only outside at pool. Inside no nose from outside. Good nice access to and from all areas. Staff very pleasant, helpful, and asking how everything is for you very nice.The location is amazing and right off the highway. The building itself is much older. I'm glad they finally fixed the elevator, he had been broken for months. The breakfast bufffet is simple and tasty. I do like that they have soft/hard pillow options which I don't see anywhere else. I will stay again for convience off the highway and price.So you're heading to El Paso and most of your budget is for great Mexican food and tequila!  You're on the hunt for a budget hotel and this HI Express will meet your need very nicely.* Clean rooms and a solid housekeeping staff to keep them that way.* Speaking of staff; everyone here is super friendly.* Like every HIE, free breakfast.* Nice location. Downtown is two blocks away.* Free airport shuttle.* Lots of deals on the room rate with many folks getting way under $100 night.Save some $$ by staying here and you'll have enough to try that crazy Texas-sized one gallon margarita!I felt bad giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because really we had such a good time and the staff was so nice. THEN to top it off, i read that Anson mother-effer's review, and it's clear to me that he's a racist douchebag, so to make up for his bias, i am upping this to 5 stars. Don't listen to a guy who says condescending things about spanish speaking people.and anson, maybe if you hate trying to communicate with people who speak spanish, you should stay away from el paso. i'm sure they won't miss you.Breakfast was one of the best ""free"" continental we have EVER had. Great variety, fresh and always stocked full. Rooms were nice. Our room always felt a little damp and the even with the air the coldest it could go never got cold. Pool was closed so couldn't use it but was very small. The work out room isn't much of a workout room. Had 2 tredmills, 1 elliptical and 1 bike. The elliptical wasn't a very good one do be careful not to hurt yourself on it. One day around 6 they had chips/salsa/nacho cheese and cans of pop in the lobby for people to snack on. Not sure if they did this every day but it was nice of them. We were here for a bowling tournament at the convention center about 7 blocks away. Free shuttles were available from the hotel. The walk wasn't bad we usually did that. As soon as we got our luggage at the airport I called the hotel and with in 15 mins Cruze (the driver) picked us up. He was very nice and gave us some info and restaurants and things to do around town. I would stay at this hotel againHotel is fine, but we have a room on the 7th floor and the wi-fi signal is balls slow :(that being said, great continental breakfast.  They have a little shuttle outside that will take you anywhere within 2 miles of the hotel.  We went to a Mexican restaurant down the street.   The Holiday Inn  has some computers in the lobby that have full speed internet which is what I'm writing this review on.  Free newspapers and Repubican Fox news on blast in the lobby which makes for good jokes and commentary while you're eating breakfast.  Warp speed elevator gets you where you need to go promptly.  The premises is well maintained and clean.  Free coffee in the lobby.  Small work out facilities w/ treadmills and elliptical (no weights).   If they could fix the slow Wifi in the hotel rooms, this would be a perfect holiday inn express.  $50 a night.....  pretty good value.Becoming a fan of the Holiday Inn Expresses.  Maybe the Gypsyhawk tour hotel for 2013???Budget hotel done right. Comfy beds a la Westin's Heavenly collection and dogs welcomed. A hot continental breakfast will greet you in the morning and USA Today slides under your door for a homerun. Thanks Holiday Inn.Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. I would use the term shit-hole but need to maintain my credibility in this review.  I worked a substantial amount of time in the hotel industry. Over 10 years with Marriott. And for the longest time only stayed in Marriott owned properties. Over time others have tried to convince me that I should try other chains. Repeatedly I have been disappointed with anything bearing the name of Holiday Inn. Every time the property has been hanging by a thread between being approved by building inspectors and condemnation. This property must have paid off the aforementioned building inspector. You can tell the outside of this property and lobby have been remodeled but the budget ceased there. The rooms are still old with low ceilings, dingy carpet and walls, and everything feels slighty musty and sticky.But at least in the morning I was going to be able to have those delicious cinnamon rolls. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. In the morning there were no cinnamon rolls. None when I arrived and and the breakfast attendant informed me they were terminado and there would be no mas. This was an  hour before breakfast was over. I would have attempted to complain but my espanol is limited. This will be my final stay at any property owned and operated by Holiday Inn and I suggest you do the same.PS. I tried to come up with some whitty quip about ""dumber for staying at a holiday inn last night"" in mockery of their baseless commercials. Nothing clever came to mind, but you can eagerly anticipate an addition to this review when one does.Cheap hotel right downtown. It's nice that we could have walked anywhere. The front desk guy was nice. The beds were pretty comfortable and they even had cable on tv! They have a lot of free amenities like shaving creme and toothpaste, which I took advantage of since I didn't bring any. The next morning, we had breakfast in the lobby which was alright. Small hotel, small dining area. I did like that they have an automatic pancake maker! Made it real simple even though it took a while to make a pancake. They were really nice since they had someone serving everyone their eggs and sausages. They even had gravy! They had a pretty good selection.It sucked that I tried walking down the stairs to the lobby, but it only went to the second floor or outside to the swimming pool! I had to walk back up to the second floor just to take the elevator... wth? Our room did have a nice view of the freeway and the light up star. Awesome!The customer service at this hotel goes so far beyond what you would expect!  My husband &amp; I arrived in El Paso after a very long drive from CA only to find that our rental home wasn't ready. We were traveling w/our two dogs and had to find a hotel quickly. The hotel staff booked us in for the night very quickly and we had a very comfortable nights stay. That should have been the end of it, but the rental still wasn't ready the next day or the next after thst!  The staff was so accommodating  allowing us late ck outs everyday until we could find out if we could get into our home then extending our stay each night when we couldn't . They were real lifesavers!!! I say staff and I mean it everyone was just fantastic!!!Outdated - in need of refurbishing.  LOUD if your room is facing the highway - Terribly loud traffic noise.  Ask for the opposite side which faces the county courthouse and Amigo Bail Bonds.  The breakfast is OK, but the coffee is incredibly weak - like brown-tinted water.  One of the two elevators was out-of-service, had been that way for quite some time.","I am currently staying at this hotel and I have not come up with any concerns or complaints. Sure it's not the newest hotel in town, but they seem to take care of it well. The staff has been friendly, helpful, and courteous. As this is relatively close to where I'm working, I would not hesitate to stay here again. Also, the review by Claud Q is still accurate.This hotel rocks! I traveled to El Paso for a week on business and didnt really know what I would get at this HI (they are all kind of hit or miss) and here is why I really liked my stay:1. First of all, I found a great sale on Orbitz, under $100 a night2. FREE Everything: WiFi, Breakfast (limited selection but whatever), rooms come with a microwave and refrigerators (neat for a week-long traveler like me), VERY decent gym, a ""library"" you can just check out like dozens of cool books, and they have a little afternoon 'happy hour' where they offer chips and salsa and soft drinks. And my fave: you can do your own laundry there VS paying for expensive hotel valet laundry service that costs an arm and a leg. 3. The staff is Sooooo nice, they went above and beyond at all times and they are genuinely friendly and professional. 4. Free shuttle to/from the airport5. Located in the heart of Downtown and very close to the trendy areas near UTEP and Downtown. PS to the first reviewer, by the time I checked out this week they were installing brand new carpeting throughout the entire hotel.The exterior and lobby appear to make this look like a nice hotel. Don't be fooled; my room is very dirty, see posted photo. For 120 a night I would hope my toilet lid would hold it self up, the shower head would not have green mold on it, and the tub and sInk would  be clean.",,,,"['second', 'time', 'location', 'upgraded',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-el-paso-airport-el-paso,Homewood Suites El Paso Airport,3.5,$$,13,"Comfortable stay, clean rooms, complimentary breakfast, and right off the freeway. It's kinda nice staying at a place like this when you're a road warrior. It has some of the creature comforts of home - - a fridge, microwave, dishwasher, table, and microwave popcorn just waiting to be popped. Bed's pretty comfortable. One suggestion: when checking in, ask to stay on the side opposite the freeway, so you don't hear all the traffic. There's a TON of trucks and stuff on the 10.I have some mixed feelings about our stay here. I appreciate their military family rate as we are here to visit my husband activated to Fort Bliss. What I like about their suites was the option to get a suite with a bedroom door that closes and separates you from the pull out in the living area. This has allowed us to have some private time . The hot breakfast is pretty much what you would expect from a hotel, as well as the rooms. However the accommodations aren't what I would expect from a Hilton. Nothing special about the bed or bedding, not your typical Hilton quality. The wifi pretty much never works in our room. When I have called about it I just got a response that no one else has complained, it might be the wind, and they will try and reset the router. Been here a couple of days now and have yet to have an instance of it steadily working for more then 10min to a half hour without the service going in and out. The network won't even always show up and never has more then 2 bars of signal strength. Perhaps having wifi wouldn't be a big deal as I'm not here to work, but the tv channels are slim with little programming options appealing to my 3 year old. I will probably look into other options for our next visit but with the good rate and privacy may stay again.Ok place to stay, but its time for an update.  Furniture and finishes in the room were old, beat up and in need of replacement.Great hotel, rate was awesome, very clean, we loved the layout of the rooms, bed was comfy too! The only thing that I considered a drawback was trekking all over hotel for vending machines (they don't have them) so I trek all the way down to the front desk to buy some out of the little ""guest shop"" only to be told they are $2.50 a bottle. Why must these hotels try and make a killing off water??!! Breakfast wasn't that appealing either...they don't serve waffles anymore and I didn't see any fruit or yogurt.Stayed there two weeks in August and the service was ok.  The hotel was clean but when I got to my room there was hair on the bathroom door and in the tub.  Once that got cleaned up the stay was as expected.  The only real concern is that this is a pet friendly hotel (which I don't mind) but hearing a dog barking throughout the night as you're trying to sleep is a big setback, but not the hotel's fault.  The Breakfast was ok for a small hotel, not a lot of variety.I am not warning anyone away from this hotel, but if you are the type of person who reads yelp reviews before reserving a hotel, you will find some issues with El Paso Homewood Suites. The hotel is fairly worn - we had significant spots on the carpet, slight smudges on the wall, some mold in the bathroom, and the bathtub drained very slowly. But the room was clean and generally habitable. Also, I think the hotel should hire a few more staff. Everyone was professional and friendly. However, they seemed to be stretched.Great hotel, the staff is friendly and the rooms are clean.  There is free WiFi (slow)  fridge, stove, sink &amp; microwave.  If you want quiet don't get a room facing the interstate.I stayed at this hotel for one week for business. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The staff was very courteous and friendly to all guests. The rooms are excellent with a kitchen, full size refrigerator and dishwasher. There is no need for the kitchen because the hotel provides an adequate breakfast and dinner to all guests. They even provide wine during the dinner happy hour. Nice hotel with all necessary amenities within 1mile. If you have an extended stay in El Paso stay here.I stayed at this location since I was in El Paso for 5 weeks on a work assignment. I'm a fan of Hilton properties so I was glad this is where work chose to book me. I also appreciate the ridiculous amount of Hilton Honor's points I earned for my weeks here. The hotel staff was friendly. Room was comfortable. I really can't complain. While I hope I never have to spend so much time in El Paso again (sorry Texans), this place made the stay tolerable.Homewood without a Fitted Bottom Sheet?Shower was lethally slippery.IH-10 noise a constant.But it is after all, El Paso!I stayed when the hotel first opened and really like my stay (3 months). The food was good. Breakfast was the normal eggs and a meat. Dinner was something that was a meal (Meat, 2 sides, salad, bread, and drinks)(Even if I got in late I could call ahead and a plate would be in my room). Laundry right next to the gym so drop your things and get on the treadmill/bike.I stopped by on August 1, 2014 around 10pm at night, because we booked a reservation through the Hilton Honors Points customer service phone line.  We specifically told them that we need a hotel that accepts a small dog.  When I arrived to the Homewood Suite in El Paso, Texas, the front desk customer service agent was not helpful in regard to my small dog.  She wanted to charge us $75 for our dog, but we told her that the Hilton Honors Points customer service agent did not tell us their was a fee for our small dog to stay, and the Homewood Suites front desk customer service agent did not care that their partner company mislead us.  She said we still have to pay $75 if our dog stayed.  I told her that we didn't have the money in our budget for the $75, and our only option is to wake up early to get our dog from my car, before it gets hot.  I told her that I had a baby boy, and we are all tired so late at night from driving across country in Texas.  She did not care that I had a baby boy too at 10pm at night.  She was a ruthless uncaring front desk customer service agent!  We decided to stay somewhere else.I found the hotel adequate.  The rooms were too big in my opinion.  And the walk to the rooms seemed kind of long.  Lots of highway noise on the highway side.  The bed was too soft.  And the light switch fan thing was confusing.",,,,,"['comfortable', 'clean', 'rooms', 'complimentary', 'breakfast', 'right', 'freeway', 'kinda', 'nice', 'staying', 'place', 'like', 'road', 'warrior',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/guesthouse-international-suites-el-paso-el-paso,GuestHouse International Suites El Paso,3.0,$$,10,"The Ritz it ain't. So if you're looking for some fancy hotel, this is not the place for you. However, if you're looking for a very reasonably priced, simple, clean, friendly, and did I mention-- cheap-- place, then this is it!My family of four stayed here thanksgiving week to visit with my son who's stationed at Fort Bliss. We arrived earlier than the check in time, but Hazel was very accommodating. She said our room would be ready in 10 minutes, and invited us to enjoy some beverages while we waited. She was vey friendly and professional. We stayed in a two room King suite. The room was modest, but clean and spacious. The room had a separate sitting area with a couch and small dining table. It also had a small refrigerator, microwave and coffee pot. The bathroom was very large, and the shower was a full-spray (no water saving here!).  Yes, the toilet did plug up. Housekeeping was very quick to bring us a plunger, and we kept it on hand, just in case. ;)The continental breakfast wasn't the best I've had, but there were quite a few options to choose from.  The hotel also boasts a pool, fitness center and computers for public use. The staff was very friendly throughout our stay. They made us feel right at home. We will definitely stay here again. :)I can't figure out how to delete this. So I will correct my self. I'm at the other locations in the west of El Paso.Stayed here a couple days for a wedding. Clean, large rooms. Shared a king bed and slept great! Breakfast is good. Our party took over the breakfast room each am and stated past breakfast closing time. And staff was super friendly and even left the food and drinks out for an extra hour.Only downside is occasional noise from nearby airport.Would recommend staying hereWe have checked into this hotel a little over 3 times.Love the hotel,the breakfast and the gym in the lobby area.Definitely worth the price and the stay.I have to travel with work so I stay at a lot of motels. This room is the nicest I have stayed in without spending twice the price. After reading the reviews I have to wonder is this the same place. I stayed 5 nights and had a great stay. The only thing I did not like was the eggs in the hot breakfast, but they had plenty of other items to start off my days. My room layout: full bath and sink in bathroom, 12' x 12' living area with couch and bar separating the bed with a frig, microwave, coffee pot, and sink. My room had the king sized bed. Internet was both wired and wireless. If you are looking for a place to stay in El Paso then I recommend the GuestHouse Suites. You won't be sorry.I reserved my room through Orbitz and arrived a day early without any issues.Absolutely amazing! When we arrived in El Paso February 2013 we were so amazed at the service, complimentary breakfast, and I am not talking about fruits and bagels, I am talking about waffles, bacon, eggs! And they even have like a happy hour at 5PM where they serve popcorn, wine, sodas, nachos, it is the all time favorite. The staff is WONDERFUL!! Quick and speedy service.Which brings me to my family leaving El Paso, we are back here again, and we are in a different room, and despite that our room doesn't have the flat screen TV or remote control, we are so grateful for the continuing service that GuestHouse Suites has provided for us. We now have a son and he sleeps in the pullout couch with all the room he wants. It is just sooooooo great to be leaving El Paso at the BEST hotel in town!! Great job!Uh... This place sucks 2 mins ago I was just plunging my own toilet in my hotel room. Everything is very old decor. I actually use to like this place up until the moment I asked to switch rooms because my toilet was clogged. The lady working the font desk just brought me a plunger... Sweet...Aside from their random TV placement (directly facing the pony wall that separates the ""bedroom"" from the ""living room""), I'm a big fan of this hotel. Airport hotels are generally lacking all things comfortable, but not this one. The beds are comfy, the AC blows COLD, there are 2 outlets AND light switches by BOTH bedsides (cha-ching!), fast free wifi, and has the kind of continental breakfast Europe wouldn't be embarrassed to have named after them (we're talking hash browns and real -not instant- eggs). All rooms have a wet bar with fridge, microwave and coffee maker and a pull out couch. Party time! ...?Note for the light sleepers: not only is this hotel inside the airport boundaries, it also has train tracks running through the front lawn. While I've never been awoken from the local transportation, I've also slept through several earthquakes so I'd suggest you pack your earplugs!The bed is horrible, you would be about as comfortable on the floor. The bedding is awful, as are the pillows.  The Internet service is sporadic at best and often didn't work at all.  The only response we got from the manager was  that she had never heard those complaints before. (right ;-/).   We did finally get a $50 dollar refund on our $550 bill.  The only good things I can say for the place is that it was clean and the continental breakfast was adequate.  We moved on to the Radisson for the rest of our stay in El Paso.Do not stay here.  The walls are paper thin and you can hear the conversation of the next room.  In my case the people next door were drunk and I believe they were participating in the services of a lady of the night.  THEIR was awoken at 1 am in the morning by loud and raunchy conversation.  I'll spare you the details.  Lets just say it was so weird and scary that I requested that I be moved to another room.  I won't stay here again",,,,,"['looking', 'fancy', 'hotel', 'place', 'however', 'looking', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'simple', 'clean', 'friendly', 'mention', 'cheap', 'place', 'family', 'four',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-roof-inns-el-paso,Red Roof Inns,3.0,$$,10,"We checked in at O'dark 30 after traveling all day. Maria was so very nice! Its not the Ritz, but our room was clean, smelled nice and was warm. What made this a 5 star review?  Maria and her customer service. PS: they give a Military discount.This place does not even rate a start.. My room was not made up.. They tout renovated rooms but the hotel is run down and the room are bare bones with old beds.. My bathroom light was cracked with a big hole in the cover and the ceiling stucco was falling down with holes in the ceiling.. I would not recommend this place to anyone.No microwave or fridge,  no coffee pot, wifi and cable sux, i wont stay again... room was clean though  lolI read the reviews so I have to say they redid  the place very updated modern look. Smoke free hotel now. At least a 2 1/2 star hotel. They have  flatscreen TVs in every room now. But some rooms don't have microwaves or refrigerators like mines but it has a nice pool. Staff was friendly and help me out when one of my sinks did not drain. They try fixing it but traded me rooms. So over all I liked it. Oh yea it's a Pet friendly hotel so it bump my rating up. I love my dog!I rarely stay at Red Roof Inns, but I was told by a friend that they don't charge an additional pet fee like most places, so I decided to try it out. Upon arriving, I asked the (not very friendly) clerk if any of the outside rooms were available, he said that he ""didn't know"" and that he would have to check if any were ready. At this time most people get on a phone or walkie-talkie to contact the housekeeping staff and inquire about the rooms. Instead, he told me to ""come back in a half of hour,"" so that he can check. Really??? I was too tired and travel weary to go seeking another pet friendly hotel and I liked the location of this one so I chose to wait. I just walked my dog around the parking lot. When I went back in he said that he had a room ready, but neglected to say that there was no fridge or microwave in the room, items that come standard in most hotels. When I went to the front desk to ask, he told me ""the king size rooms have them, but not the singles."" Since I planned to stay only one night I didn't see it as a big deal, but it would have been nice to know. Another thing he forgot to mention was that there was no wifi. When I learned this, I went to ask the front desk and encountered another clerk, ruder then the first, and he told me that ""the wifi has been down for several days."" I asked for the location of their laundry facility and he told me they did not have one. I told him it would be nice if the check-in clerk would have mentioned these things and he just shrugged his shoulders and went about his business as if I wasn't there. The next morning realizing I needed to stay in town one more day and not wanting to load my car just to unload it at another hotel, I chose to stay in the room I had. When I went to the front desk to extend there was a female there, I asked her about the Internet and she said ""that side of the building doesn't have any."" A different answer from the night clerk and just as ridiculous. I asked how could one side of the hotel not have Internet and she said that ""they have tried but haven't been able to get a signal on that side."" What??? What kind of archaic Internet are they using? All they need is a router extender or an additional router placed in that area so guests can pick up the signal. It's not complicated. While I was talking to her the television on the wall was playing promotional adverts for Red Roof Inn and one of the promises for guests was ""wifi in every room,"" well, that's false advertisement. I told her they should change that and she mentioned that another guest said the same thing.As for the room, very basic, and very much in need of an upgrade.  The furnishings were old, stained, and in some cases ruined. The tub &amp; sink was cracked and stained. The small round table in the room and two chairs were old, dirty, and scratched. The dresser was ruined on the bottom and the rug looked like it hadn't been vacuumed. Speaking of, there was hair, not mine, on the bathroom sink and toilet. The towels could use replacing, they were old and dingy. The shower head was covered in mildew, the vent in dust. On the dresser there was a room service menu that when I picked it up I regretted it instantly because there was a black, sticky substance on it. The room made me glad I travel with my own towels and blankets. I did like that the beverage vending machine in the lobby had a debit/credit card option for those who don't have change or cash on them. Though, when I went to get a water, there was another clerk on night shift duty (second night) and when I entered the lobby he had his head down so I walked up to the desk and said hello and he glanced up said a monotone hello and put his head back down. So rude! For all he knew I was a newly arriving guest coming to check in and he didn't bother to ask me if I needed help, he pretty much ignored me. I don't know what the hiring process is for this hotel, but evidently the ruder you are, the more desirable you are. Personally I think if you're not a 'people person' you shouldn't work in the hospitality industry. Overall, if you're not picky and just want an inexpensive room to shower in and sleep for a night or two, then this isn't horrible. After all, it is close to many things, such as the highway, stores, restaurants, and the New Mexican border with a beautiful view outside, and best part, no pet fee.  If you want somewhere nicer and more updated with a friendlier staff this is not the place for you. I know I will not recommend this place, and if this is an example of all Red Roof Inns, I won't be staying at any ever againI always choose this hotel when I come through El Paso. It's priced right and the rooms are just fine for a night. I like to walk over to the Mexican restaurant or Cracker Barrel.Better than expected. Cute room and pool.Don,t believe the yelp's on here this place sucks, noise, freeway,T V , bed ,room this place needs to be remove as a hotel I CANT SAY ANYTHING EXCEPT   RUN FOREST RUN  AND DON'T STOPThis place was really a dud. Well for $60, on the side of the freeway, what should you expect? Microwave buzzed all night, room was very loud with freeway noise, and toilet ran. TV was 20 years old and room looked to be 30 years old - at least. Best part was that you could book last second.If you're looking for a 4-star (in hotelese) hotel, this is not it.  This hotel is clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful.  Vickie was the desk clerk when we checked in and she went out of her way to get us extra bedding so that we (2 adults &amp; 4 children) could stay in the same room.  Getting 1 room for our family has been an issue at many other hotels.  Also convenient that it's right across the street from Walmart.",,,,,"['checked', 'dark', 'traveling', 'day', 'maria', 'nice', 'room', 'clean', 'smelled', 'nice', 'warm', 'made', 'star', 'review',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/comfort-suites-el-paso-2,Comfort Suites,4.5,$$,10,"I loved staying here! I like how they are so clean and the beds were so comfortable! It was the best hotel ive stayed in. The breakfast is free &amp; great as well compared to other hotels that have breakfast. I would definately recommend anyone to stay here. Had no problems at all. :)Very nice &amp; cozy!  Friendly front desk staff. I stayed here for one night while on a business trip. This hotel is conveniently located right off I-10, with direct access to shopping, gas, site-seeing and restaurants. I was very happy with the location &amp; overall feel of the hotel. My stay was very pleasant &amp; the room was very clean. I like that there was a fridge &amp; microwave in the room and that there was an indoor pool &amp; jacuzzi. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the bathroom. It's a little outdated and the way the door open is a little awkward.  It is right in your face if you're sitting on the toilet &amp; you can't push it back, as there is a stopper there to prevent it from hitting the tub. Also, the lighting in the room is extremely dim, which was a bummer for me as a female trying to apply makeup. Overall, very nice hotel. I would stay there again but they need better lighting.This place gets a solid 4 star rating. It's one of the nicer Choice Hotels offerings not too far away from UTEP. It's really not that far away from a 5 star but the little things wrong do add up. On the plus side there is good water pressure, working ice machines and the rooms aren't old and stinky. The mattresses are so-so but the suite I had was spacious. The WIFI however was pretty crappy and as a business traveler that is important. Plenty of good channels on the TV and being right off Mesa there are plenty of decent places to eat nearby. The people working there were very nice and there was no hassle when I had to extend my visit by a day. Parking can be a hassle. The floors and ceilings tho are as thin as can be. I haven't been to many hotels where the rooms directly above can make so much noise. Be prepared to hear your upstairs neighbor loud and clear at whatever hours they keep.Very clean. Staff is friendly, helpful. Only one negative: Wi-Fi is spotty at best but that's normal for most hotels. Good enough for basic web browsing, but that's about it.Clean and comfortable.  My so and I are driving back to college.  After a 10 hour day of driving it was a relief to find such an affordable, clean place to stay!This was a very nice hotel - probably one of the nicest I had been in awhile. The staff was very accommodating and helped resolved a billing issue very quickly. Well worth the money and we would definitely stay here again.I originally had booked a different place to stay but when I saw the reviews for the Comfort Suites on YELP I cancelled where I was booked and decided to here.  It was the right choice.  This hotel is clean and the people are courteous.  Breakfast was had some nice additions like hard boiled eggs, already peeled!  :-)We usually try and stay at Embassy Suites and I think we will change and start to stay with Comfort Suites more.  We are a large family and it accommodates us fine.  AND the high speed internet is included, which is not at Embassy.Keeping in mind that this is the Choice Hotel chain and not an upper level, high end resort chain, this hotel deserves 5 stars. My family and I have done extensive cross-country USA travel the past few months and  compared to other properties in the chain, this hotel is at the top! The rooms were very clean and adequately spacious. The staff was helpful and efficient. The hotel furnishings, decor and hallways were nicely updated. The rooms were quiet, Several things stood out above other hotels though: Multiple pillows were on the bed and were identified as firm or soft!Four complete sets of towels were available in the room at check in! Not the usual 2. The bed linens were of good quality and made the bed feel almost luxury level on the pillow top mattress.The breakfast room was spacious and had many seats and tables. Breakfast included the usual fare plus more. Cooked eggs, not just hard boiled, whip cream and strawberries for the waffles. Fresh grapefruit halves!The lovely indoor pool included a jacuzzi which is unusual. The fitness room was small but had plenty equipment. The lobby was well appointed. Plenty of free parking.This place was clean, clean , clean!There were a few negatives: mattress was a little lumpy on one side, the pool had no emergency phone, the pool was too hot as though it was spa temperature. I highly recommend this hotel for any traveler. For only $10 more than our preceding night, our stay was 100% improved! And that was a comparison to another hotel in the same Choice Hotel Chain!When back in El Paso we will choose this hotel again!This is one of the nicer roo.s I've had including at Springhill and the Fairfield hotels.  I have to say it is also quieter that both forementioned hotels and very clean.One of the absolutely nicest hotels I've stayed at especially for the price I stayed in room 302 and everything was excellent including the free breakfast. The price of the room was $116 for a double queen after the taxes. The room was very clean and spacious. Most definitely would stay there again.",,,,,"['loved', 'staying', 'like', 'clean', 'beds', 'comfortable', 'best', 'hotel', 'breakfast', 'free', 'amp', 'great', 'well', 'compared', 'hotels',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/days-inn-el-paso-airport-east-el-paso,Days Inn El Paso Airport East,3.0,$,13,"Stayed here on business for a few days.  For the price I was not expecting much however what I ended up with was a 5 Star experience.  Mr. Pedro Garcia &amp; the entire front desk staff were so amazing &amp; hospitable.  They would go above &amp; beyond their duties to accommodate me &amp; make my stay enjoyable.., &amp; always with a happy &amp; pleasant attitude. Breakfast was v good &amp; Housekeeping does a excellent job as my room was spotless everyday.   VG location w easy access getting onto I-10 .  A big plus for me was that this place is literally surrounded by a number of good restaurants all within a 5 minute walk which allowed me to have some wine w dinner &amp; not be concerned about driving.  Also there's a Super Walmart behind &amp; to the side of this hotel which I used twice during my stay.  Having stayed at many Hotels in El Paso over the years, I would have to say that this place is one of the best deals in town.  I'll be coming back.  Thank you to the staff!!!I wish I could give 0 stars bc this is disgusting. I'm aware it's low on the totem pole for hotels but still? For $75 for 1 night I expect cleanliness at minimum. The pics I posted say it all.Overall, not bad. My buddy and I were looking for a decent, cheap place to stay while looking for houses and this place fit the description. The rooms are clean and the beds and pillows were more comfortable than I was expecting. Recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap place to stay.Stayed here before and it was ok, this time around it seems that quality is slipping. Room has no fridge or microwave, apperantly this is a specialty  item, and the manager will not allow a staff member to get one from an empty room. This is our second room and don't  want to move again.Nothing too fancy about this Days Inn, but the prices are pretty decent. The beds are clean. The room smelled of too much carpet cleaner, but otherwise it was okay. They did have a microwave and a refrigerator in the room (wow you usually have to pay extra for that in your room)! Good news is that it's pet friendly, even though we don't have pets. Laundry available. They have a free breakfast and it's not just a continental type either. They had scrambled eggs, sausage bits, gravy, biscuits, toast, cold cereal, milk, and juices, but they should also have water available too. Free wi-fi, cable tv (didn't watch any), just a place to lay our  heads for my Dad and I's trip from Houston back to San Diego. Good halfway point to our trip home. Easy freeway access. Located near the East end of El Paso off Interstate 10 Freeway. The place has three floors so if you're handicapped, make sure that you state that before booking a room as the only elevator they have is located near the front center of the building. So if you have a room in the back and you can't walk up a few stairs, then you need to make sure you make arrangements.My true test of if I like a place is would I stay there again? My answer is yes! That's my test for places to eat too. Would I eat there again?The price was right.  We really just needed a place to crash while in El Paso for a funeral, and we weren't expecting luxury accommodations. Rooms are reasonable with a standard TV, fridge, microwave.  Our remote didn't work properly, and neither did the buttons on the TV, but I figured a way around it.  The vanity light over the sink was glitchy.  Beds were fine.  Shower had good water pressure.  Staff was nice.  We arrived on a Thursday, and the place was a ghost town, but Friday night the place was hopping and they sold completely out and put up the ""no vacancy"" sign.Yuck. Dirty bathmat that had dirt marks and a hair on it and small, very thin bath towels that were also dirty. Hotel is old and needs remodeling. The only saving grace is the warm breakfast and the fact that the beds were clean. If all you need is a bed, a lock and some breakfast then this is your place. Don't expect much else.I wasn't expecting much, but needed a cheap place to stay the night during a cross country trip from California to Alabama. I called ahead with a reservation and paid in full (non-refundable). When I arrived, I informed the front desk woman (Ira) that I had a reservation. She looked in her antiquated computer system and simply said ""no you don't"". She then told me in the snippiest way possible ""YOU need to call the reservation company and work this out"". I called, and the reservation company apologized and put me on hold to call the front desk. I could hear the whole conversation. Ira was rude and unhelpful to this woman also. Finally when they were able to fax over confirmation that I had in fact reserved the room and paid in full, Ira showed her superior customer service and let me know that the room I reserved was not available and in fact, no smoking rooms were available. She also appeared to take pleasure in letting me know that the room was not refundable. It wasn't until my husband came in demanding a refund that an off duty hotel worker came in to the rescue and gave us a room that was non-smoking but was already smoked in. He promised we could use it as a smoking room and informed us that this booking issue has been happening frequently.After a 14 hour drive, the last thing I want is a rude, ignorant woman talking down to me and taking my hard earned money without giving what I paid for. When I complained the next morning, the GM called and said I should check in next time I am in El Paso and he would ""make it right"". That was a nice gesture, but I wouldn't deal with that woman even for a free room.The room itself is what you would expect for a $52 room. Old, worn down, but clean. No roaches or horrible stains. Just shabby motel room, which I have no problem with. I just hate dealing with rude, lazy, people!We had been staying in Days Inn whilst traveling across the country and they were ALL terrible, terrible places to be. I had prepaid this Days Inn (otherwise, I would've looked for a hotel elsewhere). However, this Days Inn was refreshing in being what you would expect from a cheap motel.It wasn't amazing, but it was clean, safe, secure. It was within walking distance of a Walmart, and some delicious food (including an amazing Texas Roadhouse).Bottom line: I would stay here again if I were passing through El Paso. Good location, comfortable beds, and pet friendly.For a quick stop for a nice cat nap, this is an okay place :] I'd first like to stress how absolutely kind the lobby receptionists are. Jonathan, who I believe is the manager, and Delilah were very kind and helpful :] Their amazing customer service is definitely 5 stars. The cleanliness of the hotel is 4 stars. The only problem was the old cigarette smell. Not too huge a deal for me. The comfort of the hotel.. 3 stars. You pay what you get for though, ya know? So I'm pleased with it altogether :] A few extra goodies:* PET FRIENDLY :D !! I have my little girl with me, and love that I don't have to sneak her in like I usually do :ahem: she's spread eagle on the bed right now :D* Complimentary Continental breakfast 6-10am* Free wifi* Ton of cable channels with good reception.* Right off of I-10 :] * laundry roomsThere is a pool and an elevator. Only one elevator, so that's kind of a bummer. Ps.... Majority of the people around this area.. Not the people I typically surround myself with.I stayed here 1 Saturday night in nov 2013 . after nogationing with the man behind the desk I got him to lower the price to $ 58.70 including tax. I didn't  like the hotel at all. loud noise from the I 10 and the elevator. the first room the air condintioner didn't work . he said the plug might be out . I said I checked the plug . so he finally gave me a new room facing the I 10 . the second room the door wouldn't open . he said the door handles were installed upside down so I have to push the door handle up. I should of remembered my 3 stooges movies when curly said you have to use stratatoogie. . dirty room . you need the coupon they give you at check in to eat breakfast or the breakfast Nazi will grab you  by the neck and throw you out the restaurant and into the street  you free loading bums. the nerve of me to think I could just waltz in and eat my free breakfast without going through check point Charlie.After traveling across the country and staying at multiple Days Inn, I was expecting pure failure.The room was clean, although smelled of dust...Overall, nothing was stolen and we slept well after a long day on the road.The staff was great, there was free wifi, and pets are not a problem at all.If you're traveling and need to stay off the highway, I wouldn't look any further.I would like to give 3.5 stars. However, since I can't I will be generous.The nice thing about this hotel is it is right off the freeway and a parallel street with a lot of restaurants on it. Unfortunately, this means you can hear the freeway and street from the room.The structure is 3 stories and has an elevator. The halls that face out to the parking lot can be very slick when wet or icy so be careful. The room was good-sized but not fancy. Inside there was a mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker in the room. The internet was pretty quick and no-hassle. They have a continental breakfast that is pretty good but not remarkable.",,,,,"['business', 'days', 'price', 'expecting', 'much', 'however', 'ended', 'star', 'experience', 'amp', 'entire', 'front',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/wyndham-el-paso-airport-el-paso-2,Wyndham El Paso Airport,2.5,$$,30,"Very spacious rooms, clean, all the amenities you need, and you can walk to it from your flight. Staff very courteous eager to please. Gym better than most, and plenty of sidewalk if you wants to run outdoors. The swimming area well that's could use some TLC but not much will get it there.After a while my anger has subsided a bit.I feel like no one will take a long review serious.So I've cut it down. I wish there were negative star options but one will have to do.This hotel provided me the WORST experience I have ever had and that's all that needs to be known.Stay here at your own risk, just know that you don't matter to their staff. They are a poor excuse of a company and I am surprised they've gotten this far.This was the worst hotel!!!! Ever!!! Horrible staff Very dirty we ended up just leaving an hour after are stay I had to just file a claim with my bank, because they refused to refund me after we had seen roaches and bed bugs save your time money! And a headache and drive down the street! Yuck yuckJust passing through El Paso and had a great experience at this Hotel. We had been driving for 10 hours straight and this was the only hotel that had a hot tub. The rooms were very nice and spacious and the hotel staff was extremely accommodating. If I am ever in El Paso again I wouldn't pick anywhere else to stay!Would be five stars with new carpet and new upholstery furniture.  The restaurant and breakfast included in my package were above average.  I was here has a business traveler, there are lots of other amenities, like a water park, that I did not experience.Gym equipment is broken. Rooms smell musty and old. Find another hotel. Hotel isn't kept up well and everything seems to be on the verge of breaking. Elevators don't work with key access. Internet continually goes out.Stayed at the Wyndham Airport recently. It was a very average hotel. Comparable to most others I have stayed at in El Paso. The location was good for me. It is right next to the airport and close to Fort Bliss. Had a couple issues with the air conditioning in our room. Maintenance looked at it and it didn't cool off so they moved us to a different room. They were very nice and apologized for the inconvenience. Both of the front desk employees I worked with were great. The pool was decent. Bigger than all the others that I have been to in El Paso. The breakfast was also decent. All in all it was an average experience. Nothing about the hotel will wow you but it is solid for the price.Our next time through El Paso we will surely stay somewhere else. This hotel is dated, worn and filthy.  The front desk staff was lovely and very accommodating when moving us out of our first room which smelled so strongly of cigarettes it made our eyes burn. And the maintenance staff came quickly to our second room to resolve an issue with the lamps not working, so kudos to the staff. Sadly their efforts could not erase the holes in the ceiling, stains on the bedspread, mold in the shower, filthy carpet and worn out furniture.Our overall stay was horrible. The carpets are incredibly dirty, and the furniture is dated. Kimberly at the front desk was really rude and not helpful to any of our needs. The pool was nice but there were a ton of people, leaving trash and towels everywhere. We will definitely not be staying there again. Ever!Stayed here for a conference. Granted the temperature this week was between 108 and 105, but when we walking into our room around 5pm the room was at 77 and the temp was set to 53. There were also 2-3 very large stains on the carpet that were not very nice to look at and made us question the cleanliness of the room. I assumed the air conditioner was just frozen so I turned it off for 15mins then set it back to 68 to cool the room off. I called the front desk before we left to eat, asking about the air conditioner and they said they would have maintenance look at it.  My family (wife and 3yr old) and I got back to the room 3 hrs later after dinner and a meeting and the room was still around 77, with a note saying it was working fine and they changed the filter. I called down to the front desk and the guy said it was a swamp cooler and it was just doing the best it could with 108 temps. I was not expecting swamp coolers in this quality of a hotel, but I know they have refrigerated air in the main lobby! Swap coolers? Really?I asked for another room and of course they were completely booked. I then asked for a fan to be sent to the room because the room was hot for me(much less my 3yr old daughter and wife). They said they would send one up. The fan never arrived that evening and it took until 3am before the room reached 73 enough for me to actually fall asleep after taking a cold shower to attempt to be remotely comfortable. (Btw: only like warm water, not really cold). I finally went down and picked up the fan myself for our second night and still no offer for a new room. I visited a few other rooms from friends and colleagues attending the same conference, and they had no problems with temps in their rooms and their rooms were actually much nicer with larger rooms and much newer furniture. I felt like a was being treated as a lower class and the hotel had much differing room qualities that you will probably never know about. I'm not sure how to ask for a room with newer furniture and much more room and larger bathroom, but both of these rooms were the same cost and both a single king bed.I will not return and  will ask for some kind of refund. It is obviously close to the airport and the food was not horrible (over priced, but typical of a hotel, but a hotel with this companies name, I've come to expect better quality.I am back, my work choses our hotels. I am staying in quite possibly the dirtiest hotel in our system. The pillows are so old and smelly I couldn't sleep on one. The bedding is so smelly and old I had to pull it off. The smell in the room was so bad I sprayed air freshener. I went to my co workers rooms to see if they were all like this....they are.  I had a non working coffee pot. I called down foe a working coffee pot, they brought one in a plastic bag and said it was new, it had old dust and dirt all over it. I had to go brew in another room. I called down and let the front know about everything and was told they would ""log"" this in. This hotel is going to require a complete overhaul and redecorating. New bedding are necessary and any management in charge of this hotel can see that. I am sitting up in a chair praying I leave soon. I hope I never come back here.Nice lobby and hallways. Ordered a pizza with anchovies. Out of anchovies. How hard is it to pick up a tin of anchovies at the store? Really? I also asked the bartender if the pizza dough was fresh. ""Oh, ya it sure is! We even have a pizza oven in back""  Pizza comes out. Frozen pre packaged dough. It was like pizza toppings on a giant cracker. Ugh. Rooms are ok.  . Bar..outdated and sunken below ground level. Decorated in Miami Vice tv show style. Framed beer posters on wall. nice touch.Photos to follow.-Coffee pot in room inoperable. -Shower doesn't drain (2 work orders submitted-claimed to be fixed, still floods)-Cable port dangling from wall-Door frame to bathroom not connected to wall and missing large pieces-The waterpark as advertised was inoperable and the slide had no water flowing through it.-ATM in the lobby was double charging cards-Strongest Wi-Fi connection was 2 bars and at dial up speed-This Wyndham does not live up to the name brand associated with it.Not very impressed with the hotel for the price I paid. It's look outdated with a few updates done. The lobby was nice, however the rooms need some more work. Wasn't able to try out the water park slide, but it did look fun. I didn't like that the plazas were all separate and not connected. Overall, it was fair.Had a great stay at the Wyndham El Paso.  It's A-OK in my book and I'd stay there again.  Not wanting to rewrite the numerous previous comments I will attest that the service was in fact great, location to the airport...none better, good happy hour running to 8pm with complimentary food, and slept like a rock in a comfy bed.Also, The exercise room is located in the pool area.  The running and elliptical machines worked great, they had dumbells and one bench (functional but in need for recovering) with fresh towels provided and nice big TV going to keep you entertained in case you forgot your ipod.They have three internet desktops for guests close to the front desk, but if you'd prefer to lounge in the lobby area they also equip a few of the coffee tables with Samsung tablets.Room had a good fridge, microwave, and coffee maker, but in the morning I found it easier and tastier to just walk to the lobby and grab of complimentary cup of Starbucks coffee in a provided ""to go"" cup. Breakfast buffet was good.  Depending on the room price you negotiate your room may come with breakfast coupons.  ...but here's a tip: if you pay for the buffet request and they'll make you an omelet to your liking.  If you have the breakfast coupon you're going to be eating the scrambled eggs with the rest of us....and for business or web surfing I almost forgot: in your room get ready to kick back in a bona fide HermanMiller Aeron chair.  Who'd a thunk?Yvette at front desk is extremely unfriendly &amp; unprofessional. No regard for previously confirmed rooms.Friendly staff, but it's so inconvenience to go anyway if you don't driveThe staff is soo friendly. Especially Karen Polanco, Sales &amp; Marketing Manager, who helped me with all my questions and needs.Was in El Paso for business and the Wyndham is one of the newer/nicer properties around.Literally about a football field away from the airport, you can easily walk over.Setting is nice, staff is friendly, property is really cool, with pool and water slide in the middle, giving it more of a resort vibe with the layout and courtyard in the middle, with lounge chairs and fire pits all around.Rooms are decent but aren't as modern as you'd expect from a new resort, rates are fine.Bar and restaurant is pretty cool, too.I like that it is close to the airport, but that is also a detriment as you can and will hear airplanes at all hours.  Here are the fails:roaches in the room, not the tiny ones, but the industrial sized ones.rooms are old and in dire need of a face lift.  lots of dust flying aroundleaky toilet that didn't flush oftenPros:bar with fantastic pricesstaff is attentive and works to resolve issues (my first room did not have a working AC, but I was transferred to a new room immediately)I probably won't return, but it is a live and learn world...","Writing this from my hotel bed at 6 in the morning. I work afternoons and am in town on business. Why am I up at 6:00am you ask? Because I just felt something crawling up my arm in bed. Flung it off, turned the light on my phone on, and saw an inch long cock roach on the floor. Second one I've seen in less than 2 days here.Yes, it is right here at the airport, but I'd suggest a hotel with better reviews over convenience. The need a pest control service for sure.great location - literally in walking distance to the airport so no waiting on a shuttle to come get you. slept very well - bed/ pillows are super comfy. breakfast buffet is reasonably priced &amp; offers a wide variety of good food. staff is friendly. hotel shuttle will take you to the mall nearby.The advantage is that you can walk right from the ELP airport right to the hotel.  I like the outdoor space around the pool.  The staff are friendly and helpful.The rooms are spacious, but look tired and in need of a face lift.  What bothers me is that other than needing a face lift, is that not all of the guest room building are secure from outside access.  Outside doors do not require a keyed entry, which means anyone passing by can gain entrance.They should call this hotel Wyndham on the tarmac! It is so close, you could walk there from the airport if you wanted to! The hotel itself is pretty nice with large rooms with nice amenities such as a flat screen TV, a microwave, and a small fridge. The facilities are also very nice. In particular, the hot tub is amazing. It is large, very deep for a hot tub, and very powerful. By far, my favorite part of the stay! For the kids, they also have several water slides, The fitness room is more elaborate then some with both elliptical, free weights, and several other strength machines. They also have a nice outdoor area which includes a fire pit. Overall, nice place, not outstanding, but still above averageGreat place to stay.  Fantastic for business stays...literally a stones throw from the small El Paso terminal...One of the best prices in town too...booked through orbitz for under $100 / night.  Might find it cheaper on priceline.Nice, friendly staff...ready to go above and beyond at every request.  They upgraded me to a suite so I might be a little bias in my review.I stay in a lot of hotels during my travels so this place is surely a gem.This was the WORSE experience of any hotel I have ever had.  Please don't waist your time and money. They were ALL every rude and seemed to be put-out by having to work. I had a knee and back injury and asked for a ground floor, close to the pool, over a week in advance and called 2 times to confirm, when I got there, they put me in the worse room for my needs. I met my 3 grandchildren there, they lost their wristbands to swim on the first day, I went to the front desk to ask for new ones for the 2nd day. I was told my grandkids could not swim any longer in the pool...(???) I told them my suite # and explained the kids had thrown away the old wristbands when they took baths that night. I was told ""TO BAD, NO WRISTBANDS, NO POOL...PERIOD"".  I told them I had paid $285 for 2 nights there, and my grandkids had a right to swim in their swimming pool.  I had to get the hotel manager involved and FINALLY got them into the pool. And this was also the very smallest suite I have ever seen, we could hardly turn around.  I have had better rooms and have been treated better at Motel 6.We stayed here for the water slide - not working. Unhappy kids, unhappy parents as a result. Our nights stay included free breakfast - but nothing is offered you have to ask..so overall I'd just say not upfront with values, and we stayed here for the pool and 4 story water slide which doesn't even work. Fitness center also not available and not working.Gross. The rooms felt dirty and more like glorified college dorms than hotel rooms. Yeah, it's right by the airport. You can easily walk to the check-in desk from baggae claim. Is this a good thing? Overhead plane noise...lots of traffic...questionable travelers looking for convience over quality. I guess there's a bar onsite and a pool. After checking into our rooms and calling the front desk for the refrigerators they promised us, we decided just to leave. The couple on the other side of the paper mache thin wall screaming at each other convinced us to get rooms at the nearby Hyatt, which actually turned out to be cheaper and WAY more comfortable.Great for business travel. Right next to the airport. I actually walked to and from the airport. Very clean and affordable.This hotel is VERY CONVIENENT (spelling?).  After I had a delayed flight from Chicago coming in at 11 pm, we literally walked across the street and there was the Wyndham.  I had signed up for the loyalty program before my trip, so I gave them my number.  When I entered my very spacious room, I had a plate of fruit, a 1/2 bottle of wine, and bottle of fancy water waiting for me.  The room itself had a living room, small bar, bathroom, and large king size bed.  I guess there was a patio, but I never opened my windows.  There is a free hookup to internet and $10 wireless charge.  Two TVs and nice work out room.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-el-paso-airport-el-paso,Courtyard El Paso Airport,4.0,$$,24,"This is my absolute favorite hotel to stay at when I visit El Paso. I like the bistro and bar. The little store is so very convenient. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly. Very pleasant conversation. We felt very welcome and comfortable. There was these two staff members in particular, Mary and John. They were very professional and gave us light please an conversation. We enjoyed not only our room but comfort of the lobby. We relaxed and had quite a nice evening. Highly recommend hotel!!!Super easy to find. Has its own little ramp off the Boulevard coming from the I-10. We walk in, the lobby was very clean, and the decor was inviting. There wasn't anyone at the check-in counter so we had to wait a few minutes. As soon as the front desk person comes out, check-in process was so quick it made up for the wait. We get the 3rd floor, and a room with a sleeper sofa in it since we are a family of 6. Entering the room, it had the same clean and modern vibe as we felt entering the lobby. Only stayed a night, but twas well-worthed. The importants were clean (bed and bathroom), beds were comfy. Good enough. My only gripe was that the room was so darn cold. It was already freezing outside, and now it was freezing inside. We couldn't find the temperature control in the room? Fortunately, the blankets were enough to moderate the coldness I felt. None of my other family members were complaining, so maybe twas just me?!?Anyway, checking out was just as efficient as checking in. Ample parking. There's lots of lobby seating to hang around, a snack store, think there was a bar too or some sort of cafe? Very convenient location. I will note that I did hear the person in the next room from us coughing early in the morning. Walls are pretty thin, I'd say. The carpets could use some steaming as well. Overall, I'd still return especially if you are only stopping for a night and need a place to just crash.An average Courtyard.  Rooms are small and sparsely furnished.  Noise from the hallway comes right into the room when people are talking. The bathroom needed some maintenance.However, the staff was really nice.  The bartender in The Bistro was especially courteous and made several recommendations for Mexican restaurants in the area.Not the best Marriott, but it's comfy, clean, and right off the highway, which makes it convenient for those traveling through town. The pool is outdoors (boo!), but no one is ever there so we've got it to ourselves. They provide free business services, including printing and faxing documents (helpful in a pinch). The food place is definitely overpriced, but still decent. The pizza is lacking (clearly frozen), but the breakfast is actually really good. The French toast is a favorite. All in all, not a bad option when passing through el pasoWonderful place to stay! Super clean and extremely friendly and helpful staff!  Great stay!  Room was quiet, had my own balcony overlooking the pool to step out on for a cigarette and to enjoy the beautiful weather!  Beds were comfy! Water was hot! The staff helped set me up with transportation during my stay!  Free shuttle to and from airport!  Enjoyed my stay and will be returning to this hotel for my future trips!Pro: Clean, simple, free parking, easy access. Nice staffCon: I almost gave it 2 stars for this--the TV is at the  side of the bed! We drove 8 hrs stopped for an easy night , to rest and watch TV . We had  to watch TV over our right shoulders -- our necks hurt. We stayed in this same hotel on the way up-- same thing.The front desk girl was nice but the rooms are totally outdated compared to most courtyards. The carpet needs to be ripped out! Our room reeked of musty, mold smell and the pillows were rather old because the filling inside had turned into balls and the pillows themselves were yellow (yes, I took them out of the case). Lastly, there was an man going in his room with a hooker in broad daylight and even though I know there's little the staff can do about it, but it's completely gross and maybe if they raised the prices they can make some upgrades and keep people like that out! I just have never experienced anything of the sorts from a Mariott chain hotel ever and I've stayed in tons! Do yourself a favor and look right behind this place and go to Fairfield inn and Suites its brand new and about the same price and less that 2 miles away you can thank me later.Stayed here for a few nights. Very clean and great customer service from the staff! The room was pretty decent size. The bed was not the best but comfortable. Had a good night and peaceful sleep. Overall, my stay here was great and thanks to an excellent and friendly customer service from Mary! I will definitely stay here again.One of the worst Marriott stays I've ever had. I travel quite a bit, and always stay at a Marriott property. First, when I walked up to the front desk to get a room, he wouldn't give me the military rate. The ""best he could do"" was $10 off. I did a quick check on the Marriott website, and the military rate was $100 less! I even showed the gentleman (Arthur) working, and he said he couldn't do it. I had to book online. Second, they put me in a room facing the highway, and there is nearly no insulation. The freeway was louder then the TV. Third, when I went to take a shower, the faucet was sideways, and the shower valve was broken. Took me a solid five minutes to make the shower head work. I was just passing through, so I can't speak to the quality of other properties in El Paso, but this is one I'll never return to.Very clean and great staff. The alarm was set for 4am by previous guest, so thanks for that.  And the breakfast doesn't start until 7am on the weekends. A little late for an early rising traveler to benefit from.I have stayed at several marriotts locations and as a platinum member have gotten different perks. But the customer service at this location is absolutely amazing!! They have me my choice of floor and a kind bed! It was clean and spacious! Would definitely stay here again!!!I'm a platinum elite Marriott member and have stayed over 150 nights in Marriott's this year.  I have seen my share of hotels and I have stayed in all 3 Marriott properties here in El Paso. I think they all have different perks. This is a solid option close to the freeway. I've always felt the ""west side"" of El Paso is a bit more safe but haven't had any issues the few tines I've been here. Its very clean but a bit off the beaten path.  There is a nice mall and the new Fountains shopping center very close by.  Its right off the freeway an minutes from the airport so a great access spot if you're working all over el Paso. The prices can be a bit higher than other Courtyards and its both a step above average but overall a great property.My family and I booked a double queen bed room and it was very spacious and clean! I felt very comfortable although in our room, there were not that many outlets. (I forgot to bring my power strip, boo!). Free wireless internet, pool being open until 11PM, and the gym being available 24 hours were definitely all pluses. No complimentary breakfast or coffee though! The lobby area's decor was contemporary and had many amenities for guests. There was a little convenience store, a cafe, a lounging area, as well as easy access to the pool and gym area. I would definitely stay at the Courtyard El Paso Airport again for my next visit!This Courtyard was an OK one.  I'm a gold Marriott rewards member, so I've stayed at a lot of different Marriott properties for both business and pleasure.  I usually like Courtyards because they are fairly reliable in quality.This one dropped the ball a bit in my opinion.  CONS:The room was quite cramped for a Courtyard, I thought.  I could not roll my suitcase in the gap between my bedside table and the tv stand.  The water pressure was NOT good, and the shower curtain was not properly hung.  I feel I should explain that - they use the bowed curtain rods to give more space in the shower so the curtain bows out in the middle.  Except they mounted the bowed rod so that the outermost part of the bow was actually even with the INSIDE of the tub.  I barely had room to shower without hitting the curtain, even when standing sideways to avoid it. There were no outlets next to the bed for charging my laptop or phone, which is something I almost always have at a Marriott property.PROS:Clean, well taken care of property.New lobby and mostly updated rooms (a few years ago I think).Room service was prompt and did a good job.Food at the Bistro was as expected, not stellar but standard.I know I sound like I'm nitpicking here, and I am!  But when you travel half your time on business and have to live in hotels for a week...you start to get picky.  Because these places are HOME as often as home is.When I returned two weeks later, I stayed at the Residence Inn nearby (much superior).As far as Marriott Courtyard properties go, this is one of the best I have stayed at.  They offer a free airport shuttle.  Just give them a call and they will be there in 10 minutes.  This Courtyard has been renovated to the new Courtyard style.  Staff is super friendly and willing to accommodate you.  Rooms were fresh and clean.  My only complaint is that I called for a 6:30am wake up call.  Next day I received a wake up call at 5am.  Not fun, especially when you can't go back to sleep!I'll stay here again while on business.  Very convenient to the airport and Ft Bliss.I stay at a lot of Marriott properties and rarely get disappointed.  But, like any chain, some properties are better than others.  I lucked into finding this hotel because the full service Marriott at the Airport didn't have any holiday specials - e.g. breakfast included in a reduced price room.  This is one of the cleanest and nicest Marriott hotels I have stayed at.  Service is first class.  Rooms are spotless, and the entire property is clean.  We had a room facing the freeway - but due to great sound dampening and acoustic control we couldn't hear any highway noise - very nice!  We will definitely be back on our next visit to El Paso!I stay in plenty of various chain- hotels..... and this Courtyard is totally fine, as far as Courtyard standards go. Like many other El Paso properties, it's located just off the busy 10 freeway. Which is convenient... although some pretty noisy traffic. When checking in, ask for a room furthest away from the freeway. The staff was totally fine at check-in and friendly. I even checked in earlier than the arrival time, and my room was all nice and ready for me. They even had my specific requests of ""feather-free"" pillows, since I'm allergic to practically everything. Room was comfortable...everything again, was your basic standard Courtyard-fare. Complimentary WiFi...complimentary parking... and complimentary coffee in the morning.And 24/7 gym with some great Life Fitness treadmills, elliptical, and recumbent bike. Few weights.I've been here less than 24hrs, I like the staff Alejondrea was working the front desk when we checked in. Very friendly courteous and helpful staff make it a great location. It is very clean has a pool and jacuzzi and is close to Fort Bliss. We have 2 rooms here and I'm paying half the price. Thanks to my great friend and brothah RT.Not much is nearby, but this is a great Courtyard.  Great front desk.  Small food, coffee, beer available in lobby.  Clean, new rooms.  Outdoor pool.  Free internet.  Free parkingGreat hotel. It was kept very clean. The beds were comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful with the local area. The hotel was close to everything.. The airport, fort bliss, the zoo.. I would stay here again!","Great location for what we were in El Paso for. Convenient to many of the things you will want to do while in town.Kudos to the hotel for all of their special attention. They were very accommodating when it came to special storage needs that we had and for fixing a corporate screw up that indicated we were to get an American breakfast with our room rate. They promptly arranged a buffet for all the guests on Saturday and Sunday. They clearly went out of their way. They get what customer service is all about. Without exception, every staff member that we came across was simply first class. Looking for a great place to stay in El Paso ... make it the Courtyard El Paso Airport.We are certainly glad we did.I stumbled on to this courtyard due to a traffic jam, must have been my lucky day.  Front staff, Romo, was the nicest, most professional kid I have met in a long time!  We were in our room within a few minutes!  Room was very clean, comfortable, and the a/c was cold.Romo had the shuttle driver give us a ride to dinner, nice touch!  Eddie the driver was also super nice!Five stars for sure!Let's start with the staff. They are so unhelpful. They have a Starbucks in the lobby, except they were closed on Sunday morning at 11:30. I spoke to a worker there and she said they reopen at 5:00. When I spoke to the front desk the next day about it, they said they are open all the time, just have to ask the front desk. Whey didn't they say that the first time! Then there's coffee in another part of the lobby, empty! Rooms don't have fans in the bathroom, so steam from showers will linger. Elevators super slow. The staff were sorting laundry sheets in the lobby when we came in for a late night check in (kinda weird). The beds are comfortable though, and it's better than a motel 6, but I got a $59 special price so can't be too picky I guess. Rooms overall are clean, and newer interiors with modern decor. Just don't expect any help from the staff, because they will look at you like you have a 3rd eyeball!",,,,"['absolute', 'favorite', 'hotel', 'visit', 'like', 'bistro', 'bar', 'little', 'store',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-el-paso-university-el-paso,Hilton Garden Inn El Paso/University,3.5,$$,33,"Hilton Garden Inn. Probably my favorite hotel chain. ive stayed in them all over the country. This one in particular is really acomodating. They are always asking if you need something or just checking to make sure your ok. The bar/restraunt is open all hours of the day unlike some of the hiltons around the nation. There are a lot of local business and restraunts within in walking distance. Its a good crowd lots of college students. If i ever decide to come back to el paso this will be the hotel i stay.After much thought, we picked this place instead of the Double Tree downtown because Hilton Garden Inn's restaurant was open until later and we were coming to town on Christmas Eve and wanted a sure dinner if all else failed. Double Tree restaurant was very non-commital about closing time. This is a clean hotel with a restaurant that serves good food. But the service is very spotty. Depends on who you get. The young woman who checked in us would be let go in any other place. She was absolutely nonchalant and non-interested. Every Hilton property we stayed in during this trip upgraded us due to our Hilton Honors status. She didn't despite the availability of suites. The first room we were given did not have any cold water at all. And so we had to be moved to another room. She couldn't care less about that either. We had to call and follow up multiple times. Whereas Carlos (the one on the front desk the next day) was incredibly gracious and helpful. If not for him, I would have given only two stars. Give him a raise. And Andrew, the shuttle driver was wonderful too. He gave me and my son a ride to the movie theater and took excellent care of us. I guess if you are visiting the university, Nice things about the hotel1. Good restaurant: Excellent cheesy green chile, don't order the pasta primavera. I should have gone with the quesadilla. The pasta was flavourless. 2. Carlos and Andrews3. Nice cucumber waterCons1. Spotty service2. Faulty maintenance (wouldn't you check the water before you assign a room?)3. Poor value for moneyLast business trip to ElPaso this is not where I stayed and quite frankly I would not prefer to stay here again. During my week stay it was mediocre at best. First the good this is that the staff are all friendly and attentive. Here are the reasons for my displeasure during the stay: The bed and pillows were so uncomfortable I woke up with my neck and back sore a couple nights. The water pressure in the shower was low and overall dated. The towels were hit or miss as far as the thickness.  The air conditioner sounded like a freight train coming through when it clicked on and off. The breakfast if you are not getting no it free from being a HiltonHonor Gold status member is like $15 bucks and not tasty at all. The restaurant in the hotel.... Well the service is soooooo slow and the food looks great when it comes out but doesn't taste very good. The hamburger was ""okay"" and the salmon was ""okay"" for the prices it should taste better. During half of the week one elevator was broken and when both were operational they still operated slowly. I was on the fifth floor and opted to take the stairs down rather than waiting that's how long it took. Literally guest would sit out on the ottoman in the hallway waiting for it to arrive. The fitness center is decent a couple treadmills, stationary bikes, ellipticals, free weights and a weight machine. One treadmill was broken, I informed the front desk but it was never fixed. The pamphlet outlines how the business center has office supplies at request. I needed a notebook and didn't feel like driving to a store... Needless to say they don't have anything so don't ask just go to the Walgreens four blocks down the road. The university is on the same street so is the hospital so the streets are always crowded with walkers, kids scooting around or on bicycles. Lastly, they tested the fire alarm one afternoon which was posted but one night the alarm just started going off for no reason for the longest time....Stayed here for a 2 night stay to attend the Sun Bowl. Arrived in the evening on Christmas...after checking in went to their restaurant/bar to have a late dinner/drink: the waitress was not trained well -- didn't even know if they had a full bar... Food below average: think canned pears on flatbread. The first room we had was noisy and shook every 2-3 minutes due to the 'compressor'. The 2nd room had dirty sheets AND no maid service for our second night ... Overall not what one expects from a hotel with the Hilton name.Booked this hotel on accident. I actually wanted to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn located near the airport.  But I don't regret staying here one bit.  This Hilton Garden Inn is one of the bigger ones that I've stayed at.  Just the decor alone sets this Hilton Garden apart from the other Hilton Gardens out there.  Because this hotel is located so close to UTEP and downtown El Paso, there's obviously a ton of restaurants near by within walking distance. I didn't partake in any of these restaurants...just saying.  I did, however, took advantage of their room service.  I'm so use the Great American Grill that most Hilton Gardens have as a restaurant. So, I'm also use to their food.  My opinion, this Hilton Garden's food is pretty damn good.  I had their Crispy Salmon and it was phenomenal.  As for the rooms, I thought that my room was just your standard Hilton Garden type room. It was clean, spacious, and the noise level was low. Based on my initial experience of the hotel's facade, lobby, restaurant, bar, the decor, and even their large hallways, I expected a huge room.  Nope...all I got was your average Hilton Garden room.  Not a big deal at all. I still had a great stay.The hotel was ok, nothing special.  The bathroom sink drained very slow and the hot water was limited. The room condition was ok, older but taken care of. The breakfast was ok, but not at all special.  I opted to pass on the 2nd and 3rd nights.  Location was good for my travels.  Starbucks is very close which is a plus.  This is not my preferred location for future visits.This review is based solely on this hotel's bar and food. Otherwise the actual hotel and the rooms are great.I DETEST being lied to. If your menu says you serve a certain dish and your business even goes into detail as far the menu is concerned, then stick to it. If you can't because...oh I don't know, you run out of ingredients or something foreseeable like that, then at least BE HONEST with the customer and not only the customer but the poor server who has to endure dealing with the unsatisfied customer. The service as far as the waiter is concerned, is great, and I would like to commend him for the great way he handled it, especially since he is the only one working! I ordered the salmon Caprese which is listed in the menu as having smoked salmon, mozzarella, olive oil and pancetta. The pancetta - which is NOT regular bacon people, was missing, along with the olive oil. I was understanding and went to ask, you know because it's a Monday and everyone forgets, so what does the ""chef"" give me? Regular vegetable oil and no bacon, because, well..you see it was frozen and he couldn't unfreeze it. Excuse me, what the nuts?No. Just no. I don't know about the rest of their food, but this turned me off.I travel to El Paso on business several times a year and had previously always stayed at the nearby Doubletree - I didn't realize this property was here.  I ended up here after the Doubletree was booked solid and the Hilton Honors program offered to find another property for me.  SO glad they did!  I really like this place.  It's more centrally located - there's a Starbucks about 2 blocks away (be still my heart) and several shops and places to eat within walking distance (but I'm not the walking type, my rental gets me there in seconds, though! lol) I also really liked in in house restaurant - I had a hamburger when I first arrived and it was seriously tasty.  Yep - this place is my new 'home' away from home when I'm in El Paso - I'm glad to have found it!This is a mixed quality hotel. The location is great and there are many dining options within walking distance. The front desk and housekeeping staff are professional and did a great job checking me in and preparing the room.  There were a few hiccups....  half of my bed had some serious sag (probably from previous football players that stayed at the hotel) and the linens were aging.  The restaurant and bar in the lobby was a nice addition, but the grilled chicken on my salad was charred and dry (I'm talking desert dry).  I also ordered a martini and was given (and charged) the top shelf alcohol even though I didn't ask for it.  Hmmm....Bottom line, this is a convenient hotel though there are some details that drop the quality of the stay... and when you are the road frequently, the little details make all the difference.This may be the only Bhutanese architecturally-designed hotel outside of Bhutan!What does a girl do who is visiting family, and the family rents a guest apartment with no air conditioning, back to back with the high rise's exercise room, across from the elevator and resident entry door and stack of stolen Albertson's carts for residents to roll around, with a window facing the busy street and a hospital whose a/c unit sounded like a factory starting up every 3 minutes???Well, after 2 insufferable nights (can't open the window because of the noise, so it was rather stuffy!) and waking up in the wee hours to an annoyed husband because of all of this, we convinced his family to let us move a few blocks over to the Hilton Garden Inn, which did not cost that much more but had all of the things we wanted: air, quiet, and distance between us and noisy things.We did great!  Friendly service, got a high floor, comfy bed, working a/c, easy parking, walkable to all of the family we wanted to visit, next to UTEP, and of course - Bhutanese architecture!Check out Wikipedia's entries on UTEP and Bhutan.  They are cross-mentioned and this hotel is even mentioned regarding the architecture.  Bhutanese monasteries are rather southwestern in appearance and fit right in!  and there is a nice full bar near the lobby.  One night we sat there and had a few drinks, chatting with the friendly bartender and another hotel guest.Free wifi.  Stay here!Pros:Location is great close to a lot of restaurants! Staff is friendly, accommodating and courteous.The rooms come with a mini firdge &amp; microwave.There is plenty of parking.They give you mint chocolates!Cons:The rooms smell kinda funny. The towels that are supposed to be white are not white ( they should wash them in hot water &amp; use some bleach)!Found hair in bathroom upon checking in &amp; asked to switch rooms. Restaurant closes early for food orders (I'm a night owl).I honestly have never stayed at a ""Garden Inn"". I was absolutely happy with the stay. I reserved the room via hilton honors and it was a 1 room studio. I pleasantly found that the room was very large much larger than some of the 2 room suites that I have stayed in before.  The staff was very friendly and I would absolutely stay here again.  One thing to be prepared for is that the breakfast is $11.95 for all-you-can-eat.Hotel stay = decent.Food in hotel = Out freaking standing!I had the Green Chili soup with my dinner. It was unreal! I could have consumed a bucket of this stuff!Stop in and try some ..So many things I was disappointed in so I'll write them in short sentences.Attempted to check in early, no luck; hotel full. One of the treadmills didn't work for me although the TV worked. I checked the cord, checked the emergency stop, everything. When I called Carlos at the front desk, all he said was maintenance would not be in until 8 am (it was 5:30......). No compassion until I remained silent then he gave a pitiful ""sorry"". So I ran my 4 miles outside in the cold, hoping I didn't have to exercise my ninja skills on some crazy person. Why isn't breakfast free?? It costs $12.49 for an omelet and a bowl of fruit with water! It was not worth it.The guy at front charged my business partner more than the reserved rate because he didn't think to check the group reservation. An unnecessary issue.The creamer in the room was SOLID. Expired...The network data port is so loose, your computer can't hold the internet connection. When you call for help, they send the janitor....! And when they need the janitor, they tell him to leave because it's probably your computer....Gee, really feeling the love now.The waitress Sylvia treats you with an awkward kindness at first, as if she's distracted with other thoughts, but when you go to pay, she ignores you, reaches for your card without telling you the price, then when you ask her the price, she snaps back to reality and turns her mandatory customer service skills back on. I gave three stars for the decor, the cleanliness of the room, and the fitness center which served my needs minus the treadmill issue (it worked the next day). I deducted two stars for the staff and high-priced food.Very pleased with my stay here. Super friendly front desk staff, they even remembered who I was when I would come get my morning bottled water before heading to work. Room was clean, hotel has nice amenities. I look forward to staying here on my next visit to El Paso.This is most prob the best place to stay in El Paso, if only for the Bhutanese arhitecture, which lends itself to it's relationship and proximity to the UT El Paso campus, which is growing by leaps and bounds. I mention this as an important footnote that there is road construction on University Ave. right now, so we had to merge back onto the freeway and back-track a coupla miles to access the hotel from Mesa Rd.The tasteful interior design matches the tasteful architecture, and it is built with a subtle, yet grand scale. The hotel is a step above your typical Holiday Inn, so they have full-size kitchen service and hence charge for breakfast, which is to be expected.Room was big and clean.I will have to say, though, the woman at the front desk, whose name I forgot, lacked interest or empathy for customers. I can kind of understand this since she seemed to be a 20-something college student, HOWEVER, there is no excuse to have absolutely no customer-facing skills. We asked for directions, asked her questions about security, etc. and she always looked face-down, mumbled all of her answeres, and didn't seem to care about us at all. In fact, I am sure that she couldn't wait for us to leave, and for the day to be over.Sorry, but some of us travelers are super tired, and would appreciate a kind smile to brighten our days. Not to mention, when we pay for services, we are also paying for customer service.Wow! Excellent customer service. I got a spacious clean two queen bed one bedroom suite with soft comfortable beds. Both times I called for more towels and blankets they were dropped off within minutes. For the most part we stayed in our room because we were tired from driving so I can't say much about the pool and other amenities but everything looked clean and the hotel itself looked safe and was well lit. I would definitely stay here again.There were many good things about this hotel but one thing ruined my stay: despite having specifically asked for a quiet room, I spent a very sleepless night due to the extremely loud elevator electronic beeping and electronic room doorbell sounds that were going all night. I was in room 507, not close to the elevator, so it must have been even worse for those in rooms close to the elevator.Worse, when I politely asked about the noise the following morning the man at the front desk said indifferently that those noises are out of their control, which is ridiculous! On no account stay here if piercing electronic doorbell sounds through the night will bother you.On the positive side the room was lovely and  it was nice to have a real bath with hot water. 4 or 5 stars for that, but zero for my lack of sleep and their indifferent attitude.Better than the average HGI (and I stay in them about 50 nights/year).It is a good location - right on the edge of UTEP campus.  I think because of the locale as well as the niceness of the property, they command slightly higher rates than other Hilton properties in the area.  Parking is free and there are plenty of good restaurants and bars within walking distance of this property.The thing that made me write this review is they go beyond the typical HGI breakfast.  For those who stay often, you know the drill in the morning with the American Grill.  This location has more stuff like Corned Beef Hash and giant sausages - yum!Very disappointing stay. People are nice, but untrained and inept. We had three reservations, and they screwed up two of them. It took several hours of our weekend to fix the problems. Food at the restaurant (we only had breakfast) was horrible. If they can't even do breakfast, so glad we didn't try to have dinner there. The only good thing about this hotel is the shuttle drivers. They are friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. This property would run much better if they turned over management to the shuttle guys!  Also, got locked out of the rooms several times due to faulty room key system.","This hotel was a mixed bag for me.  Stayed here 4 nights:Pros:Great location if you're business is with the university.  Also within walking distance to several restaurants.Great shuttle service - they will even take to or pickup from airport.  About a 15-20 minute trip.Easy friendly check-inThey honored my preferences in terms of room location.Cons:My room wasn't too clean.  Hairs in bathroom.  Duvets stained.  Some kind of stain even on the notepad.  Carpet stained.ESPN channel didn't work.No free breakfast which I thought was standard at Garden InnsAll in all I was disappointed with the cleanliness.  An immediate turn-off on any hotel.I'd blocked a group of rooms for my wedding guests and I'm giving two stars for the good things they said (nice lobby, good rooms, great location). My new husband and I, however, didn't get to experience this hotel because they don't honor late reservations past 1:00 a.m. We arrived after 2:00 a.m., still clad in our wedding garb, and were informed that we couldn't be checked in until 3:00 p.m. because it was technically the next day. I asked if there were available rooms and the night clerk said there were but that we couldn't have a room. It was truly an awful experience and I will never stay at this hotel. I still don't understand why we couldn't spend our wedding night in an available room, especially since we were still charged for it. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, period. Don't expect any special treatment for any reason and be sure to abide by their rigid check-in (starting at 3:00 p.m. and closing at 1:00 a.m.) and check-out (12:00 p.m.) times.Very good location! Me and my friend Dottsy Z were in town to take care of some business and we were able to secure a room at this Hilton. From the time we arrived to the time we left, everything was great. Upon arrival, we commented about how cold it was in town (we had just arrived from sunny and warmer AZ) so the front desk manager sent us up some hot chocolate and cookies to warm us up. How cool was that? The rooms were clean, the beds were comfy and the breakfast was yummy. (Thanks to that staff for staying open a little later to make fresh breakfast for us!) The downside was their internet service needs some serious work, but otherwise it is a great place to stay and near just about any and everything. If you are in the area and need a good hotel to stay at, definitely check out the Hilton Garden Inn!The hotel, lobby, hallways and rooms were very clean and well appointed. It is adjacent to the UTEP campus, which was a great place to walk everyday. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well as professional, a really nice combination. I especially enjoyed the cold fruited water they had available 24/7 in the lobby. It was infused with limes or lemons and was very refreshing and gratis. I probably drank a gallon or more over the course of 4 days and it was much appreciated. They also have some type of healthy cookie/bar available in the evenings, like a late night snack, which my husband tried and enjoyed. The outdoor pool, which we meant to get into but didn't, is actually heated. And while the website doesn't mention it, they also offer a free shuttle to the airport and other destinations around El Paso. We took the shuttle to Tabla, which is a wonderful restaurant located in the downtown area of El Paso, and after dinner, we just called the hotel and they sent the shuttle to pick us up and bring us back, it was really wonderful! There is a restaurant in the hotel lobby, but we ate out for all meals so we could explore El Paso, so I cannot offer any reviews on the food, but the breakfast prices were a little on the high side, that much we observed. I would definitely stay here again if we make it back to El Paso, it was a great hotel and I would highly recommend it to anyone going to El Paso for any length of stay.Stayed here for a mini staycation. We are from El Paso so we know the area. Hotel was nice size and for a nice price. There was a few stray hair in the shower but nothing to drastic. Room and bed were clean. Came with a microwave, mini fridge and Keurig coffee maker. Was a good experience abd would probably recommend it.Clean hotel, great location right next to campus and friendly staff. Everything you need is within walking distance of the hotel. The only thing I didn't like was 50 emails after my stay asking me to take their survey and become a HHonors member.Centrally located, clean. And Greg, the man at the front desk, was great!I actually lived in this hotel for a couple of months in 2008 (it's been open since at least November 2007) and really had a nice time.  It may be the only Garden Inn with a bar, I don't know.  But that was a great place to unwind and watch a game after work. The food is so-so, although the breakfasts are pretty good.They give you a free El Paso Times.  I love that. Highly recommended if you want to be on the west side, have business at UTEP.  Easy-ish access to the freeway.Hello Mr Adauto. I would like to start by saying I never take the time to write a review, However this incident forced me to do so.  We had just arrived in El Paso from Las Vegas and due to the time change thought we still had an hour to get something to eat at the Grill in the Hotel Lobby.  We arrived at the restaurant and to our surprise it had just closed it was actually 10:05pm.  The Restaurant supervisor Adrian explained to us that the cook had left but he would try to see what he could do.  To our shock, Chris the cook had returned to the restaurant to cook us in his own words ""whatever you like"" and he proceeded to make us a fabulous dinner.  I cant tell you how much we appreciated that warm delicious food after our trip and being tired from a long day. My wife, daughter and myself really appreciated both Chris's and Adrian's superb customer service and that step above service they provided us.  Thank you againEd DeAndradeWe were on our way to Santa Fe from Austin and decided we needed to stop in El Paso for a break so we decided to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. Upon our arrival I was very impressed with the hotel itself. Since it's fairly new, it's very nice and clean. My favorite part about our stay was the breakfast!! The service was spectacular. Our waiter Carlos was the best and was very attentive. The food was good but the coffee...the coffee was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place for a stay if you're traveling to El Paso or passing by and need a break.Great hotel! Super location-right by pretty UTEP campus which makes for good running to start the day. Excellent personnel-friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. Clean, modern atmosphere. Best HGI I've stayed in around the country!Nice Place. Well maintained, clean, and friendly staff. My only complaint is that the buisness center is ill- equipped. The scanner was never connected to the network to email documents and the printer wasn't working.",,,,"['garden', 'inn', 'probably', 'favorite', 'hotel', 'chain', 'country', 'particular', 'really',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/staybridge-suites-el-paso-airport-area-el-paso-2,Staybridge Suites El Paso Airport Area,4.5,$$,12,"Nice service.   Free breakfast 7 days a week consists of scrambled eggs or omelets.  Each day they rotate the sides: bacon, hash, potatoes, biscuits and gravy.  Free Dinner is three nights a week, with a self serve draft beer and wines.Very clean, love that it's pet friendly. Breakfast is full breakfast &amp; offered a large variety of items. Staff is courteous &amp; customer focused. We were concerned with highway noise since it is located tight off an extremely busy highway. We did not hear traffic &amp; slept very well.The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and comfortable for our family of 4 and 2 dogs. They have a laundry room, gym, business center, movies, games, delicious breakfast and during the week a nice social hour with free beer and wine. They are also located right off of the 10 freeway.I have a great idea. I'll buy my own beer and the hotel joins the 21st century with better internet connections for its guests. Avg. download is 48 Kb/s. When I checked multiple times during my stay.I appreciate the kitchenette but I don't use it. The breakfasts are nice too. The bed is good. Be sure to operate all of the bath fixtures before unpacking.  But that applies everywhere, right?I was really impressed with this hotel. It was clean, comfortable, quiet and the staff were great from the moment of check-in to the check out process! The morning breakfast was good! And they even had complimentary beer?! What the heck?! That was a nice surprise! Overall, if I am ever in El Paso again, this will be the place to stay for us! Thank you for the great accommodations!Good hotel and nice full separate bedroom suites with kitchens - close to freeway and cool amenities like a DVD library that you can check out and watch for free. Laundry is free and the soap is only a $1-2 so they don't even try to take advantage of the convenience factor of buying it on site. Breakfast is free and decent in morning considering they do all items in a oven I was kinda impressed and it always got me though the initial part of my day. The gym is clean and new equipment and being next to laundry makes it kind of perfect for a Multi-tasker.  The Pool- spa was clean with no issues - even had free beer certain days with weekday evening socials. Staff was polite and efficient- doing everything right and accommodating when something was asked of them - good job and a well deserved reviewTypical Staybridge quality. It's clean, nice people and the food is good. If I ever come back to the area I will stay here without a doubt.Amazing 5 night stay! Breakfast was great each morning. Only had dinner one night, but ate so much I could not move. Dinner also came with free beer and wine. The hot tub was a steamy 103 degrees and the pool was 90 degrees in December. Great stay! Would recommend to anyone!I can't say enough great things about my recent stay at this location. From the time we were picked up by Valerie from the airport, the staff was nothing but friendly. We soon met Stephanie and Eduardo who knew us by name by the end of our stay.We stayed a week and the location was 10 minutes (or less) from the airport, downtown El Paso, and all our shopping destinations.They offer a week night dinner along with beer on tab or wine! The menu is listed at the lobby and also posted on your fridge so you prepare your belly for what's cooking during your stay. Continental breakfast offers everything from scrambled eggs, omelet's, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, yogurt, waffles, bagels, something for everybody. They offer complimentary laundry mat, no need for quarters, its FREE!Take a dive after a long day in their pool or just relax in the jacuzzi.This hotel received a 3 star rating from AAA. Maybe it should be 4 stars. They are not a full service hotel but it is such a nice hotel. My room was super clean....not a spot on the carpet, gleaming bathroom and kitchen. It smelled clean when I opened the door. The bed was heaven and I slept very well. Mattress was very very new. The staff was professional. The only cons I could see were minor- the hallways smelled funky and the sliding glass front doors were open at 5:30am when the sign says they are supposed to be locked until 6am. I really enjoyed my 1 night here and will definitely stay here again should I return. Better than.many 4 star hotels I have stayed in.We had lots of choices of places to stay but the price and ammenities here really made it our #1 choice. Pool, jacuzzi, free breakfast, social hour (free evening meal + beer and wine 3 nights/week), clean large rooms and the best staff ever. A must if you are visiting El Paso.Terrific stay. We were here 4 days, welcoming my son home from Afghanistan. The family shared a two bedroom suite. Very cozy and comfortable. I usually don't sleep well in hotels but this was an exception. Really nice breakfast selection. The items in the Pantry are waaay over-priced so bring your own snacks and drinks. Still one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had.",,,,,"['nice', 'service', 'free', 'breakfast', 'days', 'week', 'consists', 'scrambled', 'eggs', 'omelets', 'day', 'rotate', 'sides', 'bacon',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/americas-best-value-inn-el-paso-3,Americas Best Value Inn,2.0,$,10,"Good nights rest w/ complimentary breakfast in the morning, hell yeah! Yelp check-in offer of 25% off the first night? Even better. Conveniently located off the 10 fwy. I was passing by on a road trip.Nice looking pool and jacuzzi. Didn't get a chance to try. =\Free wifi!!!! =)Beds are standard spring, but comfy enough for this guy to sleep well. Requested a doubles room1st stay; room 110 was great. Strong a/c, nice view of the pool. No issues.2nd stay; First room smelled like urine (111) Notified front desk and they apologized and moved us. Second room had a weak a/c (121) and I slept warm =(I was too tired to care so I didn't complain They NEED to wash their carpets, in and out of the rooms. I was walking barefoot and it seemed like I had been walking on asphalt. They got some things to work on, but overall a good place to rest your weary head.Before booking a last minute stay at this hotel, I wished I had thought to read current Yelp reviews.The first issue I have with this hotel is the back door I used to get to my room does not lock. Literally, anyone can walk into the building. The back door's key lock looked like it was broken off and no one ever bothered to fix it. I'm traveling with my children, so I felt unsafe.The building is in need of a major renovation. Upon entering the building, I noticed first floor bedrooms and a conference room with a glass window are covered with bed sheets. The walls, floors, ceilings, and stairs are dusty and dingy. There are a pool and jacuzzi. Both are closed for the winter; however, I wouldn't risk putting my toe in either one.The hotel is dated and can use new carpeting, furniture, linens, televisions, heater/AC units... New everything! A free breakfast is offered, but the selection is small. I asked another guest how long she's staying at the hotel and if the breakfast is normally this bad. She's been here 3 days, and yes, the breakfast is normally that bad. We decided to go to McDonald's instead. Thank God I didn't see bugs, blood, and other disgusting things other Yelpers did. My room is dusty (see the picture of the tv)and aggravated my family's allergies. Overall, the next time I'm in El Paso, I won't stay here again.This is my second night here as a result of some mix up in moving houses. The first night was fine, but tonight we got a room with a broken door lock, then they reassigned us to a room with two double beds instead of a king we reserved. Then, the room is LITERALLY CRAWLING WITH BUGS. ROOM 121. I laid down and flipped over the pillow and a number of small aphidy looking bugs were all over, as well as some small beetles the size of ladybugs. The more I looked, the more I found. We also killed two small roaches in the bathroom. Perhaps that's what I get for booking a budget hotel, but this is disgusting. I'll be making some other calls on this too. <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FPriceline.com&amp;s=a7fbdccf674e97746685dfb19eddf988696e5a62d38c815fc567f952b1c07748"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Priceline.com</a> was kind enough to give a full refund, though, so kudos to them.This is the filthiest hotel I've ever been in. I had booked this place for 5 days. 1 day is enough to make me want to vomit. I will never stay here again.Do not stay here! It's full of bed bugs and blood stained sheets.  The rooms also smell of chemicals.  This place needs to be called America's worst value inn!I decided to give this property another try after the new owner had a chance to do some ""fixin' up"".  The property is now in my top 2 list for when I stay in El Paso, and I definitely recommend it.  On my recent stay (June 2014), I noticed many neglected items had been fixed/repaired.  Our room was very nice, clean, and a great deal in terms of price paid.  Do make your reservation on-line to get the best rate, though.  I stopped in and tried to book a room in-person, and it was about 15 bucks higher than the internet rate, so I plugged my computer into my iPhone and booked on line ... I am a very happy customer!  I would like to see a few more breakfast items added and would be willing to pay a bit more, but not sure if other people feel the same way.This place is a true dump. It was dirty, unsafe (back entrance security door was broken and my own room door lock was broken), and basically rundown. My room was supposed to have a microwave and fridge and had neither. Drinking glasses were  not individually wrapped and were just styrofoam cups upside down on the bathroom counter. Light globes were missing, light fixtures were loose, the shower head squealed loudly, and the bathroom was plain dirty. the maze-like hallways were dimly lit and depressing. On the plus side, the bed was ok and the sheets seemed clean. The room was very quiet. This motel is many years past time for a renovation.For the cost it was the perfect spot to lay my head for the night. It was within walking distance to several restaurants and bars (including The Hoppy Monk). It is nestled between I-10 and office building complexes, never felt unsafe.The hotel was probably really nice when it was first built, but the age and neglect are showing. If it was renovated the price would definitely rise, so complaining might be counterproductive. I would definitely not book the conference room for any event. The smell of chlorine was everywhere. It gave the illusion of cleanliness. It seemed clean enough, but hard to tell since everything is so wore down. However I did find what appeared to be blood stains on a towel. Check your towels if you're here. The sheets were stain free though.The bed was firm, the shower hot, free wifi, and cereal for breakfast. Basically all you need to lie down comfortably and have a good morning transition. Stay away from the coffee because coffee it is not, and it leaves a terrible after taste even with one sip.Staff was nice and price was right. I would stay here if I was passing through again. Would probably bring my own towel next time if I planned it out.I would recommend it for an overnight stay if you're traveling and need somewhere to rest before you get on the road again. It has all the basic amenities you'd need - tv with many channels, iron, fridge, lock box, and breakfast in the morning. The staff was very friendly and we got a room (with a 20% yelp discount) very easily. The rooms themselves are a little old and need to be updated. Again, if you're just staying for the night, it's fine for the price.Had a comfortable stay here. Indoor jacuzzi was cool and make your own waffle station for breakfast was a nice addition to a traditional continental spread. Overall great avlue. Would stay here again on my next trip to el paso",,,,,"['good', 'nights', 'rest', 'complimentary', 'breakfast', 'morning', 'hell', 'yeah', 'yelp', 'check', 'offer', 'first', 'night', 'better',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-paso-inn-el-paso,El Paso Inn,3.0,$,10,"Solid place to stay | Can't help the location$My friends and I come to El Paso only to climb at Hueco Tanks once a year. We're doing this as an annual thing, too. Last year we stayed at another motel just blocks away from this place, but this year we decided to try another spot. This was a better decision.Front desk is friendly, they remodeled the rooms, lots of parking, and lots of rooms. Our room had two beds, a tv, a bathroom, wifi, a small fridge, and a microwave. Those are all the basic things we need on our trips so no complaints there! I think because they don't have a table with lounge chairs, it makes the room more open. Location IS good since you are minutes away from the El Paso airport and close to Albertsons and other places to eat.No complaints with this place. I will note, however, during our stay there was police action that occurred behind our building. Someone who was staying at the place got in trouble with the police. It is important that I say the owner was not tied to any of that, it was just an unfortunate thing that happened during our stay. We had a completely good experience here. Just keep in mind that Juarez is only a couple miles away.yeah...so the Lone Star closed next door.I went for a brisk walk last night...DICK POE parking lots and car sales are all around.There's a Kmart and BigLots closeby/ side - by - sideand the price was right around 50 bucks a night.my room was big, I had a microwave and little fridge. a king sized bed. The shower water was kind of cold in the morning but a lot hotter at night. I remember that.I like this little hotel. It's not a Hilton that's for sure but if you just need a place to crash and then leave the next morning this is the place to stay.I think we paid about 50usd per night. My 2 gripes are; the filthy floor and the shower/ low water pressure.The floors need to be mopped every day. It's pretty bad when you take a shower and notice your feet are all black from walking on the floor.The water pressure isn't very good which for me is a big thing.It's a cheap hotel to spend the night only. And it think for the price, the room it's nice. The air conditioner works well, the room comes with refrigerator and microwave (they work well too) and wifi service. The bathrooms are very clean as well the bedroom. And the TV signal is good too. The parking is in front of the room which is good too.Worst and most rude staff I have ever encountered. I think it was the owner. I almost left without staying even after paying.Stayed here last night, and I'm really happy the room. Very clean, the bed is very comfortable. I stayed the night in another hotel a few days ago, and I was very disappointed. This hotel has a great price and very nice clean rooms.My daughter, (who is pretty picky) and I both thought this was a great deal. Centrally located, close to so much. Rooms were clean. I think having laminate or hardwood floors instead of carpet helped. Guy at front desk was very nice and helpful. We stayed 9 nights and my only complaint was that the bed is very hard. Instead of box springs the mattresses were on wooden platforms.  Too hard for me, but my daughter thought it was great. Free Wi-Fi, HBO.not bad for the rate, but the guy at the front desk is so rude you want to smack him. Otherwise Ok. I would have given another star if the front desk person had a better and more courteous attitude.Great value for only $40 a night. Friendly service. Pretty cozy. All wood floors, clean, microwave, fridge, and free high-speed wifi--what a deal! Small room, but a big bed. Again, can't beat that price. The only negative is that there is no hair dryer or shampoo/conditioner in the rooms. And the surrounding area is a little shady, but maybe that's the West LA in me talking.Is in the process of being remodeled. Looks like it may be a nice place when they are done but, had rather hard bed  and the floors were kinda dirty. Not bad for a couple of nights but, I don't think I'd want to spend a ton of time here.",,,,,"['solid', 'place', 'help', 'location', 'friends', 'come', 'climb', 'tanks', 'year', 'annual', 'thing', 'last', 'year', 'another', 'motel', 'blocks', 'away', 'place', 'year', 'decided', 'try', 'another', 'spot', 'better', 'decision', 'front', 'desk', 'friendly', 'remodeled', 'rooms', 'lots', 'parking', 'lots', 'rooms', 'room', 'beds', 'bathroom', 'small', 'fridge', 'microwave', 'basic', 'things', 'need', 'trips', 'complaints', 'think', 'table', 'lounge', 'chairs', 'makes', 'room', 'open', 'location', 'good', 'since', 'minutes', 'away', 'airport', 'close', 'places', 'eat', 'complaints', 'place', 'note', 'however', 'police', 'action', 'occurred', 'behind', 'building', 'someone', 'staying', 'place', 'trouble', 'police', 'important', 'say', 'owner', 'tied', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'happened', 'completely', 'good', 'experience', 'keep', 'mind', 'couple', 'miles', 'away', 'yeah', 'lone', 'star', 'closed', 'next', 'door', 'went', 'brisk', 'walk', 'last', 'night', 'dick', 'parking', 'lots', 'car', 'sales', 'around', 'side', 'price', 'right', 'around', 'bucks', 'night', 'room', 'big', 'microwave', 'little', 'fridge', 'king', 'sized', 'bed', 'shower', 'water', 'kind', 'cold', 'morning', 'lot', 'hotter', 'night', 'remember', 'like', 'little', 'hotel', 'sure', 'need', 'place', 'crash', 'leave', 'next', 'morning', 'place', 'think', 'paid', 'per', 'night', 'gripes', 'filthy', 'floor', 'shower', 'low', 'water', 'pressure', 'floors', 'need', 'mopped', 'every', 'day', 'pretty', 'bad', 'take', 'shower', 'notice', 'feet', 'black', 'walking', 'floor', 'water', 'pressure', 'good', 'big', 'thing', 'cheap', 'hotel', 'spend', 'night', 'think', 'price', 'room', 'nice', 'air', 'conditioner', 'works', 'well', 'room', 'comes', 'refrigerator', 'microwave', 'work', 'well', 'service', 'bathrooms', 'clean', 'well', 'bedroom', 'signal', 'good', 'parking', 'front', 'room', 'good', 'worst', 'rude', 'staff', 'ever', 'encountered', 'think', 'owner', 'almost', 'left', 'without', 'staying', 'paying', 'last', 'night', 'really', 'happy', 'room', 'clean', 'bed', 'comfortable', 'night', 'another', 'hotel', 'days', 'ago', 'disappointed', 'hotel', 'great', 'price', 'nice', 'clean', 'rooms', 'daughter', 'pretty', 'picky', 'thought', 'great', 'deal', 'centrally', 'located', 'close', 'much', 'rooms', 'clean', 'think', 'laminate', 'hardwood', 'floors', 'instead', 'carpet', 'helped', 'guy', 'front', 'desk', 'nice', 'helpful', 'nights', 'complaint', 'bed', 'hard', 'instead', 'box', 'springs', 'mattresses', 'wooden', 'platforms', 'hard', 'daughter', 'thought', 'great', 'free', 'bad', 'rate', 'guy', 'front', 'desk', 'rude', 'smack', 'otherwise', 'given', 'another', 'star', 'front', 'desk', 'person', 'better', 'courteous', 'attitude', 'great', 'value', 'night', 'friendly', 'service', 'pretty', 'cozy', 'wood', 'floors', 'clean', 'microwave', 'fridge', 'free', 'high', 'speed', 'deal', 'small', 'room', 'big', 'bed', 'beat', 'price', 'negative', 'hair', 'dryer', 'shampoo', 'conditioner', 'rooms', 'surrounding', 'area', 'little', 'shady', 'maybe', 'west', 'talking', 'process', 'remodeled', 'looks', 'like', 'nice', 'place', 'done', 'rather', 'hard', 'bed', 'floors', 'kinda', 'dirty', 'bad', 'couple', 'nights', 'think', 'spend', 'ton', 'time']",[],[],[],[],"[('night', 8), ('room', 8), ('place', 7), ('think', 6), ('rooms', 5), ('front', 5), ('bed', 5), ('good', 5), ('clean', 5), ('desk', 4), ('microwave', 4), ('great', 4), ('floors', 4), ('another', 4), ('hotel', 4), ('nice', 4), ('price', 4), ('pretty', 3), ('big', 3), ('fridge', 3), ('little', 3), ('bad', 3), ('hard', 3), ('parking', 3), ('lots', 3), ('away', 3), ('water', 3), ('last', 3), ('thing', 3), ('shower', 3), ('year', 3), ('need', 3), ('well', 3), ('police', 2), ('remodeled', 2), ('better', 2), ('location', 2), ('friendly', 2), ('around', 2), ('couple', 2), ('like', 2), ('morning', 2), ('small', 2), ('deal', 2), ('close', 2), ('free', 2), ('pressure', 2), ('guy', 2), ('owner', 2), ('service', 2), ('next', 2), ('daughter', 2), ('conditioner', 2), ('thought', 2), ('nights', 2), ('floor', 2), ('instead', 2), ('staying', 2), ('star', 2), ('rude', 2), ('complaints', 2), ('spend', 2), ('walking', 1), ('help', 1), ('cheap', 1), ('attitude', 1), ('bedroom', 1), ('cold', 1), ('speed', 1), ('staff', 1), ('lounge', 1), ('dick', 1), ('wood', 1), ('black', 1), ('happened', 1), ('complaint', 1), ('someone', 1), ('crash', 1), ('beat', 1), ('smack', 1), ('dryer', 1), ('every', 1), ('tanks', 1), ('trouble', 1), ('disappointed', 1), ('day', 1), ('helpful', 1), ('chairs', 1), ('signal', 1), ('try', 1), ('wooden', 1), ('miles', 1), ('mopped', 1), ('went', 1), ('works', 1), ('courteous', 1), ('side', 1), ('looks', 1), ('right', 1), ('hardwood', 1)]","[(('front', 'desk'), 4)]",[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-el-paso-airport-el-paso-2,Hyatt Place El Paso Airport,3.5,$$,39,"I've stayed here 6 times now and I've enjoyed it 4 out of the 6. The staff has changed and are much friendlier. My company has this hotel listed as preferred as well as the airport Marriott. I choose this hotel because Hyatt allows you to add your points to Southwest Airlines rapid rewards which ends up going farther for me because I fly often. A few times I requested a king bed but ended up getting stuck with two queens because they ran out of the rooms with kings (booked my room weeks ahead so this was frustrating). The hotel is very clean and amenities are good. I wish they offered room service, instead you have to come down and pick it up yourself at the lobby counter.This hotel is a good option if you're looking to stay for a night or two. I'm not sure I'd spend an extended amount of time here though.The staff at the front desk was very courteous, the girl who checked us in even gave us a small tour and explained what was offered before we proceeded to our room.The room itself was nice. We stayed in a king ""suite"" which had a king-sized bed and a large sleeper sofa. There is a small bar sink and a mini fridge but no microwave. One minor compliant I have about the room is the bathroom. First the design of the door is awful. It swings so close to the toilet you have to squeeze between the side of the toilet and the wall to get it closed. Definitely needs to be redesigned into a pocket door. My husband and I are average size and we even struggled to close it, I'd imagine a larger person would really have trouble. Also the shower water took quite a while to heat up.The pool area is decent however the pool itself was full of dead bugs and there was green algae growing near the steps to get into the pool. The hotel is right next to I-10 so there is quite a lot of traffic noise outside. Wasn't an issue for us but if you're looking for a peaceful, quiet spot to lounge by the pool, you might be disappointed.One thing we really enjoyed was their free breakfast skillet. That morning they offered waffles, breakfast sandwiches, oatmeal, boxed cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, and various pastries, toast, bagels, etc. The food was hot and fresh. They also have juices, milk, water, coffee, and tea.Like I said, overall this is a good hotel for a short stay.Let me start by saying that the common areas of the hotel were nice and the rate was very good.  However, the bathroom was so small we had to almost crawl over the toilet and squeeze ourselves between the toilet and the shower door to get in and close the bathroom door.  The dish TV was out the majority of our stay.  The battery died in our tv remote and when I called down to the front desk, they put me on hold for at least 15 minutes before answering my call.  Then, they made us go down to get a new remote rather than bringing one up to our room.  They also ""encouraged"" guests to skip housekeeping due to weather-related staffing issues.  I give it two stars because I got a great rate and it was relatively clean.  Otherwise, I might have given it one.I've stayed in Hyatt Place locations in several cities and this one showed promise when I walked into the lovely lobby, but you can tell this location is showing its wear and tear.  As I headed to my room, I noticed the wallpaper was coming off the wall and in my room, the shower stall could use a good re-grouting.  Even still, the bed was comfy and the room was clean.  I enjoyed a dessert in the downstairs bar/seated area which is very cozy and inviting,  I would stay here again on a return business trip - hopefully they have a budget to spruce up the place.I like this hotel, since I'm part of their Hyatt Goldpass Program. But this time I'm only giving 3 stars due to the low water pressure, 2 nights we were there. Also due their power outage, which took an eternity for the Wi-Fi and TV to turn back on. Breakfast was great and so are the regular food items from the Gallery Menu.This place is very nice! The employees are super nice!!! I recommend this place to anyone staying in the El Paso area!King bed is soft and comfortable.  The showers are spacious.Pretty decent hotel with spacious rooms, free wifi and good breakfast. Only issue I had was with the air unit where thermostat didn't work properly so I was constantly having to adjust. Noise is also a concern since they are very , very close to the freeway. Ask for a room as far away and on a high floor.Well, the hotel was okay, but that is about it. That being said its cheap so why not stay? I wanted to take a shower before bed, but the light in the bathroom would not turn on and it was kinda creepy in the dark bathroom at 10PM. So, I resorted to washing my face in the sink. I almost flooded the room in the process because the sink was clogged. When I was trying to fall asleep I noticed the gentle lull of the freeway sounds was interrupted by a loud air conditioner. I also noticed how hot it was in the room. After inspection I noticed that the room was set to 58, but was actually 74. Luckily I like toastier temperatures than most, but the AC was definitely broken. The complimentary breakfast was satisfactory but I warn you: it was a mad dash to get coffee before they ran out. Checkout was quick and the workers were pleasant. Altogether not an unenjoyable experience... but it was not particularly pleasant either.I've stayed at dozens of these Hyatt place hotels, and this was only OK. The area is utterly charmless, and the rooms are smaller than most Hyatt place rooms - our bathroom door hit the toilet as it opened and closed.If you are staying here then the options in El Paso are pretty lean, so it's an endurance event, nothing to remember.Wow has this hotel aged and gone down the tubes!  Elevator wait is at least 5 mins before you can get on it to go to your room, girl at front desk agreed that they have had several technicians out and can't make it function correctly?Couches are ripped with tears in them, bedspreads are snagged, wood trim in room is worn.  Stayed at a Hyatt Place last night in Albuquerque and this El Paso Hyatt Place does even come close to the Hyatt quality!  I'll never stay here again!!!!Nice hotel, But there's no microwave, and the bathroom it's really hard to get to the toilet......Well it's hard to close the door in the bathroom.  You have to step in the shower, to close the bathroom door.  It's a nice room, nice sectional, desk, refrigerator, nice LG flat screen TV.  They have hot breakfast, that's always a plus.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.They have very friendly staff, especially Derrick at the front desk. He was very empathetic to my situation. Normally check in is at 12pm the earliest, I arrive at the hotel at 9am due to car trouble and it's a Sunday, all car repair shops are closed. Derrick was very customer oriented that he made an effort to try to find me a room right away so I can just settle down and relax. At the end, he was able to check me in early and I get to relax after a disastrous morning.   I appreciate his compassion and professionalism. Thank you, Derrick from the front desk!Visiting Hyatt Place El Paso Airport is like being a special guest at your rich Uncle's place. The exhibits are always interesting, the grounds are relaxing and the view is  stunning. The price is right too. For the cost of parking you get a tram ride and the whole shebang. Also, down by the garage/tram station there are nice picnic grounds and a sculpture garden.Good place to stay.  We've stayed at several Hyatt Place hotels across the country over the past few years, almost always with a pretty positive experiences.  This instance was no different.  Clean comfortable room, friendly staff, and the amenities we're used to with Hyatt Place.  I do have two small negatives though for this particular location...no coffee after breakfast, and they leave the chairs on top of the tables.  I don't mean they put them up to clean the floor then drop them back down.  No, they leave them up all day.  We stayed three nights; every morning after breakfast, the staff would throw the chairs on top of the tables, where they'd stay until some time after we'd gone to bed late in the evening.  I'm not suggesting this was wrong, it just created a really weird vibe.  The other item...coffee.  At every other Hyatt Place we've stayed, we were able to help ourselves to coffee from a carafe in the lobby all day/evening long.  Not at this location.  When we asked the front desk, they quickly offered to sell us espresso drinks, but explained we'd need to wait till breakfast for the coffee we were asking about.  Again, I'm not suggesting this was wrong, it just didn't fit with the expectation we'd developed after staying at more than a dozen other Hyatt Place locations.All in all, a good hotel.  I'd definitely recommend.We always stay at the Hyatt. Great location,  clean hotel,  nice rooms, good value.  Parking is free and safe.  Breakfast used to have more variety, now rather basic.  Great staff,  especially the cleaning ladies. Only complaint: on first floor it was very loud and our sleep was very disrupted.The staff was wonderful. I felt like they were there to serve only me. Friendly and personable. The rooms and bed helped me sleep like a baby. The food wasn't my cup of tea but it will fill your belly in a pinch. I'll be staying here again. For sure.Place is very nice and clean, but NO queen beds. And no wifi streaming. The single beds are comfortable however, if you expect to sleep with your significant other you'll be disappointed. If you only want to check email, fine but don't look forward to streaming movies because their internet contract does not allow it. Small bath. If you want to eat great texmex google Fortis. Went there 25 yrs ago and recently returned still great food. It's in an old remodeled house.New Years Eve in El Paso, TX. We were nervous about this one. It turned out OK, and the rooms are actually pretty nice with a plush seating area. We wished there was a little more room carved out for the restroom - you had to step between the shower and toilet just to close the door. Free breakfast hit the spot, but wouldn't have had anything else to eat there and the drinks were overpriced. Luckily there's a Walgreens across the freeway, where we procured our champagne for the midnight toast. This is right on the I-10, and although we didn't think the noise was a problem since we're from LA and it's always noisy, your mileage may vary. You're gonna be hard pressed to find a decent hotel in this town, and while I can't shout from the rafters about Hyatt Place, I wouldn't hesitate to book again.Stayed a night here for an interview and the facilities are fantastic for the discounted rate!  My room was hugemongous with a full size couch and office area leading to the beds and bathroom sink.  The free wifi is fast and reliable and I enjoyed the complimentary hot breakfast with a pretty full range of options (hot breakfast sandwiches, French toast, oatmeal, cereal, pastries, tea/coffee, etc.).  The free, on-demand shuttle will also take you anywhere within a ~3 mile radius of the hotel - an immense help if you don't have a rental car at your disposal.I love the layout of HP rooms and always enjoy my stays here.  This one was just like all of the others, so it was clean and nice.  Didn't know the only pool was outside, so we lingered a little longer after a long day of driving the day before, and I got up and went to the pool, and normally I love an outdoor pool and getting some sun, but all of my lotion was in the car and I got a little sunburned (which is rare for me, since I am usually the spokesmodel for sunscreen,) but that bag was still packed in the car and I didn't know it was an outdoor pool until I got there 8-}  The pool itself was too cold and had a film floating on top of it, with dead bugs and leaves near the stairs, so it didn't seem very sanitary, but I was there before it was supposed to open, although no one came out to skim the pool while it was supposed to be open.  The breakfast provided was the usual, except the eggs were powdered and tasteless, but the link  sausage was good. One star off for non-skimmed pool and skimpy eggs.  But we will visit another HP again soon.","My first experience staying at a Hyatt Place and I'm satisfied. The rooms are large and comfy. Love the big couch and 42"" TV -- makes you feel very comfortable. Nice work desk with adequate lighting, a few outlets near the desk area - - could probably use 2 more ( i travel with lots of gadgets). And coffee maker, mini-fridge, small sink. The closet and actual bathroom are on the small side. The bathroom vanity is just outside with adequate lightning. But the water pressure in the shower is AWESOME! :)The bed.. meh! ""I've had better"" certainly applies here. NOT the best bed I've stayed in. Overall the room and property are very clean. One note - - when checking in, ask for a room on the EAST SIDE. My room was on the West Side, and I could hear all the traffic last night on the 10. Took me a while to fall asleep, and I'm too lazy to move everything. Oh and the breakfast... my opinion, kinda blah. Some cereals, white breads, mini-donuts, sugary yogurts, fruit, juices, coffee &amp; tea.Review from Jan 09' stay:PROS: Ginormous plasma TV, most comfortable hotel bed EVER (can't say enough about it), big couch with ottoman in the room, free wireless internet, friendly and accommodating staff. CONS: No room service, food available in lobby was really poor, no vending machines or stores near by, really scratchy carpet, staff wasn't aware of a good mexican restaurant in their border town, location was next to a rough neighborhood and a freeway.The staff is what puts this hotel over the top. They are TOP notch. The lobby and common areas are well-appointed. And we enjoyed the lay out of the room. Bed was comfy and the pillows were marvelous. HOWEVER, the bathroom in this hotel is a deal breaker - period. You can not close the door to the bathroom if you are standing in the bathroom. Let me be clear. It is impossible to be in the bathroom (consisting of a toilet and a shower) and close the door at the same time unless you actually step into the shower. Yes, in the shower. Moron design and will influence my decision to stay at any other Hyatt Places with the same configuration. I have been on European cruises that have better bathrooms. Breakfast was okay - lots of breads, fruits and juices. Delicious ruby red grapefruit that morning. Also, these properties appear to run slightly higher than similar brands but I get the loyalty program aspect of it.Okay, the good first--The staff, especially David and Raul were great.  The hotel has a shuttle to and from the airport.  The free breakfast was wonderful, and the beds were really comfortable.  Now the bad.  The rooms are hard to keep cool.  Both my boss and I had to have our refrigerators replaced, and my ""new"" one STILL didn't work.  The other reviews about the elevators are true, they are scary and actually broke down while we were there. No microwave and NO VENDING machines on the floors.  If you want a soda you have to pay for it at the front desk.  Don't ask how much they charge, it will scare you. And one of the reviewers is absolutely correct, the wifi is only good for email. I told my boss I thought this hotel was a Best Western in disguise.  She said I gave it too much credit, it was probably a Motel 6 in disguise.  If possible, stay somewhere else !Nice hotel.The only reason for -1 stars is that getting to anything to eat or any shopping is quite a trek. Although you can see the mall and several restaurants from your room, there is a large highway separating you from them, and no direct route across near the hotel.I love Hyatt Place. Location is right by highway, so ask for a room  not facing it!The check in process was smooth and the staff was friendly. I ordered food from the kitchen a few times and it wasn't the best, but it got the job done. Checking out was just as smooth and very quick. The room itself was cozy, clean and the direct a/c unit was a plus. The only outlet I could find was behind the TV, which was not convenient.Wonderful stay and impressive continental breakfast including a decent selection of coffee and Tazo teas. The staff was very friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The room had 2 twin beds and a fold-out queen size sleeper sofa that was perfect for us and our 4 small children.This is my second stay at a Hyatt Place. My first was in Atlanta several months ago. After two stays, I have to admit I'm really digging this new concept Hyatt has introduced to business travelers.The customer service has been top notch, the rooms clean and spacious (giant flat screen). Food available 24 hours, free wi-fi, nice lobby, free breakfast. And all for a very affordable price. I highly recommend this brand for those budget conscious business travelers.Pros: nice modern room. good size for family of 4. Good price.Cons: very very weak plumbing; clogged so much that we had to use the common restroom on the first floor.I have been in El Paso for about 3 months on and off now for work and I stay in the Hyatt Place El Paso. Everyone who works at this hotel goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is as comfortable as possible. The few times I did have minor complaints, they were dealt with immediately and without question. The staff is extremely friendly and always greet me with a smile when I walk in.- The hotel is VERY clean, the building is new and nothing feels old or outdated.- The rooms are all spacious, included, couches, free WIFI, and nice TV's- Free breakfast, and the food that you can order 24/7 is also pretty good.- Small but fully stocked bar in the lobby.- Staff is extremely friendly and personable, always have good suggestions for restaurants and things to do.- Pretty central location, close enough to downtown and the airport.Overall, for living in a hotel for about 3 months, these guys do a great job and definitely made my stay comfortable.I would suggest this hotel to anyone who is traveling to El Paso for a short or long period of time.We needed to visit some family in a small town outside of El Paso Texas, and were trying to book at a nice hotel near the airport.  We crossed our fingers and gave this hotel a try.  We were very happy with our stay here! Considering downtown El Paso is a very busy and loud place with a lot of traffic, we were ready to be dissapointed.  But the Hyatt made our stay great.  The rooms were really big with a large sitting area with a sofa and wet bar!  We had two queen beds, and also the room has a large flat screen TV, everything seemed clean and smelled clean.  Even though this hotel is near the freeway, the noise really wasn't  loud at all.  we had the fifth floor, so maybey that is why.  They give a free continental breakfast with fruit, cereal, bagels and stuff, so that was nice.We would stay here again.I've stayed here many times, as I must travel to New Mexico on business and I like the fact that it is close to the airport.  The staff is very friendly and they really try to help in any way possible.   The breakfast is good, especially since they have added some hot items such as breakfast egg muffins to the menu.   The only reason for the three stars instead of four is one very important item.  The wi-fi.  Although I read a review that says the wi-fi is fast, it is not.  I use the internet for Skype and also for remote desktop where I can sign in over my network and do work on my home computer.  This is the only hotel in recent stays over the last few years that does not have reliable, fast wi-fi.  Many times, when I type an email at home, I have to wait a minute for each character in a word to appear.  At other times, on Skype, the video of who I am talking too, breaks up freezes, and a message comes on and says, ""your internet connection is slow, there may be frozen or jerky video"".    I have talked with the manager on numerous occasions, and he is very nice and wants to help, but the internet never seems to change.  Perhaps his hands are tied by corporate?  I don't know.  But if you are a business traveler and you really need fast wi-fi that's reliable, this is not your placeThe hotel was comfortable and fulfilled our needs. We have stayed at the Hyatt Place properties before and all of them have the same style and setup. The staff was friendly and we checked in and ordered pizza at the cafe next to the check-in counter and took the pizza back up to our room which was very convenient. The rooms featured a queen size bed, sectional, desk, mini fridge, wet bar, and a large flat screen TV. Our TV had some minor issues with the picture quality but was otherwise very nice. The shower seemed a little old and maybe needed a bit of refurbishment but overall we were happy with our room. Plus the hotel offered free WiFi which is always a plus!Easy access to the freeway, safe, friendly staff, and good food options for a single girl who didn't want to venture out in El Paso alone at night. Can't go wrong :)This is a great hotel in a nice location close to food and shopping.  The facility and rooms are clean and neat.  The staff was very helpful.  Since I was a day sleeper on this trip, my room was serviced in the evening while I was at work.  And the hotel staff was quiet during the day while I slept.  The room had a mini bar, refrig, desk and sofa.  I would recommend for a business trip or extend stay.  Very nice.We were in El Paso because we had Buddy Passes on Southwest to Vegas. We could not get to Phoenix from El Paso so we just decided to spend the night and head back to Dallas the next morning. Being a travel agent they have a $49.00 per night rate which we jumped on since it was only 4.7 miles from the airport. I think for the rate we got, the hotel was very nice. The lobby was very modern and very clean. There were couches and TVs all over the place. We even got a sandwich and some sodas from the front desk "" store"". We got a room on the 6th floor and the room was very nice and roomy. We had 2 couches, work desk, sink w/fridge and a huge TV, just in the living area. The bed was just OK and the bathroom and the closet were very small, but all good no big deal because we didn't have that much stuff anyway. We decided to go to the local (really in New Mexico) casino, so while my wife was taking a shower and getting ready I went to the front desk area to have a beer. They do sell domestic bottles for $4.00 at the front desk bar area. I had a few and talked to another front desk guy by the name of Jim A. He was really cool guy and we talked about the travel industry and how he used to own a little travel agency. He gave us recommendations on where to eat and we talked about the casino we were going to later that night. The hotel was easy to get to from the AP and since we drove around the area the night before, getting back to the AP was really easy, we didn't even have to get on the highway. I would recommend this location to anyone in the area. As we was driving to the hotel from the AP we did see many hotels that were closer, but if you want to interact with nice people and stay at ""not your normal cookie cutter hotel' then I would drive the 4.7 miles to this property and relax. My wife and I did partake in the free breakfast. They had the normal goods but they also provide many cooked to order items as well. I have the bacon and eggs with seasoned potatoes and for $7.00 it was better than I thought it would be. Very Good. If we end up in El Paso again for any reason we will make another reservation here.I was in El Paso for a few days on work at got a good rate at this Hyatt. It's clean and has plenty of parking. The rooms have the big swiveling flat screen TVs and mine even had a tub, which was way cool to soak in after working long days. It's close to the freeway, but the only places you can really walk to are an Ihop and a Denny's. Meh. There's a house of ill repute about a half a mile away if your into that kinda scene.This is probably the best you can get in El Paso.  We stopped here for the night to break up our drive from Austin to Los Angeles.  Our room was very clean, comfortable, and updated.  The staff was friendly.  There was food in the lobby for us to order even though we arrived at 9:00p.m.  And they actually followed through on the requested 7:00 a.m. wake up call!  We will surely come back here next time we pass through.",,,,"['times', 'enjoyed', 'staff', 'changed', 'much', 'friendlier', 'company', 'hotel', 'listed', 'preferred', 'well', 'airport', 'choose',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-paso-marriott-el-paso,El Paso Marriott,3.0,$$,42,"This was the nicest Marriott I have ever stayed in. It was extremely clean. The service was impeccable. The catering and banquet room were excellent. The front desk employees were full of great suggestions and we had so much fun talking to them about El Paso. My bed was very comfortable and the pillows were perfect. My room service breakfast was great. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.But, I do have to admit while we were there on the 2nd night, a fire alarm went off (similar to the comment before). My hair looked like a monster and I didn't budge. But, if I had small children, this would have been a huge issue. I find it ironic that it happened while we were there as well. Plus, when do you know you need to leave? I wish there would have been a voice to tell us why it went off and what we were suppose to do (like the casinos in Vegas.)Decent hotel but overpriced. Easily the worst Marriott property in the area, and there are several others very close. Internet prices are outrageous ($15 a day I think). No fridge in the room. Not even a mini one. A co-worker waited 40 minutes for a salad at the bar. TV is usually on the fritz. Bathroom is tiny. The air conditioner does nearly nothing except make a lot of noise. That being said, the people that work here are great, even if there are maybe too many of them. I don't need someone to grab my bags at the door or hit the elevator button for me. Not really a complaint, just saying. They are trying to pass this off as a luxury hotel, but its really not even an average Marriott for the area.Avid Business traveler and visit El paso often. I have stayed here numerous times and always I have some sort of issue...this time was the Internet was messed up and I had to spend a few hours dicking with that one. Had to do laundry and there was a bad dryer wasting my time and money. Water all over the laundry room. I called twice, but no one gives a rat's Ass! I should have slipped and sued there Ass. Also I'm an elite status and was never recognized, thanked or given a room or entry into the concierge floor..nor was I given the obligatory Internet access code. My suggestion is the Hilton Garden Inn around the corner. This will be my next choice.It's an OK airport hotel.  It's my choice, honestly, when staying in El Paso.  I have stayed at a lot of hotels in the area (Marriott properties), and this one offers the best balance of location, amenities (especially for Platinum members), and service in my opinion.It IS an older hotel.  They gave it a facelift, but not a total remodel, so it has been improved but isn't perfect.  Water pressure is good and wifi was fine.The concierge lounge had a very friendly staff and offered a decent selection of beverages.  I felt the alcohol was rather overpriced, especially considering it was self-serve.  The prices were slightly higher here than at other Marriott's I have stayed at in other cities.Overall it was a wholly decent experience, and I will stay here again.This is not a hotel I would recommend. Although the facilities are fair, there isnt' a lot of attention to detial. For example, I have pretty bad dust alergies. So, when I had to request all the sheets in the room be completely changed everyday to not have a reaction (pillows and everything), I felt that should be done pretty regularly anyway. There's a downstairs bar which isn't bad at all. Some of the cocktails were good. There isn't anything within walking distance of the hotel besides a steak place, so this is important to note. Last but not least, they don't include wifi. That's getting to be a staple in this day and age.Beautiful lobby, convenient highway access and plenty of food options nearby. The things keeping them from receiving a full 5 stars were 1) the rooms were tiny, and 2) the hallway fire alarm went off at 6:45 am, waking my entire family and causing our kids to freak out. No going back to sleep, that's for sure. Terrible start to the day, and they didn't even offer to discount the room/comp breakfast/or anything else. It was just like, ""oh well, you're outta luck"". Pretty crappy since I'm now stuck with two overly-tired and cranky toddlers for a full day of travels.We were moved here after there was a plumbing issue next door at the Hampton Inn. Our room was nice, clean and spacious. Only problem is that it is off the freeway and you hear the traffic. Most likely not an issue for the rooms on the front side of the hotel. They do not have a free breakfast, but we were told to come back over to Hampton Inn for breakfast.I love this hotel. I stay here for business often. The rooms are very clean and updated. The showers are great with lots of water pressure. The concierge level is very nice with breakfast in the AM and snacks in the PM if you prefer a more quiet area. The bar area is ok, but they seem to be under staffed and the food is way over priced yet sort of mediocre. Overall I really like the hotel though and it's very convenient to the airport with shuttle service if you need it.The only thing even remotely impressive about this hotel is their bistro.  Other than that, it's extremely overpriced.  The rooms are itty bitty jokes with thin walls.  The staff was halfway attentive, at least.  I personally would never recommend this particular Marriott to anyone.  It was the worst experience I've ever had at any Marriott, or anything by Marriott.Ok I will give it a 1 star, barely. After 510 Marriott nights I am allowed to be truthful. In the concierge lounge I asked for a bottle of water, water mind you, and I was told no way,  pour yourself a glass or better yet you can call room service. Are you kidding me, I can't even imagine the thinking around this thought process. Your very best loyal customer who has spent thousands of dollars at your hotel and you can't even give them a bottle of water, I am beside myself.Oldest looking/feeling Marriott I've ever been in.... Also most expensive for not being in a city. Front desk was very helpful... specifically one clerk.   I'll try to remember to post her name when I see her again.    I have another stay in a few weeks. ... almost switched hotels.    This is a company pick though.    I would have checked out after one night is I was paying $200+ a night.Very old Marriott for the price. Have paid less in larger cities and had more amenities. Staff not that helpful, mediocre at best. Problem is, where else can you go in El Paso?  Not many options.Decent stop for pilots who appreciate a nice warm bed in a quick hurry (quick shuttle-ride from the airport), not good for travel/business, though.  $15 for internet, um...no.  I'm not an elite member, so I didn't to sample the business lounge.  Can't have any riff-raff streaming who-knows-what online or causally reading the paper with coffee or a complimentary light breakfast.  Extremely small bathroom.  Thankfully, I didn't have to pay extra to use it.  However, I did have to step around the toilet to shower.  Also, I was under the impression that I could have more than two options for the shower temperature.  Sorry, it's scalding hot or cold only.Marriott, if you are reading, the decor is just fine. Don't waste money updating, as it does not look as dated as others have stated.  Get with the times and offer at least complimentary wifi with an additional charge for faster downloads.  Add a small, yet satisfying, complimentary breakfast for the bleary-eyed traveller, who is not looking for a grandiose veneer away from the little people.I'm giving it two stars, because they claim to be a 4-star hotel.  Gym, pool, massage, fitness center, restaurant are fine.  Business travelers, even the high-end, don't care if you don't cater to the norms and make them pay (a lot) extra.Sam, the receptionist, is one of the best professionals I have come across.This is a standard full-service Marriott that seems to have been built sometime in the 1980's.  The lobby seems to have been renovated fairly recently and the rooms seems to have been updated in the last few years as well.  The rooms do seem to be on the smaller end of the spectrum for a full service Marriott property.This property offers an executive lounge for Elite Marriott Rewards members that serves a light breakfast in the morning and snacks throughout the day.The hotel is located less than a 5 minute ride from the El Paso airport.I will stay here again when in El Paso on business.This Marriott was very nice! I booked my trip through Priceline and paid about $60 a room!! The rooms were very nicely updated, and a good size. Would definitely recommend this hotel, and wouldn't mind staying here again.Pros *Complimentary airport shuttle*Excellent customer service*Great restaurant inside hotel*Very comfortable bedCons;*Definitely an older hotel in need of an upgrade. My room upon entering smelled old and musty.*Teeny tiny bathroom *$13 for wifi? I have stayed in Holiday Inn Express hotels with free wireless!*$15 for breakfast? Again, hotels that are supposed to be levels beneath the Marriott offer free breakfast I am not a cheap skate.. I just expect more from the Marriott. There is a certain standard I expect, and it definitely was not met. FYI i had a double queen room.I would not stay here again.This hotel has all the great Marriott Service you would expect from a full service Marriott, however, we found it unsuitable for our weekend stay and checked out early.  The biggest reason we booked this hotel was the warm swimming pool.  I have been staying at this hotel for about 25 years and the pool was always bath water warm.  On my last stay, the pool was much colder, but swimmable.  On this stay, the water was so cold none of use elected to get in.  Also, the hot tub has been removed.  Since swimming was our number one goal, we checked out the first thing the next morning.  This hotel is perfect for airline employees looking for a quiet place to sleep who are not on a budget.  The restaurant is good, but not as great as it used to be - everything tastes like it comes out of prepackaged containers - e.g. biscuits and gravy, potatoes, etc.  I remember when this Marriott restaurant made hash browns fresh - from real, fresh potatoes and oil!  And the biscuits and gravy used to taste home made.  Overall, the restaurant is pretty good, though.I very much enjoyed my stay in this hotel - friendly, acommodating staff; large, comfortable room.This hotel is right outside the entrance to the airport, and I never heard a plane.  Refrigerators are available on a limited basis, and I was able to get one (I drove from home to El Paso so had food with me).  The ""jack pack"" is great!There's a charge for wifi! Fortunately my iPhone had excellent access to AT&amp;T's 4G network so that I didn't need the hotel's wifi.  It always surprises and annoys me when I stay at a motel or hotel that still charges for Internet access.  The bathroom doesn't vent moisture.  To summarize - I would gladly stay at this hotel whenever I visited El Paso.Either this, the Doubletree, or the Hilton Garden are the best hotels in El Paso (which doesn't mean they are great, they are just the best available options). At the moment I prefer this Marriott because its location by the airport is most convenient for my purposes and it has a bigger and better lounge area. Definitely try to get the concierge floor if you stay here because then you can have free drinks/snacks and breakfast. The rooms aren't fancy but they are fine, and the bedding is comfy. CAVEAT: this hotel is basically a miiltary base/traveling man hotel (like, fighters at the airbase are literally flying in here just to fly to Colombia on drug war runs in five hours) so if you are a woman and you sit at the bar you will be tactically engaged. Some of the military guys can be cute though so it may not be a problem but as an earlier Yelp reviewer said, they are all married. Caveat emptor.Nicely maintained hotel.  I stayed here for one night and didn't eat, use the gym or watch TV.I did use the wireless internet and it is fast.  I had a first floor room and it was quiet!  I was expecting a lot of foot traffic to make noise but it didn't happen.  There are a few fee options for internet service depending on how long the stay is.  Since I was there for only one night, I chose the option that ends at noon the next day, versus the 24-hour option.  Saved $3, but most hotels that charge don't have that option so it was nice to see.There is plenty of parking and I was able to park very close to the door near my room.  My room was clean, the bathroom is laid out very nicely, with extra towels etc stored in the open on shelves. I chose this hotel based on Yelp! reviews but I noticed that there seem to be a lot of hotels in El Paso, so I might try another hotel next time.","I enjoyed my two night stay at the El Paso Marriott.  As others have noted, the rooms are probably due for a remodel and the bathrooms are pretty small.  However, the customer service at this hotel is the highlight.  The employees go out of their way to make you feel welcome and provide all the information you need to make your stay a comfortable and enjoyable one.  I was extremely impressed with Sam, the front desk staff member who checked me in.  She didn't leave a stone unturned, as far as giving me all the vitals.  Her enthusiasm and professionalism were much appreciated and set the tone for my stay!My family and I stayed here this past weekend when my brother-in-law returned from Afghanistan.  My husband calls it the ""stinky hotel"" because there is definitely a distinct funky odor in the rooms (perhaps a ""Febreze"" sort of spray that they seem to douse everything with?).  That being said, the staff and service where great!  We literally didn't leave the hotel bar/lounge the entire weekend and were treated very well...they even hung our ""Welcome Home"" banner up in the lobby for our soldier...WOW!  The buffet breakfast was pretty good (for a buffet...and I don't usually DO buffets), but I ordered an egg-white omelet topped with salsa each morning and was pleasantly surprised at how fresh and flavorful the ingredients were. And a big YAY for good salsa and strong coffee...I didn't even have to find a Starbucks for my caffeine :)Well fool me once shame on you.. fool me twice well shame on me...Seems like my first review was deleted not filtered.. Unless you are a Marriott awards freak I would recommend you stay elsewhere when visiting El Paso.On my first business trip I stayed here and my room was just beat, service in the bar was terrible..Food not so good.. I did receive a nice letter from them sooo I went back... Well on this trip I asked for a quiet room as I had very early client meetings on both days... My room was fine overlooked the pool upper floor no problems...... At 4:40 iAM the Marshall College basketball team was up and ready to check out... Yes they were staying on my floor.. not a big deal but at 4:30AM they are yelling in the hallways let's go..get up..bus is leaving and pounding on doors.. When I appeared asking if they needed to get everyone up one of their coaches said that they were told that they had the entire section of this floor..........Downstairs the poor night clerk got an earful about me being an upper tier member... requesting a quiet room.... and so forth.. I felt bad about it as it was not her fault but c'mon... The front desk manager who checked me in was scheduled to be on duty that day so I requested a meeting with her... I also sent an e-mail to their customer service group.Well, that evening when I returned my room was changed, clothes moved, provided with an formal apology by the manager, and given a nice basket of wine and peanuts, and a Comp for the previous night...... Great gesture on their part, appreciated the effort... But twice is enough. I'll be back in EP this summer and I will not be returning to the Marriott.The conference and common areas of this Marriott exceeded my expectations (which btw are El Paso expectations so its not the same kind of 4 stars you give to a hotel in cities like Las Vegas, ratings are relative people!).  The conference rooms and banquet halls are spacious and in top shape, we had no technical issues, the facilities are clean, and the staff was super nice and friendly.Nice lobby, friendly staff however the place is a little dated and the price is generally high. Especially for el paso! Way over priced compared to other hotels in the area. Not sure why they command such a premium, as a platinum Marriott member i would pass on this dated hotel.This hotel is always great. The front desk staff are very polite and very nice. The only downside is that the walls are paper thin in the rooms. You can literally hear everything going on in the hallway. And you can even hear the television in the rooms next to you. The bar and lounge in the lobby is very nice and the staff are always very polite and very accommodating.I was only supposed to have a layover in El Paso on my way home to San Antonio, but after my flight was cancelled I had to spend a night. I called at about 12:30 for their 24 hour airport shuttle and it arrived right away. Once arriving the women and the desk were so nice and friendly! The room I stayed in was very comfortable and clean. Not a bad thing I can say about my short stay here.A business hotel is always a good bet for leisure travelers like me. I've stayed here twice and both times have been pleasant. My concierge level rooms were clean and comfy. I would prefer better coffee, but I can get some out easily. Can't beat location: spitting distance to the escape/get me the hell out of here machines (aka airplanes).Underwhelming. Appx 400$ per night for the Jacuzzi suite...loud jets too noisy for comfort...food was average hotel fare...recent lobby renovations not overwhelming but comforts you into feeling that 400$ for the night might just be worth it. lol not so...Dirty, underwhelming. Front desk is always nice. I was walked in on in the middle of the night by a service man who didn't get the room lineup and I was in there as a single woman traveling! Inexcusable. They need to have movies available, which they don't. Room service is overpriced.the hotel itself seems like it was built some decades ago. could use a remodel, maybe some new furniture. my room came without a refrigerator, but that was quickly corrected. the room seemed a little cramped but hey, one person, less than $90 per night on short notice, king size bed, i can't complain.i'd give it a 3/5 because the building seems rundown but this definitely gets a 4, 4.5 if i could. the service and staff easily make it one of the best places i've ever stayed. they called me after i just checked in to ask if everything was all right and then the night before check out if i needed a wake-up or anything else. i live and work on fort bliss but i just had to get away for a weekend, easily more relaxing than if i hadn't. they even let me put my bucket of ice cream in their kitchen freezer, no problem. the pool could use a little more diligence, but after all, it's half-indoor, half-outdoor, stuff's going to come in from the outside. jacuzzi was covered up though.it's definitely worth getting a massage too.one other problem i have is the overpriced room service and food. while pretty good, not really worth it. otherwise, you have chili's, mcdonalds, pizza hut, jack in the box and other places across the street anyway. no big deal.so while the building may seem a bit aged, the service and staff more than make up for it. they really go the extra mile to make sure you're comfortable. i'd definitely check-in for the weekend just to relax, unwind and get away.Absolutely terrible experiences peppered in my 1-2 trips a month for the past two years traveling to El Paso for work, shame on me because I kept staying there for the proximity to the airport and Army post Fort Bliss thinking ""I couldn't possibly have another awful experience at a Marriott, can I ?!""Let's just say that my least favorite experiences have been the clearly unchanged sheets (yes that's right, other person's hair in the bed) multiple times, poor service in response, and after the second time reporting this to the front desk staff they didn't even apologize any more but would just switch me rooms. To their credit, the first time this happened they ""honored"" me with 3,000 points for my disgust and complaints.    I am a Gold level Marriott member (50+ nights per year) and have NEVER experienced such awful conditions or service anywhere else I have stayed.  I finally ended up realizing that this hotel just cannot get it right and as much as I am a self-admitted Marriott rewards point freak, I now stay elsewhere where I am also a loyalty points member and can be sure there won't be hair in my bedsheets OR room service food. Ughh.Stayed on the concierge floor and the room was very nice, comfy set up with lots of amenities. This was a nice place to stay for business and will be a great place for fun as well!Front desk service is exceptional.  Everyone seems eager to help you out.The gym is small, but adequate.  Same can be said for the business center.  The pool, hot tub, and sauna are a real perk after a long day.The rooms are contemporary, but the first floor rooms don't allow you to close the drapes completely.Very close to the airport.The Red Rim Bistro is not so great.  The design is not very inviting and the Sunday Brunch is overpriced for what you're getting.All in all a good hotel.No free internet!  $2 for an hour of internet in your room, and $5 for god knows what in the business center.  I wouldn't really call this a very good business-traveler hotel.  Really weak.Had a great time celebrating New Years Eve until the bar manager told everyone not to throw confetti. Well at midnight someone did. So in the middle of hugs and kisses, the bar manager starts yelling at tables wanting to know who threw the confetti.  So thanks for ruining an otherwise great night.  Next time, ""lighten up Francis"", and let us enjoy New Years the way it's suppose to be.Didn't stay here so I can't rate the service of the Front Desk or the cleanliness of the rooms BUT I did come here for a weekend leadership conference.  I think, out of all my experiences, this has to be the absolute WORST hotel for a conference.  I was forced to endure lunch here and the food was atrociously, horribly, disgustingly bad!  They served us what I think was supposed to Parmesan crusted chicken dish with Penne pasta.  -__-  The chicken was overcooked and the pasta was undercooked....eww.  There was ""cake"" for dessert that looked like it had been sitting out for hours.  The cake part was dry and hard and there was a Strawberry on top that looked dirty and tasted old.When dinner came around, I thought to myself ""Self, there's no way a hotel of the Marriott's stature can screw up two meals in one day.""  I was sooooo wrong!  Dinner was worse!  It was some kind of chicken (again) with a little shredded ""crab meat"" that smelled so strongly of fish that it overpowered the entire dish.Please, I'm begging you.  Don't eat at this hotel under any circumstances!  If you have a choice, go across the street to Denny's because I can guarantee that you'll be more satisfied.In addition to horrendous food, their AV system sucks major monkey gonads.  The staff could not figure out how to reduce feedback from the Mics to save their souls.The rooms were clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. The bed was awesome. I would take the bed (sheets and all) home with me if I could. I didn't eat here so I can't rate the food, but two friends got room service and they seemed to enjoy it. The room was nice and quiet for sleeping. That's really all I needed on this trip to be happy. The major negative that I have is that they charge for internet. So I just used my iphone instead.I really didn't like this Marriott. My room was on the first floor and the patio door was unlocked when I first arrived, the smoke detector had been taken apart, and the deadbolt on the door was non-functional. Umm, safety first, yeah right not here. It was rainingand the hallways near the conference facilities had giant buckets to catch the water leaking from the ceiling. In the hotel restaurant, there was an industrial fan blowing on the carpet, because water had leaked into the restaurant. The restaurant smelled absolutely horrible like a moldy water smell, it was wretched. Really weak internet connection. The staff at the hotel were pretty much unhelpful (except for a server at the restaurant who was really nice). I would not recommend having a conference here or staying here, period. Only plus was a good gym.I really enjoyed my stay at the El Paso Marriott.  The most-striking element about it is that it is located directly across the street from the El Paso Airport, but I never heard a single airplane.  Perhaps I was too exhausted to tell the difference after driving across Texas.  Regardless, this Marriott has already received its linen upgrades, so the beds are super comfortable.Since I stayed here in the middle of my move across the country, I had a Budget Truck full of my worldly possessions parked in the lot.  I was very pleased to find that the truck survived the night in the Marriott lot, instead of disappearing across the border.  Ample free parking and it's safe, too.They also have an in-door/out-door pool and a lounge with karaoke.  There are plenty of restaurants within either a short walk or short drive of the property.It appears they also have frequent e-break weekend rates.  $72 for a night at a Marriott?  That's dirt cheap.  Cheaper than the Fairfields I stayed at on my journey.","I was here last month  for work. I must say I enjoyed it. I got that marriot hotel feel and the room service was on point. I slept like a little baby in the hotel room away from my kids and wife it was peace in el paso,texas.for 2 nights.This hotel is in serious  need of a face lift. The staff does a good job with wht they have to work with,however it appears as though nothing has been updated here since the 80's. Never-the -less I would still recomend staying here as most other hotels in el paso are much worse.",,,"['nicest', 'ever', 'extremely', 'clean', 'service', 'impeccable', 'catering', 'banquet', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-by-hilton-el-paso-downtown-el-paso,DoubleTree by Hilton El Paso Downtown,3.5,$$,44,"I was in town on business and stayed here one night. Despite of some negative reviews are here, they listened and made improvements. My stay here was good and would come back if I come back to El Paso.Check in was smooth, the room I picked from previous night app checkin was available when I arrived. The elevator made some noise which made me a bit nervous but no issues. Carpet in the hallway was clean and modern. My room was spacious, towels they had was standard Doubletree quality I've seen at other Doubletree properties. (I like their towels). They had plenty of electric outlets including a few by the beds. The gym was plenty enough for the hotel. I was there for about 90 mins this morning and most we had in the room at a time was three people. Pool is small but I enjoyed swimming laps for about 30 mins. Outside pool but water was warm enough at 7am in October.  There was no clock nearby, I was going to swim 20 mins but I ended up being there for 30 mins.Breakfast included for Diamond/Gold VIP is now full buffets (they changed one year ago). I enjoyed my usual egg white only veggies omelet. Cleaning staff I encountered in the hallway was very friendly, restaurant staff and front desk staff was very pleasant too. Besides the usual Doubletree pillows I don't like, I enjoyed my stay here.The employees were nice and were quick to respond to any request.The beds were comfy and the pool was maintenance was awesome. We had a patio and watched as they cleaned it, hosed down the concrete and placed towels on the furniture every morning. Impressive as I have seen at any hotel. Cheers for the pool tech!The hotel is well located and easy in and out.The interior is could use an update and the carpets need a massive clean!! Our feet were black when we went barefoot. Ewww!Me living in El Paso and all, you would think I wouldn't spend much time in hotels here and you would be right... sort of. Usually in between moves I find myself staying a week or two (sometimes longer) in a local motel or hotel until my move in date so the gist of what I've learned is: Location, location, location. Doubletree Hotel is in a great location.My boyfriend surprised me with a one day staycation at this particular Hilton and I'm not entirely sure how I'll outdo him for our next staycation during his birthday week. I've stayed in a few Hilton's on various trips and I love how devoted they all are to customer service regardless of if your an HHonors member or not. Doubletree is no exception.When checking in we were promptly handed warm walnut chocolate chip cookies. And I devoured about half. I don't know what it is, but I'm not fond of cookies with nuts or fruits in them... but I they were good cookies, nice and soft. Thinking about it now, I'm sure they also had regular chocolate chip cookies hiding behind the counter somewhere because what do they do for the people with nut allergies? Also worth noting, they have infused water at the front counter. And even though we weren't HHonors members, they put us on the 12th floor which appeared to actually be devoted to member. Sweet! I love that after a certain floor you do need a room key to get to it. It's just a little precautionary procedure that lets me know I won't run into any unsavory characters during my stay.The room we had was a pretty good sized for just a king bed. And that bed... *drool*... it was soooo comfy, the pillows surrounded my head in what can only be described as a marshmallow encasing. Yeah, okay they were down pillows. I know some people like firm pillows, but not me... these pillows were absolutely perfect and I need four of them at home like yesterday. The room had the usual amenities like a coffee maker, hair dryer, hygiene products, and a pretty large tv. Oh and there's free waters in the room... it's the little things. Overall, I was happy with the room and I think this is ideal for both a short or extended stay.As far as the amenities for the hotel itself, they do have a pool and terrace on the seventh floor. The terrace has a few events throughout the year on it, like a Rib Night one night and during the summer they play movies out there. I didn't see an onsite gym (maybe I just missed it), but there's actually quite a few gyms nearby so if you're coming from out of town I'm sure you can find something to your liking. There is a restaurant, bar and cafe inside the Doubletree, but I'm not particularly impressed with Fire or M Cafe so if you're look for a place to eat/drink I recommend Pot Au Feu, Craft &amp; Social, Sparrows, Pint &amp; Peanut, or The Green Ingredient and if you're looking for a place to pick up snacks, toiletries, and the like I'd say just make a trip down to CVS.Because of location and the way they run Doubletree, this is definitely one of your best options when staying in the area. Sure, you can find cheaper, but you get what you pay for.Stayed here last week for a business trip. I didn't eat or drink here, so I cannot speak for that. What I will say is that the bed and pillows were super comfortable!!! The room was also clean. My coworkers did complain about the lack of hot water in the morning, but I shower at night and didn't experience that. The staff was friendly at checkin and checkout. I'd gladly stay here again.Came on business to El Paso. I must say, I was impressed. Normally, hotels do not impress me. This one did. From the free pick up at El Paso Airport, to the ease of check out. The guy who picked me up, forgot his name, was very nice and informative. He even took me to do an errand on the way to the hotel. The room was clean. Only complaint, the noise of the band playing when I was trying to sleep and the train that ran late at night. If I ever come back to El Paso, I recommend this place.This is my second stay and the only place I plan to stay when in El Paso.  The location is great within walking distance to all venues and 20 minute ride to Ft Bliss.  With 17 floors, you will always find a good selection of rooms.  I am able to get Government rate which is not always the case with Hilton in other cities.  If possible, recommend getting a room with a window facing south so that you view the Mexican border from a high floor.Not a bad spot. Just about a block out of the district.  The room was nice and I had no issues with noise or the facilities. The gym was decent and the pool is heated during the cooler months. There is some construction going on but I was up and out before it bothered me.I am a critic, have very high standards, and I have found a few things to complement in El Paso in general. But the staff at the Doubletree Hotel is absolutely amazing. They went above and beyond with every single request that we had, and sometimes we didn't even have to ask!Do to unforeseen circumstances, we had many requests that asked them  to go above and beyond... From the front desk staff, to the waitstaff in the restaurant, to the housekeeping staff... They all cheerfully helped us any way they could. My daughter's actual comment was, ""when did the people of El Paso get to be so nice?"" Keep it up!! Without question, this will be the place I stay if/when I ever return El Paso.Over priced, but for what else you have to choose from in the area well worth it.  The customer service is a step above, but the rooms and accommodations need a little more attention if you ask me.  If you are paying over $290 a night you should have light covers on all lights and the carpet should be fresh.Weary of spending the night in El Paso as we passed through on our cross country trip to LA, we booked to spend the night here. So glad we did! The rooms were clean, gorgeous, comfy! The Buffett breakfast was delicious, plentiful &amp; the waitstaff was beyond hospitable! The cucumber water on the lobby is a nice touch, as are the cookies! I don't think I'll be back in El Paso anytime soon, but if so, I'd stay here!Dear Hilton ManagementPlease check room 710This was my third time at this hotel, I have loyalty with hilton. 1. Room smelt of strong chemical when checking in. 2. Towels are old and completely chemical spoilt. 3. Low water pressure and could not get the shower to be warm enough. 4. Air conditioning fan is so loud. 5. Beds poorly made and pillows were uncomfortable. 6. I did not feel the room was clean. 7. Cannot open a window there. 8. No comp water in the room. 9. Checkin in process was fine. 10. Restaurant and bar are just horrible. No atmosphere and dated. 11. Gym is standard. 12. Did not and would not use the pool due to my fear of hygiene and chemicals used .Couldn't sleep at all in double tree hotel, I  stayed one night here.All night long, I heard shower using and bathroom flushing from other room, (not only one room) it could be upstair or next room or next next room..  it's all over I heard water running, all night long... I was miserable, so tired can't sleep.  The wall is very thin for sure, or flushing systems is way too strong..Sounds like all guest room pipe  connected to each other room. I asked wake up all at 8 am, I got wake up call at 8:45 am. I already awake, but if I am not..?It's not reliable.The hotel was new,  so nice and clean but I am not coming back to stay another night to wake up all night long...Whenever I am in El Paso, I try to stay here.  Needless to say, I have stayed here few times.  It is in downtown and close to many restaurants and is close to work.Sometimes, finding a parking spot can be challenging inside the garage, especially when there is a function going on at the hotel.  The staff here are really great as they are all very helpful and friendly.  The breakfast bar is adequate with a chef available to make an omelet for you.The only drawback is the business center setup with the printer.  I have gone there on several occasions to print a document and was not able to do that.  There is no option to print a document with their current setup.  I had to go to the front desk for a print.  But, that just gives me an excuse to get couple of the warm cookies they are so famous for.This was my first ever trip to the Lone Star state and I was lucky enough to get to spend the weekend in the fine city of El Paso... sister city to Jaurez, Mexico. Don't laugh. I had a really rockin' time in El Paso and I'm hella excited for semi-frequent future visits. I'll be real, when I first Googled El Paso, knowing that I'd be traveling there for work, and I kept getting redirected to sites telling me about the women murders and disfigurement in Juarez, Mexico, a part of me had to wonder if they really wanted me to come back. But after further research I found out that El Paso is actually the safest big city (population over 500,000) in America, and since I was coming from the city with the highest number of murders in it in 2013, I figured, it can't be worse than Chicago. Plus, I was told that as long as I'm not within ""shooting distance"" from the Jaurez border, that I'd be fine. **Cut to me Googling how far ""shooting distance"" is.**Spoiler alert: I survived El Paso.  Correction, I survived El Paso and I f*cking loved it! Sunny, warm, safe as far as I could tell, and some crazy nice people. Honestly, I don't know why the Midwest has a rep for being full of friendly people, because I think Texas absolutely takes the cake. They make us midwesterers look like a buncha jerks. I spent all of 3 days in El Paso and I stayed at this city center Doubletree for all of it. Fun fact: This is actually the second most expensive hotel in El Paso... pretty swanky, huh? I've never even stayed in the 14th nicest anything, and now I'm staying here? How'd that happen? Well, I'll tell ya. It's because even one night at the second most expensive hotel in El Paso (on a weekend, no less) was only $79 a night. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?! And not even joking with you, it was above and beyond the best and most customer service-oriented hotel I've ever stayed at. Free shuttle to and from the airport. Free shuttle to anywhere within a 3-mile radius of the hotel (excluding Jaurez). Free WARM chocolate chip cookie at check-in... or anytime you just ask for it, as I found out and definitely abused. It's very possible that I ate more than $79 worth of cookies on my stay, so I basically stayed for free. Oh, and they have free green apples and cucumber water in the afternoons. What do they have in the morning? F*ck if I know. I was sleeping... in their mega comfortable bed with feather pillows. FEATHER PILLOWS. Heck, to make an even clearer example of how much of a luxury this whole pillow experience was, someone just had to tell me that they aren't called 'feather pillows', they're called 'down pillows'. Pardon me and my blue collar. The bathroom was big, the tub was extra big, they gave plenty of towels and some pretty rad toiletries. Their wake up call was right on time and every staff member, particularly the shuttle drive (big ups, Mario) were impressively accommodating and welcoming. If you do happen to drive, parking here in their lot is free, and they have a restaurant/bar in house, a just-okay cafe, an outdoor rooftop bar and a heated outdoor rooftop pool. I seriously wanted to cry when it came time for me to leave. As I checked out, I def had the urge to go a-wall and scream, 'you can have the key-card when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!' But I didn't because everyone who works here is just too nice to do any kind of yelling at. I don't know when my next trip to El Paso will be, but I know I'll be staying here from now on. PS- They've got cable AND Showtime!I had my wedding at the DoubleTree this summer. Everything turned out great! Ernie was incredibly easy to work with while planning the event. He is reliable and professional. The hotel was accommodating, and the guests enjoyed their stay. It was nice being able to hang out with all of our family and friends on the 7th floor and in the hotel restaurant/bar (the host in the restaurant was awesome!). The food at the wedding was delicious. You also can't beat the view!I'm in El Paso on business three to five times a year - and this is the hotel I always stay in.  Very nice - I've always had a solid experience each time.  Only minor issues with maintenance (the carpet in my room was tattered one time) and general repair (the grout in the bathtub could use some touching up) but in general, it's nice.  The warm chocolate chip cookie when you check in is always a nice touch and the lobby is very well done.  I haven't eaten in the on site restaurant yet - but I may just do that next time.  I'm definitely a repeat guest.HORRIBLE Hilton Property.. The towels are at least 20 years old. Thread bare. When I arrived on my floor (16th) as a Diamond Member with over 110 nights this year alone..I was greeted by an open party and drunkenness.  I called the front desk.. They said...It will end soon.  Note. This was 11pm.  Now tonight..live dance music overhead and stomping people. When I call.. they say ""if you paid, we can refund. If your company did, we will give you points.""  So...apparently sleep isn't expected at this hotel. Just gimmicks.  Don't stay here.  Hilton. Fire the GM. Not for the poor planning of the party. That might be profitable. For your ridiculously poor attempt at customer service. Unacceptable.  Be warned. This hotel sucks.*UPDATE* After SPECIFICALLY requesting a call from the GM and the Diamond desk emailing and asking for the same....I received a voicemail from the ""front desk manager"" saying the GM had emailed him and asked him to call and offer me either 30k points or a refund on one night.  The same thing I had been promised the night before. No call. This GM didn't even have the common courtesy to call a very loyal Hilton customer who has spends over a third of the year in Hilton properties to discuss the fact I hadn't been able to sleep for two nights in his property due to excessive noise and an unwillingness to enforce policy.  In my experience...a manager who is unwilling to call a customer is indicative of a business that is destined to fail.  I'd stay away y'all.This place was terrible.  47 day reservation and they didn't lift a finger for an entire group of us.  47 day reservation and they took 2 weeks to even get us rooms with refrigerators.  Additionally, when we expressed our disappointment, we ended up having our breakfasts that had been complimentary somehow downgraded which even if we were getting something that was not arranged, probably should have stayed as they were in order to avoid us feeling like the hotel was retaliating against us for complaining. Other issues experienced by our group were extended TV outages, parking shortages, repeated key card failures, and billing anomalies. When the stay was complete (we left early because of the conditions) we did complain to them through their proper channels (Hilton, Hilton Honors and Doubletree management) and heard nothing back. Ironically, this yelp review actually got them to reach out to me. They do not care about their guests until they get to Yelp I guess.Much better than the doubletree in California  that we stayed at last. It was a nice room overlooking the pool and had a great view of the ballpark down the street. Was a little concerned about the parking because I heard that many cars had been broken into them or stripped down and left on bricks. Fortunately nothing like that happened to us.The hotel itself seems nice enough however, we went for Easter buffet today and boy do I feel RIPPED OFF!   The room was nicely decorated but the food was pretty awful.  The mimosas were warm, with really cheap champagne which left an aftertaste.  The beef was over cooked and despite the hint of garlic was bland.  The sides were cold!  Cold potatoes, vegetables, pasta etc., is very disappointing.  The desserts were even worse.  There was a sparse selection, the pies were warm and did not appear to be made by a professional baker.  And all for $34 per person.  Not exactly a meal to remember other than to remind me never to return.  What a waste of my hard earned dollars.  It was as if the 2:00 seating got the leftovers from the 11:00 am seating.  So there you have it.  At least they didn't charge for parking.","Hi Eric, It will not allow me to message you back can you please advise me of the email address I should be using? Thank you.Only here just to sleep, but warm cookie on greeting and friendly staff made it nice.   Went off site to eat in authentic Mexican restaurant, so didn't take advantage of the dining.  We thought the room was very nice, as was the lobby, and the staff were all very friendly.  We would stay here again.  A welcome oasis in the squalor of El Paso.  Not city I would want to visit again other than to sleep here.check- in and reservation were flawless and easy.  Stayed in room 1220 on 6/24 ,  it's a shame that when you pay 222 dollars for one night you don't receive complimentary breakfast in the morning.  The  shower was a major let down in that the shower head was pathetic, either a trickle or a 3 painfully strong  and thin blasting jets that hurt .  I also found the water to be not very hot, seemed like my shower wasn't ever able to get to the temperature I like.  Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, hotel was clean, bed was very comfortable.  Swimming pool was a letdown due to dirt blowing around and no hot tub.A very nice hotel in El Paso.  The rooms are very nice and the staff is fantastic. As a Hilton Diamond member, I have to say that the bed is one of the best hotel beds I've ever slept in. The only drawback to this hotel is the Internet.  It's extremely slow.  If you're here for work and will need to use your computer, I'd suggest either of the Hilton Garden Inns.  They are nice and have way better Internet access.Stayed here for a week because I couldn't' get into a Marriott hotel.  Maybe that was a good thing as this place was fantastic all the way around.Free parking, shuttle, newspapers and wi-fi. A nice, warm cookie at check-in. How can you beat that?The shuttle driver brought a small group of us to a local eatery he recommended (see my review for L&amp;J Cafe) and it could not have been better! The driver was a super nice guy and kind of set the tone for the El Paso DoubleTree experience.I didn't try the bar/restaurant downstairs, but it looked nice.The rooms were modern, comfortable and spacious. No complaints at all.Every interaction with the staff went well and I could see that service is at he top of their list.This is a place I would definitely stay at again, whether in El Paso or in other locations.May I have another cookie?Watch out Hilton Honour Diamond members, you are only entitled to a continental breakfast. To upgrade to a full breakfast including cook to order eggs is another $5.00. And they wanted additional money if you order orange juice, and who knows what else you need to pay extra. The hot food section was luke warm, sausage was downright cold. Oatmeal was watery and eats like soup. My waiter Marcus was excellent, very attentive and great service.There was no cold water at 1am after my workout in the gym. Couldn't take a shower as the water from both taps was scalding hot. Very inconvenient.Just re-read this review and forgot to come back to mention that the hotel absolutely made the situation right. When we returned home, we sent an e-mail to management describing our experience at the this hotel (not asking for a refund but rather an FYU kind of thing) and received a full refund for the stay, no questions asked. Management was very responsive and certainly listens to their guests!Nice hotel.  Stayed for 4 days and would definitely stay again.  Restaurant was ok.  No complimentary breakfast but I knew that when I booked.  The cafe downstairs was over priced and coffee wasn't good.The staff was friendly and the rooms were nice. It's a hotel. The internet service was very slow. Good thing it's free. I was glad for the high shower head (I'm 6-foot, 4-inches), but surprised the water wasn't boil-my-skin hot. Speaking of height...the parking garage has really low celiings. Careful driving a tall vehicle.I was attending an event at the conference center, so the hotel is close enough that I could walk. There's a bar and restaurant in the hotel. There isn't very much seating at the bar itself, so I went wandering around the area to find a bar. Soon, I discovered 4 of the 5 bars in the immediate area were gay bars. I wasn't in the mood to convert a lesbian, so I stopped at Soho for a couple drinks. This is an okay hotel. If you're looking for some night life, I suggest going elsewhere. If you're doing business downtown, it's a good place.Pros:-Nice rooms-Good housekeeping-Cookies-Nice StaffCons:-Old (you can tell it was a very old building they tried to make nice)-Parking is awful!! small spots in a tiny garage that fills upI stayed here with my boyfriend after we attended an event with his medical school. The room was very nice, clean, and had a great view of El Paso. The bathroom was large and also very clean, but the shower didn't drain at all when we first went to use it. It was eventually fixed and this was the only hiccup we encountered. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and assisted us with a few questions that we had. Our room did not have a mini-fridge, which we thought was a little strange, but overall our experience was positive and we would definitely stay there again. P.S. Be sure to ask for the cookies.After traveling to El Paso for rock climbing the past few years, we've determined that the Doubletree in downtown is probably the finest El Paso has to offer.  We stayed in other hotels in town and found them to be pretty run down. This one is relatively brand new - built in 2008.  They have a coffee bar downstairs that is not an official Starbucks but serves it and does its best to replicate it, making lattes and other drinks.  They also have a decent restaurant called Fire.  All the staff, front desk, housekeeping, everyone, is extremely nice.  They are pretty liberal with the Doubletree cookies, if that is your thing.  The rooms are also very nice with large flat screen TVs and nice amenities, such as Neutrogena toiletries and good in-room coffeemaker. The rooms have recycle bins, which are a nice touch.  Instead of the traditional artwork, photos of El Paso are mounted on the walls.  Which basically means a picture of statue and a picture of traffic crossing the border into El Paso.  The bathroom is small, like most hotel bathrooms, but they try to maximize counter space by making the top of the toilet tank flat.  For what its worth.The fitness room on the 7th floor is small but nice.  It is called a ""Motion Center"" so make sure you follow the signs for that.  There are two treadmills, two elliptical machines, and a bike.  All the cardio machines are new and come with individual Cardio Theater TVs.  The ""Motion Center"" has a basket of headphones for people to use with the Cardio Theater.  There is also a TV mounted on the wall with a remote. The ceiling in the ""Motion Center"" is super low so I expect that if you are around 6 feet tall using the elliptical is out of the question.  I'm 5'5"" and my head almost touched the ceiling. They also have medicine balls of various weights, two fitness balls, free weights, and a foam roller.  There are small towels and a dispenser for cold and hot water.  Not sure why anyone would want hot water in a gym, but there you go.  The only disappointing thing is that there are absolutely no workout mats.  So bring a big towel down from your room or be prepared to stretch and do situps on a hard, cold floor.  The pool is also on the 7th floor and looks nice.As great as the staff is, I have to knock this place down a star for having a bad, nonsensical design.  Two elevators service both the garage and the rooms.  One elevator only goes to the rooms.  However, you cannot choose which elevator you get.  So if you push the button, wanting to go to the garage, chances are you will get the elevator that does not go there.  You have to keep calling the elevator until you get lucky.  This inevitably messes up the whole elevator system for everyone.  Plus, if you come from the garage or the 7th floor, you have to swipe your key to get to the room floors.  But if you come from the lobby and get the elevator for the rooms, no key swipe required.  It makes no sense and is super annoying. In addition, they do not seem to have a service elevator so be prepared to share the elevator with staff trying to move tables up and down for events.  But they are really nice and apologetic about it.Also, the parking garage is very narrow and poorly designed.  Try to get the smallest rental car possible or expect parking garage aggravation.  Downtown El Paso is pretty empty, especially at night.  One of the reviews says the downtown is revitalized.  It's not.  However, make sure you keep track of the Christmas tree lighting downtown and avoid booking a room or coming downtown during that event.  Apparently, it is the biggest thing in El Paso and it took us forever to get back to our hotel room.  The exit was backed up onto the freeway and everything.  Other than that, traffic is sparse and there is nothing much to visit within walking distance (unless you like rundown libraries) so be prepared to drive to the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) area or somewhere else for entertainment.  All in all, if your travels lead you to El Paso, the Doubletree downtown is probably the place to stay.  A little pricey at $129/night but worth it if you are looking for a comfortable, nice hotel.Not a good experience.  I travel weekly across 6 states and often at a Hilton properties.  Zero customer service across the 2 day stay.  Tv broke and had to move rooms.  No apologizes or even pts given for having to move rooms and floors....spg would have done both.  Woke up with awful bite on arm.  Co-worker given better rate and manager would not offer the same even though I'm 2 status levels higher with hh program.  We be traveling to El Paso every other week and will not be staying here again.In my first stay here, I was quite impressed with this hotel for El Paso. The modern rooms include a large flat screen TV, really nice white sheets, terrific down pillows (five of them on my king size bed), and nice fluffy towels made me happy as I was there for an entire week. One shortcoming was that the room service menu really was overpriced in my opinion and as a result I didn't order dinner one night due to the cost. Other than that, I look forward to staying here on my next trip to El Paso.The four stars are for likeability. It's not a four star hotel as most people understand that term. The rooms have been updated relatively recently and are decently sized. Like others have said, downtown El Paso is pretty dead after dark, but the hotel is not that far from the UTEP area, and it has a decent restaurant/bar called Fire. It's located close the highway and is easy to get to. The staff was friendly and helpful when I needed them. All in all, it's a good place to stay if you're in or going through El Paso.I liked the hotel, the decor, the big bed, the huge TV and especially the substantial military discount -- it was all very comfortable. What I didn't like: they checked us into some other guys room, then they rechecked him into the same room and he ended up walking in on us....AWKWARD. We had to deal with the front desk trying to get that all situated with the credit cards (front desk was very nice), but they didn't do much to make it up to us and we didn't push it, but it was a hassle. We ate at the hotel restaurant and it was not good at all. I couldn't even eat the rice that came with the ahi because it was so bad. And the beer selection was small and basic - normal for the area, but I expected more from a place that presented itself as upscale. The worst part was the cleaning staff knocked on our room every morning at 9 am over and over, even when we loudly yelled ""no thanks"". On the other hand, we forgot to put up the ""do not disturb"" sign, but having to yell over and over at 9 am when you are trying to sleep in is rather annoying. All of that being said, I would stay there again.Perfect location for anywhere in the El Paso area.We'll definitely be staying here again! The view of EP/Juarez was amazing from our room. I guess you have to be from the area to really appreciate it. King size bed, most comfortable bed I've slept on in a LONG time. Flat screen TV, didn't watch much of it but what I did I enjoyed. The room was super clean, very up to date. The staff was very nice, the cookies at check in were delicious, and it was nice to have our own little coffee machine in our room. The location is great, right in the central/downtown area.... for those who complain about the ""nightlife"" you should have googled or yelped the area. Yes, the majority of the nightlife downtown is gay, however Cincinnati Street is literally 5 minutes up the street and there are numerous bars there. Don't expect much from El Paso, it's what you make of it. However, rating the hotel and the hotel only... I will admit I was impressed. I can't wait to go back!Excellent hotel with may common features.  Great staff.  Good facilities.I love the Double tree hotel! Though I have never had a room at the El Paso location, I eat at the restaurant on the 1st floor. The food is super yummy and the customer service is generally exceptional. There is also a pool and sun terrace its a great place to relax and read a magazine! The cookies are also Delicious!","I have stayed here every time I have visited El Paso due to its proximity to City Hall.  It is close to the airport and they have a shuttle.  The pool was nice on the 7th floor and the room is always clean.  I like the Crab tree and Evelyn soaps and lotions.  I have two pet peeves though, the inability to send emails out on their server and the lack of a fridge in the room.Nice place however seems very noisy. Heard it every time my neighbor flushed the toilet. Heard my neighbors plain as day talking through the A/C vent in the bathroom.Update:  I stayed at the hotel again, this time for business and was again let down.  There was not always hot water, the TV cable did not work, the sink smelled like a sewer and the pool was brown.  The hotel ended up discounting my stay and says the issues have been resolved.  I hope so.Pricey for the quality.  If the quality was on par with other DTs I would rate moderate.The service staff was great.. the management was not the best (see letter below).  But to their credit, the chain did offer me a coupon for one nights stay after I wrote a formal letter.  I suggest staying there but not with a package.  Save the extra cash for a nice bottle of booze or tickets to the Plaza.* The room was nice, though not deluxe if compared to other Double Tree deluxe rooms such as Orlando or Chicago (though to be fair, I was told the hotel only has twin/king rooms, and not deluxe).  Check out was late, as expected.* A bottle of sparkling wine was not waiting upon arrival, and when I inquired several hours later, only red wine was available.  * The hotels special Valentines Day dinner menu looked delicious but did not offer any vegetarian menu items (nor did the manager offer to ask the chef to make a vegetarian dish), forcing my girlfriend and I to run out for takeout.* Breakfast, though very tasty, was only available in the restaurant and not ""in-room"" as advertised by the package.  The manager told me this was ""because we have a full hotel"".Beleive it or not, this is a 50-year old hotel, that was bought by the Doubletree chain and completely remolded, I was told that it was the biggest eye sore of the city for the longest time.  The hote is tastefully decorated with a modern motif, and has three elevators to accomadate you.  The rooms are a little small, but I changed rooms from a king to two queens, and the room was just a little larger.  Not sure, but I think the king rooms face the pool (west), and the double rooms face east, if that matters.  The pool area is nice, although its not really mentioned on their site, so bring a swim suit, and next to the pool they have a bar so you can watch the sunset over Mexico.  The best thing about this hotel is its location! The main library and history museum are across the street and are completely free! Also within walking distance is an Art, and Science Museum, as well as the revitalized downtown area.  Make sure you go to the Plaza theater built in 1912, absolutely beautiful.  No complaints on this hotel except the smaller room...Oh! Parking is free, but the spaces are really small, so drive up to the top where no one parks, then you dont have to worry about it, and theres elevators on all floors anyway.  If you dont rent a car, the hotel has a shuttle, which will take you anywhere within a 3 mile distance for free.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/camino-real-hotel-el-paso,Camino Real Hotel,2.5,$$,67,"This is a 2 star hotel with 4 star dreams. I booked 2 nights at this property with a coupon code on Orbitz, I think, so I ended up paying like $50/night instead of $100. So I was happy with my stay for the price, especially because I was working at the venue right in front of the hotel.The rooms are old and there is wallpaper peeling, among other aged property problems. But none of them affected my sleep. The Internet was pretty unreliable, though.Ya know....hotels really should be about more than fancy chandeliers with grand standing reception halls. Don't get me wrong--this sort of '5 star' decorum is extremely nice to look at and admire. But when the catering tastes somewhat reminiscent of an upscale cafeteria (do those even exist?), it leads one to leave a mixed review. I shall commence to do so now.To be totally honest and upfront, I only ended up here due to a work organized function. The theme was basically a formal dine-in type setting with an open bar, reduced room fair (if we opted to take it), and exclusive paid parking. So I don't know much about the place as an actual hotel, considering I didn't stay in any of the rooms.To the extent that I saw the lobby, restrooms, the eloquent bar and huge reception hall....I was honestly impressed. Everything was clean, classy and proper. But as the old saying goes: looks aren't everything. Onto the food and drinks...or should I say *drink*...singular.I ordered a wine from the bar. Cabernet. Considering how common the brand is, it was horribly overpriced. Now, I rarely lament about the price of anything, as mentioned in another one of my earlier reviews. $11 for wine that pretty much tasted like house wine is just....*sigh*....it's just pretentious, guys. Ah, well...gotta pay for those fancy chandeliers somehow, amirite??Finally, we come to the fine dining. Which was...anything but fine dining. Ugh! Let's get this over with, shall we?Of COURSE, my company played it safe by only ordering two choices for the guests: chicken/beef or a vegetarian plate. Since I obviously am not a vegetarian, we'll discuss the chicken and beef plate I had.I need to clarify that I'm not entirely sure if this is routine of the hotel's in-house menu. I noticed a restaurant type deal next to the bar when I walked in. Near as I can figure, this is but a small portion of their catering menu for large parties such as the formal one I attended. Operating under that logic, I can aptly say this dish was...rather mediocre for the type of place we were sitting in.The beef looked like imitation pot roast which was not done very well. Let me put it this way: every single plate I took a glance at around my table had their respective piece of meat cooked all sorts of different temperatures. Keep in mind: none of us got to request any particular way we wanted our meat done. Under these circumstances, a place would cook the beef medium just to play it safe and attempt to please both sides of the house. What we had here...was beef ranging from medium to well done like a shoe. It didn't matter anyway, because the beef itself was bland. I had to sprinkle (more like pour) salt and pepper on mine to give it flavor AFTER the fact. It was...*aheh*...edible, I guess. By ""edible"" I mean I didn't break my teeth chewing it or anything like that.The roasted potatoes were pretty good. Also needed some love from our friends, salt and pepper. Not much I can say about that.The chicken was rather interesting. First of all, they attempted to get fancy with a ricotta filled chicken recipe. I honestly liked it, but it was far from perfect. Whilst the chicken breast itself was cooked just fine, the ricotta cheese was bland and could have also used some intense therapy from Professor Salt &amp; Pepper (notice a pattern here yet?). It's always tragic when the kitchen fears using too much or...ANY seasoning on their food. But the good news is that this particular dish gave me inspiration to make the same thing at home, only better.As I said in the beginning, I can't rate the rooms because I didn't stay in one. But assuming what I ate is a representation of their catering menu, I can say it was...okay. Nothing special or spectacularly horrible. Just okay. However, considering most of us paid between $30 to $40 a head, that's abysmal.Surprised at the negative reviews here, but I guess I was lucky - after I and other guest complained about an out of control party down the hall, the manager upgraded me to a large and quiet suite on the top floor. I liked the fact the management took control of a situation and worked to remedy it. The hotel rooms are admittedly old and tired-looking, but the hotel is right downtown and my room was only $95 for the night. Reviewers have griped that guests had to pay for parking, but it was only $6 a night. Desk staff forgot my wake-up call.Worst hotel ever. I travel for a living and they should shut this hotel down. It's filthy &amp; the staff is rude. It smells &amp; the bathrooms haven't been updated since it opened. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!0 starsAll beds are full size even when they 'upgrade' you to a queen.Overall-Out of date, dirty, gross, creepy-and that's putting it mildly.Hint-steer clear(great restaurant$$$ next door though)The hotel was in an excellent location. We were in town working a show at the theater next door. The staff was really friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself could probably be considered an antique or perhaps a landmark in El Paso. The rooms have older electronics and classic wallpaper, which in some areas looked to be peeling from the wall. The bathroom was pretty big. For the $50 price tag we paid, I can't complain...But I can't say I was wowed by the room either. 3 Stars cause it's A-OK. I'd probably stay here again, if I could get the same price.My coworkers and I were booked here for business for the week. We checked in this afternoon and immediately started looking for another hotel. Mold growing in the shower, carpets stank, old lumpy mattresses. Don't stay here.This place was rated a 4.5 stars on Hotwire and in reality, it's a 2 stars.Everything is out dated. From the T.V. to the clock radio and the furniture. No microwave and for the size of the room, it could use a couch. Very disappointed. To top it off, we came and checked in on a Sunday and no where to eat a decent meal. Everything is closed. Not doing it again. Do your homework when searching for a good place to stay in.I like the renovated bar, a bit expensive but worth the old time experience. The actual rooms needs a little bit of an upgrade.  The place is clean and I have not had any problems with the staff. The people giving this place a crappie review are stuck up kids.My wife and I stayed her for our wedding night plus another night. I knew from reviews that the hotel wasn't in the best of shape and my expectations were met. The hotel is dated but its historical so it kinda might be going for that feel. The room we had was on the bigger side compared to most hotels. I was a little disappointed to find no mini-fridge in our room as well as a TV from the 90's. The place could be quite the place to stay if it were updated a little with little commodities such as a flat screen TV. The staff weren't particularly hospitable or rude except for the bar tender who was working his first night. He was great to talk with and conversed with us making us feel welcomed. The bar was a bit pricey though. We were surprised by a 53 dollar bill for six drinks that were decent but not amazing.We checked in Saturday Night.  We left a VM with Housekeeping for 2 extra pillows as we suffer severe knee and back pain.  Two hours later after dinner, we called Front Desk asking where the pillows are.  Finally, three hours after that I go down to Front Desk and tell them my issue.  They were planning on calling to have pillows delivered.  I said, ""No.  I want the pillows handed to me and I will wait right here for them.""We were here for the USBC Open Championship.  Breakfast came with the reservation.  Scrambled eggs were not real; tasted powdery.  Fruit fresh one day and from can the next day.Service at bar was slow, unattentive and ignorant.  USBC Bowlers provided laminated All Day/Night Happy Hour for the below.  No where does it particularly say Spirits is for Well Spirits.  I pointed that out to Bartender and she refused to abide by the Marketing Printout.  CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT???One night a few girls ran in chased buy another woman.  One of them was the bartender.  UNPROFESSIONAL and NOTICEABLY DRINKING!!!STAY AT DOUBLETREE OR ANYWHERE ELSE!!!NOT WORTH $109.00 PER DAY!!!OVERALL  OVERPRICED  UNPROFESSIONAL  POOR SERVICEThis is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. In town for work and wanted something downtown. This place needs EVERYTHING upgraded. My room is stuffy and smells horrible! Windows won't open. The TV is from the 80's, the bathroom might be from the 70's, and the carpet from the same era. Disgusting!!!! Avoid at all costs. Looks nice from the outside, but is a complete $&amp;@+hole as far as rooms are concerned. I'm going to have to get drunk just to sleep comfortably.Hotel reminds me of the shinning . It's a historic hotel so it's been around and I had that old smell to it.. While I was sleeping a kept hearing the toilet flush, scared the heck out of . So I kept one eye open all night .  During my shower it sounded like someone was in my room moving stuff around .  I've seen too many ghost movie to stay hear by myself, or even with somebody else ...This hotel is horrendous!  Our day began with check in at 4:30 pm. The young lady never cracked a smile, asked my husband for ID and credit card but then checked us in under someone else's name?!?!?When we proceeded to tell her about her mistake she never apologized. Now let's get to the rooms:  dirty, old, gross and very creepy. The mattress is very old, lumpy and needless to say extremely uncomfortable. Bathroom wallpaper is dirty and peeling off the walls. Walls in the rooms have cracks and are dirty as well. I cannot wait to get out of here tomorrow.I had high hopes for this hotel because it's a historical landmark and the pics on its website make it look very nice. We stayed here the past 2 nights for the USBC Nationals Bowling Championship. I booked the room through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBooking.com&amp;s=1f17c73962f209fbc601da6f961a0a357b5e42154d26d707a45176e07320fbac"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> in Feb (3mo in advance). When I went to check in, it took almost 30mins because they had overbooked and couldn't find my reservation. Melissa at the front desk was nice and changed our room from 2 double beds to one queen which was great for us. That's the only good part. The place is just dirty. You wouldn't know it from the lobby; which is probably the only thing they put money into. On the walk to our room the carpets and walls had marks all over them. Even a giant dirty hand print on one of the doors that was there the entire trip. The floors in our room were dirty too. You could see the dirt on the bathroom floor and feel it was sticky. Every time my baby walked around the carpeted part I had to wash her feet off. The windows were so dirty you could write on them with your finger. Our ancient TV was the worst quality image I've seen in years and we had to switch where it was plugged in to get it to turn on. The beds are hard as rocks. Hopefully they were cleaner than the floors. The ice machine on our floor (4) was broken. It took the shower 15mins to warm up; which at that point it wouldn't regulate from boiling hot. And we had to have maintenance come up and unclog the toilet the first time it was used.When we booked the room it said if you paid with a Visa, you got breakfast included in your room ( which I can't believe that for $130/night there isn't a complementary breakfast). When we asked about it on the first morning they said they didn't ""see"" the offer attached to our room so breakfast would be $11/person! We went to The Fountains instead. Our friends did stay for breakfast and said it was awful, same when they tried the restaurant for lunch.I hope USBC Nationals doesn't come back to El Paso. It's a rundown downtown area. But If they do, we won't be returning to this hotel. Although it is across from the convention center, I'll walk from the Double Tree.The hotel is in urgent need of renovation. The electrical outlets were not working properly, the faucet leaks, the carpet is very old and looks dirty. They painted over the wallpaper and is coming off.I heard that they are selling the property and not investing in renovating. Couple of rooms for an important convention were canceled cause they overbooked. The restaurant at the hotel is expensive and mediocre. Internet didn't work, they said because too many people were staying there.They were some dead bugs in the bathroom, it seemed like if they spayed couple of hours before. The double tree is a better option.Disappointed cause the location is great but not worth the $89 a night.In a positive note, the housekeepers are very polite and helpful.Super outdated it has a smell... Just gross. The staff is not very pleasant. The cafe is the absolute worst service! The waitress was no where to be found...after we went to the front desk to ask if it was even open she came out of the back with a man.. Startled. Whatever... That's besides the actual service... It was terrible never offered refills and she could not make it more obvious she was not in the mood to attend anybody. The room... The remote did not work for the 1980's TV, the bed was uncomfortable, the floor was dirty, the bathroom was clean but again...very outdated. I would rather sleep in a tent than pay to sleep here for a night. Oh, and you can't adjust the AC either so the best you can do is complain about EVERYTHING that is wrong with this place and NEVER stay there again.The best thing about this hotel is it's beautiful architecture. Beyond that, thumbs down. My company just held a conference there and the food was mediocre at best. The rooms are very spacious but dated. The showers were cold and bad shower heads. But, this was what threw me over the edge.... I was dead asleep at 10:30PM. A maintenance man let himself into my room yelling ""Hello! Hello!"" I jumped up startled and he stood there asking me if I ordered a remote for the TV. Half asleep I told him no, let him out, and dead bolted the door. I could not believe he came into my room! As a woman traveling alone, this was very concerning to me that this hotel clearly doesn't have a safety protocol for it's guests. The Marriott at the airport is outstanding and they will get my business going forward.What a nightmare of a hotel.  3.5 stars - NOT!  One star at most.Enrique is the GM, and Carmen his asst. was terrible at even keeping her word at returning my calls on-time (3-days late regarding a CB).  I am a man of honour, and this hotel is a disaster awaiting the next unfortunate guest.After having maintenance come to my room 5 times in a 43 hour stay (four times for a 1950's AC unit, and once for a TV that's a dinky CRT w/snow/ghosting all over the screen) - I get offered a FREE BREAKFAST. Seriously.  Last time I will ever stay there.  Please be warned.  Bing Crosby is dead - this is 2015 and in 1950 this hotel was likely top-notch.  But 65 years later, it's outdated; and even worse, the management is so out of touch it's ridiculous.BE WARNED.  I can provide photos, videos, and call logs to document my poor stay and CS experience.  Fortunately, it seems the only rude staff is the upper management.  The maintenance, front-desk staff, and the restaurant/bar (I spent $150 in two nights eating there w/a client) were all great.  The 1950's room, impossible to watch TV and non-functioning AC?  That gets me a free breakfast. Shame on them.  Buyer beware.I would never stay at this hotel again. Front desk was down right rude. They would not let you check in until 3:00 pm whether they had a room or not. I asked if I could check in and pick up my keys later. The women pointed to a card that said check in at 3:00 pm, like I was stupid or could not understand the English language.We also got charged for parking $6.00 a day. We went to dinner and when we came back there was no room in the garage, there was a Streetfest and people attending that parked in the guest garage because no one at the hotel was outside checking guest passes. I mentioned this to the asst manager at the hotel and her comment was yes I already know about it.The sheets on the bed continued to come off so that the bottom sheet was a bunched up. I finally went to the desk and demanded a fitted sheet be placed on our bed. The women just stared at me.One of my biggest pet peeve is to have two people speak in a foreign language when someone is standing at their counter. Never did anyone greet me tell me they were glad I had chosen their hotel. The management needs to be either retrain or replaced. They could care less, worst customer service I've had in a hotel in years.They did not tell me we had a free breakfast with our reservation, I actually learned that from a friend of ours. We were in El Paso because of the USBC tournament, it was a preferred hotel with a discounted rate. We actually had a package via American Express. Shower water pressure was low, TV was old. Hair dryer was one from the 70's. It took forever to dry my hair. This place was bad. When I left I felt like they should be giving me money to stay there.","First of all the ""bell boy"" told me that the McDonalds was two blocks away. This was correct, I'll give him credit for that. However he neglected to tell me that they were not open at 4am. Then when I went back to confront the gentlemen I queried if they had a vending machine. His answer: ""no sir there is not."" Upon waking the next morning I was flabbergasted to see a vending machine not more than 50 strides away from the front desk. He lied to me not once, but twice. The room was very nice though.So disappointed. The hotel was rated a four on Orbitz, but not so.  The beds were horrible, the faucet leaked/couldn't be turned off, the tissue so thin it took three and the room smelled a bit old.  I've stayed in historic hotels before and this one is certainly lacking in panache.  PS. The bird we snuck in; not interested in roosting here again.Old hotel and that was the only good thing about it. Unfriendly staff at the front desk. Very unfriendly staff in the restaurant. Upon checkout I had to argue to get my invoice. On business travel and booked through my company like I do throughout the U.S.  Never had an issue getting my invoice upon check out. Finally gave it to me but something wasn't right with that. Just not a pleasant experience. Won't be coming back.The front desk staff has absolutely no idea how to run a hotel. Very poor customer service.I haven't reached the hotel yet but I am starting to understand why they have such a low rating on Yelp. I called for the shuttle 45 minutes ago and am still waiting while every other hotel in the area has had a shuttle go by at least 4 times. I called to inquire on the status and there is supposedly a traffic jam on the freeway that only affects their shuttle and not the other hotels. Right.Swindlers! Crooks! Booked a queen bedroom online. Got to the hotel and was told that they only have full size bedroom available. When asked why, the guy at the desk rudely asked me to take what's available or leave. Agreed to the full size room. The guy gave me the keys. When I walked into the room; I was astonished!! There was someone else already living there. Thankfully that person was not there and I only saw their luggage etc! Went down and asked the guy what the F was going on here? Same attitude again. He gave me another room, this time a queen ( no idea how the room appeared on his system in 10 mins). I asked the security guy to escort me to the room just in case there was someone already living in this one too. Thankfully this room was unoccupied. What bothered me was that we are not secure in this hotel. Other people had similar stories to tell. Never book a room here. These guys are outright rude and cheats and crooks!!! If you stay here, bolt the room when you sleep because you never know who may walk in on you!Zero stars!!! The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was dirty stinky disgusting! Everything is outdated and doesn't work. Waited 10 minutes for the elevator  elevator! Internet never worked. Nothing was good. Staff does not care! Please NEVER stay at this hotel!!!My boyfriend and I stayed here for one night , we loved the old interior and antique furniture. After all the building was built in 1912 something like that. We ordered room service at 9 and received our meals and cheesecake 25 min later. We loved it , my boyfriend loved the food. our room was very cold , but we found a extra blanket in the night stand. We will defienty be back .This hotel sure has seen better days.  Horrible and rude management and an awful restaurant.  I usually write long detailed reviews and most of my reviews are pleasant as I like to give credit where credit is due, but this establishment deserves none of that.  In short, I was served raw duck, had a dirty room, and waited 40 minutes in the bar before a waitress came over to take my drink order.  20 minutes later she came back with my drink but I had already walked out.  Water glasses had lipstick on them in the rooms.  Carpet was dingy. The only thing nice is the location.  It's close to some great restaurants and a ball park.  But that's about it.  Since then i've stayed at another hotel close by and was much happier.Excellent!  Stayed here many times when visiting. Also stayed here when I lived in El Paso for a night out with my wife.  Old southwestern/mexican decor, spotless!  if your looking for a ultra modern Westin or Marriott look, then this is not for you.  If you looking for beauty character &amp; charm, &amp; cleanliness &amp; a very comfortable bed then look no further.. all for a very reasonable rate.  Dome bar as always was a wonderful experience.  Special thanks to OMAR at check-in.  Omar is so polite, cheerful &amp; accommodating.  He started off my stay on a very positive note.Here bowling Nationals.  Nice old, historic hotel.  Happy with the accommodations/location (though how about upgrading those old TVs to flat screen HD).  However, front desk staff and day management need help when it comes to customer service and overall professionlism.  Total fail in that department.  If you arrive a bit early, don't expect to check in at all.  Weird policy or just laziness by front desk personnel cuz they wouldnt entertain checking anyone in until 3:00...really?  Heck, front desk told us to come back at 2:00 then we did, flat out refused to check us in until 3:00.  Finally, we were almost victims of their bait n switch tactic as they almost didn't honor the complimentary breakfast for the stay package we purchased.  Had to pull it up on the IPad and show the manager their own website who proceeded to call someone and demand it be immediatley removed.   At least they honored it..reluctantly.  Here's the kicker, it was a military/govt package...First. The Camino Real is supposed to be tops in El Paso.  It, at least, has been for ever.  That said, we got a great rate on the executive room package for a Saturday night.  41% off = $90 + taxes and fees.  All said and done, $105.  Perfect for a one night escape for the wife and I from our kids on our fifth anniversary.The room was supposed to come with a king sized bed, a view of the city and access to the executive lounge.  The lounge offered free continental breakfast and free drinks and snacks in the afternoon.  We had a queen bed, the windows were painted shut, and the sink had multiple long, deep cracks running through it.  The shower was cozy, but it needed some minor maintenance and the shower head was placed about a foot too low for a six foot person.  A bit ghetto for a ""luxury"" hotel, but I felt pretty at home. The lounge was a converted room with a few set tables.  On one side was a bar station.  It had one bottle of Chardonnay, vodka, rum, whiskey and bourbon each.  Next to it, a small fridge with a few waters, beers and sodas.  It covered the basics.  On the other side of the room was a snack table.  One quarter section of a club sandwich and a plate of 7 pieces of cut veggies. There was a small bowl of ranch, but no serving utensil.  For breakfast the next morning, all the mischief from the evening before was still out and untouched.  No breakfast...  Called the front desk, no breakfast.  Closed on Sundays.  You can have brunch in the La Huerta restaurant on the first floor.  Except they stopped serving breakfast thirty mins before we called and don't start brunch until thirty mins after.  That tidbit came from the staff in the restaurant after we showed up starving...  So...  All-in-all, our experience was very good.  The room was clean, there were good quality towels, the price was reasonable, and it was quiet.  The staff was polite, if not informative or timely.  This review could have easily been a four, but there were too many little things in the way of that.I'll probably be back the next time my wife and I run away from our kids!I've stayed in plenty of historic hotels, and a certain amount of shabby chic is to be expected. But here, you've got lumpy mattresses, holes in the linens, coffee machines that look vintage (and not a good way) and air conditioning, in certain rooms, that automatically turns itself off after 90 minutes. They are desperately in need of an update. That said, I had a lovely dinner and cocktail in the dome bar. Do that instead of booking a room here.Where to start. Old. Dirty. Bad Mattress. Painted wallpaper. Ancient TV. Horrible restaurant. The desk folks couldn't direct us to a decent Mexican restaurant. This is El Paso!  And I still have to be here for 2 more nights. Sucks.I stayed here not expecting much because of the reviews I saw but it was an excellent place to stay now I also had a corner room with a ton of windows with cool views the only thing that sucked was the shower hence only 4 stars and the tv was a tube tv but that didn't matter much they say the place is haunted but I didn't see anything try it outI give this hotel a five star! Not because it was the most gorgeous and modern hotel but because I was 100% satisfied! If you're looking for something up to date this probably isn't the hotel for you. The room  is filled with antique (old) but cool furniture. Although the bed had a simple old fashioned frame it's so so comfy! And I'm 7 months pregnant so that says a lot! The thermostat is old school but at least it's cold in the room which is great in El Paso! The shower pressure and temperature is wonderful! Our room had a view of the new Chihuahua stadium which was pretty cool since my husband and I love baseball! And make sure you get the package that includes the breakfast buffet! I'm actually eating my breakfast now as I write this review! They have pretty much everything! Eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, waffles, toast, pastries, activia yogurt or plain yogurt, biscuits and gravy, about six different fresh fruits, oatmeal and and a variety of things to add to the oatmeal like almonds, pecans, raisins, granola and a few others. They also had either milk, water, orange juice, apple juice and coffee. Also if you're craving a Mexican breakfast they had refried beans, some type of red juicy meat (which I tried and was really yummy!)When and if a new owner takes over a few things they could update are adding a microwave and refrigerator, some more small towels in the bathrooms, and some detail cleaning on a few of the furniture items (lamps/walls) oh and new shower curtains. Other than that everything is wonderful and I can't wait to stay there again. I definitely recommend it!I got a deal with hotwire $60 or so. Yes it is old, has not been remodeled, the furniture is old and it's not perfectly clean, but it has some El Paso charm to it (i.e.: very friendly people, ready to chat, but not necessarily on top of things). However, service us is substandard, mattress is torn, food is below bad, room service is handled by trainees who do not speak english drop food on the floor when brining them to your room and put it back on the tray, and all that for $28 for pasta with alfredo sauce... Eek!I was there last night with two friends at the Dome Bar for drinks. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the place. The cocktail waitress was extremely inattentive the entire time we were there. She eventually just disappeared completely, and after looking for her for at least 10 minutes so that we could pay our tab and leave, the other waitress informed us that she had gone to a room with an Army gentleman to do, well whatever they were going to do up there. She was finally called to come back down so that we could pay and leave. I have spent many years in the service industry and this is deplorable. I am from Austin and have never before had this negative of an experience. But the unprofessionalism that happened last night makes me question whether or not I will be frequenting the place again.The room rates are cheap and now I know why. I checked into the hotel and my room smelled like smoke. I called the front desk only to get the response that. ""I guess the person in the room before you smoked in there."". You think? Did not offer to change my room because she was ""too busy"" checking in other idiots like me who decided to stay here. Then I thought, ""maybe a good workout to get rid of some stress""....I called the front desk again thinking they might not be so busy now. ""What floor is the fitness center located?"" Their reply, ""Oh, it is closed due to flooding."" Wow! Do you think that might be a good thing to tell guests when they check in? So I asked, ""Any other gyms around that I can go to?"" Their reply, ""No."" This might have been a great hotel back in the 70's, not anymore! Stay some place we they are happy you decided to spend your money there, not here.So disappointing.  Such a beautiful hotel but so dysfunctional.  It is February and the room is sweltering hot and no way to cool it off.  The television doesn't work and the bathroom floor dirty.  What a shame...used to love this hotel...beautiful bar but that doesn't compensate for the other problems.","This hotel has so much potential, but it is severely lacking in the operational department. Dealing with the front desk takes 15-20 minutes, no matter what. Checking in, retrieving checked luggage, asking questions, etc. all took forever. Basically I avoided the front desk at all costs. But when I had to, it was really annoying because there would be people standing in line, and there would be two people working the front desk, and they would be taking care of all sorts of other stuff like telling the maintenance guy to do this or that, talking to other staff/maids, calling the cable guy, etc....all while the line of customers grew longer and longer. Only when everything was taken care of, would they help the customers waiting in line. Seems a little backwards to me. Also found a long curly hair next to my pillow and another one next to the toilet.Bar area is cool, but that's about it. Rest of the hotel needs to be updated. Thermostat/AC system looks like it is from the 70s. Anyway, you get the picture, don't come here.Well, I just took a lukewarm bath.  Poor lightning in the bathroom.  The scale was weigh off, even though it said I was 30 lbs lighter.  The room is spacious, but square.  Definitely old school.  There are security cameras in the garage which is underground (2 levels)Elevators works, but grumble.The front desk clerk (Stormy) is hot, and very efficient.  I did have to prompt her for the wifi password though.I got a great deal, but it seems to me I am paying for the location and amenities more than anything.  The restaurant and bar area are nice.  Restaurant seems to be 4-5 star quality with a brief look through the menu with varying dishes the chef has to offer.  Lobby area is very quaint with high back seats and decor to suit the architecture of the building.Choice is up to each guest for what they are looking for. . .Personally, i wouldn't pay over $75 to stay in this hotel for each night, regardless of location and amenities.Should have read these reviews before coming here. Would agree that the hotel is beautiful, but that only goes so far. When I literally wait 10 minutes for anyone to even answer the phone at the front desk, and even longer (no less than half an hour) for one of the five front desk people to look up and acknowledge the growing check-in line while they do who knows what...paperwork it seemed...entirely backwards, as another commenter said. Rooms are outdated. But my real complaint is staff. Utterly useless.We came in from the Phoenix area for a family gathering and wanted to stay in downtown or the West side.  We have stayed at several area hotels over the years but this was our first time at the Camino Real.  The first thing we observed was the long line at the check-in desk.  Considering most hotel stays are pre-book, the influx of customers shouldn't be a surprised to the hotel.  It took us approximately 30 to 35 minutes to check-in to the hotel even some of the other guests standing behind us in line made comments of how long it was taking and how the hotel should of have more staff.  Another observation was the parking garage, the old rusty pipes were leaking a brown-yellowish liquid which covered our white SUV.  Not knowing what the fluid was or if it was going to be damaging to the paint job, we went to get the car wash. In addition to be travelers we are also business people, one of the amenities we look for in a hotel when we travel is Wi-Fi coverage.  We are not opposed to paying for it if it's a reliable service; however, your hotel advertised Wi-Fi in all the rooms which it was very unstable and very slow which led to many interruptions in service.  This was troublesome since in today's market place Wi-Fi is a mandatory necessity.  We understand that the hotel is older and has a lot of charm and character; however, some updating is needed especially charging 100+ dollars per night like the bathrooms, TV, Decor and Bed Size.  As you know there are usually several options when it comes to selecting a hotel and this hotel in its current condition probably it won't be in at the top of our list.If I could give zero stars I would.This hotel is awful: some elevator buttons don't work, hair dryer buttons didn't work, lobby is a ghost town, meeting room has no writing pads or pens, rock hard chairs in the meeting room, and the rooms need a major overhaul.Just a bad feel, not a place I would ever recommend.Other better options downtown like the Doubletree or even Holiday Inn ExpressDO NOT STAY WORST HOTEL ON THE PLANET. This hotel robbed me. I stayed here on a business trip where the hotel rooms were paid for. I never checked in, I never signed anything. I was handed keys and told to have a nice stay. I paid for room service with my credit card. Two weeks later there is a charge on my card for over 500 dollars for 5 rooms. I don't know how one person can stay in five rooms but there it was. They took my credit card I used to pay for food and applied it to FIVE ROOMS. When I called to ask them what in the Holy fuck was going on I talked to BLAKE, who I'm relatively sure is missing a chromosome, this scholar proceeded to argue with me for an straight hour until he finally admitted that I was NOT the person on the reservation he STILL would not reverse the charge. I was told to find the person on the reservation and take it up with them. So after months of back and forth with banks I won the case easily but I can't get the time and hassle back. FUCK this hotel. If rather stick my dick in a blender than walk on the same street this hotel is on. WAY TO GO BLAKE, morons. Oh and read the fine print where it says this company is a Mexican company and not subject to American laws so good luck with anything of you actually do sign something.I thought the rooms were fine here. Got a special price from <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a>. Too bad that this hotel has an ISSUE with clean rooms. Yes, clean rooms. I was given the key to room 714 and it was left unclean (VERY UNCLEAN) from the last guest. Glasses in the sink, bed unmade and everything else unclean, including newspapers on the floor.  I was then given room 707 and I considered that room to be LIGHTLY UNCLEAN. The prior guest was pretty neat and I decided to sleep in the bed which was unmade but neat. I did not use, the used glasses but I was not concerned about any bad affects from sleeping in the bed. Well, the sheets were dry and not too unkempt. I could have gone to Motel 6 for a few dollars less, or stayed in Juarez (ten blocks away) and probably had a clean room. The other aspects of the hotel were fine, that is why I think they are two stars and not less. I hope that Camino Real gets the message and takes the care that is basic for any hotel/motel, to give guests a clean room.The hotel is old.  Very old.  Service is very slow.  The TVs are old, and while wifi is free, the business center is abysmal.  There is one printer that did not work during my stay.  Downtown was dead and there was absolutely no one in the hotel.  There was no bellman, no one to greet me when I came in.  All in all, such a shame, as it could be wonderful.I love the history of this place. That being said, it is such a waste of a beautiful space. It needs and deserves an appropriate investor (with a team including a savvy interior designer, a restauranteur/sommelier and an event coordinator) to revitalize it to its potential. The Driskill Hotel in Austin or the Paisano in Marfa are perfect examples of well maintained, appropriately furnished historic hotels. Our stay was fine, the service was good (we could never find parking but we were reimbursed).  I am rooting for you, Camino Real.Ambience of hotel is remarkable. Must check out the dome bar!The price was right but over half of the service was poor. I went down for breakfast the first morning to eat the $12.99 buffet. I wanted fruit and oatmeal. The oatmeal wasn't out yet so I got my fruit and waited while I ate. After a while, the manager came out and said they were out of oatmeal. WHAT? On top of that, I told him I specifically wanted oatmeal and didn't feel the Buffett was worth the $12.99. He said he was sorry I felt that way.....no help. The next morning they were out of orange juice. To top it all off, this place hasn't been upgraded in years.....old beds, old t.v.s, old shower heads and bathrooms......and I saw the same food tray someone left in the hallway for 3 days without pick up and nasty dried up food on it.On the brighter side, the bar area was great and the bartenders were the exception to the poorness of the hotel. I had great food experiences at the bar and relaxed time.I wouldn't stay here again, the bar wasn't enough.....It was touted as some fancy schmancy historical place in the heart of downtown El Paso, but it was pretty disappointing. We got rooms for cheap, which is good, but it didn't live up to its reputation. We had 2 rooms; for some reason, the odd # double rooms are way bigger than the even # ones. One room reeked of smoke. The other room's AC was barely functioning although it was at the lowest 50 degrees. Instead, it was a very uncomfortable humid stale air feel. The room also had bugs/roaches. We asked to move to another room the 2nd day and it was an odd # room, so it was much bigger and a functioning AC.Free wifi. Cheap parking. Good location. That's it!We stay here whenever in El Paso.  Old Latin charm, great service, comfy beds,  fresh clean everything.  Downtown near San Jacinto Plaza which was OCCUPIED this last stay.  Enjoyed talking with campers.  Wish we could have taken in the Broadway musical WICKED or visited one of jseveral top MUSEUMS nearby.  Next time.  Loved our dinner under the TIFFANY DOME.  A poblano chile filled with meats and raisins smothered in a walnut cream sauce.  Nice folks at the bar too.  Wish they allowed pets.  All staff most helpful.  Interesting to watch DOWNTOWN El Paso become, . . . .more . . . interesting.  EP is said to be SAFEST city in US.  The architecture at UTEP is BHUTANESQUE.  Excellent museums within.VIVA EL PASO.  Did I mention the big breakfast buffet?This place was so close to good, it really was trying.  The front desk staff were incredibly pleasant and very helpful.  Room was very large, relatively clean though not clean enough in my opinion, outdated, but overall actually a really nice room for the price.  Food was ridiculous - price, quality, it really was not edible.  I appreciated that they tried to have a room set aside for business - if only I could have gotten my computer to hook up to the printer.   I would stay there again though for the price and ease of location.  Definitely scout out somewhere else to eat though.They have really great internet deals, and are apparently not as crowded on the weekend, so rates are cheaper then than during the week.  I spent  about an hour mesmerized by the stained glass dome.  The hotel lobby is absolutely exquisite, and our room was large, roomy, and comfortable.  This place really made my stay in El Paso very pleasant.  Also, did I mention Tom Waits stayed here?  Yeah, he did, and I kept looking for him while riding the elevators and running up and down the stairs, but he was only to remain on the stage for me.Oh, and apparently, the only place in all of downtown El paso to get coffee on a Saturday morning is in the hotel restaurant, and it's almost 3$ for a regular cup of drip.  If you walk around El Paso, you will know you are staying at one of the nicest place around.Plus, did I mention, Tom Waits stayed here?I won't lie. The only reason I made the drive out to El Paso from Arizona was to see Tom Waits. Thanks to the Camino Real, I may return in the near future! My companion and I stayed in one of the Master Suites, and I usually have trouble sleeping away from home---but not this time!  While on the topic of comfort away from home, the hotel staff was extremely attentive, and catered to our every whim--whether it was bringing us a bottle of Jameson with a bucket of ice upon our arrival(I had called in the order from the road when we were 45 minutes out), promptly bringing our late night food orders, or directing us to a local bar with a pool table. A lot of the hotels I've stayed in over the years had a staff that was shockingly indifferent to the needs of guests, but not at the Camino Real!In addition, the hotel was conveniently located across the street from the Plaza Theater. Even though I was running late(I forgot about the time change somewhere in Lordsburg, NM), I was still able to make it to the Tom Waits show on time.Next time I stay, I will have to check out the Dome Bar.Everything is great except for the shower. They need a new shower head. It's like stepping under a knief. Very clean and staff is very  friendly. Great deal for the room. When I return to El Paso I will stay there. It is in walking distance to everything. Shops, diners, and clubs.The looks from the outside can probably tell you how it looks inside. The rooms look pretty old, but I can say they were at least well kept. The price for a room is much lower than the rest of the hotels nearby(which is probably the best thing about this place). The pool on the rooftop is really a good place to relax and unwind, especially at night. This place also offers a little workout station. By request, you may ask for a room that overlooks Juarez, Mexico.We recently stayed a weekend at the newly remodeled Camino Real.  From the minute we walked in we were pleased with our stay.  The people at the front desk were very polite and helpful with a few request that we had.  The room was bigger than we expected, exceptionally clean, and had a great view of the city.  The Dome Bar had a mature crowd with excellent music (band), and a great variety of drinks that were reasonably priced.  The food at Azulejo's Restaurant was delicious!  The service was great and the waiter recommended some great dishes.  Great tourist attractions within walking distance or relax at the rooftop swimming pool that was sparkling blue:)  Had an amazing stay!  Highly recommend this beautiful hotel.This place was pretty in some ways, but overall, it was a dump.  You can maintain the building and update the facilities without losing the historic appeal.  The customer service was absolutely terrible.  The front desk manager, Maria, was apathetic and unwilling to help with anything managerial.  The room smelled bad and was generally dirty.  The food in the restaurant was awful.  The parking garage was a confusing, creepy dungeon of a place with inadequate signage.  I would save the money and stay at a Super 8 next time, honestly.","I stayed here as a result of being overbooked at the Hyatt Place, El Paso.  Hyatt Place could not accomodate me so they sent me here n their dime.  After a long day of travel and having to deal with this new twist, Upon my arrival, I asked for their best suite.  Although they have negotiated rates with the Hyatt, They were able to accomodate my demands.  Next time I am in El Paso, I will definitely stay here.  The room was clean and very spacious.  They can use a little face lift.  The furniture looks like i's been there since the 70's.  Very comfortable though. They were even gracious enough to pay for my valet parking in exchange for my opinion in a survey.I love this place.Patricia G.'s review is right on the mark - the history is fantastic but the hotel rooms are dingy, etc. etc..  I stayed here a few times and for one reason -- the dome in the bar.  The bar is not that great, but the dome is beautiful (if only it was lit better).I actually went last night to see if the bar has improved.  What a mistake.  Some good news first -- the staff was very kind, and our server kept stating that it was ""her pleasure"" to serve our table. Something like this:""Here are your nachos""""Thank you""""Its my pleasure""or""Here is your martini.""""Fantastic, thank you""""Of course, its my pleasure"".or""Here is your check.""""Thank you.""""It has been my pleasure""okay, so maybe she only said it a couple of times, but it still stuck.Anyway, the bartender was also pretty good and the martini was a perfectly dry and neat.The El Paso Nachos sounded like a good idea but left much to be desired.  The cheese was only melted on the top layer of the pile up and the canned jalapenos were, well, canned.  Sigh.  I want the Westin to take it over again.I will preface this with, ""I am one of El Paso's biggest fans."" Really, I am. I love my hometown and hate that I live somewhere else. So, I was completely excited to find a great deal for the Camino Real for a week's stay for the 4th of July holiday. As a kid, I always heard about the Camino Real and its swank interior. I dreamed of being able to stay there and mingle with the many rock stars that stayed there. I'd walked around the lobby before and enjoyed a drink in the Dome Bar, which is really classy looking, so I had high expectations.A little background, the Camino Real Hotel  is located in Downtown El Paso and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A New York Times review says ""formerly known as the Hotel Paso del Norte, the property first opened in 1912, awing guests with its lavish marble and cherrywood lobby under a stunning glass dome from Tiffany's in New York. While the dome remains in place above a splendid bar and fine-dining restaurant, almost everything else has changed in the time since as a result of numerous renovations. In 1986, a modern 17-story tower was built next to the old Paso del Norte, expanding the lobby and more than doubling the hotel's capacity."" The hotel is only a few blocks from one of the city's major bridges leading to Juarez, Mexico and surrounded by many shops that sell clothing and cheap ware. Nearby attractions include the El Paso Convention Center, El Paso Museum of Art, Art Festival Plaza, the Insights Museum of Science, and the Union Train Station. The hotel offers a rooftop pool and a small exercise room. Also offered are conference facilities, room service, handicap facilities, concierge, business center, restaurant, and meeting facilities.With such a storied history, I was giddy as we checked into the hotel, despite the fact that when my fiance and I drove up to the front of the hotel nobody came out to us. ""No biggie,"" I thought, ""we'll just park and then check in ourselves."" The lady who checked us in was sweet and helpful. As we walked through the lobby, we couldn't help but notice the beautiful staircase. ""The rooms must be gorgeous,"" I thought. I was more than disappointed as we walked into the room. Not only was the furniture dated (it seriously looked like they bought the furniture at a yard sale and some of it was peeling, PEELING!), there was not much offered in the way of amenities. I was expecting a little more than this, considering this hotel was supposed to be one of the nicest in town. We only received a small bottle of shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and one bar of soap for the whole FIVE days. Some days we received a shower cap and shoe mitten when we received anything at all -- there were times when the cleaning ladies actually didn't leave any bottles of anything!! And the sink was always on -- it had a leak or something!! The information booklet that was sitting on the table looked like it was printed with the cheapest ink available and didn't actually offer that much information about the city. When we ordered room service one morning, the man on the line kept just trying to get the order instead of answering my questions (for example, he kept saying, ""Okay, you want it with green chile?"" when I was simply asking if the item was made with green chile...arrrgh) and treated me more as a hindrance than as a valued guest. And to top it all off, we didn't even receive complimentary newspapers each morning! I felt like I was staying in a motel with a nice lobby! I was SOOOOOO disappointed. When we did go down to the Dome Bar (which truly is gorgeous), the bartenders ignored us as our glasses stood empty on the bar for quite some time. In fact, they were chatting it up and reading the paper as we waited more than 10 minutes to get another drink (which was terrible). I've been afforded the opportunity to stay in some of the nicest hotels in Texas, and I have to say that I now understand why people groan about El Paso. Is this really the best it has to offer? Do the owners of the Camino Real stay in hotels such as this one and not complain about how cheap it looks? Do they really feel it appropriate to charge such high prices for such minimal service? I think the Days Inn has nicer looking furniture and service that doesn't feel like you are overpaying for it (at least you expect no luxury at such a motel). I was really rooting for the Camino Real, but not anymore.The one upside was that the view from our room was spectacular! We left the curtains open most nights, so we could see all of the lights and see both sides of the border. It was one of the best parts of the stay.With the planned renovation of the Plaza Hotel just a block away, I am hoping the owners of the Camino Real will realize they've got a diamond in the rough and really make an effort to make it shine.I'd recommend the Artisan Hotel over this place in a heartbeat....and I haven't even been there!I love this place. It could definitely stand some updates in the rooms (especially those bathrooms),  but it's clean and if you get the right room, you'll get a fantastic view of the historic plaza area. Of course, having a drink under the famous Tiffany Dome is always a treat. Their customer service is excellent. During my last stay, Osbaldo did everything he could to ensure we were satisfied. I went to him several times with requests and he was able to accommodate me time and time again with a smile on his face. I've only stayed here a couple of times, but I plan to make this my go-to place when visiting. It beats the stress of staying with family.This place was horrible.  My boyfriend and I stayed for two night.  The first night they were out of Bud Light at the bar.  Who runs out of Bud Light?  The following day they forgot room service. ? The also had to turn the water off during the day for several hours without an explanation or apology.  I felt like we were really staying in El Juarez.  We ate at their restaurant which overcooked my food; then they undercooked my friend's fish.  It seemed like a new restaurant although it wasn't.  Then the icing on the cake.  I accidentally left my coat in their armoire (yes, my bad).  We immediately called after checking out and said we would be there in an hour to pick it up.  But in the meantime they accidentally gave it to some random person whom they did not identify.   THEY JUST SIMPLY GAVE MY $600 COACH COAT TO A RANDOM PERSON BY ACCIDENT.  No one contacted me from mangement. No one contacted me with a plan on how to resolve the problem.    In fact, I had to spend three weeks calling (where it would just ring without an answer),  finally leaving messages, and a writing letter before I finally got the GM to respond to me.  I evenually argued my way into a cheap settlement for their mistake. The whole experience was such a DISAPPOINTMENT.This is the only place in El Paso whose website was not in Spanish.  So we stayed here.  The rooms were ok although they completely missed my room service breakfast the next morning even though I ordered at like 9pm.  I guess if you want to be in downtown El Paso, this is right in the middle of downtown El Paso.  We walked to Cafe Central which was a really fantastic dinner.  But yeah, nothing really outrageously good or bad about this place.  Would have given it 3 stars but subtracted one because I wanted my BREAKFAST!  Oh, also, when we were here there was like a women's senior bowling tournament in town and they all stayed here.  It made the bar area a total... rager.This hotel is a very interesting study in contrasts.  The common areas are well-appointed and quite nice - high ceilings, pretty architecture, and one of the most beautiful bar areas that I've ever seen in a hotel, featuring a stunning, large, circular stained glass rotunda.  The food is pretty decent here, too - not bad at all for hotel fare.But the rooms...the rooms!  They are hideously dated and do not appear to have been redone or updated for at least twenty years.  The toilet seat in my room was actually *peeling*, it was so old...the drain in the sink had to be fiddled with constantly - it wouldn't close all the way, then it wouldn't open at all...I had to manually pry it up - the bedspread was this horrible, 80's-era, teal-and-pink-swirls number that completely clashed with the carpeting...not impressed, especially in comparison with the expectations that were raised by the nicer-than-average common areas.  And to top it off, my husband called and was told that they couldn't put me through because I had to ""authorize"" calls to my room.  WTF?  I was there with a large group, and I heard many others express similar impressions about the state of the rooms.  One thing I will say - they were fairly spacious, and the large, wooden armoire in mine was kind of nice.Anyway...I haven't ever stayed anywhere else in El Paso, so don't really have anything to compare it to, but if you're looking for a swanky place to stay, this isn't it...despite what the common areas may lead you to believe.",,"['star', 'hotel', 'star', 'dreams', 'booked', 'nights',
