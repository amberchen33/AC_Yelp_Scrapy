http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-new-albany-new-albany,Hampton Inn New Albany,2.5,$$,15,"This is a great place to stay if you're visiting Louisville or just driving through. Rooms were very clean, hotel staff was helpful and had quick answers to questions about the area. WiFi works well but is slow. One thing to note, if you're a light sleeper, you may want to ask for a room on the west side of the hotel as the east side of the building is very close to the highway off ramp.Hampton inn is pretty consistent, but this location wasn't as good- (I was torn between 2-3 stars, but chose 2).Although I was upgraded to a suite for free, the service was just *fair*. Nobody was rude or anything, but I felt like I was interrupting everyone- as if I were inconvenient to them.Some Hampton inns are updated, but this one did not appear to be. The room was clean, but the walls had patches of stuff on them- scratches on the doors &amp; furniture. The HVAC worked, but the housing was in disrepair. The workout equipment was obsolete and in severe disrepair. (The towel bin hadn't been restocked and the water cooler didn't work at all). I'd stay here again, but it would not be my first choice.Okay so we are on the road from KC and looking for a Hampton. We found this one tired as ever they gave us a room but when we got there it had hair every where on the beds? Under the sheets, bathroom. Even on the decorations in the bathroom. Really? So we went to exchange the room and she gave us another room but guess that room had hair under are sheets and on the bathroom floor. Look like how's keeping was cleaning the room with a hair mop smh. We were so tired we ended up getting sleeping bags to use on the beds. It was just Nasty.This hotel chain is usually really good nationwide however, this is the exception.The customer service here is fantastic.  The staff is friendly and warm.Unfortunately, the rooms are a bit run down and the walls are paper thin.  We were also here for work while they were under their ""reconstruction phase"" to be fair but that's all I have to go on for this hotel.If you just want a roof over your head this is the place for you.  However, if you are looking to feel comfortable and happy, perhaps try another hotel/chain.AVOID. Worst Hampton I have ever stayed at. Boarder-line Run-Down. The only positive thing I can say is check in was a breeze, and that is because the desk clerk seemed to be the only person there that cared. Breakfast. incompetent layout, quality, and availability. Awful. Room cleaning LAZY. Not once changed sheets or the stained bed-spread. Really? 2-days not trash removal from room. Room missing items, trash can, do not disturb, enough hangers. Gym: WORST EVER. ALL MACHINES BROKEN. Never have seen ever in a Hilton chain. Blatantly CHEAP MANAGERS!Will NOT stay at this one ever again nor recommend.Currently undergoing a renovation, the property is a little rough around the edges.  My only real complaint would be the tough traffic patterns to get into the property.  The room was clean, the staff is exceptionally personable.There are better choices. The staff is great but the rooms are lacking. Comforter was lumpy. Carpet unfinished around air conditioner and lime scale build up on faucet. I will look for other accommodations next time I am in town.The girl at the front desk was super rude when checking in. I thought she was having a bad day, which happens, but apparently every day was a bad day for her. I just don't care to deal with that after a long day at work. No, thank you! Other than that, rooms were clean but super outdated like most Hampton Inns.No sheets.  No apologies.  We were woken up very early by the housekeeping guy knocking persistently and saying ""hey"" over and over.  And they have a terrible breakfast. I'm paying more for a better hotel from now on.Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Room was fairly clean but the pillow case has disgusting stains on it. Walls are paper thin and I got to enjoy my neighbors television all night so keep this in mind when booking. Wi-fi worked well and was complimentary. The breakfast, also complimentary, was pretty decent but stains on the chairs. Phone would not connect to front desk at all for a wake up call and had to actually go to the front desk. The desk clerk was great about helping with local food delivery options and even gave me a coupon. Pros and cons. Needs more attention to cleanliness details but very accommodating.Great customer service by all except the owner. Room had bed bugs! Were moved -front desk was great-but family had to be split into 2 rooms. Next morning the owner changed the compensation promise and was incredibly rude. Too bad. Have contacted Hilton for resolution.This would get 5 stars but it's an old hotel with nothing decent close to it.   Staff was awesome but everything is old minus the medium size flat screen.Very friendly staff. The place was clean. Free wifi throughout. Decent free breakfast. Great location for Louisville tourism. We'd stay here again if ever in the area.Very clean and a great locationOne of the more popular places in New Albany. Place was booked when I showed up, but thankfully there was a cancellation and they moved me right into that room. The hotel is beautiful and very clean. The rooms are quite spacious and comfortable. Moderately priced. They have breakfast and sometimes serve other buffet style meals around dinner. Food was QUITE good too! However... The beds weren't anything to brag about. I slept in a better bed at a hotel that cost me half the price. So, if you don't mind a remotely uncomfortable sleep, check this place out if you swing through New Albany.",,,,,"['great', 'place', 'visiting', 'driving', 'rooms', 'clean', 'hotel', 'staff',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-louisville-louisville,La Quinta Inn & Suites Louisville,3.5,$$,12,"Very clean hotel, friendly staff. The rooms were nice and clean. The hotel is in a good location, close to the interstate and several restaurants.Several items for breakfast. I will stay here again.I made a second visit at La Quinta it is still very clean and the staff very friendly.I stayed at this La Quinta in June 2015 and my experience was great.  I saw some poor reviews; however, during my stay, I got nothing but great friendly service!I worked with 2 employees during my stay.  Sadly I forget their names, but, a man checked me in, and was very helpful.  We had a problem with our room where our door just didn't seem to line up well to close.  Without a question he moved us one room down.  A nice lady helped me check out and she was also very nice.Sadly I slept past the free breakfast, but, I have stayed at many La Quinta's and it's usually your standard buffet breakfast which isn't bad at all, and best of all, free!Although I missed breakfast at the hotel, luckily there are many restaurants very close by!  Cracker Barrel was where I went for breakfast, and there is also a seafood place and many other choices nearby!One thing I love about La Quinta's is their pet policy!  FREE!  I travel with my dog and sometimes my dog &amp; cat.  Some hotels charge insane amounts for pets!  I am happy every time I can find a La Quinta in the towns I am staying so I don't have to pay tons extra for having a dog.Overall, the building and rooms are standard La Quinta.  Basic, but clean.  At under $100 per night, with pets, this is my go to hotel!This LaQuinta is an excellent value-oriented property with clean, comfortable rooms including refrigerator and microwave.   Front desk was very accommodating.  We brought kids once and they enjoyed the small indoor pool.  While this is not the newest LQ decor it is nice and not dated.  There are 2 chain restaurants on the same road and plenty of fast food around.  I use this one when I need to be in East Louisville.  Of course it is pet friendly with a very reasonable pet policy.  The breakfast is standard LQ fare of fruit,  cereal,  waffles, and those prepared eggs with pastries.   By booking  well in advance I found rates very favorable.David Kloop is the manager at this location and could use some schooling on his social skills.  We witnessed some bad behavior while he was checking in a guest prior to us.  And, while I came in to the building during the middle of the discussion.    I quickly realized when he was checking us in that this guy obviously hates his job.  Too We're very clean - appears to be a new hotel, breakfast each morning was excellent. But even after a week - David had a very poor attitude.  We won't stay at this location again.Pros: Pet friendly, comfortable beds, okcontinental breakfast, and decent rate. Cons: Rude staff, zero water pressure, and a filthy indoor pool that smelled like creek water and looked like an outdoor pool that had not been cleaned in 15 years.Upon check in we had to yell for the clerk to help us. She was unfriendly and acted like we were interrupting whatever she was doing in the back office. The clerk in the morning was just as rude. We love the La Quinta, but we won't stay here again.Avoid this place if you are a dog owner and don't want to be treated like fourth class. When my wife and I checked in with our ten pound beast last Saturday, we were informed by ""Doug"" at the front desk that we were not allowed to enter the hotel through the main door with our dog. Rather, we were told, that we were to enter through a side door and we were not allowed to use the elevator. We completely ignored Doug, of course and entered all we liked--with our dog in tow--through the main entrance. I have never been treated like this anywhere I've stayed. Ever. It was incredibly insulting, particularly when La Quinta advertises themselves as ""pet friendly."" To add insult to injury, this second rate hotel is very over priced.One note: there are two Doug's here. The Doug we dealt with is just a front desk clerk. The other Doug is apparently a manager. He was not on-site during our stay, but he will be getting an earful. We won't ever be back.My husband and I have stayed in multiple La Quintas and this is one of the BEST ones we've stayed in. We stayed in a suite so we had a pull out couch. We didn't use it but it was nice to have a little sitting area. We also traveled with our 2 pets, one cat and one dog and they welcomed them but told us to come through the side door so we wouldn't disturb anyone. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the staff that waited on us was spectacular!Not only is this a clean, convenient hotel, but the staff is also first rate.  We stay at this hotel about 4 times a year.  During our last stay we forgot a pair of shoes in the room.  When we realized that we had forgotten the shoes, we called back to the hotel and talked to Gary who informed us that he had mailed the shoes back to us at his expense.  Thank you Gary for the ""above and beyond"" customer service!  Highly recommend this hotel!Not a bad place. Just a good hotel room with nothing spectacular. The free wifi either work great or terrible. Good for dogs. Free continental breakfast. Not bad for the value.LOVE LOVE LOVE this La Quinta......We had a room reserved with double beds because at the time that is all they had but when we checked in they had a King Suite available and needed our double bed room so they upgraded us for free.This room was amazing!!! It had a jacuzzi tub, fridge, microwave, the works. The bed was real soft and the room was extra clean.I really liked that the area around the hotel was really clean and nice. Plenty of restaurants to choose from.If I ever pass thru again I would love to stay here again.We try to always stay at La Quinta because we travel with our Aussie Shepherd. This one is one of the best, very nice rooms and very clean. Staff is very nice and helpful and the breakfast is great for travelers.  There is a large field behind the hotel that is great to let our dog run after a long day in the car. And plenty of great places to eat very close, love this area.The quality of La Quinta's varies widely.  Yes, this one does have the comfortable beds and for that I'll give it the two stars. However, there is practically NO water pressure, at least not in room 215.  There were children running screaming down the hall by 9am -- Hey, you little urchins, it is six in the friggin' morning in California! Then a half hour later the maids knock on your door and yell ""Housekeeping"", like there is no way to give them a print out of the people who have already checked out.  They want you out of there. Their reported fitness center is apparently a room with two machines . . but I never saw it (and I looked).The front desk is not particularly friendly.  I mean, I was standing in line to check in and he answered a phone call ahead of me.  Hello? I'm actually here in the flesh - if I started ringing annoyingly would you afford me a higher priority? I said something . . as nicely as I could and he obliged but noted that he just hoped the person on hold didn't hang up.  Oh . . that's right, you already HAVE my money. What really galled me is that I'd switched from the Downtown Hyatt to save a few bucks on my last night in town.  I literally saved $23 on the room . . . $13 on the parking.  That means that for just $36 more dollars (shop through travelocity), you can be smack dab in the middle of downtown, have an actual fitness center open 24 hours on premise, a larger room, better bathroom, actually shower, 18 floor hotel . . . I mean, it is worth $36.  This place isn't awful but for over a $100 with tax on the very outskirts of Louisville, it should be A LOT better.",,,,,"['clean', 'hotel', 'friendly', 'staff', 'rooms', 'nice', 'clean', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-louisville-east-louisville,Courtyard Louisville East,3.5,$$,11,"Nice place to stay. We did two nights. The rates were good. Rooms were clean, linens were clean and rooms were just as described on site. Location was right by major expressways and had lots of restaurants and shopping near. Location is about 20 minutes from downtown Louisville. There is also a Starbucks and bar right in the lobby area.Cue the standard review - the bed is comfortable, the room is clean. Price is trending a little higher than I think is worth it for a place like this, but...depending on the area, that sort of thing happens. I do agree with some other reviews - for this kind of price, I feel like I ought to get some breakfast included with the room. I definitely would have at a competing Hampton Inn. So there's absolutely nothing here to avoid - I'd say let your hotel loyalties do the talking, and if you value breakfast, find a Hampton nearby.What can I say about my visit to the Courtyard by Marriott in East Louisville other than ""A Perfect Stay""...Upon arrival I was greeted with ""Welcome"" and a smile...The lobby area was very modern and NICE!! I had requested an early arrival and arrived at 1pm and was promptly checked in with no problem (normal check-in is at 3pm). My room was on the fourth floor overlooking the courtyard and pool (nice view).  The room was immaculate and I LOVED the red accent walls behind the bed and in the bathroom. There was no fridge or microwave in my room like at some of the other Courtyards that I've stayed in but since I was only there for one night it was no biggie. My room was right around the corner from the elevator and I heard nothing... It was very quiet in the hotel. The bed was nice and comfy (not too hard or soft)...The water temperature/pressure in the tub/shower was awesome...There is a Cuisinart single serve coffee maker for those like me who like that one cup of coffee in the morning...The hotel is very close to lots of stores and restaurants, a lot within walking distance. Overall it was a most perfect stay and I will definitely return to this hotel when I come back to Louisville.So, the lobby is nice but same sub-par Marriott rooms. Awkward set-up of bed/tv positioning- not ideal. There's an in-room balcony but it's not accessible. Had to hold down the toilet handle for a full minute to flush every single time. Icky shower with moldy curtain. And the room smelled funny when we arrived. Happy to have an outlet next to each side of the bed for easy phone charging. Friendly staff. Wasn't too far away from the derby.Our stay here was average- expected more for what we paid - noisy rooms with a gap under door so heard hallway noise as well- very nice lobby and check in- friendly staff - rooms were outdated but clean- close to several restaurants!Good: Nice hotel, rooms clean and friendly staff. Bad: The lack of an included hot breakfast when other hotels in this price-point include it, and the free version of the in house Wifi is so slow that it is unusable. I suppose this is to persuade you to pay for the ""advanced"" service.  In this day and age, charging more for usable internet is inexcusable.Great hotel, very clean and accommodating! Free wifi, computers to use, and extravagant lobby! Breakfast is great and there is a Starbucks in the lobby as well!Very Nice hotel at a great price!Clean rooms.  Bathroom was immaculately cleaned.  Decor is the same as every other Courtyard.  Towels are like SANDPAPER.  Comfy lobby.Newly renovated lobby. Nice.  Rooms still in crappy old scheme but at least it's reasonably priced.I stay at this hotel every week since the end of September.  They recently upgraded their lobby and it is much nicer. The rooms are clean and they have large tv which makes it nice.  They need to install wireless and my understanding is this is in the works.",,,,,"['nice', 'place', 'nights', 'rates', 'good', 'rooms', 'clean', 'linens', 'clean', 'rooms', 'described', 'site', 'location', 'right', 'major', 'expressways', 'lots', 'restaurants', 'shopping', 'near', 'location', 'minutes', 'downtown', 'also', 'bar', 'right', 'lobby', 'area', 'cue', 'standard', 'review', 'bed', 'comfortable', 'room', 'clean', 'price', 'trending', 'little', 'higher', 'think', 'worth', 'place', 'like', 'depending', 'area', 'sort', 'thing', 'happens', 'agree', 'reviews', 'kind', 'price', 'feel', 'like', 'ought', 'breakfast', 'included', 'room', 'definitely', 'competing', 'inn', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'avoid', 'say', 'let', 'hotel', 'loyalties', 'talking', 'value', 'breakfast', 'find', 'nearby', 'say', 'visit', 'courtyard', 'east', 'perfect', 'upon', 'arrival', 'greeted', 'welcome', 'smile', 'lobby', 'area', 'modern', 'nice', 'requested', 'early', 'arrival', 'arrived', 'promptly', 'checked', 'problem', 'normal', 'check', 'room', 'fourth', 'floor', 'overlooking', 'courtyard', 'pool', 'nice', 'view', 'room', 'immaculate', 'loved', 'red', 'accent', 'walls', 'behind', 'bed', 'bathroom', 'fridge', 'microwave', 'room', 'like', 'courtyards', 'since', 'night', 'biggie', 'room', 'right', 'around', 'corner', 'elevator', 'heard', 'nothing', 'quiet', 'hotel', 'bed', 'nice', 'comfy', 'hard', 'soft', 'water', 'temperature', 'pressure', 'tub', 'shower', 'awesome', 'single', 'serve', 'coffee', 'maker', 'like', 'like', 'cup', 'coffee', 'morning', 'hotel', 'close', 'lots', 'stores', 'restaurants', 'lot', 'within', 'walking', 'distance', 'overall', 'perfect', 'definitely', 'return', 'hotel', 'come', 'back', 'lobby', 'nice', 'sub', 'par', 'rooms', 'awkward', 'set', 'bed', 'positioning', 'ideal', 'room', 'balcony', 'accessible', 'hold', 'toilet', 'handle', 'full', 'minute', 'flush', 'every', 'single', 'time', 'icky', 'shower', 'moldy', 'curtain', 'room', 'smelled', 'funny', 'arrived', 'happy', 'outlet', 'next', 'side', 'bed', 'easy', 'phone', 'charging', 'friendly', 'staff', 'far', 'away', 'derby', 'average', 'expected', 'paid', 'noisy', 'rooms', 'gap', 'door', 'heard', 'hallway', 'noise', 'well', 'nice', 'lobby', 'check', 'friendly', 'staff', 'rooms', 'outdated', 'clean', 'close', 'several', 'restaurants', 'good', 'nice', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'clean', 'friendly', 'staff', 'bad', 'lack', 'included', 'hot', 'breakfast', 'hotels', 'price', 'point', 'include', 'free', 'version', 'house', 'slow', 'unusable', 'suppose', 'persuade', 'pay', 'advanced', 'service', 'day', 'age', 'charging', 'usable', 'inexcusable', 'great', 'hotel', 'clean', 'accommodating', 'free', 'computers', 'use', 'extravagant', 'lobby', 'breakfast', 'great', 'lobby', 'well', 'nice', 'hotel', 'great', 'price', 'clean', 'rooms', 'bathroom', 'immaculately', 'cleaned', 'decor', 'every', 'courtyard', 'towels', 'like', 'sandpaper', 'comfy', 'lobby', 'newly', 'renovated', 'lobby', 'nice', 'rooms', 'still', 'crappy', 'old', 'scheme', 'least', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'hotel', 'every', 'week', 'since', 'end', 'recently', 'upgraded', 'lobby', 'much', 'nicer', 'rooms', 'clean', 'large', 'makes', 'nice', 'need', 'install', 'wireless', 'understanding', 'works']",[],[],[],[],"[('nice', 10), ('rooms', 9), ('lobby', 9), ('hotel', 8), ('room', 8), ('clean', 8), ('like', 6), ('bed', 5), ('breakfast', 4), ('price', 4), ('staff', 3), ('every', 3), ('right', 3), ('courtyard', 3), ('great', 3), ('restaurants', 3), ('area', 3), ('friendly', 3), ('perfect', 2), ('location', 2), ('coffee', 2), ('good', 2), ('close', 2), ('shower', 2), ('lots', 2), ('since', 2), ('single', 2), ('arrival', 2), ('bathroom', 2), ('free', 2), ('place', 2), ('included', 2), ('comfy', 2), ('heard', 2), ('say', 2), ('check', 2), ('charging', 2), ('arrived', 2), ('nothing', 2), ('well', 2), ('definitely', 2), ('walking', 1), ('stores', 1), ('hallway', 1), ('lack', 1), ('corner', 1), ('still', 1), ('find', 1), ('slow', 1), ('cup', 1), ('courtyards', 1), ('age', 1), ('cue', 1), ('easy', 1), ('smile', 1), ('east', 1), ('advanced', 1), ('worth', 1), ('ought', 1), ('return', 1), ('around', 1), ('distance', 1), ('far', 1), ('overall', 1), ('fridge', 1), ('early', 1), ('walls', 1), ('outlet', 1), ('competing', 1), ('day', 1), ('minute', 1), ('biggie', 1), ('bar', 1), ('reasonably', 1), ('morning', 1), ('large', 1), ('bad', 1), ('renovated', 1), ('night', 1), ('loyalties', 1), ('soft', 1), ('side', 1), ('view', 1), ('accessible', 1), ('old', 1), ('higher', 1), ('absolutely', 1), ('house', 1), ('hard', 1), ('back', 1), ('understanding', 1), ('noise', 1), ('flush', 1), ('happens', 1), ('trending', 1), ('sub', 1), ('linens', 1), ('review', 1), ('microwave', 1), ('behind', 1)]","[(('clean', 'and'), 4)]",[]
http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-louisville-3,Hilton Garden Inn,4.0,$$,19,"From the time you walk in and the front desk staff greet and check you in then you walk into the large clean room you are saying Yes I am glad I picked this hotel. You then go down for drinks and a meal WOW the bar tender and wait staff are great. Then when your meal comes out to perfection you say to yourself SCORE!This is a Great Hotel and I stay many nights from High End to the Hampton brand (which are very good) this is now one of my favs in Louisville.From one happy Diamond MemberI travel a lot for business. This is the friendliest and most helpful staff I have encountered. The breakfast is great and the dinner items  are delicious. Great service.C'mon I do like Garden Inns.This one was perfectly located for work. Right across the street.Gotta love rolling out of bed and going to work.The room was clean and fresh.Can't ask for more.The staff is so friendly and helpful. Real customer service is so rare these days, and I'm so grateful and impressed by these guys! I had an allergic reaction to the sheets (forgot to call ahead and ask what detergent they use to wash their sheets, and I'm allergic to most detergents), so the next morning my skin looked horrid! The staff was so nice when we called. They said they would change the bedding and towels with a hypoallergenic option, and said they have bedding washed with different allergy-friendly detergent for this very case (probably something along the lines of Tide-Free-and-Gentle or All-Free-and-Clear.) They changed the sheets within a couple hours, and even apologized! I was impressed because people who are allergic to everything (like me) should have known to call-ahead. They were very kind, and some hotels don't even offer a hypoallergenic option. Also, for breakfast they made custom-made pancakes just because I asked if they were making any more. The tray was out of pancakes, which was understandable since I was late getting downstairs after trying to calm my skin and let allergy medicine kick in. I asked if they were making more, but never meant for them to make more if they were wrapping up breakfast. They made two huge yummy pancakes for me! Again, multiple employees here are just fantastic.  Overall wonderful experience!Best breakfast in Louisville. Homemade scones and cinnamon buns. Oh my, it's a heavenly breakfast.Breakfast is FANTASTIC!! Homemade raspberry scones, sticky buns, hash, buttermilk biscuits. I think I've died and gone to heaven.  Good thing I hit that treadmill first. What a breakfast!Clean, Nice Staff, Quiet and full food service.This Hilton Garden Inn on Crittenden Drive is conveniently located; low traffic area, but close enough to great restaurant strip on Bardstown Road, and other tourist venues. The hotel rates are reasonable, good facility for those on business trips. The staff are nice and cordial; very pleasant dispositions.This location is good if you are:A) At the convention centerB) Wanting to be close to the airportThe hotel is nice, clean, and current. If you are going to a convention this hotel will fill and fast.Negatives if you wish to go downtown you will drive. If you want to go to trendy restaurants in old town you will need to drive. If you like Cracker Barrel, then you are just fine.Anything but the convention I am downtown.located near the airport,  difficult to get to.  No free upgrades for breakfast. the shower was luke warm,  and the air conditioning made weird noises.  Room was clean, and the bed firmness adjuster was broken.  The only good, was that I was leaving the next day.Large spacious room. Nice lay out with friendly staff. Small pool and very small fitness center, but enough to do the trick. Biggest down side is restaurant. would have been a solid 4 or 4.5 but the restaurant brought it down. I choose the Garden Inn because it had a restaurant and bar. This way I could get dinner after I arrived and have a few drinks with out having to worry about driving. I had the Smokehouse cheddar burger. It was ok, but nothing great especially for the price. Typical low end restaurant burger. Had 2 glasses of red. I asked for the ""freshest"" and was brought the Sycamore lane which I assume is the house wine at $6. It tasted like it had been open a long time (a few days at least) with a taint and slight carbonated feel. Definitely old. I asked for the Malbec for the second glass; $12.50 and was extremely disappointed. It too was old. Didn't want to seem like a snoot so I ate the cost of both. Very disappointed. Lesson learned only order beer or bring your own!Had Breakfast this morning. If you are a Hilton Honors member and get it free it is OK. If not, GO NEXT DOOR to Cracker Barrel to get great food at a reasonable price! Eggs were watery, was not ready at 0600 (still cooking the scrambled eggs for the line. Wait staff friendly and helpful Although waitress kept chiding me and 2 other fellows for being on our phones so much. We were all at different tables and eating alone. I like to clear my email for work during breakfast while having coffee allowing me to be up to speed before my first meeting. I don't need to be told by Mom about no phones at the table, since the Garden in is trying to get business clientele as customers.Excellent hotel. Very clean. Lots of meeting space for groups of various sizes. Indoor pool was appropriate temperature. However,  the hot tub apparently had a leak. Maintenance kept adding water daily. Don't expect a lot of upscale dining within walking distance. You'll have to drive on in to downtown.Very nice hotel and pleasant and helpful staff. I just spent one night here but the property was well appointed and maintained.  I would certainly recommend this hotel if you are in the area and want to be near the airport.Been waiting 40 minutes for Shuttle to hotel. Called 3 times. Every time told 5 minutes. This is why I use MarriottAwesome place with amazing staff.  Traveling with family member with a disability ..very accommodating!Nice rooms, awesome staff, Amazing bartenders.This Hilton Garden Inn is super friendly, clean and actually quite stylish! My room and my bathroom was quite large, and even had space for a desk and a small sitting chair with an ottoman next to the two Queen beds - and it didn't feel cramped. The bathroom was stocked with Neutrogena products, which I thought was much better than the usual hotel junk.There was quite a large selection of breakfast foods, including: cereal, fresh fruit, omeletes made to order, scrambled eggs, bagels, toast, cinnamon buns....you get the idea. I think that the cooks came out every morning and asked us how our breakfast was and if we needed anything. Wow. The hotel isn't downtown, but it's very close to the airport and right next to the Six Flags Kentucky that has been closed for apparently three years. It's also quite close to the expo center, which was especially convenient for the purposes of my stay there.I had a huge room, which was clean and quiet.  Not much else to ask for.  The staff was friendly (and one of them was a hottie) and the AC was cold.  The bar downstairs left something to be desired and I never really tried the restaurant.  There wasn't much in the way of selections for beer or wine at the bar, although the bartender was really friend.  Bonus is the free shuttle to the airport, which was quick and without incident.Typical clean, modern HGI. I stay here whenever I'm flying out of the airport.I swear that I could tell you about all the dumpy hotels in Louisville - this year alone I have already found 2. This time I decided to stay near the airport and there were alot more choices. The hotel was fine. Although very close to the airport my room was quite. Maybe once I heard a little air noise but Im used to living in a busy area so it doesn't bother me. Liz the concierge was kind enough to fill my request to provide me a room on the top floor.  The hotel is very close to the Fairgrounds/Stadium other than that there is not a lot in the immediate area but 2 major interstates are less than a mile away so it's easy getting from one end of town to the other. the ramada inn in the same block looked dumpy. There is fairly new super 8 which looks good. Lots of hotels in the area but i believe you do get what you paid for. Yea the bathroom had Neutrogena it's better than some of the other toiletries you receive. Plenty of parking also.Nice size rooms, friendly staff and adequate restaurant but two big negatives: Check in took 15 min. One person for a big line. And twice there was lukewarm water so showering was impossible.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-louisville,Fairfield Inn & Suites,4.0,$$,11,"I recently had a 3 night stay for a business trip at this location. They are currently finishing up a remodeling project of the entire building. The staff are friendly the continental breakfast has a large selection. The rooms are nice and clean and the beds are cozy. Will definitely stay here again is business brings me back to this area l.So my sister had come West from D.C. to visit and we decided to make a trip to Louisville. This was the hotel we had stayed. The hotel at first glance is very hard to find as the name is all the way on the other side. If you were coming down into metro Louisville from I-64, you would definitely not see it. You have to literally go around because the front is facing West. The check-in was quick and we got to our room, which was not too bad either. What I did find was weird was that the closet, because they put it perpendicular to the wall, kind of constricted the walkway, into the room. In other words, when you enter, the sink is on the right, then you have the closet facing the sink and then the bathroom is in that alleyway created by walking between these two. But rather than use the wall to align with the sink wall,  it stuck out into the walk way. The closet door was hard to open as well because it was one of those pull away (kind of like a restroom on an airplane deal). The room did have a nice HD plasma screen and the view on the 6th floor was amazing (could see a full view of the KFC Yum Center). The amenities were nice as well. The pool was great lengthwise going from  3 ft. to 5 ft. deep; however, the width was terrible. On Saturday, I was the first one in and then all these people started coming in and I was like ""Dang, how am I going to make room, while still being able to swim?"" It was as if I was a big ass fish in a small aquarium. I could only get in one stroke from wall to wall! The continental breakfast was pretty sweet. They had some hot food (gritz, waffles, scambeled eggs, sausage and vegetable stir fry) as well as the regular cold (cereal, bagels, yogurt, etc.) Things that were not included in the rating, but a big WTF. Okay so in the room, the wall facing me had this outlet thing that they were trying to blend in with the rest of the wall. What I was trying to figure out was why the other wall, beside it had all these other things sticking out? It seemed as if they like half assed it. You will see in the attached pic. O_o The tried to blend in the outlet; however, the fire alarm, speaker, and sprinkler system were all visible and those stuck out the most!FANTASTIC hotel.  I cannot recommend it enough!!The continental breakfast in the morning was delicious and plentiful.  I like how they had a fridge down there to KEEP the cold stuff cold.  Not just a bowl with ice.  Sometimes that doesn't cut it when it comes to yogurt or milk.The rooms were really nice and well-kept by housekeeping.  They were accomodating at the front desk when my friends and I wanted to be by each other.  Each of us were traveling with kids, and they were very sweet to them.  They were all really patient with us when we met in the hallway so our kids could fall asleep (only one complaint-woot!! lol).Check in and check out was a breeze and the hotel is very centrally located.  I would definitely stay there again!Disclaimer: I have not stayed overnight here.But: I have been to several multi-day professional continuing ed classes here and gotten a feel for the hotel overall.The breakfast is solid.  Make-your-own waffles, bagels, muffins, oatmeal with add-ins, cereal, hardboiled eggs, yogurt, danishes and a few microwaveable options like sausage biscuits (convenience store type) plus coffee, tea and juice of course. The place is clean.  Newer hotel and it shows.  Small indoor pool, small weight room both appear clean and nice.  Small patio outside and a dining/working lobby inside.  Staff is friendly but not obtrusive.  Responsive to the needs of their clients like refilling coffee, unlocking doors, restocking bathroom items etc. Overall very good staff. Rooms appear nice, I've seen them while maids are cleaning them and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there.  My colleagues who have stayed there have had no complaints. My major complaint is location.  Dang that location is impossible to exit at rush hour- Blankenbaker light takes 2-3 turns and I-64 towards the city is horrible.  So if you were staying here and wanted to go to dinner closer into town or downtown, it is very annoying.  Not many local or nicer restaurants right close by, all chains like fast food, Cracker Barrel, Ryan's, and such.  A bit farther away there are more choices at least.  And it is walkable to nearly nothing of interest for the average tourists.Great look, clean rooms; however probably the first room in 20 years that didn't have a mini fridge. First time at a Fairfield, but an avid Marriott fan. Not the hotel to choose for a week long business meeting. Rooms seem quite small in comparison to competitors. Don't misunderstand, this is not a bad hotel, they are very nice here. I'm just a hotel snob an expect a higher level. HI express is a notch up in value for the dollar if budget is an issue. Louisville Marriott east is the premiere property in the area fir all brands and is only 2-3 min away. I will return to what I know at the Marriott next trip.I've stayed here twice.  Feels relatively new.  Courteous staff.  Proximate to a good range of fast food eateries.  Close to some major highways.  Seemed relatively busy.Pro's-  Feels new and clean-  Good value-  Hi-speed internet also available via ethernet cable (and pretty stable and fast)-  Speakman shower heads-  My room had a tall showerCon's-  My room felt a bit small - almost Manhattan small-  Water pressure not greatDidn't eat the breakfast - had other commitments.Nice new hotel, pretty speedy internet.  Good breakfast, bit far from downtown or it would be 5 starts.Great place to stay with great rates. Free hot breakfast every morning is something you should take advantage of. The hotel decor looks modern and is clean. There's an indoor pool and inviting lobby. Couldn't give it all five stars because of our experience with the staff. They were not hospitable. I would still return.Woohoo is right! When Frontier Air lost my family's luggage (ugh, all the baby gear was stuck in Milwaukee), Rachel from the front desk stepped in to help! She went above and beyond, providing my hubby and me with toiletries, setting up the hotel's portable crib in the dark, and offering to go home and get me diapers and baby clothes!!!Besides the fabulous customer service (seriously, that girl better be running this place next time), the hotel is modern, newly upgraded, clean, and comfortable. The color scheme is super cute (blue, orange, and green--sounds 80s, but it's really spa-ish and organic) and the staff is phenomenal.The Executive King Suite has a sitting room and a sleeping space--it's semi-private and airy. The bathroom is roomy enough for our family of three to scrub up together! This great value coupled with superior amenities will have me as a life-long customer when I'm in town on business.Clean, close to everything.  Great value.Wonderful, clean, friendly!  Nothing more to ask for in a hotel.  Plus free breakfast!",,,,,"['recently', 'night', 'business', 'trip', 'location', 'currently', 'finishing', 'remodeling', 'project', 'entire', 'building', 'staff', 'friendly', 'continental',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-louisville-airport-and-expo-louisville,La Quinta Inn & Suites Louisville Airport & Expo,3.5,$$,11,"Overall a good stay for the price. This was our 6th place to stay over a period of 10 days while traveling cross-country. It was second best to another La Quinta, followed by a close third at Falls Motel in MN.We stayed on a Monday night, easy check in process. We received military pricing at $87+tax.All was clean except hairs (the coarse/curly kind) found on bathroom floor. After letting the staff know, Amanda was apologetic and noted it for cleaning staff to take care of.Our 2-queen beds had 6 pillows each, super clean, comfy and fresh. Fridge, microwave, mini-bar area and huge tv. In-room coffee maker too.Bath/shower closed off by a door, separate from the sink and vanity (and hair dryer). This is handy!Free breaky included coffee/tea/juice, egg and sausage patties, a variety of baked goods, toast, waffles, cereal (hot grits), fruit salad, bananas and yogurt.No extra charge for our small dog.Overall, we recommend this hotel for sure.Overview: This La Quinta Inn &amp; Suites in Louisville is a ""okay"" 2-star class hotel located next to the I-264 freeway (literally next to the freeway) off the Preston Highway. There is no pet fee, and parking is free. The rooms become oddly humid, some rooms have significant freeway noise, the pool/hot-tub is outdoors, and the nearby restaurants are not the best. See photo below for the view across the street. Pricing is about $100/nightThe Room: With poor sound isolation, a strangely high humidity despite leaving the large-window-A/C on, and a slight odor of old air freshener, the room was nice but not ideal. The king sized bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was well laid out, but the view left a lot to be desired.Conclusions: This La Quinta is an average 2-star hotel located in an area without too many attractions. Though it is positioned near a convenient Aldi supermarket that I liked, and didn't have any glaring problems besides the humidity of the room, I would have chosen a different hotel had I not been traveling with my pet.Overall I'd say a good deal for the price. I liked this one slightly over the one in east Louisville I've stayed at but I'd say the area is better at the east Louisville La Quinta but the breakfast is better here so pick your poison. I will say my room layout was nice, with a wet bar and cabinet space, so this room would have been awesome for the three night stay we just had in Knoxville but the LaQuinta in Knoxville was cleaner and had a better breakfast spread compared to this one. I've never been given goody bags for my pups before so kudos to this hotel for the extra bonus!! It made me and my pups both smile!Front desk clerk was very friendly when we checked in and gave me two treat bags for my two pups when I checked in which included pickup bags for them and two bones which was a nice guest ute I thought. She was friendly to them too and they are German Shepherds which most people are terrified of.My room was clean and I had plenty of hot water (scalding hot water from my shower). I had one of the pet rooms on the first floor since I was traveling with my pups. No problems with smells or stains, my room smelled clean and fresh and I had plenty of towels. Wifi is free but unsecured (no password required).Louiville had just had a foot of snow dumped on it and the parking lot had been plowed and was easy to navigate so the hotel clearly maintains the paking lot. Overall: Better than most La Quintas I've stayed in but not the best. My final impression: a good choice for a stay if you are traveling with your pups.I stayed here one night on May 24th visiting Kentucky Kingdom and Holiday World.   The hotel is clean, everything is great.    However, my price was $94 a night, with taxes that came out to about $120.    At all the other hotels I visited on my trip, the price was about $75 plus taxes.       The other thing, was the shuttle doesn't run until 05:30am.   My flight out was at 6am, so I couldn't return the rental car the previous day and use the shuttle.     Since my flight was so early and I wasn't going to be staying in the room that long, I car camped the night before my flight out, returning the rental car at 4am.    If the shuttle ran at 4am, I would have stayed the night.Whether it's worth it for the hotel to run the shuttle at 4am, I don't know.   But there are flights that leave at 6am.    And please do something about the dogs in the back of the hotel that bark until midnight.    If you stay here, ask for a room on the West side of the building to the far North side on the ground floor.   Then you might not hear the dogs that bark until midnight.This place sucks. My room smelled like dirty old feet. My shower only put out cold water. The bed was rock hard.  I usually have better luck with la Quinta. If I return I sure will not stay again.An okay La Quinta but not as nice as some I have stayed at.  Clerk at desk when I checked in, didn't make me feel welcome.  The room was so-so.  The bed had to be one of the hardest I have ever slept on.  Needs a bit of help on a number of fronts to move higher on the rating.Great hotel especially for the price. Our king room was huge with a mini-kitchen that had a large fridge and microwave. The was plenty of counter space and cupboards. I only wish that the bathroom sink area was larger. Maybe when they remodel they can open the bath sink area by taking up some of the counter space of the kitchen.We were very impressed by the breakfast room and the offerings for food which included waffles and biscuits and gravy. The staff was very helpful and friendly.If we are ever in Louisville again, we will stay here.I drove from Chicago down South with my dog and was looking for a pet friendly hotel to stay at midway through our trip.  After searching online and reading other good reviews, I chose this hotel.  The other positive reviews I've read at various web sites are spot on. The common areas and room was immaculate.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the room rate was very reasonable.  The fact that this hotel does not charge an extra pet deposit fee is a nice bonus.  They have free wi-fi, coffee maker, microwave, and a refrigerator in the room.  The only thing that didn't really impress me was the free breakfast.  However it was free so one can't really complain.  I liked this hotel so much that I re-booked it on my way back to Chicago. If you are looking for a very clean, comfortable and reasonable pet friendly hotel in Louisville KY, this is your place!We stayed here in June 2013. We called the hotel around 10 pm and told them we needed a room when we got into town at midnight.  The staff (Erin) was incredibly nice and helpful. They were very accommodating both over the phone and when we arrived. The staff the following day were very friendly. The room was immaculate, and well kept.The breakfast was well stocked. And most importantly, this is the first hotel I have been to in a long time that had awesome water pressure in the shower. The hotel is just outside the airport, but not as noisy as you would think. I highly recommend this hotel!I chose this hotel because we had our Shih Tzu with us. I LOVE that they accept pets and don't charge extra for them! The breakfast has a very good selection of hot and cold choices. The area was very clean and well organized.I misunderstood when I spoke with the reservations (via 800 number) that our double queen room would have a pull out sofa couch as well. We needed the room but had the little kids sleep on the floor. They offer a roll-away, but there isn't room, in my opinion. ALL off the staff were EXCEPTIONALLY friendly to EVERYONE that I saw, EXCEPT for the guy who works the 2nd shift at the front desk. Very indifferent and acted like I was taking up his time.Overall, a nice hotel, especially for the price.This was a nice place.  We requested a suite but, they were booked and could only get 2 beds.  The location was convenient to airport, right off the expressway and several restaurants.  The room and hotel was clean.  Staff was very friendly.  We had been staying at Drury Inn's on our trip and this I would say was a step under as far as decor but, still a very nice place.  They had a very nice area in the back to walk your dog and lots of  garbage cans which made clean up a breeze.  The breakfast was very good.  The only cons I would say is that at breakfast the garbage was not changed out and food and plates got stacked up on top and it was gross and difficult to dispose of your food.  Also, when I called to make a reservation we specifically mentioned we were bringing a dog and they put us in and adjoining room with a family who also had a dog so the dogs could smell one another from the adjoining door and whined all night.",,,,,"['overall', 'good', 'price', '6th', 'place', 'period', 'days', 'traveling', 'cross', 'country', 'second', 'best', 'another', 'followed', 'close',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-louisville-airport-louisville,Hampton Inn Louisville-Airport,3.0,$$,14,"Stayed here overnight before an early flight at the airport. Excellent hotel! My room was clean and well kept. There were even towel animals in the bathroom!! My only complaint is the walls are thin, so could hear my neighbor. Otherwise, great place to stay and less than 5 minutes from the airport.Have always come to expect a certain level of quality at a Hampton Inn. They are known to be excellent travel hotels with just the right about of amenities. The Hampton inn Louisville airport does not live up to expectations. In the simplest of concerns, it is just dirty. The elevators floors and walls look as if they have not been cleaned in quite some time. There was a trail of drippings leading from the back door to the front door of the elevator and out into the lobby.  This observations occurred at 7am. One would assume that nighttime staff would have some time to clean.  After this trip will be changing locations.This hotel was average quality. Nothing 'horribly gross', but nothing 'omg the best'. The bed and the room were clean and everything but nothing in my room drained. I took a shower, and the next morning the tub was still full of water. I washed my hands and brushed my teeth and the sink held the water. I was only staying one night, so not that big of a deal, but if I was staying several nights this would have been a big problem.Clean we'll run . Most expensive hotel I've ever stayed in for work over 200 a night crazy.  There is really no where to eat dinner. Fast food . Stayed  here for a week for a trade show it was awful had to drive 20 minutes to eat dinner every night.  Next time I will stay 20 minutes away in a suburb with some sports bars and variety of restaurants and nightlife. What's the point of staying next to a trade show if there is no coffee and no restaurants.The jet noise sucks. Very noisey at all hours of the night.They don't have washing machines to do laundry.I'm updating my review. As of three days ago I've received the compensation that I was promised by the front desk staff. Now this is the level of customer service that I had grown accustomed to. I look forward to seeing those smiles the next time that I'm in the Louisville area. Thank you all for making it right.One of our favorite hotels in the area! We visit Louisville once every February/March for a trade show inside the Expo Center, so we're very familiar with the airport area.This location is newly remodeled (within the last year or two) and features a friendly &amp; helpful staff. One of the shuttle drivers even drove us over to Kroger at 10:30p one night for medication. It was late and I know he was tired, but there were no complaints, only a sweet smile.The breakfast selection is always wonderful and a great thing when you're running late to the show!Right by the airport! With that said, you don't notice the jet noise. Nice hotel with clean rooms. Typical Hampton quality and great staff. Not a ton within walking distance to eat but a short drive in any direction gives you lots of choices.Miserable. The jet noise rattles the windows. It is not continuous so that you get used to it, it starts every morning at 3:30 am then every 30 secs. The hotel is nice enough but I wanted to sleep. I now remember why we moved downtown when manning the trade shows at the expo center.If you are sensitive to cigarette smoke smell,  be sure that you ask for a room that was NEVER a smoking room.  All the rooms are now non-smoking, but were not always that way.  I asked for a room on any floor other than the 1st and the room I was assigned was the only one they had.  There were events at the nearby KY Expo Center, so the hotel was completely booked.  Becuase I didn't want to be on the first floor, I had to settle for a room that had the linger of cigarette smoke.  YUCK!The location is great if you have an early flight or get in late from a flight as it nearly abutts the airport.  You do, then, get the sounds of an airport.  The location is also great if you are attending events at the Expo Center, as it is within walking distance.  I saw many walking into the Expo Center the next morning.  The breakfast was varied, including a hot breakfast item.  This was nice -- it was not fancy, but definitely gave me what I needed to get the day started.The most accommodating hotel i've stayed at in a really long time.+1 friendly and helpful staff. From the awesome front desk, the breakfast staff and the maids. Everyone was on point. +1 clean rooms - spacious rooms with comfy bedding and a good shower. Only downside was the lighting as we felt like the bathroom lighting made us look extremely dead pale =P+1 continental breakfast -- not the greatest, but they changed up the hot dishes everyday which was good.+1 for free shuttle service to airport and expo center. They also offered my co-worker a free shuttle ride to the convenience store since it was raining-1 my only complaint was the fact that there was not much stuff to do in the area. A bowling alley across the street and other hotels lined the street. This required us to have to cab it downtown to grab lunch/dinner which got pricey after a while. Next time, we'll consider renting a car.Pretty decent for a Hampton Inn. Very close to the airport and the highway if that's a requirement for you. The downside is it's not all that close to downtown, but if you knew Louisville, I suppose you'd know that. (I didn't) Friendly staff and lots of parking. No complaints.Once again, another Hampton that seems no different from any others.  Clean and friendly staffAnother great Hampton Inn experience. This is an older hotel that has been brought up to the current Hampton Inn standard including their very comfortable beds. Conveniently located between the airport and the Kentucky Expo grounds.",,,,,"['overnight', 'early', 'flight', 'airport', 'excellent', 'hotel', 'room', 'clean', 'well', 'kept', 'towel', 'animals',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-louisville-sw-louisville,Holiday Inn Louisville-SW,3.0,$$,10,"Stayed here one night for business.Exterior:  the grounds appeared to be clean and presentable.  Attempting to get into the parking lot was a bit of a hassle as I came from the freeway and the turn lane was backed up.  Once the turn lane started moving, traffic came from the opposite direction.  It appears there is only one entrance/exit as the other one was blocked off from a side street.  Parking is plentiful, so that's not an issue.Interior:  this building has definitely seen better days.  Paint was peeling or missing from some doors, especially at the front entrance.  The breakfast/dining area is to the left of the main doors and had a fair number of tables and booths.  Large groups are at a disadvantage as there are several columns around which make it difficult to sit comfortably if/when tables are moved around.  Once the elevator door opened, I expected to see a sign directing me towards my room, but I didn't see it.  Once I took the other elevator up, I spotted it.  Room numbers are not placed where you can see them easily when just walking down the hallway.  Some face the opposite direction, some face the hallway, just bad placing throughout.Room:  the room was spacious and clean.  There is a serious lack of plugs for multiple electronic devices, so I had them all over just to get them charged.Staff:  I didn't deal with many of the staff.  From what I noticed, there aren't enough staff for peak periods.  The main desk had 5 people standing at it with one associate, who was trying his best to help them.  There was an individual come out of the back office and then disappeared right back in, though there were now 7 people in the lobby waiting to check in.  The associate was able to disengage himself from the 5 people in front of me and had me checked in within 3 minutes.  I ate at the restaurant, which was filled with people (mostly having drinks) and he was the only staff member I noticed in the area.  Kudos to him for keeping track of it all and staying polite, professional, and courteous.Wi-fi:  absolutely no problems with the wireless!Overall, for a single night, this is not a bad hotel.  It's just not the best either.  The room was comfortable and clean and the food (dinner) was good.  The building needs some care and updating to match some of the other HI properties I've visited.Not Holiday Inn anymore. It's a Cottonwood suites. Dump dump dump. Do everything in your power to not even look at this place when you drive-by. Elevators been down for two days. Fire alarm was going off for three hours when I checked in. Hotel staff might as well not exist. You would be better off sleeping at the Circle K next-door.Hotel room:  Met our needs; clean, modern enough, and I like that they have shampoo and a hair dryer that I've come to take for granted in my selection of hotels.  Bed was king-sized and the bed and pillows were comfortable.  TV sound wouldn't go very loud (don't know if that's on purpose or not).  Curtains aren't full width of window leaving just the sheers in place when the sun comes up.  I'd rather have all my curtain in place, thank you very much.Staff:  pleasant and courteous.  Management may want desk staff to be just a ""little"" bit more cautious; however.  We locked ourselves out of our room and all we had to do was say for what room we wanted a new key... hmmm.    The restaurant server was very gracious.  We had neglected to pay -- meaning someone in my party signed the check but neither gave a credit card nor put the room number on it.  When we came downstairs to check-out, she kindly pointed out that maybe we forgot to put the room number on the check.  She was so sweet about our mistake.Restaurant:  Meh.... Pancakes weren't that great (but, to be honest, I've become extremely picky now that we make our own from scratch).  But, I do have a bone to pick about advertising on the menu that they serve maple syrup with the pancakes.  Those little self-encased containers say ""Mrs. Butterworth's original syrup"".  Nowhere does it claim itself to be maple syrup.  Sorry; it's the snob in me since I lived in New England and they would advertise ""real"" maple syrup when it was available.Price:  We bid on our hotel via Priceline so it was a good deal and, yes, the location was where I wanted/needed it to be for this trip.Location:  If your goal is to be in the southend of Louisville, then the location is fine.  It is close to the Watterson Expressway (I-264) and all kinds of amenities are on Dixie Highway near the hotel from gas stations to pharmacies to fast food and sit down restaurants.Nice clean room. Friendly staff. Easy to get to, close to the freeway. Close to Iroqouis Amphitheater which was good for us in town for a concert.Clean bed. Clean hotel in general. Professional, courteous, and efficient staff. Super convenient to 265 and airport. Not a super nice area but a decent value if you aren't using any of the amenities. 15 minutes or so from U of L campus.A CVS and Walgreens close by but don't expect a lot of food choices in the area if you are used to big-city dining. Food at the hotel and in the surrounding area is strictly middle-America and should come with a side of Lipator and insulin. Not saying that the cheese grits and biscuits at the hotel were bad, far from it, they were SUPER awesome, but I should only eat them every other year.Nice clean place to stay!This hotel has been around for a while but has been maintained very well. Spacious rooms, flat screen, and comfortable beds. This is a nice place to stay.UPDATE: After my complaint to the corporate website, my fellow traveler and I had a conversation with the manager of this hotel (pursuant to our call for fresh towels). He was very, very apologetic and wanted to make sure that the rest of our stay was very much improved. He identified with us on a personal level and went out of his way to make up for the tragedy that was our first three days. I've added a star for his personal attention and I'll update again after our stay._____________________________OK...This is a very pricey hotel for a ""motel"" experience. Not to be picky, but our room smells like beachhouse, the decor is very early '90s, there's no microwave or fridge, the one-cup coffeemaker leaks everywhere, maid service is sporadic, continental breakfast was not included, wifi is only in the lobby (though they're working on expanding the wifi to all floors), and the neighborhood isn't the best. When we got in, none of the lamps worked. Apparently the hotel has a problem with vandals. Visitors routinely steal lightbulbs and pull other pranks. What I discovered is that all of the plug outlets are so old that the plugs just fall out of them. I'm glad I brought a car charger.The wired connection wasn't working when I got in and it took two maintenance calls and a phone call to tech support before they would listen to me. Convo: Me: ""I think there's something wrong with the router."" Maintenance Man #1: ""What's a router?"" Me: ""The box. I think there's something wrong with the box."" Maintenance Man #1: ""No there's not. The lights are all on."" Me: I travel a lot and use wired internet frequently. My computer is working fine. I think there is something wrong with the box. Look at the diagnostics printout I did."" Maintenance Man #1: You're going to have to call the number. Where's your information card? Oh you don't have one. I'll get it..."" The tech support spent an hour getting me to reset the router, which I'd kind of done already because the power cord kept falling out of the wall. Then, when that miraculously didn't fix the problem, they promised to send an ""engineer."" Maintenance Man #2 was kind enough to admit he didn't know anything about computers and brought me a new ""box."" PROBLEM SOLVED. I guess the worst part was how rude the front desk was when I called about it. The lady thought I was calling about the wifi and got into a nasty argument with me about the whole thing. I guess that's what happens when you don't actually listen to what the customer is asking about. And at that point, my frustration level was actually fairly low so I don't think I was the rude one!Not to knock all the staff. The young woman that checked us in on Saturday was very efficient and sweet, and I greatly appreciate Frank for getting me the new box. And our room was very clean.So, yeah, $1,300 for 7 days? I don't think so!! Worst Holiday Inn experience so far.Gentlemen at front desk was very friendly when I checked in and rest of staff very pleasant when passed by in hallway.  This is a very old holiday inn that has some renovations, but definitely could use more!  Also, not best part of town to be staying, but was never bothered!  HUGE complaint though about dry cleaning.  Left my dry cleaning night before to make sure it was there in enough time.  Came back to pick it up next day and was told contract wasn't renewed with dry cleaner so did not get done and would have to wait until tomorrow!  Only thing offered as ""customer service"" was free breakfast!  If you are looking for place to lay your head, this is the place.  Want above and beyond customer service...go somewhere else!It did its job. The staff was overwhelmingly friendly, the room was clean, pool maintained and though it seemed to be on the edge of a seedy neighborhood, the parking lot was secure. My family enjoyed the experience and I would stay there again if it worked into my travel schedule. Once again, the thing that makes it most memorable was the friendly, helpful attitude of the staff.Not the best hotel I've ever stayed at, but I didn't have any problems. Staff was nice and brought us extra towels within a couple minutes of asking. If you have business around Shivley area, airport, fair grounds, Churchill downs, or Expo5 it is perfect! Several restaurants, and other stores in the area, for conscience factor! Rooms were clean and well maintained!",,,,,"['night', 'business', 'exterior', 'grounds', 'appeared', 'clean', 'presentable', 'attempting', 'parking', 'lot', 'bit', 'hassle', 'came', 'freeway', 'turn',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-louisville-2,Hilton Garden Inn,3.5,$$,12,"Let's be honest. I picked this hotel because it was relatively close to (20 minutes) the Kentucky Derby Marathon and was priced right. Easy to find and a breeze to check into. My only complaint was the ever-so-tempting list of happy hour drink specials taunting me from the check-in desk. Any other night, I would have been in the very welcoming-looking bar with a cocktail (or three) in hand.The front desk attendant was efficient and, when she noticed a man walk up, made a point of telling me where I could find my room number written, rather than speaking it aloud. Nice touch I hadn't thought of. Housekeeping missed the pile of used towels from the previous guests, but the front desk handled it like a dream when I called to request a fresh set of towels. I said ""no rush"", but a well dressed and very polite gal showed up almost instantly. Moments later, another brought vouchers for complementary cocktails and apps. When everything else is the same (beds, running water...), it comes down to the people.Our overall experience was positive and for the price of $89+tax it was a decent value for a HGI.  The lobby was spotless and we were warmly greeted by the front desk staff.  Pros: The room was clean and free Wi-Fi included. A small bar is in the hotel lobby, which is a nice convenience to the guests who wish to have a drink. Of course the prices are higher, but it is a nice amenity. Location, Location, Location. The hotel is in the middle of a fabulous shopping complex.  Cons: The hot tub was closed by order of the health department (hmm?). A buffet breakfast was available for purchase for $9.99 each.  No options were available for the traveler who would like a quick bite/to-go.  The bed was ok.  Since HGI and Hampton Inns are owned by the same umbrella corporation, HGI should look at incorporating the bedding from HI.Friendly staff. Clean rooms.  The location isn't as close to downtown as one might hope. But...the location is close to shopping,  food,  grocery and freeway.I chose this hotel based on the proximity to the Norton Brownsboro Hospital, literally a 3 minute drive. It is also located behind a large shopping center which features many restaurants and the much needed Starbucks.PROS: Clean, great location, free wi-fiCONS: Pricey...$189 a night  and no complimentary breakfastI've heard there is a big convention in town, perhaps that's why the price is so high. In a nutshell I think this place is A-OK, no complaints. I would stay here again if I need to come back to see the great doctors at Norton's.Not the best Hilton I've ever stayed at but the location is great. My husband stays here often for business and when we (myself and two small kids) travel with him this offers a great location and a nice pool.  Great new shopping center and restaurants (including Starbucks!) is within walking distance, there is a grocery across the street (great perk when traveling with small kids), and downtown Louisville is only about 25 minutes away.Next time I am in Louisville, I will most likely stay here. I would give the hotel a 5 star rating, but would like to have received more assistance with recommendations of things to do while in town from the staff. Absolutely no complaints about the property at all. Friendly staff, nice spacious rooms, clean pool, hot tub, bathrooms, great lobby and dining areas, and very modern decor throughout! I was also very impressed that my sister and her small group were allowed to come over from across town, as we booked separate hotels for a convention, and staff allowed them to hang out at the pool for a while with us. They also allowed us to use the pool a little longer than the noted close time. Very appreciative, since we are not from the Louisville area, and didn't realize the distance between our two hotels!  Would love to see them on Twitter so I can share the love! p.s. HGI staff, if you are reading, feel free to ask for my assistance! @nickilaycoaxOh Conrad how you woo me. Oh Conrad, yes I'll stay the night, but you're sleeping on the pull out. Your hospitality competition in The Holiday Inn (on Hurstbourne) was blocked off for a wedding I was coming to town for. Then, while stuck in traffic I thought: ""hmmm, Mr. Holiday, could you really be better than ole man Conrad?"" And lo! the Holiday Inn that we planned for is getting 2 stars on Yelp and there were the immortal words: ""bed bugs,"" and ""blood."" And when those two phrases used together or separately have me running back into the terry-clothed arms of Conrad. We found this HGI on Yelp, we called, answer immediately, with open arms, they have a King room available and for early check in. This HGI is either really new or has undergone all the modern updates. Squeaky clean with plush pillows high thread count sheets. A new iron in the room. If we were staying any longer I would have found myself in the fireside front waiting area with the leather empire chairs and Hi Def TV. This place is located behind the monstrosity that is a mall, ""The Summit,"" so enter through the parking lot and weave all the way to the back. Needless to say I was driving into Louisville fearing ""blood on the comforter,"" and ""case of the bed bugs,"" at Holiday Inn, and then Conrad with his Garden Inn swoops in and saves the day with a slick, simple, comfortable, same price ($99) stay instead.This is a good HGI - pretty much the standard, good service and facility.I guess the one thing to mention is that the hotel is not the easiest to get to - it's off the highway (which gets very congested in the morning/evening rush hour, just FYI), and then you have to go through or around a little shopping mall area.  It was dark(ish) and I was tired, and so actually getting to the hotel took a few twists and turns.But then, I got there.  And oh, the beds.  Nice. :)I live here in Louisville so I do not stay here but sometimes use the business services and wifi (with permission of course). The staff couldn't be nicer, very clean public areas. Would certainly stay at this chain anywhere based on this location.This is a very nice hotel and offers both free wired and wireless access to the Internet that connects very well at decent speeds.But when I tried to hook up my laptop to the wide-screen TV it refused to let me change the source input.  The system would always change itself back to the pay-per-view preview channel.  Screw that! I want to watch my on content rather than pay Hilton more money for the few choices they offer.  I would recommend this hotel to business or geek travelers but I CAN'T!  Locking down the TV's input options is a deal breaker for me.  I know from experience that there are plenty of other hotels that don't do this that I can go to for less money per night.Well, after 50 years of being comfortably ensconced at ""home"" whenever I came to visit my parents-my Mom moved into a condo, necessiating ""relocating"" my family on visits to this hotel. First, if you are from/connected to the east end of Louisville, you will not believe the development out KY 22 past Ballard High School. The hotel itself was fine. The room had the heaviest door known to man-and I travel a lot professionally. Hotel was clean. Pool was nice albeit small- though they were slow to clean it up in the mornings from the prior evening on a weekend. My biggest gripe is they ran my folio through in the middle of the afternoon prior to our departure leading me to have a conniption and overdrawn on an account as I was planning on paying from a differnet bank account. The staff handled the problem but be forwarned ""that is their policy"" and make sure you give them the credit card you want to charged from.Other than that, it would be nice if they offered free breakfast for the rate they charge which was just $10 less than I paid in Chicago on this trip at a hotel right off Michigan Avenue.very nice , very well kept, in a very nice area, lots of shopping and restaraunts, pool was great, not crowded at all, warm cookies at the front desk , the only 2 issues are the bar closed at like 10 pm on a saturday nite !!!! during march madness? and the other issue was the girls softball team who were in town thought that everyone in the hotel wants to be woken up by loud mouthed teenage girls , and that the parents who were watching these girls would have had the courtesy to tell them to keep the noise down at 5 am , but hey todays generation are full of rude teenagers who think the world owes them everything",,,,,"['let', 'honest', 'picked', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-louisville-downtown-louisville,Fairfield Inn & Suites Louisville Downtown,3.5,$$,18,"I'm a basic person and its your average hotel - clean with a super comfy bed and pillows plus your average tv, desk, fridge, and coffee. I'm super down with the continental hot breakfast and there are several coffee varieties prepared and ready all throughout the day in the lobby. We stayed in the conference room as well, and it was pretty good. No complaints. And very nice for a price that is quite cheaper than other places.Just okay for a Fairfield property, likely would not stay again.First, this is an older property and is split with Springhill Suites - the same building with interconnecting floors, but separate entrances and check ins. The floor layouts are quite wonky - the wayfinding isn't great so its very easy to cross over to the other hotel and end up in the wrong lobby by mistake. The only real clue is the color change in the carpet - Springhill is green and Fairfield is orange.Second, as a few others have noted the A/C does not work well. I had it turned down to 65 yet it never got any colder than 74 in my room. Mind you, it was not a hot day so imagine what things would be like in high summer! I didn't check in until after 9pm and frankly, I was exhausted or I would have asked to be moved or for someone to fix it. On the plus side, I really did not hear any traffic noise despite the hotel being near the expressway.Third, the shower stall in my bathroom was gross! There was definite mold in the corners and part of the floor looked just plain dirty. I was tempted to wear my sandals, so it wasn't good.On the positive side, the staff I interacted with was very pleasant and the free breakfast was about what I'd expect from Fairfield (decent). Wifi is free and wasn't the fastest but I was able to connect. Again, had I arrived earlier I definitely would have asked for a room change but ultimately my first impression was ""definitely staying somewhere else next time, especially for $189/night!!""My usual hotel was sold out due to a convention, so I ended up staying at the Fairfield Inn. I had a very pleasant stay. My room was not spacious, but that's not something I care a whole lot about. The bed and pillows, which I do care about, were very comfortable. The room was clean and tidy, and the housekeepers did a great job of keeping it that way throughout my visit. My first night was a little loud because the hotel was filled with a teenage baseball team. It was a lot quieter after they left. I always appreciate the little things, like having plenty of outlets. The hotel provided a small hub with two A/C outlets and two USB ports. My geeky husband and I really appreciated that, with our two cell phones, a Kindle, and laptop between us.A strong hotel for the price but about two blocks in the wrong direction of downtown. Not having a restaurant here makes you have to go out for dinner but please do not walk around too late. Complimentary breakfast in the morning for everyone.Good indoor pool for children with full windows outside. Parking is split between outside and inside and though they have spots ""reserved"" for Marriott Elite members; the front desk noted they do not check if Elite members are parked there or not.The staff are very kind and attentive and since I'm working late hours, I appreciate delivery can come right to my hotel door instead of me having to go down to the lobby.My only issue with this hotel is the knat problem in their dining room. I was having a glass of wine and working and had to leave after 3 minutes because of the bugs. The moment I left my wine glass out of my hands, 6 nats where on the glass having their party.Nice, clean hotel. I stayed there for a conference at the Louisville Convention center, which is a short two block walk. Staff was helpful and room was quiet, which isn't always the case in many hotels.We had a great experience. We were traveling with my parents. My Dad accidentally dropped the keys in the vehicle. They wound up so far underneath the console we could not reach them. Mark at the Fairfield got a socket set out of his vehicle and assisted me with removing the colsole to get the keys. It was at night, and nearing zero outside. Mark could have just said ""sorry about your luck"" but went above and beyond in helping. Hotel smelled clean. Rooms were very nice, very clean. Quiet. All of the Staff were very nice. Breakfast not that great, but it's not a restaurant. Parking was convenient.Everything. Everything was great. Especially for the price. Hotel staff was very kind, room was very cleaned. Cleaned it while we were out and about and I can back to my clothes neatly folded and my things organized nicely. The woman who cleaned the rooms left us some towel art that looked like a dog, which I thought was super cool. If I'm ever in Louisville again I will stay there. The breakfast was great, with a waffle maker to make your own waffles! The coffee was always hot and pretty good, especially compared to what I have gotten from other hotels. I'm very pleased with everything and will stay again if I need to!Stayed here for Thunder weekend. Staff was friendly but our AC was broke all weekend. 80+ degrees  in Louisville and no AC, yea.When I brought it to their attention that it hadn't been fixed, I was told I was the person who was wrong. I can't sleep because it's too hot in my room and I'm apparently the one who is wrong.Despite some friendly greetings, staff is horrendous at addressing guest issues. I strongly suggest staying elsewhere. My father is a loyal Marriott member and I couldn't disagree with him more on the level of service and satisfaction for the price point.Excellent hotel for the price - great location and clean, very spacious rooms.Decent breakfast - the breakfast lady was REALLY friendly :)For the price it's pretty nice. Staff were extremely friendly, every single one of them. Room was large and clean. Breakfast food was ok, I'm sure it's due to there limited cooking options, but for free it is a deal. Breakfast staff was so pleasant though it totally made up for the heat and serve food.I stayed at this Fairfield Inn on a recent trip to Louisville.  Marriott is one of the brands I prefer to stay at when I'm on the road.  This one certainly didn't let me down.  The hotel is located right downtown and is co-located with another Marriott property, SpingHill Suites.I was afraid that parking would be a problem (as it often is with downtown locations), but they have a guest registration parking right out front.  The hotel also has a parking deck and private lot.  The lobby is the standard Fairfield inn package.  It's clean and inviting.  The guy behind the desk was friendly and welcoming.  He checked me in quickly and was able to help me with some local information.  This is a great location, as it's only three blocks from Fourth Street Live, which is Louisville's restaurant and entertainment district.  It's a short walk, and I never felt unsafe walking between the hotel and Fourth Street Live.  The rooms, while not that spacious and very clean and serviceable.  Housekeeping does a great job with keeping the rooms neat and tidy.  I was pleasantly surprised to come back to my room one night and found that my housekeeper had made some ""towel art"" and left it on my bed.  The bed was very comfortable and the room comes with a flat screen TV, and a desk to work at.  There are plenty of electrical outlets around the desk for all my devices that need charging at night.  All of the furniture was in good condition too.  The air conditioning worked very well.All of the employees were very friendly and accommodating.  The breakfast host was very friendly and always smiling, the front desk staff were all very nice too.  This was a great place to stay during my trip to Louisville.   This was a great hotel.  I will certainly stay here again the next time I visit Louisville.Large Clean Room, a short walking distance to YUM Center, Love the convieance for concert however no bar for a late night snack or drink! They have a cooler you can purchase from but totally lacking a full service bar!Booked a room for Valentine's Weekend. Room was quite overpriced and very small. The connecting room was very noisy. Luckily this was a pleasure trip and I wasn't in town for work. Very small TV, maybe 19"". Bed felt quite lumpy and there was no internet. I'm no decorator; but the colors made my eyes hurt. The rooms you view online must be at a different property. Also, is an additional fee that wasn't mentioned until check in. This hotel is in the same building as another hotel. You must walk through one to get to the other. All in all, the room was clean, the bed sucked, the linen was rough and temperature couldn't be controlled.I probable should have known this based on the price but these guys left out a few things that we have all come to expect in a hotel...a frig and internet. I was surprised that there is no frig and that internet is at additional costs. I did expect parking to be at an additional costs though. Having said that, there is a free internet option that I am currently using to post this. Hopefully its good enough for light duty  (or I'm out of here). I'll update this post tomorrow after I've been here and had a chance to look over the place. First impression is good though.Stayed at Fairfield for the 2013 Ironman and they were fantastic.Upon arrival, they informed me that they'd have water and Gatorade available at the front desk for the duration of my stay. Other thoughtful gestures: they offered grease rags for if I needed to clean my bike; they had me park in the lower level so as to ensure that the parking garage gate didn't close on my bike rack; they had bag breakfasts available beginning Saturday evening all the way into the early Sunday morning hours so that we could have something on race day; they kept breakfast open late on Monday, the day after the race, because they knew people would be slow getting up; they had race maps and materials at the front desk; they served complimentary beer, water and Gatorade to finishers as they returned to the hotel Sunday afternoon/evening. The staff was very responsive and the rooms were typical of a Fairfield. I highly recommend that Ironman athletes consider staying here as it's only a few blocks from transition, the finish, and the swim start.We stayed here for one night in July in a king room using points.Pros: good water pressure, clean, big room, surprisingly quiet overall in the room (lots of children in the building)! Staff was friendlyCons:While I normally ignore the hotel decor in the lobby and halls as I don't generally agree with Marriott's combinations, this seemed particularly awful. Too many colors and patterns like they put together what was on sale. The rooms aren't much better.The shower only had one small place for your soaps. Definitely tight for even the travel size shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. I had to put mine on the floor No refrigeratorThe sockets in the lamp were really lose making it impossible to keep a connection and charge devices.Towels are roughOdd: Its great that they have parking on the premises but it's odd: because of the various entry points you could end up going through three checkpoints where you have to swipe your room key to get to the next part of the lotI remain a loyal Marriott fan, and a fan of most Fairfield Inn Properties. This facility was nice and very well located in downtown Louisville. My only gripe is that I originally was going to say only one night. When I used my Marriott app to cancel and book the room for two nights, my nightly rate went up $10 per night. So I went with two reservations figuring I could get it straightened out when I checked in. Unfortunately, one reservation was for 2 queens and the other for 1 king with a cot. I asked if I could keep either room for two nights and they said no, they'd have to move me after the first night. So, we left after the first night.The hotel itself was very nice. The hotel is in good shape and had a modern design. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. When we got there, they had sold-out of the other rooms and we were placed in a handicap room. We didn't mind except for a few minor changes in the bathroom. The hotel is one of the cheaper non-motel kind of places in louisville, but is still not cheap. The location is good enough. In walking distance to 4th st live and a few other places downtown. We were told by various people when we got there though that the better place to go for night life was bards town st which we were quite some ways away from (probably need to take a cab to get there). The only downside for us was that Louisville was a complete ghost town on a Monday night! It seems like the whole city closes and there is no one walking around or even bars open past midnight. We had never seen anything like it in such a large city. The hotel staff was super great though! We checked in with them the next morning to see if we could cancel our reservation for that night and check out without any penalties. We thought they probably wouldn't do it, but they were sold-out that evening, so they were very flexible and accommodating and let us cancel our reservation for no penalty so that we could move on to a different city and enjoy our vacation. We would definitely stay here again!",,,,,"['basic', 'person', 'average', 'hotel', 'clean', 'super', 'comfy', 'bed', 'pillows', 'plus', 'average', 'desk', 'fridge', 'coffee', 'super', 'continental',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-louisville-hurstborne-north-louisville,SpringHill Suites Louisville Hurstborne/North,3.5,$$,12,"This is a fine hotel located in a nice garden setting within quick driving distance of many major attractions, malls, and restaurants in Louisville.  Our lodging here during a two-night stay was in a very fine one-bedroom king suite, which boasted a contemporary flat-screen TV, comfortable sofa, writing desk, and wet bar.  On the ground floor was a fairly large indoor swimming pool and separate hot whirlpool spa with vigorous back-soothing jets.  A daily hot breakfast was also included in the reasonable room price.    Hotel staff were helpful and accommodating.  The printer in the community lounge area was broken and a new one still on order, so an attendant at the front desk graciously printed our boarding passes for us without charge.  I will readily stay here again when next traveling to Louisville, which I found to be a city imbued with a thoroughbred's high level of breeding, and remarkable dining that embraces both fine and humble fare.I admit, I booked this hotel for two reasons. Its location immediately next to my office and it's a Marriott property. Luckily the hotel didn't disappoint, however that's not to say that the hotel wasn't without a few minor issues. SpringHill Suites, is a moderate- tier hotel compared to other Marriott properties, however its only lacking when compared to other brands under the Marriott name. The room itself was spacious, with a large seating area with a comfortable sofa with a wet bar complete with a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Located immediately behind the wet bar is a large desk which has plenty of workspace to catch up on some work or just browse the web. Wi-Fi is free and available, however I didn't see any wired connections. The TV is actually located in the middle of the living area and the bedroom, which makes it a little awkward. The bed itself was large and comfortable however the pillows were just not right. Another problem is that the AC unit is located directly next to the bed, which makes you want to just pull up all the covers on you just to stay comfortable. The bathroom itself was large, with the sink separate from the rest of the shower and toilet, which was a nice touch. Breakfast is also available however it is limited to eggs, sausage, and oatmeal as your only hot items. There is a toaster available, if you want toast however unlike other properties you will not find a waffle maker here. Fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, and mini muffins are also available so you can still grab a quick meal on your way out the door. SpringHill Suites does offer a decent value, however I feel that they are geared more towards a short stay. I still prefer Residence Inn as they tend to offer the most value to me on extended business trips.Wtf Springhill?! Your pull out beds are useless because when unfolded it creates a complete barrier for the other half of the room. It's an obvious violation to the fire code.I am currently staying at this hotel and, unfortunately, I must give it a bad review.  The primary reason for this is that this is another one of those hotels that gives you nice-looking big lumpy pillows that are practically impossible to sleep on because they keep you neck &amp; head at a minimum 45 deg. angle.When I entered the room, the light did not work so I had to fumble around in the dark to find a light.  The air conditioner was on cool (and the room really cold) even though it is below freezing outside.  The shower was good at least and all the plumbing functioned well.  The shower head plumbing was not well fixed to the wall studs so it moved around way too much (maintenance issue).Lastly, the breakfast was not brought out on time.  It was 5 minutes late, but that should not happen.I was disappointed.  The hotel is nice enough, but it falls short in a few key areas.The hotel looks very nice.  It seems the hotel was renovated to modernize the look and feel.  The problem is the modern looks are fighting the function of a hotel room.  My wife and I were baffled by a few key points:1. There is no dresser.  You have no place to unpack clothes to.2. There is nowhere to set anything - no counter in the bathroom, no dresser, no coffee table, etc.  3. The TV was positioned such that it could not be comfortably viewed from the couch or the bed.  In fact, we moved the entire TV stand as far the cable would allow (maybe 4 or 5 feet) and it still wasn't enjoyable.  4. The breakfast area was far too small and didn't have enough space for more than a small handful of people to eat.  The breakfast was mediocre at bestThe hotel simply didn't feel comfortable.  We had no desire to stay and checked out early to go check into another hotel the next night.This is particularly disappointing as a Marriott Rewards member considering the hotel was just bumped up to Category 5 when it should probably rate at Category 3.Such a cute hotel!! Staff was incredibly friendly! My stay here was very comfortable. The rooms are a decent size and it was very very clean. Will definitely stay here again when I visit Louisvile next year!I reserved the room through Frontier airlines (so it was already paid for) for a one night stay. The room was nice and the staff was friendly. BUT a few days later I noticed that they charged me for the room not realizing that I had already paid through Frontier. I understand mistakes happen so I called and the lady I spoke with said she will have to get a manager to refund the charge and will call me back the following day. Three days and no call so I call them back and they get my card information to refund the charge and assured me that the refund will be reflected on my account in 1-2 days. More days pass and still nothing. Called them back again today and it looks like they never even attempted the refund but promised to try again and will call me in a few days... this is very unprofessional and negligent. I shouldn't have to call several times a week and continuously remind them that they need to refund a charge made in error. Terrible customer service.Very clean and friendly staff at this hotel. Stayed here during the KY derby. It was about 12 miles away. I would stay here again if needed. Love Marriott.Couldn't have been a better spot for a family with two twins under two. We arrived late on Thanksgiving and were warmly greeted and as we entered our room to our surprise they had already set up two high quality pack n plays for our girls to slumber in.  As we awake in the morning we went downstairs for the complimenatry breakfast which was actually pretty darned good and made our life much easier as there were great options for our girls including oatmeal, fresh fruit and yogurt. The only downside was that we didn't like the pillows on the bed but because the overall experience was so good we'll just bring out own next time as well as our bathing suits. Well done SpringHill! We'll be back!Clean and nice updated Springhill - seemed to be in better shape then the other couple of Marriott chains in the area, so I am glad we landed here. Friendly staff, nice hot tub, small pool though. Easy access on and off the highway to get to downtown Louisville quickly without paying to stay downtown.As a side note - you should be warned. The toilet has the handle on the LEFT SIDE!!! It doesn't seem bad now... but spend four nights there and you will understand my suffering. Its just weird!New, very clean.  Great staff.  Love the bedroom with the little kitchen.  Free breakfast and internet too.Wonderful place to stay. Neat and bug free. Amazing breakfast and treatment. such a nice place for very reasonable pricing. Book in advance for better deals. Very close to lot of places. PF changs, starbucks, indian restaurants n other restaurants are very close. Very good location and quiet place to stay. Most facilities are available including free breakfast and internet. There is a pool and work out area. I would stay again.",,,,,"['fine', 'hotel', 'located', 'nice', 'garden', 'setting', 'within', 'quick', 'driving', 'distance', 'many', 'major', 'attractions', 'malls', 'restaurants', 'lodging',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/1888-historic-rocking-horse-manor-b-and-b-louisville,1888 Historic Rocking Horse Manor B & B,5.0,$$,11,"This is without a doubt the BEST bed and breakfast EVER!When we arrived, Ricardo, one of the owners, gave us the amazing grand tour of this beautiful house.  He was extremely helpful and assisted us in how to begin our Louisville journey.  The historic background and the restoration of this home will definitely pique your interest.  The common area on the third floor has a refrigerator for guests to use.  There are also complementary drinks in it for your enjoyment.  The first floor had complementary chips, cookies, and fruit if you need a snack while you are here.We stayed in Chelsea's Garden room and it was clean and comfortable.  The claw foot tub was very cool and the shower pressure was great.  The thing I loved the most about this place is the courtyard.  There is so much to see in Louisville but you have to have some relaxation time.  There is nothing better than this courtyard for relaxing with a glass of wine.  John, the other owner, has worked very hard on creating this ""garden of eden"" so the guests can enjoy their visit.  I brought plastic cups for my wine and he insisted on bringing me a wine glass.  Everyone knows wine tastes better in glass, but some people frown upon glass as it breaks occasionally and causes a mess.Breakfast choices were between egg dishes or pancakes.  The first morning we chose souffle.  It was a two course breakfast.  There was yogurt with fruit and granola and a banana muffin for the first course.  The second course was an egg and cheese souffle with ham and hash browns.  The food was fantastic.  Not only are they amazing host but they can cook.Ricardo and John are incredible and will do everything to make sure your stay is incredible.Stayed here with a guy I was seeing, for my Birthday.Wonderful bed and breakfast.. Very friendly informative staff, beautiful architecture, restored Victorian mansion, lovely romantic suite, pink hottub!!, beautiful city.... A bit pricey -more than a hotel, but definitely worth it. Highly recommend if you're staying in Louisville for a night.I wish I could have stayed here all week. My husband and I arrived exhausted, coming from Pittsburgh. The owners made us feel at home immediately and gave us a tour of the house, pointing out historical facts, and the location of complimentary cookies. The house is full of interesting decorations and beautiful stained glass, with little touches like a bottle of port and dozens of rocking horses. There is a lovely library that was once a gentlemen's smoking room, and a charming formal dining room. There is a courtyard in the back with a porch and plenty of greenery where I could have imagined sitting with a typewriter all afternoon a hundred years ago. On the top floor, there is a more informal, laid back sitting room with free waters and soda, as well as board games and movies. I spent about a half hour wandering around with my camera with plenty of interesting things to shoot.We stayed in the Irish Rose room, a small but comfortable room with a full-size bed. It had stained glass and a private balcony over the front of the house. The shower was high pressure, and everything was very clean. Where the Rocking Horse most excelled was in the details. Good-quality liquid soap in the shower, a corkscrew on the chest of drawers, a scale in the wardrobe. All the little things that you have at home but not on the road that, when present while traveling, make life a lot easier. We had breakfast in the morning in the dining room, and it was to-die-for. There was a choice of quiche or french toast, and we both ordered the quiche. The first course was yogurt with granola and what I believe was a sweet cheese strudel type bread. The second course was the quiche, which was crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. It was served with sauteed potatoes, finely diced, which were equally flavorful. The owners went out of their way to make sure I had decaf coffee, and everything was served with coffee and/or tea, orange juice and water.Owners Jon and Ricardo gave us advice on where to eat and what to do and see. Jon recommended Shakespeare in the Park and a visit to St. James Square to see the gas lamps and fountain among dozens of beautiful Victorian houses--just a 10-15 minute walk from the Rocking Horse.Definitely one of the most luxurious places I have stayed, and for a wonderful price.If you have tried B&amp;B's after having practically lived on road and staying in a multitude of hotels you probably understand the allure of a good B&amp;B. Rocking Horse Manor is a great one. A comfortable, conveniently located oasis in Louisville. John and Ricardo are gracious hosts and provide nice touches for an enjoyable stay. Historical elegance with a nod to modern conveniences, i.e., glass enclosed walk-in shower with two shower heads, dual sink vanity, jacuzzi-style tub, and even a bidet in Grand Victorian Suite bathroom! Stay here and you'll want to come back when staying in Louisville.We love this place and we're locals! Spent Valentines, New Years Eve and other occasions when we don't feel like traveling far. They make the best breakfast, and we have been able to try different rooms.We also like the upstairs reading room. Last time we were there I realized the next day that I left my cell phone charger. And sure enough they found it, and I didn't have to wait at all when I went to retrieve it. They are gracious hosts who truly understand hospitality.  It is a beautiful, memorable place in a charming part of Louisville. Look no further -- this is where you want to be!What a wonderful place to stay.  Beautiful, comfortable accommodations with a breakfast to die for.  The hosts are friendly and very knowledgeable tour guides; of their own property and Old Louisville.  This is a must-stay place.My girlfriend made me research B&amp;B reviews and prices for 2 hours.  Just save yourself the time and pick this one.  It is the best B&amp;B we have ever seen.  The mansion is amazingly restored and decorated with attention to details.  Our room was clean, quiet, and cozy.  The breakfast was delicious and we are both people that enjoy fine foods.  Their website needs work, but then again you're not staying at a website.  The location is close to down town Louisville. We walked the area and saw some great homes and architecture.  Again... just save yourself the time and go with the Rocking Horse Manor.  It's the best.We have been to a LOT of B&amp;B's but NONE compare...We first stayed here 7 years ago and fell in love with Old Towne Louisville and the Rocking Horse Manor.  John &amp; Ricardo actually allowed us to get married in their parlor!  We have returned every year since.  The accommodations are beautiful, the hospitality incomparable.  John and Ricardo treats their guest just like family!LOVED staying here!!! Came in to town not knowing too much about Louisville, other than the fact it's the derby capital of the world. Jon and Ricardo gave us a gorgeous room to stay in. Very private. We pretty much had the place to ourselves while vacationing there, and the owners were always around to help us out if need be. Except once, but they warned us they were going away for a few hours...A very scary tornado came through Louisville during our stay at the Rocking Horse, and Jon and Ricardo happened to be out then. Being dumb Californians (inexperienced in tornado happenings), we battered down in fear and excitement (with bed comforters and wine) under the centuries old staircase in the ""lobby"".  Those sirens outside were terrifying! The electricity went out. Guests were saying it was passing right through us. Ahhhhhh!!! Well, the storm passed, without any harm. We felt like idiots, making a reeeeeeally big deal of the situation, but Jon and Ricardo made us feel ok about it.Fantastic breakfasts, comfy night's rest, and in a great location to see all the fun Louisville sights!The owners Jon and Ricardo could not have made the stay any better. They gave us a free room upgrade, breakfast was delicious. When we asked for a dinner recommendation, they sent us to a neighborhood in louisville that was exactly what we were looking for. To top it off, the actual house is a wonder by itself. Next time I find myself in Louisville, I know where I will be staying. The service, atmosphere, and price beat out all the hotels we looked into.I had a wonderful weekend stay here over Valentine's Day.  The owners Jon and Ricardo were extremely friendly and offered lots of suggestions for things to see in the area, as well as map and directions.  We had two choices for breakfast each morning: one sweet (pancakes or waffles) and one savory (quiche).  All the choices were delicious.  They served breakfast in an adorable dining room with formal china and glasses.  The rooms were really cute and extremely spacious.  They were also very well-priced.  Because of its name, the inn is decorated with rocking horses scattered around (I counted at least 9 in the public rooms).  For some reason, they also decorated with old-fashioned shoes, which was pretty funny.  If I were ever in Louisville again, I would definitely stay here.",,,,,"['without', 'doubt', 'best', 'bed', 'breakfast', 'ever', 'arrived', 'owners', 'gave', 'amazing', 'grand', 'tour', 'beautiful',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-louisville-2,Homewood Suites,4.5,$$,13,"So impressed with this hotel! From the friendly employees at the check in desk to the spacious suite with great kitchenette, we very much enjoyed our stay! We will be recommending this hotel to our friends and family!We were in town for a wedding and stayed here this past weekend. We were impressed with the room. We were in a suite on the 4th floor and it was very nice. The bed was comfy, the breakfast each morning was great, and it was very clean. The surrounding area was nice, as well. The only thing that was a bit of a drag was the lady at the desk on Saturday afternoon and Sunday. She was not very friendly. My husband is a Diamond member and when we were walking out the door on Saturday to go to another hotel to hang out w/ family at the pool, my husband asked if he was supposed to get any water bottles as usually Hilton hotels give that and cookies to their Diamond members. She continued to ask him a few questions, even after he said there were not any in the room. She was a bit short about it. She should have happily gave him water bottles when he started asking about them, being a Diamond member. Then on Sun, when he was checking us out, he asked about the $100 pending charge (we used points for our stay) and she asked him if he trashed the room. No? Well, then you'll get your fee back. Obviously she was joking, but she had a funny way about it. Just not a very friendly employee.Very disappointed in the customer service. I called to book a room and the gentleman that answered the phone was very rude. A little kindness and humility go a long way. I will take my business elsewhere.We stayed here July m2015 and had a two bedroom suite. Except for some crumbs in the kitchen area and a little dirt/hair in the bathroom this would have been five starts. Five more minutes of cleaning a its five stars.I am so impressed with this Homewood Suites so far. All of the staff has been so friendly and willing to help, it is perfectly clean, there is a more than adequate breakfast buffet, and they even have complimentary dinner Monday thru Thursday. I would highly recommend this hotel, especially for anyone traveling on business.Our room was perfect for our needs. We had four individuals and the suite we stayed in had a bedroom with two beds, a bedroom with one bed and a sleeper sofa. It also had a kitchen, full fridge, two full bathrooms and 3 televisions. Hot breakfast in the morning. Wi-fi. Essentially it had every thing we wanted and felt very clean. Seemed like a good location as well. It wasn't a far drive to downtown and other eateries weren't far. The only minor complaint was the elevator seemed like a hike to our room.Loved the beds. Great shower. Skipped breakfast. Fitness center still need some dumbells to be functional at all. Enjoyable common area downstairs in lobby with fireplace.Another superb experience at Homewood Suites. They would have gotten five stars except for the fact that the dinner bar always seems to be empty? I guess I need to show up right when it opens in order to eat there.EDIT: Going on week 6 here and ever since I wrote my review the dinner bar hasn't been empty. Since this was the only thing preventing five stars, I'm changing my review.A typical Homewood Suites. Situated in the north east suburbs of in the great city of Louisville. This Homewood has bigger suites than most. Breakfast bar wasn't exactly great. Nice outdoor pool, basketball court. Free Wi-Fi was excellent. A couple of grills for long term stayers. Located near a few restaurants and a couple of shopping malls. Lots of parking on site. Friendly desk service. Long, long hallways......I am a youth pastor and stayed here recently with 4 teenagers, myself, and my wife. It was perfect. We stayed in the two bedroom suite. The bedrooms were huge, and the bathrooms were very roomy. I loved having a little living area and kitchen, it definitly helped having for our week long stay. The front desk was always amazingly pleasant and just what you look for when staying at a hotel. The breakfast was awesome and they even offer a limited dinner Mon-Fri which we took advantage of a couple of times. The kids loved the pool and the basketball court. This hotel is top quality and I highly reccomend anyone stay here!Wonderful customer service at this hotel.  Everyone at the front desk greets us warmly each time we arrive, which is quite often. Many restaurants a very short drive away. Avoid the Bristol bar and grill next door.This suite was perfect for my work getaway.  Comfy and quiet!  Avoid Bristol Grill.. try Bombay Grill! yummy indian food walk away..Stayed here a dozen times already.  Always super clean and friendly.",,,,,"['impressed', 'hotel', 'friendly', 'employees', 'check', 'desk', 'spacious', 'suite', 'great', 'kitchenette', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'recommending', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/microtel-inn-by-wyndham-louisville-east-louisville,Microtel Inn by Wyndham Louisville East,4.0,$,18,"December 23, 2015. Clean, cheap and the beds were great. The rooms are small...""micro"" tel, get it? There is no ironing board or iron, no microwave, no fridge, no coffee pot, but it comes with the basics like soap, towels, phone, a flat screen tv and a nice window ledge lounge area in which to relax. You also get a chair and a desk. Free WI-FI. Spartan. Basic. Clean. Right off the freeway. Attractive room. A free continental breakfast. Cheap. If you are spoiled or you like ""things in your room,"" this not the place for you. But if you don't mind about ""things"" and you want a good night sleep, you might want to give this place a try. We slept the four of us here for $63.00. That's ""micro"" money, and macro savings that stayed in our pocket.We stayed here for 3 nights--it was a last minute thing. For the price it's not only cheap but good. I wouldn't stay more than 3 nights but the front desk were super nice and friendly! The room was clean and we had no issue. It is about a 20 min drive to downtown area of Louisville. The front desk actually called as we checked in and went to our room to make sure everything was ok and then to find out if we needed room service later in the day (since we declined in the morning as we occupied the room). good customer service.I would stay if i was in that area again but next time i would want to be close to the main city.Before we moved to Louisville we looked for the cheapest room we could find...This one surprised us with it's succinct comfort. It was very clean, the room was tiny but the bad was SO comfortable!  If you're claustrophobic you will probably hate it because the walls are very close to the bed and there is very little wiggle room. If space is not the issue though then Microtel is definitely at the top of our list when it comes to price + cleanliness + comfort.Most importantly, Dont Stay Here!Room stinky from moldy smell, maybe bad room freshenerNo fridge, no microwave, no chair except hard desk chair.Small room, noisy front desk area, broken ice machine.Would never stay here again regardless of the cost of other hotels.Front desk lady was a charm with places to eat and visit info.  This was the only redeeming point.Go elsewhere!Since clearly I didn't plan my KY Derby trip well in advance, all downtown Louisville hotels were booked by the time we got our act together. All good. Microtel Inn was a solid option. The staff is so friendly, nice and accommodating; they even had Derby coasters for us as a little take away present. Awww. The place is budget, kind of smells of smoke but, the bed was comfy, it was clean and there was roof over our head. We didn't spend much time in the room so, all good. This little motel is located about 20 minutes to downtown Louisville, so by no means is it convenient.Overall, a solid spot to stay if you're looking to not spend a lot of money.*** For Derby goers - this place had a private shuttle number and for $10 pp per ride they were pretty much on call and drove you where ever you needed to go. It was perfect. We used the guys all weekend and had the best time ever.*** a 5 minute walk to a 24 hour not so delicious Waffle House.Everything I needed on a road trip. Woman at the front desk was a sweetheart. Room was clean. It had the essentials and nothing more. Breakfast was a nice start to the day. Close to downtown. Would stay again if traveling to the area.Simple rooms that are clean. Not a bad location. Pet friendly and quiet. Only complaint is my room had a bit of a musty smell (I think it was the air conditioner) but otherwise I have no complaints. For the price, it is worthwhile.Funky little rooms (remodeled but 80's style?  in a good way) that were very clean.  Breakfast was decent (bananas, juice and oatmeal - nice to have healthy options) and front clerk was as sweet and helpful as a favorite Great Aunt.  I would stay here again when passing through.I road trip, a lot. From the West coast to the East... bring it on. Spending so much time on the road, means I prefer a more basic (cheaper) hotel unless I'm wanting to pamper myself and relax.This hotel was great. The room was small, but as I was only one person, it was fine. Easy location as far as distance to the freeway, though my GPS was a little confused in finding it - luckily I saw the sign.Front desk lady was fantastic - warm, friendly and very helpful when I had questions about the area and how to find a specific place. Room was clean, bed was alright. The carpets had just been cleaned and the room had been aired out.I would certainly stay here again if I find myself in the Louisville area.Reading other comments on this hotel, I had my doubts and pretty low expectations towards this place; however, I have to give credit where credit is due. From a microtel stand point, I would imagine from the word itself, a place that was slightly more upscale than a super 8 and less than a Holiday Inn. From what I had seen, I have to say that it totally surpassed my expectations as you will see below. When entering the hotel for my stay yesterday, I have to say that it smelled like a dentist's office (formaldehyde??? idk); but it was not really a problem. The hotel staff was definitely friendly and upon first impression, I have to give it a super on this til the end with around three staff individuals taking shifts until the day I left (today). The myth that some comments have on here is that the pillows were horrible; however, I did not find them to be that bad. Very soft and comparable to what I sleep on (cotton pillow). If there were problems with them being thin, there were three of them on a queen sized bed, so just stack them. Not a problem. The blankets were awesome (layered with three like any other hotel). I think the only real problem with the hotel was having a smoking hall on one side and a non-smoking on the other. Time and time again, I had to get luggage out of my car that was parked in a lot by the smoking side. Each time, I had to go through that hallway (really..I had the choice to go through the lobby) and this is why I would not mark it down for that. If people mark it down for this, just remember that you had other means of getting to your room and having smoking sections, they are just catering to the general public. From check-in to check-out, it was a pretty hassle free experience and one of the staff asked if everything in my room was fine. If one would ask me again, I can gladly say ""No problems here, I would love to stay here again"", for the price that I got on it ($57.25).for the price, this place is great!  it was very clean which is always my main concern.  The rooms are a bit small and outdated, but still have everything you need.  Continental breakfast is nothing special, but good enough to grab a snack in the morning.  Plus a great location really close to the expressway and about 10-15 minutes to drive into town!I will be back when i am in Louisville next.Staying at this particular location was perhaps one of the best overall national hotel/motel chain experience I've ever had, and there's a very cogent reason why this chain consistently has consistently won JD Power and Associates' ""Highest in Guest Satisfaction among Economy/Budget Hotel Chains,Ten Years in a Row.""  It's actually quite amazing that this location isn't on their Top 20 list, but hey - it only gives me hope that if this location with its relative anonymity can do so many things so well, the top 20 list must be absolutely phenomenal.  Onwards.Location: 5 out of 5Convenient to the Louisville area, particularly if you are headed eastbound on I-64.  The only thing I would mention is that if you're not familiar with the construction that's going on right now, bear in mind that the I-65 bridge between IN and KY is shut down for repairs.   So...if you are coming down I-65 S and want to hop on over to I-64 E to the property, it shouldn't be a problem.  Similarly, if you are going from the east and are already on I-64, the only thing you have to keep in mind is that you can't cross the I-64 bridge, and that if you want to get on I-65 N, you have to take the 264 bypass first.  My particular experience was going through Louisville to the east TN area, originating in Chicago.  The motel is located in a group of 3 - 4 other properties, and in walking distance to several restaurants.  Cleanliness of Room: 5 out of 5I've traveled enough to know what most motels are capable of on a regular basis, and I know what most motels will tend to overlook if they don't have a staff that's absolutely ""spotless"", pun intended.  I was on the second floor in a queen bed room.  My particular room was not only spotless from an aesthetic standpoint, but there were aspects of the amenities I noticed where other properties would just sort of say, ""eh....whatever.""  Specifically, the liner of the shower didn't have the mold and mildew marks at the bottom.  Yes, I realize that they'll still be there even if you put them through the wash.  However, the liner in the shower didn't have one spot, ring, or line of mold on it.  Furthermore, the drain for the shower flowed absolutely freely without any resistance.  At home, I'm fairly meticulous about cleaning the tub drain out with a turbo snake and/or gel/foam cleaner, and I'm telling you - the tub drain in my room was almost as free-flowing as the one I have at home.  Amenities: 3 out of 5It's not the 4 seasons, though you can see them from your awesome built in day bed above the heating/AC unit.  Yes, this location has built in day beds.  They are neat to sit in for about 5 minutes.  Then, if you are traveling alone, you say to yourself, ""Why am I doing this again?""  Toiletries are commensurate with what you'd find at most of the other non-boutique chains (think Super 8, Econo, Quality, Rodeway, etc.)  The shampoo and soap do the job, the towels are generously sized (if a bit rough and scratchy...you know the sensation).   The TV is above the closet, and if you're lying in bed, it's actually in a convenient location.  The free breakfast is more than adequate for the average traveler; there are no hot or made-to-order items, but the individually wrapped muffins, fruit, cereal, and bakery items are fine.   Remember that the rooms are ""micro"" - so you may not have as much space to store your items if you are traveling with a family of 4.  For a single traveler on a motorcycle, I had plenty of space for my stuff.  The WiFi isn't blazingly fast, but is probably a little faster than 3G.  It was fine for just casual surfing on my phone's browser, and it was able to support Adobe Connect Pro without glitching out.  Decor is pastel'ish, and they have mirrors in the room to make it look bigger.  Cleanliness of Public Areas: 4 out of 5The lobby was very well-maintained, and the corridors and dining areas were kept clean as well.  The only minor complaint I would have is that because there are smoking guests who occupy the property, some of the odors associated with tobacco use could permeate through the main corridors.  Be mindful if you have sensitive parties you are traveling with.  Customer Service: 5 out of 5Very nice staff that works at the front desk.  Everyone I met was the right mix of friendly and efficient.  They were also knowledgeable the general area, and provided good advice on different tiers of local restaurants.  I don't have one negative thing to say about the staff I encountered.  Price: 5 out of 5I think I paid 57 including all taxes and fees.  Like I said in the preface, this was perhaps one of the best bangs for the buck I've encountered in terms of lodging.  Overall: 4 out of 5Highly recommended.  I would definitely stay again if I were passing through Louisville.Cute, clean, cheap, friendly, continental breakfast, and free wifi. The receptionist called to make sure our room was ok. Ten-fifteen minutes from downtown Lousiville. Can't ask for more. Would definitely stay again.This is a great place to stay for the cost. The staff was very nice and everything was clean. I only stayed one night on my way across the country. If you're looking for a clean place to sleep for not very much money, this is for you.The only thing that was disappointing was the free breakfast. There were slightly less options than what's offered at Super 8 in my experience. We opted for the McD's around the corner.Simple but clean rooms, low rates, friendly staff and free breakfast. Would happily return.It is honestly hard to find a low budget motel/hotel that is comfortable and bedbug free. I give Microtel Inn a FIVE STAR review for being a top notch home away from home. The rooms do not go out of their way to be much, however they are clean and budget friendly. All the staff that I encountered seemed to be very nice and personable. I felt safe in my room as well as in the general location. Microtel Inn is also a pet-friendly place... so this is a score for those who can't travel without little friends!There are many walkable food locations around the area and if you feel like adventuring downtown it is only a 10-15 minute drive!I liked the hotel, staff and cleanliness enough BUT bring your own pillow because all of the pillows in this hotel are terrible; they feel like foam rubber, and you'll have to ask for a blanket.Other than the ultra thin blanket (if you can call it that), there was no warm/soft blanket in any of the rooms (i talked to other guests who confirmed) so you have to ask for one which they'll oblige and give you a soft fleece blanket. The TVs are old standard def CRTs but I expected as much.All in all it was fair for the price.Fine hotel for what it is.  Like ""Andy C."" says, below, it is clean, comfortable, and inexpensive.  We felt safe and comfortable there, but were taken somewhat aback by the smell of smoke throughout the common areas.  Coming from Illinois, where smoking is off limits just about everywhere, it struck us probably more than most would notice.  Note that our room did not smell of smoke, only the common areas did, so it wasn't so bad.",,,,,"['2015', 'clean', 'cheap', 'beds', 'great', 'rooms', 'small', 'micro', 'tel', 'ironing', 'board',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-louisville-airport-louisville,SpringHill Suites Louisville Airport,4.0,$$,14,"We have stayed at this hotel for two years in a row while exhibiting at the KY Expo Center.  A less than 5 minute drive to the fairgrounds, which is nice.  Each room has a mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker.  All musts if you're in town for a few days.  The check in was completed in 3 minutes, which was nice when the rest of my family was ready to unload.The breakfast varies each day, and they have a great selection of eggs, sausage, and baked goods, as well as cereal and other items.  Nice to fuel up for the day before heading out.We have come with quite a large group of families, and have been able to use the lobby area (used for breakfast) to watch a college football game and have our food that we made set out on the breakfast area.  Works out great for us.We were staying in Louisville for a wedding, and I was very impressed with this hotel. The rooms were comfortable and clean. The staff was friendly and attentive. They were able to accommodate some last min true changes to our itinerary, which we really appreciated. The only thing I wish they had available were some movies to rent or a wider variety if cable to chose from, but overall very nice place.Only a short drive from the heart of Louisville and Whiskey Row!Not a bad hotel to stay in when you need to be close to the airport. A typical marriot property, clean , friendly staff. Our room was nice and bed was comfortable. Yes it's noisy due to the location, but it shouldn't be a big surprise to any one staying there. We stayed the night before an early am flight and left our car in their parking lot. That alone was worth staying there. It's a quick shuttle ride to the airport and the driver is awesome! Nice guy and very helpful. I would have given them five stars if their computers-printer had been working so we could print our boarding passes.Spotless and clean room, great breakfast including hot eggs, sausage etc.  Excellent staff with fast response.  The cleanest room I've had in a hotel in 20 years!  Easy stay close to airport.  The only problem I experienced is it was 20 degrees outside and the indoor pool was not heated.  Not sure I it was supposed to be.  Had a great  safe stay and pleasant experience.  CLEAN!Decent hotel, by the airport which does make for planes flying overhead...didn't keep me up but I guess it depends on your tolerance.  What does always wake me is the squeaky doors and slamming doors in hotels.  Can someone please invent a quiet closing hotel door?!  The continental breakfast is really nice.  You have eggs, sausage, waffle maker, oatmeal bar fully equipt with higher end items like agave nectar, walnuts, almond slivers and craisins. There is also cereal, croissant, bagel, muffins, lemon poppyseed bread.... individual nutella and philly cream cheese, peanut butter and maple syrup packets too.  Really nice touch!  Indoor pool is fine, max of 5 people is posted so if its ever crowded forget it.  No hot tub.Workout room has 2 treadmills and 1 elliptical, 1 weight set.A hotel is only as good as the GM. This GM is GREAT!!My wife and I had the good fortune of staying at this wonderful property the weekend of the Kentucky Derby. Hotel was filled to the gills, like Christmas in NYC. The staff was one of the best of ANY hotel we have ever stayed at. James the GM and his staff understand what the real meaning of Customer Service with a smile. Not request was too great and even though they were sold out and needless to say crazy, they handled every guest with care and understanding during the busiest weekend of the year. Only 1.5 miles from Churchill Downs and a 10 minute car ride into downtown Louisville. We highly recommend to everyone that you not brush off staying here just because they are out by the airport. A 10 from us. Keep up the good work. We'll be coming back to stay again for Kentucky Derby 142 in 2016.Pros -Hotel is nice from the outside.The rooms are large and spacious.Cons -The elevators and the lobby had some weird smell. Not very pleasant.The bed was very uncomfortable. Sleeping was very hard on them.The toiletries were not the best in the world. I am sure there is room for improvement there.Hmmmm... Pool, check. Hot tub, check. Fitness room, check. Breakfast, check. Awesome staff, check. Great room for about $100, check!What else is there to say really? This is an excellent little hotel, we really enjoyed our stay.We were driving by on our way to New Orleans and this was a perfect place to stop!Stayed January 2012, traveled with friendsClean, good breakfast. Rooms had not been cleaned behind the beds or night stands. Overall, not terrible. A little pricey.Stayed here several times. The shuttle to the airport runs efficiently. Some noise from airport noted. Rooms clean. Out of Chardonnay the past 3 times we have stayed here. Overall, goodThis hotel is ultra-modern. Very European in design throughout. This place blows away any Radisson, Holiday Inn, La Quinta, or every other let's-look-like-all-the-others hotel. I can't believe I'm the first Yelper to review this hotel.Pro's:-Super clean-Contemporary everything: furniture, plasma TV, fixtures, etc-The ultimate anti-Holiday Inn -The carpeting-- yes, the carpeting-- is freakin' beautiful-Less than a year old-Free breakfast (including warm food like egg, sausage, etc)-Free Wall Street Journal and USA Today-Free apples in lobby-3 minute drive to SDF airport-Great customer service-15 min from downtownCon's:-No restaurants or bars within close walking distance-If you're a light sleeper, you'll hear the departing or arriving jetsBest Airport hotel I've ever stayed at.  Staff was friendly and informative, breakfast was great each morning, and the decor was surprisingly chic.  The pool was a bit industrial, and the absence of a hot tub was disappointing, but all around a great stay.The hotel is phenomenal. The airport shuttle came within ten minutes and the front desk staff was more than helpful. The shuttle can also take you to the nearby attractions (Kentucky State Fair Grounds, etc) if you request; it's better than having to get a taxi. The room was simply immaculate. The only negative would be the breakfast.  They have ""make your own"" waffles, but the iron wasn't greased, so there was already a waffle attached to it by the time I got to it. The rest of the food was pre-prepared (fresh out of a box) and unimpressive. But, then again, what do you really expect for a free breakfast? The friendless of the staff and cleanliness of the rooms more than made up for it. The pool looked clean. Like another Yelper said, there isn't a hot tub. However, the exercise room was impressive. I'd certainly recommend this hotel and will stay here again in the future.Stayed here one night. Payed in advance, asked for a quiet room high floor. Received ground floor adjacent to freeway, sandwiched between the laundry and the outside door. Repeated request for a quiet room and was told that is a quiet room. Bad night- freeway noise, laundry, people coming in the door- besides the expected noise of the aircraft.. Bedside lamp didn't work as the cord was too short to reach a plug. Basic stuff. Don't stay here without ear  plugs and eye shades - the smoke alarm blinks all night. They could have situated that in the kitchen area. Other Springhill Suites have been much better. Wouldn't hurt the staff to smile either!",,,,,"['hotel', 'years', 'row', 'exhibiting', 'expo', 'center', 'less', 'minute', 'drive', 'fairgrounds', 'nice', 'room', 'mini', 'fridge', 'microwave',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/clarion-hotel-conference-center-louisville-north-clarksville,Clarion Hotel Conference Center Louisville North,2.0,$$,18,"After reading the other reviews, I'm very confused to what they're all complaining about.I've stayed here for the last four nights because I'm in town for work and haven't had. A single complaint or problem. I haven't smelled any mildew, saw any dirt covering anything, or head any complaints about the neighborhood that the hotel is in.The beds are comfortable and the water pressure in the shower is good. They also have a bar and a buffet (not free but worth it).This hotel is on the older side however, but they do a lot of upkeep to make it say updated. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars was the staff I interacted with while checking in. There were three girls all working the front desk and I stood there for about 5 minutes before any of them decided that they should help me. I would stay here again because for the price and the quality for what you get it, I think you come out ahead!The good: lobby is pretty and hallways clearly have berm updated. The indoor pool is nice and clean. The desk staff were nice upon check in and another gal at front desk was helpful in getting a beverage since the soda machine is broken.  The bad: clearly this hotel has seen better days. Linens are new but beds sure aren't see photos! The restaurant staff was rude, acting annoyed that we even ate there. The food was not very good especially trying to determine which was which between pork and chicken. The buffet table gets too hot and some of the food was dried out. The coffee maker in room filthy. The black out curtain is gross see photo. The room smells horrible which is making me sneeze a lot. I think the one bed in my room is broken as it has a bar ha going from underneath. They're in a remodel but have been told my room is compete. The elevators are scary like they don't start stop and open right and they drop in an odd fashion. And who puts s helicopter landing pad in the middle of the front parking lot? We were told its for the hospital but for the love of God who does that? The K building is NOT handicap accessible from the parking lot and the bathrooms are too narrow. Oh and forgot the dresser in my room is broken too. Lots of things that add up to a never again will I stay here.Ok. Probably more of a 3.5 than a 4, but I'm rounding up.  I think a lot has been done since some of the other reviews.  The lobby looks and smells wonderful.  It was like litely peach scented. Very modern and warm interior.The pool area was one of the nicest indoor pool areas I've walked through.  My room in K wing was renovated.   Nicely sized and clean and modern.  It had a lite green apple scent.  The hallway, which looked like it had new carpet and paint needed air conditioning and/or ventilation.   It was stuffy and had an odd smell. The elevator was hot and smelled like dirty mechanical grease with a hint of BO.  Desk staff very friendly and professional. Check in was quick effecient and friendly. 91312514I'd definitely stay here again.   Hopefully the hallways and stairwells and elevators get proper ventilation soon.Other big draw back, hotel restaurant closes early and there's nothing in walking distance.  Everything is a 10 minute drive or so.  Limits my ability to have a few with dinner...  that said, seems like everything around here closes pretty early except for some of the trendier places downtown in Louisville. .but for the price, the room and hotel is winner.  Lots and lots of parking.The place is more if a complex, with several buildings and wings.The environment is scary, the neibough hood is scary, no restaurant closeby, the food sucks in the onsite restaurant. The room is dirty, the coffee machine is dirty, the toilet is dirty. The hallway is smelly. I would like to change a room but I was too tired to do so. My room in on key wing, I had to drive around the building with bunch of luggages to carry, no wheelchair access from parking lot to the building. Never again. I pray tomorrow comes faster so that I can check out.Okaaayyy... So I went to a family reunion this weekend.  The location of the Center was convenient bcz our cookout was at the Aquatic Family Center which earned them one star. Secondly, the staff at the check in was friendly and fast which earned half a star. Our beds were comfortable and I slept well after a long fun-filled day so that's the other half a star equalling 2 stars. Otherwise I wasn't happy with my stay. As soon as we opened the door to our room there was an awful smell!!!  It smelled like mildew but someone tried to cover the smell with baby powder spray. The swimming pool area and bar were nice. Not sure if we'd come back though.Looks are very nice, loads of parking spaces, and nice pool are nice view. However, it's not sanitary at all, it smells weird, lots of prostitutes, either snot or male stuff on the bed, wifi isn't horrible but it's not good either, it's okay, fo far my experience is a three star but I will add on later tonight... Only two elevators for all 9 floors. The sign that says renovations are under way needs renovation it looks 10 years old... Now 2 star review...Wow... I came out to the lobby because it's only place you can get wifi, and the 4 workers left when their shift ended and no one is at the front desk yet... It's been 15 of no one at the front desk two groups of people have come in looking for a room to stay and no one was there to help them...One star. I left a lot, some thing I found in my bed would be inappropriate to mention. Breakfast cost extra, I guess we will leave and eat something else tomorrow lolxAlso they have hazardous substances in a container kids can easily get to, acids, chlorine and chloride. Also a room (right by other hotel rooms) that said to stay away from it, because of radio active stuff...I'm sitting out in the lobby again to get wifi, and it's hilarious seeing so many people ask for the hotel to hold something for them, the hotel keeps losing stuff of other people's...OH AND someone said in another review that the ac is broken. It's not BROKEN, they just have ONE window unit per floor, aside from the broken one in the room. And last night I forgot to tell you about my experience getting ice. I called the desk to find out where the ice was and they said it was n the front on lobby. Sadly it took forever finding it, and getting stuck on an elevator, I also came across an elevator which didn't say out of order, but it had no buttons.Old and smells terrible like moth balls. Air conditioner broken, drain in shower broken. No one inspects the room after it has been cleaned. It is old an run down. In 1975 it was probably state of the art.  The customer service is OK. The restaurant has portable air conditioners all over the place because the permanent ones are broken. The free wifi is slower than dial up Internet. I will stay downtown Louisville next time .I have stayed in a lot of places, the ones that were bad you knew going in. This Clarion is AWEFUL, the lobby and pool are beautiful, the rooms, food and most of the wait staff....S U C K. If I could afford to move my family out for the next two nights, I would.Yes the hotel is being renovated, but the problems here are mainly staff side.I've stayed here before and enjoyed it. I'm sorry I returned. There is no remodeling going on but there needs to be. I was horrified at how badly everything looks, with the exception of the lobby. The elevator had a horrible substance on all the buttons my entire stay and the hallway to my room looked like it was done in late 70's. My bed was on a fiberboard ""foundation and the mattress slid if I moved. The room had a horribly spray scent that was being used to cover something else up. The staff seemed unhappy during my stay---complaining about one another in the restaurant and the lobby. The restaurant was a horrible dark grimy area and I refused to return. I have called several times since leaving to find out if I left a toiletry bag behind. The desk personnel have been grumpy and unwilling to help.I urge you to find another place. I know I will.Nice hotel. They are remodeling a little still. Nice rooms. They do not have a free breakfast but a restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner at a price. It is a conference center so that explains the no free breakfast. Nice pool too.This place stinks. Quite literally . Our room was in the k wing which hasn't been renovated yet but quite honestly I didn't think the lobby smelled much better. It was a stench of burnt tires and chemicals. The elevators were probably the worse! The personnel was nice and courteous and the smell was more subdued in the room . We had dinner and breakfast at the restaurant because we did not want to drive after two long days on the road but would NOT recommend the food, it was at most bland. I would say the service was the only redeeming factor of this place but I would definitely not come back.I can only assume the person who gave this place 5 stars reviewed the wrong hotel. I've been here for 45 minutes and am on my third room. The first room was a king bed only... no hide-a-bed. The second one the door didn't unlock. When I went to the desk to tell them, the nice lady told me my cell phone probably wiped out the cards.Mind you they don't have luggage carts so we had to schlep our luggage all over creation.It smells weird in here.The air conditioning hasn't been on in what feels like weeks.The furniture is chipped and nasty. The bathroom is tiny. I'm not sure what interior designer decided this border matches these curtains.The pool doesn't open til 9 am and it's no where near roms.The curtains are plaid. I like plaidFor the curtains they get one star.  But everything else is a nightmare.We picked this Hotel for our New Years Eve celebration. We were a bit hesitant do to some of the bad reviews but decided to take a chance, we ARE glad we did. The renovations have GREATLY improved the property.  The NYE package was also a great value. The food, party, music, room and breakfast were ALL very well done. We plan on a repeat stay next year.This place is a dump! Reeks of old smoke and deodorizer spray. The advertise free wifi and HBO; neither of which are actually available. Had to go in search of an outlet to plug my phone in, which I wish I hadn't because before finding the outlet I found piles and piles of crap in the corners. The staff at the desk were very friendly, however, I still wish I had brought my own sheets from  home.In spite of all the construction going on in the area and getting lost a couple times in the dark on our way to check in (at 2:00 AM) we found ourselves a very good room.  We stayed 5 nights and the room was clean and the beds were comfortable.  We were on the 3rd floor in a non-smoking (and you didn't smell any scent of old smoke) room with a king size bed.  The hotel is pet friendly, the staff was very nice from the check - in to the maid service.  We never ate at the hotel so I'm can't say how their restaurant was.  I do have to say that the decor is quite dated and the tv didn't always come in clear but we were there mostly to sleep anyway.  I would definitely stay again if I have to bring my dog (again).Place was awful.  Cigarette butts everywhere, pretty sure we saw a hooker meet up with someone and go into the room.  Could hardly sleep.  Not worth what little we paid for the room.Great price. Great room. Clean. Smoke free. It had signs up that they were remodeling, but I saw no evidence of a mess. The lobby was super nice, and it looked like the pool was nice. We arrived late (due to the worst traffics I've ever seen) and found it quiet and restful. I will definitely stay here again.Rude staff!!! I got here from the airport.  Dump on outside.  Inside decor outdated.Tried to check in and told that checkin was at 5pm, 7 hours later.  Staff complained about other staff loudly as well as cursed.  Maybe it's par for the area. Very unprofessional!  They asked me if I wanted to leave my bags and my response was where was I going. I arrived by taxi for a meeting.  Her response was a shrug. This is the second online complaint I have ever posted but I want future guests to keep going on to another hotel.",,,,,"['reading', 'reviews', 'confused', 'complaining', 'last', 'four', 'nights',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-louisville-downtown-louisville,Courtyard Louisville Downtown,3.5,$$,18,"In town for business, at the convention center, and the Courtyard by Marriott is in a perfect location.  Right downtown, only a block away.  Will be staying here the entire week, and update after my trip is done.Thus far, I am not disappointed, at all.  The staff have been very friendly and helpful.  Offering great suggestions for dinner locations and things to do.The room is very nice, well kept, and service has been good, thus far.  Amenities are pretty typical for the Courtyard brand...nice room, fresh decor, really suited for the business traveler.  Coffee and free wi-fi but, no fridge or microwave.  The bed is VERY comfortable and that more than makes up for lack of a mini fridge...IMHO.Only complaint so far is noise.  But, that is not the hotels fault.  There is road construction outside and it is really noisy, can hear it in the room, woke me up at 4 a.m. this morning.  I do hear other noise, large trucks but, it is pretty quiet and muffled, not enough to keep me from sleeping.They have a sort of strange little morning breakfast bistro stand adjacent to the lobby...serving ""starbucks"" but, it's fake....as in, real coffee but, auto machine espresso...it'll do in a pinch but, for true espresso fans....meh....I spent 30 nights at this hotel on business in 2015.  I also spend several nights at other local downtown hotels (the Residence Inn, the Marriott, and Springhill Suites), but I chose to stay here the most due to the good corporate rate, the breakfast and the proximity to my office.My favorite parts of this hotel experience is the breakfast. The staff is friendly, there are a number of choices that range from quick fruit and muffins to sit down hot selections, and they serve Starbucks via a great professional coffee machine. This seemed a big step up from most Courtyards.The hotel has a shuttle that took me TO the airport, which was very convenient and also a perk. Although they wouldn't pick-up from the airport, I understand because it's not an airport hotel. The shuttle will take you anywhere within a very short radius. 30 nights there meant that I eventually wanted to go a little more than a mile away for dinner, and I was surprised that the hotel wouldn't take me further. The staff was friendly, but not as accommodating as I've experienced at other hotels, particularly for a very frequent customer.Otherwise, this hotel was ok, but not much more. The rooms were clean but not special.  This hotel was quiet at night, which I appreciated. Out of 30 nights, I only had one group of partying neighbors and the hotel handled that expertly.The rooms were clean, on occasion the cleaning chemicals smelled too strongly. This is a good pick if you need to be in downtown Louisville.I had to cancel my reservation and leave this hotel early because of the overpowering chemical cleaner smell in the hallways and rooms.Aside from that, the hotel would have been fine. If you don't mind being surrounded by the smell of menthol, the rates are good and the location is great.Went here while I was walking downtown aimlessly looking for my car that I had no idea what parking garage I had parked in. It had to be mid 40s. Was trying to find a hotel to where I could find a business center to find the PARC number. The staff of this hotel kept me waiting in the cold and kept asking repeatedly if I was a guest. I told them ""NO I AM NOT A GUEST, I JUST NEED TO USE YOUR BUSINESS CENTER"". They sent me away. Not sure if they thought I was a robber or something. After doing my brand ambassador event, I was dressed with a black jacket and grey pants. Still, when there is a guy on the street, looking to use your business center, have the courtesy to let him in and find out options. It was like 2 a.m. in the morning!The hotel is just average at best.  The lobby is pretty nice but the rooms are dated a bit.I got upgraded to a Junior Suite and it was bigger but still not super nice.I had a traincation (convention) at the Convention center and I would much rather have stayed at the Hyatt or Marriott looking back because they are connected by sky bridges and it was 28 degrees.  Lesson learned.Lastly, I must say the staff was phenomenal.  Not enough to give it a 4-star rating but they were extremely friendly the entire time.This is the second time I've stayed at this hotel.  It's been a year since I stayed here last and I had forgotten about the one problem I had with the rooms.  Others have mentioned this issue too.  They use excessive chemicals in the rooms.  The first time I stayed I had them switch my room but had the same, strong chemical odor.  I dealt with it because other things in the hotel made up for it which I'll mention in a bit.  This trip, same issue.  I called from the first room I was given and requested another room.  They turned up with a key and a bottle of air freshener.  I told them to step away from the bottle.  The second room had the same odor.  I don't think it's the room cleaner chemicals, I think that there is another odor that they are covering up with excessive air fresher.  There's a moldy, musty smell underneath the chemical smell.  My guess is that they have ""sick building syndrome"" since the windows are sealed.  Now for the good points.  Excellent staff.  Easy parking with a room key swipe.  Great location across from the YUM Center.  Nice Bistro for a quick breakfast, the service there was great as well.  They have a little General Store type closet next to the front desk which is open 24 hours and is great for me since I get back at crazy times and sometimes would like a little something.  Beds are comfortable but the pillows need work, hard as rocks.Overall I think that this will be the last time I stay here.  It's a shame about the smell because otherwise I'd be giving it 4-5 stars because of the staff.When I booked, this hotel and the full-service Marriott a block and a half away were exactly the same price, but I chose the Courtyard due to its slightly superior reviews and its location, which was a tad closer to where I needed to be during the day. I wouldn't do it again. I had the occasion to visit the full-service hotel, and the difference is far greater than you might glean from reviews. And as a Marriott Gold member, you get free breakfast and easy late checkout at the full-service hotel but no breakfast and a bit of a hassle for a late checkout at the Courtyard. But the Courtyard does have a great location, a free airport shuttle, and an especially strong staff. They're all-purpose players who are enthusiastic, knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. They'd make this hotel worthy of a solid rating, except that... The housekeeping staff needs to turn down the amount or strength of the cleaning chemicals. The hallways, at least on the fifth floor, just reek of the stuff. Unpleasant, and it makes you wonder what it so awful that it takes industrial strength solvents to cover up. Not the best sleep due to walls that don't insulate from either loud conversations in other rooms or traffic and other assorted noise from the street. Because downtown isn't terribly busy after midnight, the street noise is too intermittent for your auditory system to adapt to. So the fifth floor, at least, isn't a great choice for a light sleeper.Pretty nice hotel in a great location, near lots of restaurants, bars and attractions and right across from the basketball stadium / Yum events center..  breakfast area is  order at the counter with starbucks coffee and opens at 6:30.. free coffee in your room but not in the lobby or at breakfast.. friendly staff at both reception and the breakfast area..Exactly what I expect from a Courtyard. I appreciate the consistent service no matter where business takes me.Great place and clean. The staff was very friendly.Good staff and great location. Mediocre rooms - but most of the TV stations didn't work, instead saying  ""no signal"".""I stayed here weekly for business over a nine month period. The staff is absolutely phenomenal, always helpful and knew our names after just two stays. The rooms are clean and a comfortable size. I see a lot of people saying that the rooms are just ""ok"". If you want superb spend the $300+/night and stay at the Marriott down the street, but don't knock the mid tier hotels down a size for being exactly what they are.... Mid tier. You get a good clean room with friendly staff in a great location for a fantastic price here :)This Courtyard by Marriott is in a great location in DT Louisville. It is very easy to park in their garage and just walk to restaurants. There are many great dining establishments within a 8 block radius. Several are only one block away from the hotel.The staff is friendly and the place is very clean. I have also found some reasonable rates around $120.The hotel is across the street from the new ""YUM"" Center, home of the Louisville Cardinals. There is a lot of activity in the area before and after games.Updated Courtyard in the heart of downtown L'ville!  Easy walk to restaurants, bars, 4th Street Live.  Rooms are updated to the newer Courtyard standards.  There is a parking garage here.  Caddy corner form the hotel are a few bars that are excellent, away from the touristy 4th Street Live.  Good spot to stay in L'ville if on a budget.I hate to give a review to an established chain, but I just have to. The staff at the Courtyard Louisville Downtown were so filled with hospitality, I couldn't resist. The Courtyard brand generally offers comfy, clean, spacious rooms and good shampoo and fresh bedding, free internet, pool, gym, and decent cable channels most of the time. If you get a renovated one, you are in luck.But what made this trip special was the attention and patience given to our huge party (our very large family gathered for a wedding). The staff was so attentive, genuinely warm, joyful, accommodating, and made us feel like we were at home. Maybe it's just Southern hospitality, but I think it's those great personalities that took this experience over the top. Thank you Ladies!Nicely done, Courtyard. Can't say you're my favorite of the hotel chains, but you've never done my family wrong.Concierge was polite, but not terribly helpful. I had asked about smoking laws and the gentleman looked at me and said, ""This is Kentucky."" Why, yes it is! I'm thrilled you know what state I'm in. But I'm obviously NOT from Kentucky if I ask you what the smoking laws are here. Last *I* checked, Kentucky was bourbon and tobacco country. Does this mean I can smoke in a bar? Does this mean I have to be 20-50ft from the door? What does that mean beyond the fact that I'm stuck in this g-d-forsaken state for 72 hours for my grandfather's funeral?!Anyways. The rooms were very clean, extra towels/pillows came promptly. The hair dryer was questionable, but I should have known to bring my own. Not really sure what the breakfast situation was like as I was there for only a night (lack of proper sleep, proper meals, and a new environment makes for a very sick Jennifer), but there was espresso when I needed it and the staff was incredibly polite in the bar/breakfast area.Oh. And free wi-fi. Thank you, Courtyard. Seriously. Thank you.This was our second stay at this hotel.  The first time was good so we decided to stay again and we're really glad we did.  It's a clean hotel and a good location. The only downside is that the bed was uncomfortable but everything else was really good, especially the service from the staff.  Carol at the front desk was friendly, efficient and helpful.  The hotel shuttle drove us to and from our event downtown and on the way back Tyra was our driver.  It was brutally hot that evening and she had the A/C cranked up in the van.  She was also really friendly and we enjoyed the short ride back to the hotel.  We would stay here again.Have stayed here twice for business.  Clean rooms in downtown Louisville.  Parking garage connected to the hotel.  Friendly staff.  Breakfast daily.  Bar inside hotel.  Lots of great restaurants close by.  Especially check out Patrick O'Shea's, Bistro 301 or Vincenzo's",,,,,"['town', 'business', 'convention', 'center', 'courtyard', 'perfect', 'location', 'right', 'downtown', 'block', 'away', 'staying',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/drury-inn-and-suites-louisville,Drury Inn & Suites,4.5,$$,20,"Our mission in this stay was to find a well appointed hotel for 2 nights in Louisville without breaking the bank... and I can happily report: Mission Accomplished.This hotel features:-- Free hot/cold breakfast featuring donuts, eggs, biscuits/gravy, waffles, cereal, hard boiled eggs, and more-- Free Kickback... aka free dinner starting at 530pm featuring chili, salads, pasta, baked potato and more-- Cheap alcohol during the Kickback (53 cents each to cover Kentucky tax)-- Free soda, coffee and popcorn all day-- Indoor/outdoor pool and whirlpool-- Basic shop to get your snacks and pantry item needs met-- Nice sized LG TV -- Plenty of FREE parking-- FREE wifi, no password required-- Comfortable bedsIt sounds so silly but I love that the shampoo/conditioner/body wash in the shower are not in travel sized bottles, but rather, in a dispenser on the shower wall. I can use as much as I need and it is more environmentally friendly.The staff was very pleasant, the check in process was quick, and the decor was beautiful and basic. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely be staying at Drury again in the future over other better known chains.We love staying at Drury Inns. Free breakfast, free dinner, free snacks and soft drinks. Great! Especially if you have a family. The only downfall I would say about this one, is, some of the room aren't in a ""hallway"" like setting. Some, like the one we bad, are on a balcony, over looking the lobby, which has a really pretty chandelier going all the way down to the floor. BUT you could hear every one down in the lobby. We were even on the 4th floor. Other than that, it was a great hotel, and would stay here again.While replacing a windshield wiper in a Walmart parking lot that flew off during our drive from Chicago to Nashville, my boo-thang made a game time decision to rest in Louisville. She searched on Yelp for a highly-rated and dog-friendly hotel, booked through the listing, and off to the hotel we went.***This Drury Inn &amp; Suites location really impressed me, despite being a mid-tier hotel. For the price ($150+), customers receive incredible value and outstanding service that I think would appeal to everyone from the traditional businessman to a small family. They do so many things right, and I think a lot of other hotel chains should take note:I. ROOMVery plane, but incredibly functional and spacious (maybe 400-500 square feet). The living area and bed each had their own rooms. The carpet felt fine, TV worked well, and the comfy couch felt nice to sit on after eight plus hours of driving. All the dust had been wiped. II. BEDOutstanding firm mattress! I slept like a baby and drooled all-over my pillow. III. BATHROOMMarble floors, shampoo and soap dispensers, sparkling clean -- what's not to like? IV. SERVICESuper friendly, professional, and very accommodating. No problems here.V. OTHER TIDBITS-Their continental breakfast is actually pretty good! I really liked their biscuits and gravy as well as sausages.-It's dog friendly, and there was no extra charge. -Their workout area comprises of three treadmills and some small dumbbells. Nothing too great. The room is also very small.VI. OVERALLI would absolutely return to this Drury Inn, if I ever were in this part of Louisville again!Pooping at the Drury Inn would get a solid 9 out of 10 if the tp was Charmin. One slow elevator. Room was clean.I loved staying here. The front desk staff, especially the black gentleman who was working was extremely friendly and talkative. Granted, I stayed here the second week of may in 2014, but the service was so great that it was memorable that I had to make an account to brag on it. The only complaint that I really had was that I couldn't easily move the dresser to plug my PS4 in behind the said dresser, but other than that, it was a great stay.I was impressed. This was my first time staying at a Drury Inn so I didn't know what to expect. The check in was very easy, rooms nice, clean and comfortable, they are pet friendly and have hot breakfast. I also saw a sign that they have free snacks and alcohol beverages! (Well there was a slight fee for the alcohol due to Kentucky law, I think you just pay tax). Anyway great deal! All the staff was friendly as well. I would definitely stay at this Drury Inn or another elsewhere again.Very nice, clean hotel.  Had an issue with the air conditioning in my room and even though it was 10pm by the time i noticed, the front desk immediately came to check it out and moved me when they couldn't fix it.  Comped the room for my inconvenience, which is nice.  I don't recommend staying in one of the atrium rooms though because the common area gets pretty noisy at night and during breakfast.The staff was super friendly, even lending me an umbrella so I could walk my dog in the downpour.  I wasn't offered the chance to get a drink coupon when I checked in, so I missed out on my chance for cheap booze.  I was too tired and cranky after a long day to bother trying to figure out how to get one at night.Five stars for service 4 for decor (a little outdated). The entire staff from the Assistant General Manager to the breakfast host and the pool attendant were welcoming, friendly, and went above and beyond for service! We got a better rate than across the street at the Marriott where we had original reservations. We cancelled at the Marriott because we had requested a hotel with a pool and a restaurant and the pool ended up being outdoor and the ""restaurant"" was closed. It was really just a cafe counter in the lobby. Back to the Drury... Elated with the free breakfast and the wide selection. Also the pool was indoor outdoor with a divider above. Very cool feature. A small exercise room with treadmills and free weights. Very happy! Will be back!Great hotel all around!  It was a great stay, the staff was friendly, the room was clean, and the continental breakfast was really good (with hot food).  Will definitely stay here again.  The pool and hot tub they have is a big plus.  The only complaint was that the hot tub jets were not working during our stay, but still a great stay all around!The staff here is by far the nicest, friendliest and most helpful you will find at any hotel. They will go out of their way to help you and accommodate your every need. Super crew! The rooms are very clean and comfy. If you forget something, they've got it covered. Comfy bed and pillows too. The free breakfast, free dinner, free snacks, free soft drinks are all excellent and so convenient. Ive stayed here several times for work and Ive never had a complaint one.I had the pleasure of staying at the Drury Inn located in Cincinnati once. I made the mistake of thinking that they were all going to be high class. That is not the case for their Louisville location. When I first arrived in my room, my shoes stuck to the tile as I walked in and I found a hair on 2 of the 4 towels in the bathroom. I decided I could live with it until the morning, but the morning couldn't come soon enough! The place is old and the walls are so thin that I could make out every word of the conversation going on next door. I know they can't do anything about that, but c'mon!Saving grace was the service! They were very polite at the front desk when I asked them to mop the floor and bring fresh towels. If ti wasn't for them, I was going to find a different hotel for the 2nd night. So the front desk staff was excellent! Thank you, but I will probably stay somewhere else next time I am in Louisville.We LOVE Drury Hotels.  I first stayed at one in Atlanta but it was when my brother got married in New Orleans that I discovered how much I would need them in my life.  They are pet friendly!  We travel everywhere with our 7lb furry child and we were getting a little sick of the Motel 6/Super 8 obligation.  They are so clean and nice and our little girl is welcome!  The walls are also a lot thicker and the doors a lot heavier than the cheaper places so outside sound is way more muffled and that keeps the canine quiet too because she's not reacting to outside noise.  We stay at the one in Louisville when we travel to see my parents in Virginia as Louisville is almost the halfway point.  It's such a convenient location for us.  We're staying there in a week and a half, in fact!I've stayed in just about every hotel in Louisville at some point and time, and Drury Inn is hands down the best!  Their level of service to their guests is one that's hard to find these days. Kudos to the management staff for training their team on how to go above and beyond for guests needs! Very clean &amp; comfortable. Offers every amenity one could ask for: indoor/outdoor pool, hot tub, free breakfast/dinner, free wifi. Plus their rates are cheaper than other comparable hotels. I highly recommend staying here.Stand outs:         Clean          Pet and People Friendly      The manager was very accomadating when I asked for a first floor room near an exit with a king bed.  There are no king beds on the first floor except for a suite.  She then said if it was available she would upgrade us to that room at no extra charge.  SHE DID!  My dog Zorro was invited to join us in the lobby which was near the Kickback    snack lounge. We enjoyed our snacks and drinks while watching TV sitting in leather wingbacks. Zorro was well recieved by the guests and quickly became friends with all.The pool was unique in the fact it was half indoors and half outdoors. You could swim under the glass partition.  It was snowing out and was neat to see the kids swimming in a heated pool with steam rising while catching snow flakes in their mouths.My only negative was the bed.  It was like sleeping on a huge sponge.  All things considered, this was a great value.  I am a convert to Drury Inns!Our first time at a Drury Inn property was in St Louis, it was clean, comfortable and affordable, so we decided to try Louisville. I found the same level of service at both properties. In fact, we made a reservation for Louisville on the Internet, decided to confirm it on our way there in the car. The hole did not find it in the system and transferred us to the nationwide reservation center. They didn't see anything either, but booked us into a suite because they said the hotel was full and it was the only room left. When we arrived, the front desk must have had a note on our reservation because they apologized for not having the original reservation and gave us the suite for the same price as the single room. The suite was very comfortable for a family of four. I recommend it, especially with two teenagers. My only downside is the food. I know beggars can't be choosers, but they quality of the breakfast is low. Theres no taste to the eggs or French toast. You need to hit the buffet immediately after the replenish the food, otherwise it gets cold quickly.This location has free breakfast and free dinner, with alcohol drinks for $0.58 (it's free but KY law requires them to charge so they charge the minimal). Also have popcorn machine, soda machine, and coffee available throughout the day.  Room was clean, and the bathrooms look new ( probably recently renovated). The have an indoor pool which also leads to an outdoor pool. Hot tube was well heated. Most of all, the staff is super nice. Always greeting you and seeing how you are doing. During meals, they go to each table to see if you need anything and help you clean up.  For dinner (it's technically appetizer time but they offer enough selection to make it dinner), they don't typically have milk but my kids were looking for it so they unlocked the milk machine and got some for them.  Overall, I would recommend staying here.This is the first time I've stayed in a Drury Hotel but it certainly won't be my last! Comfortable,clean, quiet, tastefully decorated rooms--the king bed was very comfortable and had 5 pillows!When we checked in we were given the otion of having 6 drink coupons, free except in Kentucky they have to charge tax so each drink cost a whopping 53 cents. From 5:30 to 7:00pm they have ""kickback""--free fod which included nachos, chicken tenders, baked potatoes, macaroni and cheese, salad and brocolli cheese soup. We had planned on going out for dinner but decided the kickback was all we needed. Breakfast this morning, also free, featured scrambled eggs, sausage, french toast, waffles, cereal, donuts, bagels, juice, and coffee. Oh, and there was also bicuits and gravy, too.I highly recommend this hotel.This is a very nice hotel for the price.  Drury Inns accept all size dogs at no charge as long as they are well behaved.  I could not be happier.  I called and asked if we could get a 1st floor room by the exit since we have a 105 pound dog and while he is very well behaved, not everyone likes dogs and he takes up a lot of space.  They were able to do this and we stayed in a suite.  It was lovely and clean.  We especially liked the 3 very comfortable pillows on each bed.  We all commented that they were the most comfortable pillows of any hotel we have ever stayed (including expensive hotels).  I had the best hotel sleep of my life.  Usually I do not sleep well at hotels.  We did not take advantage of the drinks and food in the evening but, did enjoy breakfast.  It offered a lot for breakfast compared to most hotels in that price range.  This was our first of 3 Drury Inn stays on our vacation and we found them each one better than the next.  I think this is our new ""go to"" hotel on the road!We were very happy with our 2 room suite. A little dated but the very friendly staff, free popcorn, and free pop, meant we'd come back without a thought. The indoor outdoor pool was fun too. The staff are very very friendly. The breakfasts were so good, we ended up just needing a light lunches for the duration of our stay.Nice two room suite for a great price. Furnishing are good and not worn, but a little dated. Would be nicer if they have bigger windows in the room. Good wireless service.",,,,,"['mission', 'find', 'well', 'appointed', 'hotel', 'nights', 'without', 'breaking', 'bank', 'happily', 'report', 'mission', 'accomplished', 'hotel', 'features', 'free',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-louisville-airport-fair-expo-louisville,Holiday Inn Louisville Airport - Fair/Expo,3.5,$$,17,"I stayed here for nearly 3 weeks due to a business trip.  The staff was helpful and worked with me when my plans changed.Everything was kept clean and neat.They also have a nice restaurant/bar.  Two beers on tap (one local) and a pretty good menu for a hotel.  The food was good and the staff was friendly.It is within walking distance of the U of Louisville football stadium and Churchill Downs.I would definitely stay here again.Not the best place pave I have stayed.  Not the worst.TV in the room is horrible. customer service not great.Gym equpiment worn out.Location good.Bed comfortable.Shower head good.A few things made my experience kind of bad. Thick ass crusty mold in the corners of the bath tub, a torn curtain, and a shitty little TV with only lame ass SD channels. There were no ports anywhere to charge my phone, so i had to disconnect the night stand lamp...WTF...its 2015...even I have a smart phone.The place has clearly been around for a while, and remodeled...overall it is a convincing remodel. but with a tiny little bit of extra effort, it could be a contender.Thank you for the easy stay. I was visiting for a work conference and couldn't be happier with the service. The room looked great the AC was up super cold just how I liked it. Can't wait til the next year when I'm visiting again.Impressive hotel to stay in louisville KY for a decent rate! 1. Very clean2. Decent room colors3. Modern style furnishing4. Very close to highway5. Noise free even being next to the airport, university of louisville and highway6. Best part, smoke free :)7. There is a restaurant where you can have breakfast lunch and dinner! In case, you work for government, you will get free passes for breakfast!! :) 8. Only thing I didn't like is the entrance from road, it's kinda hidden. I had almost missed it couple times.Convenient,  clean and. good service. Heat/air pretty loud not sure why. Only a problem if on the phone or watching TV.Will stay here again.Decent price and close to downtown but the customer service was awful. I had reserved two rooms and asked for them to be next to or close to each other when I made the reservation.  It took over 25 min to check in! We arrived shortly after 3pm so they should have been ready. Initially they gave us 2 rooms 3 floors apart. When I asked that they be next to or at least close to each other it took the desk staff over 15 min to figure out how to do that. They finally give us rooms on the same floor and we go up-only to find that one of them hasn't been cleaned yet. After another 10 min of waiting the maid finally called the desk and asked them to move us so that we didn't have to wait for her. Ultimately we were placed in rooms across from each other. The rooms were clean and tasteful but as another reviewer mentioned you can hear the planes fairly often. No free continental breakfast though. My son was staying in this hotel the night before he shipped off to basic training and we wanted to be with him. And I usually am pleased with Holiday Inns. Not sure I'd choose this one again though.Wayne's World, party time, excellent!!!Not really, but that's all I can think of at 1am on a Thursday morning, listening to planes drop their landing gear. Not only is this loud, but a few of the planes actually shook the hotel! I am on the fifth floor, so perhaps the noise is not so bad for the other floors? Oh well... party on, dudes!Other than that, the hotel is modern and clean, room is very spacious and well-laid-out and has a refrigerator and microwave, which I always appreciate when traveling for business. The king size bed is large... not really comfortable, but expansive. Holiday Inn needs to get it together and provide king size pillows for king size beds, though... I walked in to find 4 tiny, lumpy white pillows centered on the headboard like the poly-fil fairy came and took a fluffy little dump on the bed. Maybe it's too much to ask for a standard size down-alternative pillow?A few weeks ago, we went to Louisville.  I really like the 4th street Live area.  It's in their downtown.  It's basically a strip of restaurants and bars. While there, we stayed at the Holiday Inn.  The hotel was average quality. However, what made this experience fun was the bar. It's hard to beat $2.  The mint julep in reality wasn't very good.  It was premixed. I had a few.  Garrett couldn't even drink the one.  I'm sure they would be better if they weren't premixed.  I guess a mint julep is the official drink of the Kentucky Derby or something.  It's basically bourbon and mint liquor.  Eventually, we swapped to Maker's Mark.  We had Kentucky bourbon in Kentucky.  The bartender was actually really good.  He gave us a sample of some high end bourbon.  He was really chatty and friendly. So... if you are in Louisville, this hotel is good.  The drinks are cheap (if you get the special).I don't think I'll stay here again.  The AC units are noisy, internet incredibly unreliable, and the place isn't kept up very well.  The elevators don't always work, entry doors get jammed, and things in the room aren't always right.  I still give it two stars for being clean and decent, but it's way too expensive for what you get.In a sharp contrast to hotels that look like the 80's threw up all over the room, this hotel is new, modern, and comfortable. The rooms look pretty sharp. There's a restaurant and bar off the lobby that serves passable food and good drinks. The room has a LCD TV, microwave and fridge. Beds are comfortable with a variety of pillows and it's fairly quiet. Outlets are well positioned in the room so you can plug in your electronics; you can plug in at the desk without crawling on the floor, and there's outlets next to the recliner that also is close enough to the nightstand to plug in your phone. They thought out the room well.It's a mile and a half straight shot to the airport terminal, so you will get plane noise during the night, but when you have an early flight it's nice to be able to roll out of bed, drop off the car, and get the heck out of there.I stayed here for my radiology board exams.  It was about $50 to $80 cheaper than the other hotels, but the rooms and the hotel was just as good as theirs.  But I must say, the service was great.  Everybody was really friendly.  One thing was amazing though.  When I was leaving for the airport, it turned out that their shuttle was gone.  The manager of the hotel (I don't know his name, but a bald younger white guy) actually got in his car and drove me to the airport.  Amazing.There is not much to do around the hotel, but if you need to stay next to the airport, this is by far your best bet.Oh yeah, and most important, free wi-fi.Being sent to Louisville for business for 3 straight weeks doesn't garner much excitement out of many however upon landing and getting my rental car which was a pimped out Chevrolet HHR that smelled like fish, I headed towards the hotel.  During my drive I had a very interesting scenic route.  This hotel is close to the college Football Stadium and is in a not so nice part of town.  I was a bit concerned as I'm not interested in homeless, crackheads, hookers nor toothless wonders.  However upon reaching my destination I was compleely surprised.I went to check into the hotel and I will say that the hotel lobby is very nice looking.  Dark wood, polished  white tile floors, very nice for this neighborhood.  They have a nice bar and resturant and the staff were very nice.  Got my card and headed up to my room.  Nice door key system as it goes into the solid wood door horizontaly which means the door is pretty thick.  I opened the door and saw a very nice dark wood furnished room.  Two queens with headboards and a LG flatscreen TV.  Too bad it's not HDTV but still it's nicer than the crappy tube TV's is most hotels.  My room had a nice desk, microwave and fridge.  With all of this the only thing I don't care for is the thermostat and heatpump.  The thermostat is an automatic one which in theory is nice however one minute it's blasting heat and the next it's blowing A/C.  I finally got it comfortable in the room by playing around with the temperature.  The only other issue with this hotel is there isn't a lot of resturants around however I did find a close Starbucks.  All in all, whereas I was going to have my admin change hotels before I got here, upon seeing the hotel I am going to have her book this for the next three weeks.Had a little glitch checking in (only one person working front desk and she had 5 things going on and she was a bit flustered). Once we got checked in the room was nice. I think the place was remodeled recently and the lobby and rooms showed it. We weren't on the property much, but it was a solid night's stay (no free breakfast, however). I'm still a loyal Marriott fan, but if you want a hotel within walking distance of Churchill Downs, this property is A-OK.Clean, good service, bar if you are interested. The breakfast is not impressive , although they do offer fresh fruit- a small bonus. Rooms are modern, clean and comfy. I've stayed here twice with no complaints.This hotel was very clean and quiet. My room was spotless and had a nice flatscreen tv. The dining area and bar is very nice and the food I had was good with quick service. My only real complaint is the location. Not much around to eat / shop, but a great place to sleep if you need to be close to the airport.Good price, excellent service.  Counter staff was especially helpful and gracious.  Will definitely stay here again.",,,,,"['nearly', 'weeks', 'due', 'business', 'trip', 'staff', 'helpful', 'worked', 'plans', 'changed', 'everything', 'kept', 'clean', 'neat', 'also', 'nice',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-louisville-downtown-louisville,Residence Inn  Louisville Downtown,4.0,$$,20,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. My suite was comfortable and spacious and modern. The continental breakfast was above average. Housekeeping replaced my towels every day, even though I wouldn't have minded keeping the used ones. Delicious water with fruit in it was available every day near the front desk. They even had complimentary dog biscuits. It would have been better if they provided complimentary cookies for people, but dog biscuits is still a nice gesture. They had the usual fare (make-your-own waffles, pastries, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, cereal, hot bar with different items every day, usually scrambled eggs, toast and burritos), but I was sold with the hot oatmeal they served. I like it better than just dry packets that many hotels have for breakfast. The biggest downsides about this hotel are 1) the location seemed to be slightly unsavory; 2) there is no shuttle service. If you have your own transportation or don't mind cabs, you'll be fine. Note, there is a nightly parking fee. If you want to walk around downtown, you may want to pick another hotel. There were a few bars nearby and a McDonald's across the street, as well as a strip club I think. If those things don't bother you, then I definitely recommend this hotel.Residence Inn has all the comforts of home and more at a fair and reasonable price. I booked this hotel for a recent weekend trip to Louisville due to its location, price, and amenities and overall I was pleased with my decision. I arrived at the hotel about just before check-in and was welcomed by a friendly front desk agent. The room itself was large, with a mini kitchen area and a living room which was separate from the bedroom. The kitchen was nice and had plenty of storage in the fridge and freezer. The living room area was nice, however during this trip it was only used as a place to store my suitcase. The bed itself wasn't the most comfortable however it did provide a quality night's sleep, my only complaint was the pillows which were far too soft and failed to provide any real support. The room itself was spacious, and very welcoming. My only complaint was the free internet itself was rather slow at times, however there was the ability to upgrade to a faster tier for a slight upcharge. Just like every other Residence Inn this location also provides evening socials Monday-Wednesday and a free hot breakfast, complete with bacon, eggs, waffle maker, and everything else you would expect. While not always as good as other local options it's a huge time saver and makes it super convenient to be able to grab a quick bite before hitting the road. I didn't have a chance to scope out the pool or business center, however both were located on the main floor. Parking here is $16/day, and can be accessed from on East Market just past the reserved check-in lane. The hotel is a short walk to Louisville Slugger Field and several restaurants and bars. Overall the stay here was good and the value was even better.Nice, but leaves a lot to be asked for.Rooms are huge, great amenities and service at the front desk.Shower head was dirty, doors bang loudly and are very thin. Breakfast buffet is decent.Parking is great though, connected and very easy to park and get to your room.Management just needs to work on the little things. Location is very good as well.The wife and I stayed at the Residence Inn Louisville Downtown for a four-night (Wed-Sun) stay for our Bourbon Trail visit.  Check-in was a snap as we used the Marriott app to check-in while on the road.  We arrived around 9PM, so our room was ready and waiting for us.  Parking was plentiful for hotel guests and easy to access from E. Market and Preston St.  With minor variations, pretty much every Residence Inn throughout the country looks and feels about the same.  Our room was clean and comfortable with a firm bed and decent pillows.  Plus, it had free wifi.  Housekeeping was unseen since we were out of room practically the entire time but for sleeping, but our room was obviously cleaned and straightened up.  Convenient location was what set this Residence Inn apart.  Located downtown, it was very convenient to the areas of the city we wanted to go.  It was practically across the street from Louisville Slugger Field and the new home to Angel's Envy Distillery currently under construction, and a very walkable distance to Butchertown and the restaurants, bars, and shops in NuLu.  Going in the opposite direction, it was an equally walkable distance to Whiskey Row, the Yum Center, the Evan Williams Bourbon Experience, the Louisville Slugger Museum, and plenty of restaurants and bars.  Its location was so convenient; we only needed an Uber once to make our dinner reservations at 610 Magnolia in Old Louisville and a cab once when we were caught in torrential summer downpour and needed to get back to the hotel.  Location may not be everything, but the Residence Inn Louisville Downtown had it and much more!  It will be our home base the next time we're in town.I stayed here for the weekend with my daughter for the Forecastle Festival at Waterfront Park. Everything was excellent and the staff was very friendly!It is also within 2 blocks walking distance to the park with indoor parking at $16.00 a night. If I go back, I'll stay here again. The convenience of having a kitchenette, and the distance to the park were good selling points.Clean rooms as well made for a comfortable stay. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they didn't have any drink machines. If you want a soda, bring it with you because it's $2.00 at the ""Market"" by the front desk.Very nice hotel! I visited the area for business and everything went well- no problems or complaints from me! It was clean!!! I didn't feel like I needed to wipe everything down or wear slippers throughout the room! The bed was soooo comfy, pillows comfy, nice kitchen-just overall GREAT stay!!! I felt safe and at home!This is the spot during convention time in Louisville. Why?* Far enough from 4th Street yet close enough to everything.* NuLu being a block away with new restaurants such as Deka and Toast.* It's the Residence Inn, you have your suite with a bedroom, living room, and kitchen.* Don' t feel like going out after a long day just eat at your temporary home.* Garage is large and two levels with doors to the hotel* Staff is very nice and professional* Hotel is secureOverall, a nice location if you know where to go in the area.This is our fIrst time here. Hotel is very nice great location in downtown Louisville.  Parking was easy in small garage next to hotel.   Rooms are nice we stayed in suite with kitchen. If you need a place to stay downtown and close to Louisville slugger baseball field I would recommend it's within walking distance. . Many small art galleries are just within blocks as well. This was easy to find right at the highway.I stayed here for the week for corporate training and the staff could not have been better! They were friendly and helpful which made being away from home so much easier!!!Had to find a place with no notice because I was having a medical procedure done in town. Every other place was either booked and wanted $250+ or was just crappy. Not only was the rate reasonable, the front desk was super friendly. I explained to them that my husband had worked all night and then driven me to town that morning, they let him check in at 11am and sleep while I was in the medical center and then we stayed overnight. The room was perfect! The bed was so comfy, the couch was extra large and there was a full kitchen. Super large bathroom. Couldn't have asked for a better stay.Listed as a 7 star hotel? Why? It's an average Marriott Residence Inn with paper thin walls and windows, a very loud bar next door, and lots of obnoxious drunk people out in front and in the parking garage all night long. Staff is super nice but very under impressed overall. Location is average. $16 per night for parking in the parking garage. Very minimal breakfast choices. We are regular Marriott members and have stayed in a huge variety of places. The Courtyard is in a much more convenient area for walking to restaurants, etc. Will definitely stay there instead next time.WOW! Ready for a long review? Let's do this: I haven't had a hotel stay that was this pleasant in a long time. Thank you so much, Residence Inn! Your hotel was clean, well-staffed, convenient, and offered a 5-star experience. This hotel has it right. First, the location was awesome. It was easy to get to from the highway (I came from the east), there is a spot right outside the front door for you to park and check-in, and the parking garage is attached to the building and has easy in/out access. Also, the parking lot is attached to the building on both levels and I felt extremely safe. The lot is permit only, so it's monitored ($10/night to park--not bad!). The hotel isn't right in the ""heart of downtown"" (think museum row, 4th street live, etc.), but having stayed at the Galt House, Seelbach, Brown Hotel, and Hyatt Regency, I'm going to have to say the Residence Inn takes it on ease of parking and convenience. I could walk from my car and get to my room in under 2 minutes.Next, the staff is amazing. Every staffer I met was kind, knowledgeable, and smiling. Even the housekeeping crew said hi and smiled! The man that checked me in last Friday night was incredible and so hospitable. When my ice maker wasn't working, he kindly got me a bag of ice from the kitchen downstairs and apologized for the inconvenience. He was great at directing me where to park, how to get to my room, and answering any question I had. On Saturday morning, the front desk attendant was able to give me directions to where I was heading. On to the room: Super clean and well stocked! There wasn't an iPod docking station which was the one and ONLY downer as I'm addicted to listening to music on my iPod, but I survived! The kitchenette was great. All the dishes, utensils, and appliances were extremely clean and I definitely appreciated having this luxury in my room. I stayed in the one bed/studio style room. There was a small table for dining, a desk, a couch, a TV that swiveled between the bed and couch for viewing, and a very comfortable bed. The linens were nice too. My skin is sensitive to harsh chemicals and I had no problems with the Residence Inn bedding (thank you SO much for this, Residence Inn!). I loved the spacious bathroom with excessive mirrors, because a girl can never have too many mirrors. Did I mention they supply Paul Mitchell shampoo/conditioner? SCORE.Other things I loved about this hotel: - I didn't hear anyone above/below/beside/across from us all weekend. This building was obviously well-insulated.- Do not be hesitant about using the pop-out bed from the couch because it's darn comfy! They supply extra bedding for it, so no worries there. - The breakfast was tasty and the coffee was good! I hate cheap hotel coffee, but I didn't feel the need to jet off to Starbucks after enjoying a cup of their brew.- There are several restaurants that you can get to easily from the hotel, but if you're in dire need for a quick bite to eat, hello McDonalds one block away. Or, if you need to unwind after a stressful meeting/week/etc., hello Haymarket Whiskey Bar one block away. Don't wanna leave your room? The Residence Inn provides with you a huge list of delivery options and a grocery service!- Free wifi!- Gym and pool and whirlpool! Sadly, I didn't get to use them (weekend got too busy).Confession time: I was a Hyatt/Hilton girl before this. I think I'm a convert to the Marriott ways now. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and will recommend it to anyone I know traveling to L-Ville.Lately when I am in Louisville and staying with my family, this is where we decide to stay.  It has a nice location to everything (and RIGHT across the stret from Slugger Field!).The place is clean, the staff is friendly, and even has breakfast included.  They have a cool pool as well.  We ended up getting 2 2BR units and a baby playpen as well.  It is also nice they have full kitchens as well.If you need a big place to stay in Louisville for a decent price- this is the place to come- or else you will need to look for presidential suites or what not in the nicer hotels which are way more costly.We stayed here for 2 nights. The employees were helpful and courteous. There's a small little store in the hotel lobby that sells snacks, toiletries, pain meds etc. It was handy. We booked 2 rooms, both were 2 bedroom suites. Beds are comfortable. Rooms were clean. The rooms were bigger than I thought they'd be and the kitchen was well stocked. This place was great, I'd definitely stay here again. Also, there's a reasonably priced shuttle service at the hotel. It accommodated our group of 10. You can walk to some great restaurants from here. The breakfast (included in the stay) was ok, definitely not gluten free friendly. Even the hash browns seemed lightly breaded. Parking is $10 per car per day. You can hear hotel doors closing at night time, it never woke me up though.I'm torn about this hotel. It's a really nice hotel. The parking was very cheap as downtown hotels go $10 a night. The staff was really helpful and sweet. They have a nice, free breakfast. So all of that stuff was great. We were in room 202. So, if we weren't so close to the street and next to a bar, I might have been much happier. They didn't have a room to move us to for our stay. We were there for four nights, over a weekend and each night there were undesirables drinking, smoking, cussing and revving motorcycles just beneath my bedroom window. I actually went out and bought the loudest fan I could find. So a tip....ask for a high floor away from Market street. Another tip...there is a free trolley that makes a loop on Market and then down Main so you can take it through NULU and all the way down to the Louisville Slugger Museum. The front desk also has a nice map of downtown that was very helpful. Between the walking and the trolley, we barely took the car out.This place deserves a good review, I would stay here again.  The rooms are great, very clean, modern and nicely decorated.  It feels like a studio apt. with a kitchenette, desk area with couch, chair, etc.  Comfortable beds and overall just a nice feel to it.  It makes business travel a bit less horrible.  Staff is very friendly as well.  Free wireless in the rooms which is always a bonus, cable only has the basics, maybe 25 channels or so.The only negative for me is the shortcuts on the bathroom towels which are a bit rough, and the shampoos, etc. should be upgraded....not even a body lotion?  We all know that traveling on planes and staying in hotels completely dries you out!  For all the details they have paid attention to here...how can you cheap out on bathroom stuff!Great service. They go extra mile - even during the Derby!Not a 4-star hotel, but clean, nicely decorated, very helpful and polite staff. Good spread for breakfast, of course. Building is pretty much brand new, as far as I could tell.The best part is the location - a block (or less) from Louisville Slugger field, one more block to Riverfront Park. A really great urban hotel, on the cheap(ish).Not as nice as some Residence Inns.  Bed was squeaky and room was very small.  Room had a view of a parking lot.  At night, saw some shady looking people in the parking garage...  Didn't feel safe.  Next time I will stay back at the 21c.Great new place, descent design. Try to get Hampton Inn(2 blocks away), if not, this will work.",,,,,"['thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'suite', 'comfortable', 'spacious', 'modern', 'continental', 'breakfast', 'average', 'housekeeping',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-louisville-airport-louisville-2,Courtyard Louisville Airport,3.0,$$,19,"After a long, 9 hour drive from Rochester, NY today, we arrived at this hotel tired, and ready to be out of the car. Alex greeted us with a smile and asked us how we were, where we were heading, and how our trip had been. She was courteous, helpful, and a wonderful help when it came to getting us checked in quickly and efficiently.Our room was nice and updated. The bed was very comfortable and different varieties of pillows. The only downfall is the bathroom. The decor has been updated, but that's it. The tub had some mold on the grout and the fixtures are old and outdated.We will definitely return on our next trip through.Front desk staff (a young guy and young woman) were mostly interested in speaking to each other.Very cold night and i had an early flight out so i wanted to return my rental car and use the shuttle.  The hotel was not busy at all and per instructions of woman at the desk i returned my car and phoned for a pick up. (hey both had told me '2 minutes' which is truly about the time to the airport).  after 15 min in 20 deg cold, i phoned again and the guy told me he was in transit.  another 10 min in the cold.i had dinner at their Bistro-i hate eating at hotels as i travel all the time and they usually are crap. 15 min in line to order, 25 min wait for a burger and 15 more to pay.  all while Jack and Jill were chatting 30 feet away. to be fair to the one guy in the Bistro he had no held and those two were not about to lift a finger.  I stay at Marriott a lot and have seen front desk help out at the Bistro often-not that night.  This is about people who dont give a s... about service-its just a jobIt's a courtyard if I wanted better I should have stayed at the Ritz really what do you want?Did not have a good experience as the fire alarm went off about 5 times between 2:30-4:30am during my one night stay. There was no fire but instead an issue with the system. ""Maintenance was attempting to fix the problem"" each time I called front desk.I stay at Courtyard's a lot. This is probably the lowest quality one I've stayed at, but that sounds harsh. It really wasn't bad. I would stay here again. That said, this was my experience on my overnight on 9/23/13.This place is so close to the airport you could almost walk there. They were able to check me in early. Yay! The carpet in the elevators was really, really dirty. My room was clean, but had outdated wallpaper and shower curtain. The complimentary coffee was totally cold and the creamer curdled when I poured it in. I visited the bistro and the lady at the register was too busy playing with her phone to notice me. I got a glass of wine though and a snack from the market. The bed was comfy. The room was quiet. I slept well. The shower was hot, but I was annoyed by the closet. It had some wired metal rack instead of a clothes bar, and was awkward. I returned to the bistro in the morning. Service was friendly and prompt even though there was a crowd. My receipt was wrong. They said they fixed it, but they couldn't print off proof.Update 10-6 - I checked my bank statements. They didn't fix my receipt.Enjoyed my stay. Comfy beds, nice amenities, clean rooms, and friendly staff. It always bugs me that they don't have a free continental breakfast but what can you do.Really this is a pretty nice hotel for the price when you compare it to it's competitors. My room was very clean and  the hotel even gave us 4 free cans of coke for the baseball tournament that was going on in town this weekend. I didn't get a chance to use the pool or the spa as they were filled with kids, but they both looked very nice. The staff wasn't particularly warm or hospitable, but I cut them plenty of slack as there were tons of kids running everywhere for the tournament.Overall it was a pleasant experience and I wouldn't mind at all returning here for another nice stay.Perfectly nice property, but customer service is severely lacking.  Trash can in room had a rotten banana in it when we checked in. Coffee splatter on the wall by the coffee maker. Stayed one night with the family for a volleyball tournament.  Four of us in a one bedroom suite.  I had requested extra towels and blankets when I made the reservations online - but there were not provided.  Not a big deal, called down to request that some be sent up and I was rudely told that they were too busy...they can give me some later if I come down to the desk.  Lady was rude when I went down, it was a bother to her.  Next day I requested late check out (gold status guarantees late check out).  Was told no even after I pointed out the membership rules...had to argue to get late checkout.  For $370 for one night, I expect at least courteous service.Amazing five star service! I'm in the middle of my stay here and couldn't be happier. First, we received an email reminding about our stay. Next, we got a personal email from Michael Scott, the manager asking if we needed anything. We emailed back about extra pillows and connecting rooms. To our delight, he emailed back right away and took care of our requests!  We've stayed in many hotels and never had that happen. We've called before our stay and they usually say they can't guarantee anything. What a relief it was to check late and not worry that our kids would be far away from our room. That is five star service. But, it doesn't end there. Beverly checked us in and could not have been friendlier or more helpful. She was joking around with our son, getting us checked in and to our rooms. We did have an issue with our toilet running and Michael has been up to fix it himself.It was a wonderful stay with attentive service and would stay there again in a heartbeat!Great staff. Front desk is awesome,Shuttle drivers to and from airport are so courteous!  Rooms ok.Too bad they don't offer a free breakfast! And although they do have Starbucks in the lobby and do have a menu I'm the morning and evening- a glass of wine is $12.95 a glass... Ouch.. Go to the grocery store and save your pennies.I have stayed here twice, both times while attending Lebowski Fest held at the bowling alley right next door.  So for that convenience alone, it cannot be beat!  The rates are incredibly reasonable and the hotel is spotlessly clean.  The lobby has recently been remodeled and is very nice.  They have a little section with computers to use (though I had my laptop both times and could take advantage of the free wifi) and books to read.  The rooms are large and nicely decorated.  The pool is very small but nice and clean.  Check in/out was very easy.  I don't know if we're going to be able to stay here again because they are not pet friendly and we no longer have our one trusted dog sitter so we will more than likely have to find a pet friendly hotel and bring her with next time.Newly renovated rooms, they did a nice job, staff is very friendly.It is your regular Courtyard by Marriott. It is fairly easy to know what to expect.The staff is very friendly and helpful and the hotel is very clean. The room we had has a HDTV and the channels are actually in HD. The lobby, pool and all other amenities on the first floor are in great shape.The one surprise is the free wireless Internet in the room. This is the first Marriott property that I have been to that has free wireless internet in the rooms. I suspect this may be due to a neighboring hotel and their open network likely covers a good portion of this hotel. As a result, they have no choice to offer free wi-fi because nobody would pay for it here and just leach off of a neighboring network.But overall, it is a nice hotel and you should have no worries should you stay here.Friendly staff, clean rooms, nicely appointed. However, the reservation process stated that we received free breakfast with the reservations (2 rooms, 5 nights). But at present, breakfast is $10 per person ($12 Friday-Sunday). Because of this, we had to allow extra time in the morning to drive several blocks to pick up coffee &amp; oatmeal at Starbucks before we were scheduled to be at the Kentucky Fair &amp; Expo Center. The free Wi-Fi in the rooms is decent - sometimes spotty, but otherwise fast. There were no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms, which is standard where we normally stay. Would book here again if other hotels in the area have no vacancy.While nicely updated, I'm afraid this is the least well-run Courtyard I've stayed in.  As a gold member, I'm actually quite a fan of the Marriott chain, but I've had two poor experiences at the front desk.  The restaurant service was slow and pitiful.  And tonight, I just tried to turn on my TV, and it won't even work.  When I called downstairs, two reps answered the phone and kept talking over one another.  Did they not hear each other?  Honestly, the staff training here needs an update like the lobby's had.Very friendly and helpful staff. The newly remodeled lobby is very attractive and comfortable. Gym is small but in good working order.Our room was very attractive. The only problems were: 1) apparently you have to ask for a fridge (we did not), and 2) we were put in a handicapped room (that we did not request) and there was no bathtub.We will definitely stay here again but will ask for a fridge and non-handicapped room.It's an old style Courtyard. They are starting to remodel the lobby, and I'm sure it will be sometime before they start to work on the rooms. Small exercise room, a exercise bike, a eliptical, and a treadmill. Nothing close by to eat. A mile from the airport, and really thought the service at the front desk was very good.Standard chain hotel with a comfy lounge and lobby downstairs. Free WiFi, which is a plus and allows me to write this review while sitting in the lobby. No real food to speak off, small coffee shop. Rooms are spacious and clean. Nothing glamorous here but functional. The staff are friendly. It's a bit spendy for what you get, but maybe that's just the day I'm here and they are quite full.I'm instantly annoyed at a hotel that doesn't have wireless.  The beds are hard and thin foam and the rooms are not that clean.",,,,,"['long', 'hour', 'drive', 'today', 'arrived', 'hotel', 'tired', 'ready', 'car', 'greeted', 'smile', 'asked', 'heading', 'trip',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/breckinridge-inn-hotel-louisville,Breckinridge Inn Hotel,3.0,$$,26,"Location was in the middle of where we wanted to go for the weekend.  It's near enough to malls on Shelbyville Road, near enough to restaurants, near enough to I-264 and I-64 and I-65.  It had amenities I wanted -- continental breakfast, complimentary shampoo, hairdryer, coffee in the room, and free Wi-Fi.Beds were comfortable, noise was nill, rooms were clean, and the price per night was below 70.00.  That was super.The only glaring flaw was the tip jar in the dining area for the continental breakfast.  Never seen that before at any other hotel.Sigh.... I didn't have many expectations. I just wanted a room at a decent price since I was on a budget because my company is cheap. During the week night I got a king bed room for 70 bucks, for the location I think it's a good deal.The hotel boost a lot of amenities there's a dance room/lounge, in indoor pool, outdoor pool, a workout room with 1950s equipment but I like it, it has the bare minimum and you can actually get a good workout.The room itself is large but the walls are very thin. There was a baby crying next door and I could hear it very easily. The bed was clean and comfortable. I would have preferred something a little bit quieter but beggars can't be choosers in this situation. Still better than a Super 8 or Motel 6!Easy to get to right off of the expressway and within 10 mins of good food/drink (I suggest the Silver Dollar). Hotel is super basic and not very updated. Bed was ok, bathroom was clean. We stayed here because it is pet friendly and our dog is with us. They failed to mention the additional $25 pet fee, so be aware of that. If I was going to end up paying $100 for a room that is pet friendly I plan to look elsewhere next time. There are better options.Friendly staff, clean accommodations, close to my favorite bbq. We didn't bring kids, or use the pool, but this is a great hideaway. Will be back.Didn't stay so can't give a fair review of room. However, arrive at 10 PM on a Saturday night to music blasting form the basement night club up in the lobby and down the room hallway. I had a reservation at this location as I was catching a flight at the airport in the morning. They advertised an airport shuttle on their site. It does not run until 7 AM so if you have an early flight before 8:30 AM they will not accommodate you. Also, when I told the desk clerk the issue and asked if there was anything I could do he kind of scoffed at me then laughed. His name was ""Bill"" I believe from what another employee called him. Well, Bill's bad attitude and foggy glasses as well as the Breckenridge Inn can count myself out. I found a Courtyard Marriott in the vicinity of the airport with an accommodating shuttle, better customer service, and way better reviews on cleanliness and experience than the Breckenridge for $20 more. Proceed with caution as these other reviews aren't flattering, either.One word:  ghetto. Room and hallways smelled like fried chicken grease. We moved hotels for our second night.  It does have an old, outdoor tennis court, which might be the best amenity. Breakfast was a mediocre cattle carb feed, but better than nothing.  I recommend sticking to the Raisin Bran, OJ, &amp; coffee. Service quality low at front desk for Friday night check in.  Required guest to walk back through dark parking lot to get new key cards when we couldn't get into the building after check in, leaving one person waiting outside with bags, rather than immediately deliver working keys to us. Experienced a low sense of security, even inside building.Horrible. Stayed two nights. No housekeeping service. Signs outside say  doors locked after 9pm. They're not. Sheets on my bed were on inside out. Pillows are miserable. ""Breakfast"" over at 10 am. I missed it and asked for a yogurt. ""We have no yogurt"" was all I got   So all in all a hotel piece of crap.The Breckinridge Inn in Louisville has many problems.  The air conditioner in our room was broken and squealing so bad that you couldn't even stay in the room.  Called maintenance and they took out the filters, said they were the wrong filters and then cleaned them and put them back in.  Of course this didn't fix the problem.  We couldn't change rooms because the hotel was full.  The hotel didn't do anything to accommodate us.Next was the pool, there are so many members of the Health Club that you can't even find a chair to lay out and enjoy the sun.  The members are drinking alcohol, smoking and eating on the pool deck.Then, we tried to get in the hot tub and a member was rude to us because we wouldn't turn on the jets (we didn't want the jets on).Also, we set our towels out on the second day so we could have a chair to sit in and enjoy the sunshine.  The pool manager took our towels off our chairs and let a member have our chairs.  If the hotel guests aren't going to get respect, perhaps the pool should only be open to members.  Besides, if several chairs weren't broken then maybe this wouldn't have been a problem.This used to be a decent hotel for the money but now things are much worse and they charge you almost twice as much.The hotel is a little outdated but otherwise fine. The rooms are extremely well kept and the hallways are very quite in the morning and at night. I would recommend this place for people with 1 or 2 pets.When we first checked in the man at the front desk was nice. We got our room without any remarks about our two dogs. The room itself was of a reasonable size with two full beds, a desk, nightstand and a T.V. stand. The beds were very clean and the floor didn't have a trace of dirt.The hotel has an indoor, heated pool with a hot tub and an outdoor, non-heated pool. There are life guards at each pool and you are required to sign in before you can get in. Also the indoor pool has two lap lanes.If you are expecting a modern hotel you will be disappointed, but if you don't mind a dated hotel for cheap, this place is perfect. It was clean and the staff was friendly. The free wifi wasn't slow either. It's in good shape for its obvious age, but there are signs here and there of needed maintenance....Very basic level cheap hotel. Clean. Easy to get lost in the long, winding hallways. At check-in, they didn't mention the continental breakfast (we just happened to see the sign) or wifi (and there was no info in the room about either. The clerk also gave us bad directions on parking area near our room. I had to call downstairs to ask for wifi password. Fewer washcloths (2) in the room than guests (3).I've eaten at plenty of cheap hotel continental breakfasts before, but never seen one that had no fruit, no yogurt, no waffle maker. Except for hard-boiled eggs and oatmeal packets, it was pretty much all bread. Good plentiful hot coffee, though. I just wouldn't do it more than one day, most likely. We're going to the indoor pool tonight, which looks nice and has lanes for lap swimming, which is great. But we largely picked the hotel for the pool and at check-in learned that my daughter wouldn't be allowed to use the hot tub (12 and older) - guess that could be a selling point for some, but it was a big disappointment for her.So nothing awful about the place or anything, but nothing great either.Stayed here overnight and was very disappointed. Pool was very big and nice but exercise room was below average and treadmills would not go past 3 mph. I did not expect something modern and luxurious but they seem to be trying to get away with the absolute least. I understand running a hotel but I also understand the need to create a nice place for your guests to stay. We went down for breakfast in the morning and it was awful, you could tell that all of the food came out of packages and I know this is the case with many continental breakfasts but at least they make it seem as if it is not. No freshly made food and extreme limited quantity and a very small variety of anything. Walls are very thin and could hear children all night. Over all, I was disappointed. My family and I used to be members of their pool and loved it but I can't say the same about the hotel.One of the worst hotel experiences I've had in a while. I requested a downstairs room so it'd be easier to carry in our luggage and big rolling cooler. I did not get one, which usually I can live with, but this hotel has only one elevator and at the lobby which was far from our room. Ok, I'm fine, BUT once we wheeled and carried everything on we had a rough time because the hallways have steps all throughout the hotel. We had to keep stopping and my daughter and I would have to lift heavy items together each set of stairs. It was also very hot in the halls which didn't help our situation. So, on the day of checkout, I parked at the lobby entrance and we lugged our heavy items back up &amp; down all the steps, down the halls, to the elevator and out to the car in two trips.  Then, I drove our car around to the entrance close to our room to pack up the rest of our lighter weight stuff.  Well, even though I had our key card, the doors wouldn't open! So, back in the car and drive back to the lobby! Understand too that during all this there was never anyone at the front desk! So, since we were in town for a swim meet that we had to be at each day at 6:45, this was starting to get irritating to say the least. It was 6:30 and I needed to check out. Also, the last 2 nights we were there, I was woke up at 3:40 am until after 4 am and then 12:30 am the next night because of people being loud and rambunctious in the hallway and rooms next to us. Finally, someone was at the desk just in time for us to make it to our meet and I approach out of breath, sweating, and tired. I complain and he says ""you should have let me know and I would have got the door for you.""  I respond, ""no one was here!""  Well, he didn't say much to that. No offer to discount or anything. I won't stay again. Too bad. The pool is actually nice, but that's all I enjoyed. Everything else was a pain.I gave This business a second chance.  It's a convenient place to stay.  This time I was given a room in a different part of the building and it was a quiet spot.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The counter person was friendly.  The price was reasonable for a week day rate.I have stayed here twice in the last 4 weeks visiting friends. I am from the Detroit area. The first time I was alone and because of a room mix up I was upgraded to a mini suite for my next visit with my husband. I had great experiences both times. The rooms were clean and affordably priced. The staff was super friendly and helpful. On my last visit, the gentleman at the front desk was nice enough to accommodate my friends and I in one of their party/conference room for pizza when we were rained out at the pool. The pools are awesome! You can take coolers and food. They are very well kept and looked after. The guests are like one big family and everyone was always so friendly. This is my go to place whenever we are in town now. Downfall was the beds could be a little more comfy but we slept well enough.I don't know if I stayed at a different hotel than all these five star ratings or if they are fake reviews. We had a connecting room with the rest of our party and their room was 'fine' except for a dirty vent in the shower (that I was made aware of). We went in February so no pools were open. Our room, on the other hand, was pitiful. Walking in the room we were immediately smothered by an overpowering smoke smell in the 'non smoking' room. It was in the central system, sheets, towels. Everywhere. I can handle smoke somewhat but this was awful. There isn't much more to say other than I spent over $30 on air fresheners trying to mask the smoke. Our ice bucket had mold in it. Thank goodness we didn't plan on using it. The sheets on one bed and some towels were dirty. Hopefully just stained...I hope. And the mattresses in both rooms were like sleeping on cardboard. Very thin and old. I don't mind sleeping on uncomfortable beds but not when the rooms were on the more expensive side. The walls were super thin! Both mornings we awoke to retching. Not ours. Somebody must have had a stomach bug or something. If my rooms had been more updated it would have been a cute hotel. The wifi was very fast. The breakfast was good. Normal hotel breakfast. Unless under dire circumstances, I will not be staying here again.Omg! Scary hotel! Run down, elevators not maintained, dirty and run down rooms. No Managers on Duty. Loser punk runs the pool sits there and texts all day. Never saw housekeeping the 2 nights we were there...Breakfast lady was nice thoThis is definitely a two star hotel - despite the favorable reviews. Their website has the touched up photos that makes the whites a little brighter and everything much more flattering.  I mean why not ... it's not like most of you will post ugly pictures of yourself.Some convention was going on in Louisville so I didn't have a whole lot of choices in where I could stay.  It was cheap and since I once had a room that had blood on the sheets, I can pretty much tolerate anything.  It was clean ... but dingy.  Walls are thin - so I could hear a lot of the noise outside - outside my door and outside the window.  Free wifi, but connection was slow as molasses.  I tried all 3-4 wifi connections and could barely surf the web, much less watch Netflix or something.  Also - the TV remote didn't have a sleep option so I couldn't drown out some of the noise outside with the TV either.  It was fine though.  Sheets were white and the towels were clean.  Dominos delivers (instead of room service).  It's right off the freeway so decent location.  I stayed in the city last time I was in town - and getting to / from my rental car and in / out of the city was a challenge ... but I might prefer to do that than stay here again.  I worked most of the time and needed a bit more quiet and a more dependable internet. But for the price ... and on vacation, this would have been fine.  Oh .. .and maybe if I brought my dog ... b/c I heard a dog barking down the hall.Breckinridge Inn Hotel was such an upgrade from the Econo Lodge I first stayed at in downtown Louisville.  I found the hotel for cheap on Priceline the day I had to check in.The bedroom was clean and the bed didn't have any crusty stains like a lot of hotels do.  The bed was comfortable and the TV was great.  The bathroom was nice and clean.They have two pools, inside and outside and an inside jacuzzi.  Both were nice and clean.  It was kind of weird to see a lifeguard on duty at a pool.Breakfast was great.  They served biscuits and sausage, cereal and toast.  I got to breakfast late because my hotel room alarm clock was 10 minutes slow.  The only down side was you could not take your breakfast back to the room with you.Will stay at the Breckenridge again if they have their rooms for under $60 again!Expected a three star hotel and really got a two star. Has many amenities but are very subpar. Wifi is slow and continually drops, fitness center is from 1984 and some of the equipment needs repair, tv in room was from 1999. The rooms however were clean and the staff was very friendly.","A pretty good hotel with very reasonable pricing. As far as hotels go, they offered everything we needed and did so without any issues. The hotel is older and that shows, but that would not deter us from staying there again.  Our daughters really enjoyed the indoor pool which was also kept very clean. The breakfast was the only area lacking in my opinion, as there was not a great variety of foods offered.Nice enough place. Nice 'Health Club' with 2 pools and gym. Price was better on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FTravelocity.com&amp;s=3f4a97ba730c914770c377a180e6bcef85750046a0d397f67128ddbf822b5d49"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Travelocity.com</a> than directly though their own website.Stayed for 4 nights.Fantastic place to stay and the price is perfect, first off the day front desk staff was super friendly and went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable...large rooms, very tidy, sheets were white and the towels were clean.   Friendly housekeeping and the shuttle driver from the airport was awesome. Very Impressed with the service and staff and overall appearance. Wifi was a bit slow but not a huge deal.The price is just right for what you get.  The staff is consistently nice and the rooms are always very clean.  We have stayed here many times in the past few years.  Their workout area definitely could use updating but it is very functional for a good workout.Oh WOW! I have payed twice as much or more for a room and not been half as pleased as I was with this hotel. So charming and plush. The grounds, hallways, parking lot, pools, and most of all rooms were clena as can be, and I have high standards. The bed was huge and so comfortable. When we walked in the ac was already on and working great, the room was at a very comfortable temperature (most hotels leave the ac off when there are no guests in them, meaning when you first get in the room its uncomfortably hot) The wifi was plenty fasty enough, i noticed they had 3 seperate wifi signals of varying strenght, one for each wing I suppose. The shower was extremely comfy, the shower head had many speeds and good pressure and the heat lamp was a nice touch. Plenty of towels and pillows too! At around 50.00 a night this place is a steal!Not bad for the price we paid through expedia including car rental.  The hotel was close enough to everything from restaurants, malls and airport.  The only draw back was it smells musty inside the room and hallway.  Also it would be great if there will be no smoking at least 100 ft away from the hotel entrance.  But overall love the continental breakfast that's provided and for keeping the room tidy and ready in time.",,,,"['location', 'middle', 'wanted', 'weekend', 'near', 'enough', 'malls', 'road', 'near',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-louisville-downtown-louisville,SpringHill Suites Louisville Downtown,4.0,$$,31,"Look, I don't look for anything fancy when I stay at hotels. I stay at hotels simply for somewhere to lay my head at the end of the day, because I like to explore wherever I'm at. In this particular instance, I was here to discover Bourbon Trail.The hotel is very easy to get to from the highway, and is attached to their sister Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites. Parking was rather inexpensive for downtown (I think maybe $15!?) and right next to the hotel - so very convenient. The check in process was smooth and my group headed up to our rooms. We had three rooms, all with two double beds. The rooms were HUGE. They're clean and spacious (even including a half bath!?), which was a quite a deal given the price. The hotel's swimming pool and gym were well kept and the breakfast buffet was delicious. The hotel is only four blocks away from Bourbon Trail, and it was very safe.Overall, it was a wonderful stay and I highly recommend this Marriott property. Once again, Marriott delivers.Great hotel!!Staff 5/5 extremely professional. And I mean on point!! Treated me like I was in a $500/night hotel. Very personal and respectful.Area 5/5 your right off 65 in the heart of downtown Louisville, can't go wrong with that.Facility 5/5 great building with on site parking and special parking for Elite members.Rooms 5/5 these rooms are very nice and spacious!! Perfect in every way.Love this place, will definitely come back when in town.I guess if I could say anything bad it would be. 1) parking isn't free but what downtown parking in any large city is. 2) the rooms have 1.5 baths with is impressive but the .5 has a sink so small it's almost unusable.So that was searching for complaints but if you asked me overall I have none.I enjoyed the rooms in the hotel. They are newly updated, modern, simple, and having the commode in a separate from from the shower was a cool, Japanese-style touch. I stayed alone, but I could appreciate how that set-up would be nice for a couple or a family. My room had a small living-room area that was well designed. Of the 4 Marriott brand hotels where I've stayed downtown this year, this one had my favorite room.The shuttle was a nice perk. Try to make a reservation for it because it's popular.  The breakfast was just ok. The hotel is a short walk to several restaurants and I found the staff to be friendly.  The lollipops at the front desk were a pleasant surprise.Looking to stay in central location in Louisville? This is the hotel for you! Are you that person who wants to explore the city and doesn't REALLY care about what the room looks like as long as it's modern? This hotel is for you! SpringHill Suites is modern, clean, and exactly what you want when you pop into a city for the night. Is it swanky/modern no. Is it renovated? Yes. The bed was super cozy and for some reason we had two bathrooms in our room. I loved the cool calming color scheme, and the small couch and table were nice to eat a snack on after traveling. I'm the type of person that skips the character and goes for a modern hotel anytime - the clean lines are just more calming to me. But this hotel is all about the location and the price cannot be beat. Just a few blocks from anything downtown and a $3-$4 uber ride to NuLu. Would definitely be my choice hotel when staying in Louisville again - and don't forget your AAA discount!The rooms are nice. Spacious and clean. They respect my privacy that's always good. The chair, couch, and bed are all comfortable. The bathroom is clean and has what we need.The lobby leaves something to be desired but most people probably don't hang out there so it's okay I suppose. And the adjacent hotel that they are connected to has a more spacious lobby and sitting area.Free wifi is pretty standard for this type of hotel. So nothing special to report except that it didn't let me play by cellphone games. It connected the first day, I think, but the second and third days it didn't. Sad. Parking is easy but the entry into the hotel area is a little confusing from the street. Good location. Good food. Clean, fresh, and delicious breakfast.Recommend it whole heartedly.This place is not being rated on an absolute scale - so no comparison to the four seasons or a motel 6, I am rating it based on what it is, a centrally located no frills hotel. The room was clean and well maintained with no signs of wear or lack of care. The beds in our double queen room where well cared for. The pull out queen was great for three kids and we didn't feel crowded on our stay here while road tripping to the tail of the dragon. The hotel front desk woman was beyond welcoming!!  She checked me in within 5 minutes flat and did so while dealing with another guest. She then walks outside to meet me in their guest parking lot to direct me into a space since I was hauling my bike on a trailer and wanted two spots to park. She actually took a ten minute break to assist me into the space. After going to my room I came back down to get my luggage and the security man for the property surprised me and my son by the car -- probably doing his job --- but and here is the kicker -  he never confronted us in a unfriendly way instead he says can I help you with your luggage to your room which he does taking up half our luggage all by himself. Both the front desk woman on duty on the evening of August 15, 2015 and the security guard who helped with our luggage were outstanding examples of hospitality. The morning had us downstairs for a complimentary breakfast but frankly unless here on business I would try one of the nearby local joints I have reviewed as its a meh breakfast mostly prepared foods no real eggs or omelettes or strong coffee - but it's a nice touch for families who are busyFantastic free breakfast buffet, complete with an oatmeal bar. Our room was very clean and modern. Wifi works great. Convenient location close to bars and restaurants downtown.We stayed last week one night at the SpringHIll Suites for a Bachelorette Party.  The room was great and clean.  The beds are SUPER comfortable and plenty of space.  I loved that they seperated the shower/sink and another sink and toilet area.  It made it great for the amount of people who were staying the night.  Our suite had 2 queen beds and a pull out couch.  We comforatbly fit 5 people.  The only downfall of the room was that the alarm clock/iPod dock did not work for music and there wasn't a safe in the room (if you care about that kind of thing.  I personally dont have anything safe-worthy but noticed it and thought it was worth mentioning).  The continental breakfast was STELLAR (by continetal standards)  They offered oatmeal with plenty of toppings, cereal, eggs, sausage,  bacon and biscuits, along with pastries, toast,englush muffins, and bagels.  The fruti was fresh and the coffee was great.A few reason I didn't give them the 5th star:  the parking garage was a mess and the machine messed up BOTH times when I tried to enter and exit.  There was no clear help button so I had to set in my car, call the hotel, and wait as a line formed behind me.  The pool area was kind of grimy.  There were tons of noddles and used pool toys lying around and overall just didn't have a good feel to it.  As previousy stated the breakfast offerings were great but the seating in the room was limited and the space was underutliized making it hard to accomoadate the amoutn of people who were trying to eat breakfast.Overall I would definitly reccomend this hotel to friends and family (minus the pool experience).The room was clean, recently updated, and had a nice layout with a work and sitting area separated from the sleeping area by a substantial partition.  Not truly a suite, but it worked well for our family, allowing my wife and daughter to turn in early while I stayed up and read.  The room had a separate ""WC"" (water closet) with toilet and small sink, and bathroom with full sink and tub/shower.  This works well when you have a teenage daughter who takes an hour in bathroom, while you take your morning constitutional with the newspaper in the WC.  The free breakfast was better than most, and the staff very friendly and helpful.  Location was nice: close to downtown, and free shuttle to most locations.  Parking on site was a challenge, with a small parking structure overflowing with cars.  There are only ice machines on every other floor, and only the  one on 2 worked.  This hotel is directly connected to the Fairfield Inn and Suites, which is confusing and makes it easy to get lost if, like me, you lack any God-given sense of direction.  But overall, I liked this place, and would stay again.Checked in to an 8th floor room the hallway and room were very musty. We were moved to the 7th floor to a much better room, however the room was still in need of some updating. Most furniture was worn but the beds were very comfortable.Breakfast was just on the fair side. The second morning breakfast ended at 9 am instead of 10 am (like the morning before) and we missed it.The pool was small but nice and well maintained.  It did have a 5 person limit.The staff was extremely helpful and kind.GREAT SERVICE, ACCOMODATIONS &amp; AMENITIES!Had to make a pit stop here on a road trip back to Chicago from Atlanta and boy my family and I were on cloud 9!There was 7 of us with age ranging from 60-something to 3 years old and this place met everyone's special needs from a fridge to store medication, a complimentary substantial hearty breakfast, comfy luxurious beds you name it!They also pre-warmed our rooms so that we wouldn't have to bear the winter chill waiting for the heater to kick in to make the room comfortable...this is what really made a 5-PLUS star experience!The great interior design and style was definitely a bonus.  We also appreciated the proximity of the Muhammad Ali Center and made a stop before getting back on the road.Would definitely make this a regular stop on our future Chicago-Atlanta road trips!Typical cookie-cutter suite type hotel. I thought the rooms were a little Spartan, but they were clean and comfortable. What made my stay great though, was the friendliness of the staff. The breakfast buffet was average, but the fitness room was excellent!Great location for this hotel. The room is huge and clean. I do like the separate toilet but the sink in that room is too small and almost unusable. Carpet is little dated especially in the hallways. I was expecting hot/warm cookies in the evening but didn't see any during the 2 nights stay. The breakfest was ok, typical. Scramble eggs was hot but little watery. Would be nice to have ""make your own waffle"". free WiFi was great but too slow. In summary, I would come back next time I visit.This was the perfect hotel for our needs.  My friends and I were down in Louisville to complete the Urban Bourbon Trail and just needed a place to sleep that night.  Nothing fancy, but clean.  The room was spacious and modern, with clean linens.  The best part of the room was that the toilet was separate from the shower.  Score!  This was great for 4 girls getting ready in the morning and I wish all hotels were this smart.  The room was also equipped with a microwave, mini fridge, television (with a clean remote, whatever that means), desk, and couch.  Parking was great at $10/day because they allow you to come and go as much as needed, with the use of key card.  They even allowed us to leave our car there for the day after we had checked out and wanted to explore the city more.  The staff was friendly and helpful, making the checking in/out process simple.  I cannot comment on the pool because we didn't go but I will be sure to check it out in the future.  You also get free breakfast with your stay, but we overslept...too much delicious bourbon!  This hotel was in a great location and we were able to walk literally everywhere we wanted to go.  There are obviously fancier, historic hotels in the area but this is perfect for someone who just wants a nice place to crash.  Highly recommend!Great location, positive, helpful staff, clean, comfortable rooms. Got it cheap on Priceline Express deals, so even better!Stayed one night and I wasn't overly impressed.  The best things were the friendly staff and the complimentary Continental Breakfast.The room was laid out really strange.  The bathroom and the shower were in separate spaces, and the doors to each had the frosted glass.  Because my wife and I shared the room with another couple (2 queen beds), the frosted windowed doors were not the most comfortable situation.  The beds were very spongy and uncomfortable.  None of us had a decent night's sleep.   There was a couch separated by a desk/glass sliding doors partition from the bed area, but there was no tv in the couch area, which I found to be a little strange.  The walls seem to be thinner than normal as well.  We could hear the people in the room next to ours talking and laughing late into the night.  One of them had BAD gas, if you know what I mean.  The walls were rattling on occasion, and the laughter ensued from both their room AND ours.Upon receiving the hotel bill, slipped under our door, I noticed a $45 ""LD"" charge, which I thought maybe was mistakenly our neighbor's ""Loud Dump"" for disturbing the peace.  After checking with the front desk, they said it was a long distance call we had made - of which we didn't.  They looked into it, and then revealed it was billed to us in error - it was supposed to have been billed to room 515 and NOT 415.  It sounded fishy and I was just happy they took it off my bill.If in the area overnight, I won't be staying here again.  Keep looking, folks.Free wifi, free breakfast, discounted parking, near everything I need, what's not to like.  I have been here 9 weeks, so far....and counting, and have had any issue resolved quickly by the staff.  Mostly minor items, something not working, dripping, etc.  One star removed for the POOR Bistro 301 that provides their room service, not worth the time or expense of ordering from there.wifi (or wired) is pretty speedy, even when I know the hotel is full.  You even can pay for faster access if you wish.I have stayed at this location a few times. It is fairly close to the Yum Center and Fourth Street...which was the reason that I booked it the first time. Very clean, spacious and a breakfast buffett is offered. My only quarrel is the pricing is never the same. The closer to the booking date, the more it usually is.Very comfortable stay!This hotel was great.  The staff were fun, friendly, and very helpful.  We were in town to celebrate my husband's birthday and we like to park and walk everywhere.  They made sure we had a map and pointed out several places of interest.  There is a parking garage for guests and parking was just $10 a day.  The services surpassed those of other hotels.  The wireless internet was free for 3 days and if it wasn't fast enough you could pay a small fee for faster internet.  There was also a wired connection in the room.  The workout room had 3 treadmills, weights, and other machines.  Free breakfast was on the second floor and there was a large variety.  There were strawberry, blueberry, regular, and cinnamon waffles.  They also had different hot options every morning.  These included sausage and egg one day, bacon and mini omelet another day, and biscuits with gravy on Sunday.Now the most important part . . . the room.  It was clean, spacious, and very comfortable.  The bed was so comfortable that I slept through the night and I don't usually sleep all night in a hotel.The location was also perfect because we explored downtown and went to a baseball game and it is between both.  Anytime we visit downtown Louisville this will be where we stay.Great hotel! Affordable, friendly and helpful staff, comfortable and spacious rooms, clean and close to everything! One of the sinks in our room (yes, there were 2!) stopped draining and maintenance fixed it while we were out. The front desk staff even wrote us a little note with bottled water and a snack to let us know the sink was fixed. I've never felt more welcome!","This Marriott cousin is a posh little number for an affordable price. The rooms boast modern IKEA-themed decor with cool stainless steel furnishings. As our room was filled with four ladies, we were thrilled to discover each suite had a separate toilet room and shower room. That's right, no more sharing facilities! The room also had a microwave and mini fridge, as well as a lounge sofa and a modern desk with built-in privacy wall. That means, if needed, four people can change clothes at one time: one in each bathroom, one in the bed area, and one behind the privacy wall. The bedding was white cotton, all washable, with no germy old comforter. There was also an iClock, where I could dock my iPhone overnight for charging. Our sleep was wonderful. It was pretty quiet, couldn't hear any of the other neighboring guests. Things did get a bit loud around 3:00AM from people leaving the bars at Fourth Street Live. Our room was on Floor 4, so if street noise is an issue, ask for a higher up room. (I think there are 7 or 9 floors.)Garage parking was pretty affordable at $10.00 per day. It's in a secure area and a guard is always on duty. You can go in an out as many times as you want. Located along the Urban Bourbon Trail and near many of Louisville's must-see attractions, SpringHill Suites is a great place to rest your head in Derby City.Price: $116.00 per roomParking: $10.00 per dayI stayed here for a convention in Oct 2014. The staff was very helpful and the room was quiet and comfortable. The staff was exceptionally helpful, suggesting restaurants based on our schedule needs with the conference, making sure we knew where we could go and how to get anywhere. Jaqueline, Autumn, and Austin were so extremely nice and helpful that nearly a month later I'm remembering to mention them in a review! Thank you! Bacon everyday would be great ;-)This is the only hotel to stay in when going to downtown Louisville.  The rooms are bigger than any others in the area, have refrigerators, and the breakfast is amazing.  It's only a 5 minute walk to the convention center.  Stay here!My company put me up in this hotel during my time in Louisville. The hotel is nice. Parking is a bit tight. Your room key gets you to the upstairs parking. The staff was really nice. There is breakfast on the second floor. Location is great. Freeways are close by. You can even walk to downtown Louisville. The room I had was just right. Clean and quiet.GExtremely clean, entire 2nd floor is devoted to breakfast, free in/out privledges and cheap parking.Our room was very modern, with a comfy bed and L-shaped couch that had a fold out sleeper.  Great location, about 5 blocks from Slugger Field.Free wifi and free breakfast.  Pretty perfect.We arrived here late at night and left mid morning, so we weren't able to utilize all of the hotel's amenities. Nonetheless, I was still pretty satisfied with our stay.Things i enjoyed were the free Wi-Fi in our room for up to three days, free hot breakfast for all guests, and contemporary style of the place. The toilet room and shower room were separate. The sink in the toilet room was so small. It was hard to brush your teeth without spilling water all over the floor. There weren't many mirrors and the only two sinks were in either the toilet room or the shower room, so if people were in them, you couldn't wash your hands or look at yourself in the mirror.We called the front desk to ask for recommendations on places to eat with two young ones. The person wasn't much help, but did recommend walking to Main Street, which was two blocks away. We walked and realized at night, it wasn't the most appropriate place for two young ones. There were many pubs and bars.Located next to what appeared to be a major medical center.Once in the land of burnt necks and ""y'alls"", we made a b-line to our hotel. Lucky me got my own suite, sweet!For some reason the entire hotel was 70's themed. From the couch in my room with Ikea lamp, <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FZyw1yldtSkJHSzXo8eWgg?select=FPQ4ad9SeqDwlsUwpPrWDQ"">yelp.com/biz_photos/FZyw...</a>, to the oddly decorated breakfast bar area. None the less, my stay here was awesome. The bed was adorned with half a dozen pillows of varying firmness and the desk with ample power strip and free internet was perfect for my business needs. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/FZyw1yldtSkJHSzXo8eWgg?select=F-pRnR_18IooNzKAyP2gfA"">yelp.com/biz_photos/FZyw...</a>Full size ironing board and iron went unused thanks in part to my wonderful girl's ironing and folding skills and the fact that I turned the shower room into a steam room to let out a couple luggage born wrinkles. There was a nice alarm clock with built in Ipod dock so I could wake up to something other than country music on the radio. In the morning we hit up the well stocked hot breakfast bar. The decor was right out of the Brady Bunch. But the food was just right for a mid-range hotel. Nice hot mushy cereal, crisp cold dry cereal and a bevy of sausage patties and dried up eggs. If work demands I go to Kentucky again, I'll be sure to stay here!Couldn't have been a better spot for a family with two twins under two. We arrived late on Thanksgiving and were warmly greeted and as we entered our room to our surprise they had already set up two high quality pack n plays for our girls to slumber in.  As we awake in the morning we went downstairs for the complimenatry breakfast which was actually pretty darned good and made our life much easier as there were great options for our girls including oatmeal, fresh fruit and yogurt. The only downside was that we didn't like the pillows on the bed but because the overall experience was so good we'll just bring out own next time as well as our bathing suits. Well done SpringHill! We'll be back!Great Hotel. $10 a day for parking (full in and out) , convenient location and a short walk to 4th street live and all of the other hotel bars (Galt, Browns, Steelbach etc). Staff was nice, wifi worked in rooms, Large breakfast selection with healthy choices. Extremely clean hotel, very spacious rooms, including a microwave and fridge which we put to good use.  Stayed for 4 days in October, could not be more pleased.I've stayed here both times I've stayed the weekend in Louisville for drinking with friends. They are usually running some kind of special for $100 a night on the weekend. The staff here is really friendly, and the breakfast in the morning is great! The rooms sleep 6 (2 each on the bed, and then there's a sleeper sofa), so it's great for larger groups. These rooms are huge, with a separate shower and toilet room. Both Ethernet and Wifi were available here free of charge.My most recent stay this last weekend: We had booked 2 rooms, paid, and checked in. After finding we'd only need one room, since not as many people were staying the night as we'd thought, I was able to call down to the front desk, and after they sent someone up to make sure we hadn't done anything to the spare room (we'd only poked our heads in, and maybe turned on a light), they gladly refunded the cost of the second room. How cool is that?!?!I'll definitely be back to this place again; the rooms are nicely sized, affordable, and the staff here is top notch.One front desk attendant, friendly in the evening, but  the morning girl-- did not greet us or say hello, just ignored us as we walked out.  The carpet needs replacing.  The hotel room was fine but the people a few doors down from us banged doors all night, from 3:30 am on..  (You know, where you put the metal thing out to keep the door from locking?)  -Called and talked to front desk but they did nothing.  The beds were comfy and clean linens but I hate dirty carpet and it was, ugh gross.  At least on the 6th floor where we stayed.  The pool and weight room, very nice and clean.  There also were not enough towels in the room for our family of 5.  Free breakfast was nice but we went to Lynn's Paradise to eat a big breakfast. Lots of ambulances at night but maybe because of hospitals nearby.",,,,"['look', 'look', 'anything', 'fancy', 'hotels', 'hotels', 'simply', 'somewhere', 'lay', 'head', 'end', 'day', 'like', 'explore',

The building is modern and comfortable- I felt like I was on set for a glam photo shoot. Rooms are spacious, beautiful and incredibly comfortable. The property is superbly clean and very well maintained. All of the staff I've encountered during my three day stay have been exceptional. Valets, front desk, omelette station, even a minor maintenance emergency was always friendly, prompt and with a genuine smile. Joyce helped us find coffee and greeted us every morning with a ""southern mamma's"" attention. Daniel was a multitasking machine behind the bar at the managers evening reception and made sure everyone wasn't thirsty or hungry anymore. I was impressed watching the employees over a few days- they are THE example of a cooperative hospitality team. I won't stay anywhere else in Louisville.  No one else should either.We absolutely loved our stay at Embassy Suites. We were in Louisville for the Kentucky Bourbon Trail and wanted to stay downtown near 4th Street Live. Getting to the hotel was not difficult, but trying to figure out where to go for valet parking was a little bit of a challenge as we were coming in on the busy street in front of the hotel. I had to call the front desk to get a little guidance as we drove around the block. The staff was friendly and led us to where we needed to be. FYI you need to be traveling north on 4th street...valet will be on your right. They charge $27, which I thought to be a little steep, but was nice not having to worry about where to park.Checking in was simple, as I had already done so on the Hilton Honors app. We just had to stop at the front desk for our key cards. The moment we walked into the hotel we were in awe of how beautiful it was. The pictures don't even do it justice...you truly have to see it in person.We stayed on the 6th floor in beautiful, which was a corner suite. Exiting the elevator, the first thing you notice is not a boring hotel hallway, but rather a very upscale classy decor.The room itself was amazing...10-12 ft ceilings and windows, super comfortable large king-sized bed and large flat-screen tv in the bedroom, comfortable couch, lounge chair, flat screen tv and desk in the sitting area, as well as a little kitchen area and a beautiful bathroom with walk-in shower. If you're looking for amazing city views outside your windows, I would suggest staying on a higher floor...the only views we had were of the courtyard outside our room.Breakfast was very good - had a number of choices including hot items, oatmeal, made to order omelettes and french toast + other continental breakfast items. It was easy to get to, the space was very large, and the dining room had a good amount of room and was decorated very nicely. I don't want to be hassled in the morning while getting breakfast and this place was relaxing and easy to use.Checking out was simple...we just handed the keys in and they printed a receipt. The valet guys had our vehicle out front in less than 5 minutes.We absolutely loved our stay here and can't wait to return in the future!If there's one thing I truly love but don't treat myself to enough - it's staying in a nice hotel. I'm usually the one that says ""Hey, let's save some money and spend it doing something meaningful/exciting."" But in reality, sometimes the place you stay can really set the tone for the trip. And I say this as if you don't know it already - which I know you do. I don't know anyone who is disgusted at the idea of staying at a nice and clean hotel. This place was in PERFECT proximity to 4th Street. I couldn't have been more pleased with the fact that we didn't have to even worry about a cab/Uber for our NYE celebration. We could literally walk out of our hotel, walk about two minutes down the street and then were in the middle of the action. It was perfection. The hotel itself was stunning. I'm a sucker for Christmas, so of course I was ohhh-ing and ahhh-ing at all of the beautiful decorations. Specifically the tree. The rooms were clean and, in my opinion, fancy. Not too fancy, but fancy enough. If this gives you an indication of our take on the room - our entire group of girls actually squealed upon entry. That's how impressed we were with the room. haha Obviously we all needed the night out. And of course - the customer service. We were treated like princesses. I don't know if it was merely the fact that it was NYE and everyone seemed to be in high spirits, but nonetheless, we were treated very well. And I'll remember that on my next trip back to Louisville.Great hotel!! They have completed a renovation that has modern facilities, soothing blue and grey decor with pops of color. The lobby area is massive, valet and front lobby staff very friendly and accommodating. Nice bar in the lobby ran by the restaurant Brandon's 23 next door. But the real action is upstairs on the 3rd floor. Happy hour is free Every day 5:30 to 7:30 pm and it is worth it!!! I had a few of the bartender's specialty drinks including the sangria. The standout drink was the Bourbon Lemon Drop Martini.  I'm ashamed to say how many I drank so I'm not telling. Snacks were just regular snacks.. Nothing special but the ambience and music was wonderful.  We stayed in a 2 bed 2 room Pure suite. The beds, linen and pillows were heavenly. I slept like a baby with the air purifier and the room was comfortably cooled. Word of advice.. If you are a light sleeper ask for a room away from 4th street.  They have concerts nightly on the weekend and the noise doesn't die down until 2am.Great location, clean, spacious rooms.  Breakfast was wonderful - so many good things to choose - healthy options.  Pool was great and spacious.  And exercise room was very good- had a nice variety.  good location.  I would go back there to stay and recommend absolutely.Amazing hotel! Must stay here if you are in the area. I am a Hilton diamond member and have been to a million hotels around the country and this is definitely a favorite (if not the best!). The lobby and bar area is very classy, with new and elegant decore. The building itself is very new and rooms are completely newly remodeled. Location is ideal as it is next to Fourth Street live and a ton of great restaurants and bars. The parking is valet only (but so are all the other parking options in every hotel here). Rooms are spacious, beds are large and not too soft. Bathrooms are huge, new, and very clean. Breakfast is a normal embassy suites breakfast, nothing out of the ordinary... But who cares! It's a gorgeous property, not that expensive, with an extremely accommodating staff!I'm a huge sleep snob and very particular about my hotels and I LOVED this Embassy Suites! Brand new hotel and so very, very quiet.Also, big shout out to Gary at Catch 23 lobby bar. Good times, my friend, good times.This was a beautiful hotel.  The front desk was very helpful - we had thought we booked a one-bedroom suite, but it was just an open suite and they upgraded our reservation without a charge.  The room was gorgeous (especially the bathroom).  Breakfast was wonderful in the morning and everyone was friendly.  Our only regret was that we were only staying one night.  Will definitely return to this hotel again in the future.The other reviews really nailed it, place is very clean, modern right downtown off 4th st and within distance of the Brown and all kinds of other dining/drinking establishments. Valet is all that's offered, not exactly the quickest but they were slammed while we were there. A restaurant and CVS are attached to the lobby which makes any late night necessities not a nightmare.Rooms clean and big, nice layout, huge shower, killer bathroom, lighting was just right, fridge mini bar, two tvs one in the living room other in the bedroom. Free happy hour, snacks 4-6 I believe, bar in the lobby, 3rd floor was breakfast, optional omelette station for those who have to have it. I travel quite a bit still and this place was one of the better hotels I've hit in a while. Would stay here again, highly recommended.I was here for a party over the weekend. Nothing but nice things to say about the interior. however, anything positive ends there. being a birthday party and because I work in photography for a living, I brought my professional camera along with me assuming it would be safe inside the room. I admit that it was my mistake in leaving mycamera in the room when I checked out. however, if the rule of thumb is that anything left in a room is fair game to the people who clean it, housekeepers would be much richer than I am. I am not accusing the staff of stealing my camera. I am, however, frustrated that I was met with little more than a shrug when I told them the magnitude of the camera being stolen. yes, it was stolen because the only way it left the room was by someone taking it. it is true that there is a strong possibility that there will never be a resolution for this. I feel the loss would sting a little less if the people who worked there did a little beyond what their minimum wage requires of them. then again, if I were making peanuts, maybe I would have taken the 4K and run as well. my advice, don't take anything nice to this hotel. it is downtown and as much as I hate playing into stereotypes, this place feels as secure as I do walking around there at night. which isn't very much at all.It's 11:38 pm and I can't sleep because of the deafening noise resonating in my room from a live concert at the 4th street bar area. Get an interior room if you're here on the weekend. It's freaking miserable. I'm not happy.Every time we called to get our car out of valet it took them 20 or even 30 minutes to ""find"" my car.Superb hotel and staff. Everyone was delightful. Brand new renovation of a much older hotel.Industrial meets sheikh.  We enjoyed the happy hour free drinks and snacks as well as free breakfast including made to order omelets.The suite was perfect for a family stay and the kids loved the pool.A dinner in the restaurant was easy and yummy in a great environment.  Pan seared salmon and fresh green salad was my choice.Excellent choice on Solid Maple Slab tables, modern accoutrements, large columns, and the high ceilings.  Only negatives were a few finishing strips separating from the walls, lack of enough towel hangers and lack of hot water in the pool rinsing shower. Easy quick fixes all.This hotel should be 4 star.  We did not expect it to be that nice.This Embassy Suites is located in a heavily congested (traffic-wise) area of downtown Louisville. It's a really beautiful historic property that has been retrofitted with a nice, sleek, clean, modern interior. Arrived after a stressful drive in torrential rain to a valet area that held, maybe four vehicles. Still raining, the valets were rushing to get items out of the car, understandably, but the rushing was an unwelcome, welcome. The two bus people were actually really sweet and friendly while taking items to the room, so that made up for the earlier rushing.I'm Hilton Honors Silver, and, when checking in, reminded the desk lady of this. She said, ""oh, well, you can get a drink from the cooler over there"" - which was an orange juice. Hmmmm. I'm used to the two bottles of water in the room, or more benefits, not one small orange juice for a 3 day stay. Maybe I'm not well-versed in the Silver experience.So, on to the room. I preselected my room to have a nice view, room 601. It really did have a nice street view! Tall ceilings make these suites seem super-large. The bathroom was super-spacious and the majority of the flooring is granite (or granite-like), with carpet in the living area and the separate bedroom. The suite really has an elevated look and feel. It included the standard ES fare: nice sized refrigerator, wet bar sink, microwave and the one-pouch coffee makers that I despise. I was happy to have brought my own coffee maker.There is no bathtub, just one large walk-in shower, which leaked at the door opening. So, every post-shower experience ended in a sopping wet bath mat. The toilet ""ran"" constantly, meaning the tank never filled to the correct capacity to shut off. I reported this issue and it was promptly fixed, which was nice.Room service was interesting. The food was not especially good. When I realized a side was missing and the condiments were wrong/missing, I re-called room service and was told they would ""fix it right away"" and they never bothered sending anything up. Zilch. That was a little disappointing.Also disappointing was the attitude of the bartender working on Friday October 1. After coming in from checking out the area, I asked him for a ""birthday cake"" shot. He rather mocked me with an attitude of ""drag yourself into the new millennium"" and told me, ""I can't make that, I don't have the ingredients"" and then returned to visiting with the ~ 6 or 8 people seated at his bar. I said, ""well is there another drink that you would recommend for someone?"" and was told ""no.""  I googled the ingredients and saw Frangelico and vodka are the birthday cake shot ingredients, and both were behind the bar. Really? I've bartended and the keys include: a. a good attitude b. suggestive sales c. please the customer. He failed in all categories, and worked the entire weekend, which kept me OUT of the ES bar. It really was embarrassing and uncalled for. Oh well, other, friendlier area restaurants/bars got my business.Another notable thing, which is not ES's fault, is the amount of panhandling at the side door and front door area. Everything from, ""can I have a buck or two for _____?"" to ""Got a cigarette it's been a heckuva day, and a lighter?"" - Without cease. It is my fault for not calling in the leaking shower at the base of the door issue, and the room service issue and the bartender attitude issue, as these were distractions from what otherwise had the potential to be an epic Embassy Suites experience.Actually had reservations at the Galt House but chose to change them for a few reasons. Best decision ever! Pleasantly surprised on the quality of this hotel. We love to stay at Embassy Suites  on our travels due to the managers reception and omelet and buffet breakfast that is always included. This place is by far the nicest Embassy Suites we have stayed in to date. As I am a Hilton Honors member I love to use the app to check in. That works flawlessly! Just say hi and get the room cards. Checkout is just as quick with an email receipt. Do yourself a favor when visiting Louisville and stay here. There is also a CVS store connected to the lobby so you can get all your needs (including beer, wine, and liquor) at normal prices. The only drawback is no onsite parking. But I did not mind the walk around the block for six dollar overnight parking. They do have valet for 27 dollars overnight but I admit I like to save a buck or two when I can!Great hotel with a great staff in a great location. (Literally half a block from 4th street Live)This hotel is so nice! The place is huge! When checking the lady wasn't the friendliest, she couldn't use my rewards card  because it was under my friends name and didn't mind that I used it for the room. Then she still wasn't going to give us a gift bag because my rewards number was not put on the room, but ended up giving it to us anyway. Our room keys didn't work even after going down to get new ones. We were extremely tired and just annoyed Bc kept having to lug our luggage all over the place. Finally a gentleman came up and carried out luggage to our room. The room was so nice! It had a bedroom with huge windows and a living room. The bathroom was so nice too with a waterfall like shower. It is also downtown so it's close to everything. I would make sure that when you are using valet to make sure you tell the front desk because they will charge it to the room and not to pay again when getting your car. I got charged twice. I would definitely stay here again.One of the most unexpected, fantastic stays Ive had in a while. A clean, revamped hotel with an enthusiastic, warm staff who on three separate occasions hooked us up. Stay here when in Louisville.I never give ratings online but this hotel is my first exception. These rooms are amazing. The hotel is in a great location and beautiful interior layout. Whether you're single or with a large family this is where you want to stay in downtown Louisville.Was great. I travel a lot to Louisville for work &amp; this was one of the best places I've stayed (along w/ the Seelbach Hilton). It is clean, modern, &amp; comfortable. I would definitely go back!!This is a really nice hotel. Perfectly located I will stay here everytime I come to LouisvilleLovely hotel with garbage customer service. Booked a room for 3 nights a full 4 months in advance. Called to change my reservation (only needed 2 nights instead of 3) and didn't find out until I got my email confirmation that my rates increased $50/night. Called back thinking surely this was just an error... Nope! Was told by the lady answering the phone their rates change from day to day and by changing my reservation I would also be changing my rate. This may be their policy but it felt a bit ridiculous since I only reduced the number of nights on an existing reservation. I would've understood paying a higher rate to change the dates completely or add additional nights. Apparently Embassy Suites would prefer to make an extra $100 than keep a loyal customer. I ended up booking somewhere else. It's a shame because the hotel has always been one of my favorites.","I'm a Hilton Diamond member. This is by far the best Embassy Suites I've ever been too! It feels like a very upscale hotel...not just another Embassy. If you want luxury, a great staff and a great complimentary happy hour... Come here! I feel like I just spoke a commercial but I dish out bad reviews and I can give good reviews too. Best hotel in Louisville, KY hands down.This place was an incredible surprise. We've stayed at other Embassy Suites in the past and this was by far the nicest. The rooms are impeccable and service was great as well. The front desk attendant mentioned that the hotel was fairly new and that the building had undergone considerable renovations. The location is also perfect - right outside Fourth Street Live. Given the location, service, and normal amenities of an Embassy Suites (hot breakfast, evening reception, etc.) this place was an incredible value!Such a nice hotel! It was recently opened and you can tell, everything is brand new and very, very clean. The people are super nice. Great reception in the evening and breakfast spread in the morning!This hotel is phenomenal! It's gorgeous, the staff and service are wonderful, and it is perfectly located. Mrs. Armstrong at the front desk was incredibly helpful and corrected an issue that was my mistake in the most cheerful and efficient way possible. Great stay! We will be returning.As someone who is on the road for for 3-5 days a week, I basically live in hotels, and this was one of my best experiences with a hotel I have had to date. I happen to book a room here the first day that they opened and was blown away at how nicely done the hotel was. Parts were still under construction, but the rooms were great, service was phenomenal, and I was able to speak with many of their higher ups as they were at the front desk to welcome their first guests. Their director of sales Dustin was genuinely excited to see their first guests coming in and made sure that everyone was welcomed and comfortable. The complementary drink and food hours were great with some very friendly bar tenders who had some great local recommendations for some good live music. The location is right down town and close to tons of restaurants, bars, and some music venues as well too. I will definitely be staying here exclusively every time I am staying in Louisville.",,,,"['looking', 'top', 'tier', 'service', 'hotel', 'fourth', 'street', 'many', 'automatically', 'presume',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-louisville-downtown-louisville,Hampton Inn Louisville Downtown,3.5,$$,31,"Location of the Hotel is excellent - on main street right opposite the World Trade Centre. This has spacious entrance and reception lounge. The rooms are large and adequately furnished.Highly Recommend to all of my friends.Definitely need to retrain the housekeeping staff. Dirty sheets (I found hair that did not belong to me) no fresh towels until I requested them, etc. Heater in bedroom blew cool air, no vent in bathroom, no restaurant onsite, etc. I won't be staying at another Hampton Inn unless I can help it.Not my favorite stay at a Hampton Inn. Not at all. We got into town around 8 and were only staying for the night. We dropped our things in our room and immediately went out to dinner. The room smelled musty from the get-go but everything else was okay looking, if not a little outdated. When we got back to the room for the night around 11 p.m., we realized the door didn't lock, and upon closer inspection, looked as if it had been broken into at one point (not while we were there but in the past). The door was not hanging straight, the plate where the lock sits in the door frame was missing, and the hardware didn't match (as if it had been replaced). We called the front desk, they sent maintenance up, and they confirmed that the door was not locking. About 10 minutes later another employee came up to confirm what we were saying and moved us to another room. I have to wonder why they would put anyone in a room that was clearly damaged, but they did a fairly quick job of moving us. The next room was still a little musty smelling, but not as bad. Bed seemed clean, bathroom was clean, but the vanity stuck out beyond the door frame. Watch your spleen when taking that turn into the bathroom if you ever stay there :)Overall the staff was nice, but nothing about the inconvenience was mentioned at checkout (which I suspect is related to a shift change). Overall, this Hampton Inn isn't as bright and fresh as others at which we have stayed. I wouldn't stay here again if I could help it.The inn could use a bit of a refresh --it's not shiny and new as other Hamptons I've been to -- but the staff is exceptionally accommodating, and very nice.My husband, a Hilton Diamond member, booked a room with a sleeper sofa.  Realizing there was none in our room, we checked at the desk. The manager, feeling badly about their mistake, gave us a lovely suite instead.  (I said they are accommodating!)Besides the staff, I like the hotel's location. It's walking distance to several good restaurants. They have a free shuttle that conveniently drives guests around town.  Breakfasts are typical Hampton Inn: you won't leave hungry, but you won't rave about your meal.  Would I stay here again? Sure, why not.Halls have lot of trash and litter all over them which always concerns me. Room needs a deep clean, I found lots of hair from other guests which is a big no-no in my book. This could be a one off problem but it should have been caught by the supervisor.Cool location in downtown with access to lots of restaurants and bars.Highly recommend if in Louisville. The service here was great, friendly and attentive. Rooms are large, clean and good AC. I will definitely stay here on my next trip to KentuckyAverage Hampton Inn. Free surface lot parking, though you need to get a parking pass at check-in and put it on the dash. It is in Downtown- just minutes from restaurants and university medical center. The property is dated and ventilation in the rooms are rather poor. The price is usually higher than average Hampton Inn's, but is similar to other hotels in the Downtown area.Stayed here on a weekend trip to Louisville.  I will say that the lobby is updated and very welcoming, looks great!  The rooms on the other hand are nothing to write home about.  Small and outdated, but it works for a place to lay your head for a night.  The continental breakfast was good, great selection, but weird layout.  You're constantly in someone's way and it doesn't flow as well as it looks like it should.  Favorite thing about this place?  The hotel bar.  If you are new to Louisville, ask the bartender about where the locals hang out.  We got some great advice while we visited and truly believe that our experience wouldn't have been as great if we hadn't asked.  Thanks barkeep!Close proximity to dining and hospitals--however, lots of sirens! Great lobby bar and bartender was fabulous and friendly! Desk staff was very helpful. Hotel seems a bit dated and stale. Not-so-positives: Hard bed, sofa-sized pillows on king bed, bath towels weren't usual plush, Internet was BEYOND slow even in business center, tub very slow to drain, housekeeping was fair at best, one elevator was broken the first night (in very busy 8-floor hotel).The Hampton Inn: right off Interstate 65, friendly staff, clean rooms, decent continental breakfast.Stopped in the Hampton Inn a few times while traveling to or through Louisville.  Being next to the interstate and walk-able to 4th street is awesome.  It took about 10 minutes to get into the 4th Street Live district, and 15 min to get to the Palace Theater.  The rooms are very comfortable, and the rates are pretty affordable, especially if you have AAA or book through a discount site.The Hampton has a private lot, so you can rest easy that your vehicle will be safe and sound while you're out doing whatever it is you do in Louisville. Also, to all my cycling friends: this place is bike friendly, take your expensive carbon frames up to the room, then ride 'em down to Eva Bandman Park for the Cyclocross races.  That's the way to do it.Consistently out of coffee and didn't keep breakfast stocked.  Went down for breakfast at 9 am and almost everything was gone and no one was refilling anything.  Each morning tried to get coffee and it was out.  I was not impressed by the hotel at all.The best I can say is the staff was friendly.  But the hotel itself was very old and run down, it was in dreadful shape.  The furniture was old, parking was difficult at best, one elevator was broken, the towels were threadbare, and the water was brown from the tap.  I like staying in Hampton Inns but this was not up to par.  This site needs to be over hauled immediately.  I feel bad for the staff that tried to make up for the bad atmosphere.I recently stayed here on business and was impressed. The staff are friendly and accommodating. The free shuttle service is nice, it even took us to our meetings downtown. Nice lobby area and breakfast selection. The rooms were comfy. I utilized the fitness center and the business center and both fit my needs. My coworker used the pool and enjoyed it.I would stay here again! My only complaint was the ventilation in the rooms, especially the bathrooms, was rough. Other than that, it was a great stay!The rooms and lines are showing signs of wear, the push in lock on the bathroom door was loose and eventually fell out.  The housekeeping was spotty, the toilet paper had not been replenished nor the trash dumped,  The lobby appeared to have been updated.  Other than the close proximity to I65 and the Downtown, I would be apt to take a pass.  The plus side was that we had a window view to the fireworks and air show.I am returning back to Louisville for the University of Louisville graduation at the Yum Center. The Hampton Inn is a bit dated but the friendly staff and central location easily overcome the 80's decor. Our room was very clean and let's be honest, it's a bed to lay my head on in between sips of bourbon. They do have a bar on sight which is always a plus. The air conditioning may not be working as it is hotter than two mice making whoopie in a wool sock!Plenty of parking and it seems to be safe, secure and well lit. Overall, not bad for the price but may look at other options next visit.Good price, reasonably friendly staff, good location, free parking and a decent room. It's a bit on the old side for Hamptons, but the value is solid. Our room was quiet, the bed was comfortable, and the waffle iron worked. No complaints, but nothing special.Nice accommodations in downtown. Close to 4th Street (about 5 blocks), the ballpark, and waterfront.  Room was nice and large and comfortable. Small fitness center and pool, but much better than nothing!!!Free parking and very friendly and attentive staff.  This was our first stay (IM Louisville 2013).Bed bugs!!!  Bed bugs!!  I spent 2 night with my wife &amp; infant son.  On our trip home we noticed these sores appearing on our sons arms.  Later that night I noticed I had them on my legs too!  Upon doing a little research we found they  were exactly what is pictured on many websites documenting the bites.  The next day I called the hotel to speak with the manager about an infestation issue and was hung up on twice!  When I finally got the manager on the phone he said he would ""investigate it"".  Two days later I received a voice mail from a management company saying that they did not believe there was a problem and that was that.  On top of that ,the hotel is in a very bad part of town and my wife did not feel safe walking around.Stay away at all costs!!Nice hotel.   Staff  was very accommodating. Nice large pool.  The rooms were nice and clean. Enjoyed the lounge and breakfast.  Will stay again.Diamond Member -  I already booked a king suite / king sofa study.  The gentleman who checked me in said he put me in their suite.  Top floor multi room suite with double door entrance.  Basically an apartment. They really take care of their Diamond members.  Was here for a week and the spacious suite made it very enjoyable and easy to get work done.  Service was excellent and the breakfast was delicious as usual.  Easily in my top 5 hampton's.","I stayed at this Hampton Inn for about a week with 11 teenagers and 4 other adults. My first impression is not very good. We had a long day of traveling, gathering luggage, and acquiring rental cars. By the time we got to the hotel it was just passed midnight and we were exhausted and the man working the front desk was not exactly the friendliest or the most helpful. I understand its super late, but isn't it his job to be welcoming, friendly, and accommodating? The rooms were nice, clean, and had working A.C. so we were happy campers for the night. In the morning we went down to breakfast, which was pretty standard, and actually ended up switching rooms. The guy who was working last night ended up arranging it for us so all of our rooms could be on the same floor and close to each other. That redeemed my opinion of him.The staff was very nice, the facilities are clean, the pool is fun, the workout center is under construction, and the WIFI works wonderfully. Also there is tons of food locations near by. My only complaint is the size of the rooms. A room with 2 queen beds does not have a lot of extra space, but overall a very enjoyable experience.Also, props to the staff for doing a good job dealing with a hotel full of teenagers. We were not the only large teen group staying that week.A comfortable facility with the two things I most crave in a hotel: a decent complementary breakfast and free wi-fi.The room was comfortable.  The heating was just right, and the bedding and mattress were ideal.  (They do need to rethink the pillows; they are not up to the standards in the rest of the room.)  A drawback is the maintenance.  My clock radio didn't work.  The first day, I mentioned this at the front desk.  They seemed interested, thanked me, and immediately wrote this down in a log.  I assumed that the radio would be replaced.  Never happened during the next three days of my stay.Nice looking swimming pool, although I didn't have a chance to try it firsthand.Location is convenient to downtown and restaurants.  Louisville is a rather nice walking town.  As they don't have a restaurant of their own, they should compile a list of good places that will deliver.Breakfast is pleasant, with good fruit options and a whole lot of breads, bagels, and pastries; along with a waffle station and heartier entree options (eggs, sausages.)Their shuttle makes pickups and dropoffs from the airport.  They will basically take you anywhere within a reasonable radius.All in all, a great facility for a very reasonable cost.  As soon as they fix the maintenance issues, they will get that fifth star.My needs seem different than that of the other reviewers. For a hotel at this price point not having wifi is just absurd. I appreciate it is accessible wired but that isnt nearly the same.The bed was also very stiff and the comforter was very off. The room was clean, service was fine, but i got the worst night of sleep in a while on this bed.This Hampton could use an update. Its not bad but, its definitely seen better days. This would not preclude me from staying here again.Typical Hampton formula with a local twist from the very friendly staff. They also have a sense of humor, which is sorta rare these days. The sign on the front desk saying ""if you want someplace quiet to stay, you might want to go someplace else"" was excellent.Walking distance from a LOT of things, including some great eats down on Market Street, the downtown entertainment area and a dodgy looking ""adult store.""Thumbs up from this Yelptard.very nice, as far as Hampton Inns go, that is. The rooms could use a bit of an update and there's no restaurant on-site, but the manager assured me that a refresh is coming soon for the rooms. I met the project manager for same at breakfast and she confirmed that this update is in the works. (See? It pays to talk to people.)There is a small bar in the lobby, which is nice. The barman was very friendly, but there are no beers on tap, which is a shame, because there are quite a few local brews that you really should sample before you leave town.The hotel is about five minutes from the airport if you drive like I do (ever seen ""The Transporter"" flicks? I drive like the devil himself. mortals could probably make the trip in 15 minutes...). The location is pretty good for walking around town, too. There are quite a few places to eat within a few blocks. The baseball bat museum is about a ten minute walk from the front door of the hotel, so do check it out if you get the chance.Lots of parking is available for free, which is nice.As with all Hampton Inns, there is a free breakfast every morning. Not exactly my type of dining, but it is free. Coffee is available all day in the lobby. Also good.I didn't see many cabs waiting at the front door, but the manager assures me that one can be had in relatively short order. Handy, to be sure.A nice stay in a lovely, up-and-coming (but, thankfully not gentrified) city. I will be back and I shall stay here.One of my favorite Hampton Inns. Clean and the staff always takes good care of me. pleany of great dining and beverage options a short walk away.The only negative is lack of wireless WIFIThis Hampton Inn is doing a great job of customer service! We used the complimentary shuttle van 3 times. How nice to be able to go out for dinner and not have to drive in an unfamiliar city! The breakfast was good, dining area large, open clean with lots of seating. This Hampton Inn had a bar open from 5:30 to  11 with a good variety of beverages to choose from. The king bed was comfortable. My only complaint was in a handicapped accessible bathroom there was no good place for your toiletries. Maybe they could add a shelf over the toilet?Nice hotel. Decor is a tad dated in my opinion, but overall a nice clean hotel with a friendly staff.Our  4-day stay at Hampton Inn Louisville Downtown recently was by far the best hotel stay we have probably had, and we travel often.  The staff, especially at the front desk, are refreshingly friendly, professional, helpful and knowledgeable.  Our young son forgot his backpack full of toys at the hotel and once we got home, we called the front desk.  They insisted on sending his bag back to us via overnight shipping without charging us!The hotel area is within walking distance to the best restaurants, entertainment and museums.  When staying in Louisville, we won't be staying anywhere else!This is a great hotel!  My boyfriend and I drove overnight from Philadelphia and arrived in Louisville around 9:15AM.  They were able to check us into a room almost immediately.  The room did not have a refrigerator (which most Hampton's I stay in do) but we asked for one and they brought one to our room free of charge.The hotel is also in a great location!!!  It's 2-3 blocks from 4th Street Live which is where all of the restuarants, bars and shopping is located.I had a block of rooms at the Hampton Inn for my wedding in Louisville this past weekend, and all of my guests loved it!  The woman who helps with large block reservations, Krista, was so incredibly helpful, and all of the staff was great.  Thank you! If you are visiting Louisville and want to stay downtown, this is a great place to stay.",,,,"['location', 'hotel', 'excellent', 'main', 'street', 'right', 'opposite', 'world', 'trade', 'spacious',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/louisville-marriott-east-louisville,Louisville Marriott East,4.5,$$$,26,"Great modern looking hotel. Probably one of the best staffs at any hotel that I have visited in he Louisville area. The workout room is the best around with plenty of options and a nice lounge area.We come here for company events, most notably our company Christmas brunch.  They do a wonderful job serving a diverse group a nice meal.  The service was adequate and the food was okay.  It's not easy to put something nice together for so many people.I travel a lot and this is one of my fave hotels! We get a room here just as a getaway in Louisville even though I live here..It's like staying in a resort!! The lobby is modern, they have a luxe bar area and a great feature is the large fireplace outside for all to enjoy, with plush outdoor seating. The rooms are very clean, spacious and well-appointed. The small refrigerator is a plus. The views are very pretty as well. Great service, upscale Concierge floor and yummy perks. They also have a huge whirlpool and a very clean, large workout center with free bottled water, rolled-up towels. Nice touches everywhere...Love it here.Good old Southern hospitality !I have stayed at this Hotel for business , and they have mastered the art of hospitality !! Staff make you feel welcome every step you take, and my PLEASURE is a standard word throughout this hotel. I just came back form a 90210 hotel that was 5 times more expensive than this hotel but their service was awful. I am so grateful for  Southern hospitality because they make you feel special and all your needs are met with a gracious smile !! And parking is free !!The hotel appears to have undergone a facelift recently; it's fairly modern and really nice inside. The rooms are large and very well appointed.The staff is quite friendly and very helpful. We staged a business meeting here, and found the conference room extremely spacious and well setup.However, if you are in a hurry for something to drink or something to eat, go elsewhere. Four of us ordered salads for lunch. It took an hour for them to arrive. It took another 45 minutes to get our bill. The same night we ate dinner here. Again, an hour passed between placing our order and seeing our meal. A second round of drinks took 45 minutes.The next night, we went somewhere else to eat.All the while our server was pleasant and nice, just didn't seem concerned about the time it took to fill an order.As genteel as it is hospitable, the praise heaped on Louisville Marriott East by TripAdvisor users (who currently place this property among the top 5 hotels in town) is well founded. Even Marriott corporate lists the location among its top 5. Though the staff don't brag about the accolades, it's clear that this hotel runs like it's one of the best in Kentucky.Redeveloped beautifully by Musselman Hotels only a few years ago, guests can expect almost every (if not every) Marriott brand perk in a new, meticulously clean environment. App-based check-in? Sure. Keys that you tap on the door to access your room? Yes. WiFi that works (admittedly, not the 'newest' perk in the industry, but one that I never take for granted on the road...)? Of course.Guest rooms here are fairly standard in size and appointment: comfortable but unremarkable. Tiled showers, bright vanities and gooseneck reading lights on the bed's headboard were all nicely done.The only complaint that I might've had when planned a trip through town turned out to be a non-issue. If you're thinking of staying here and reading up on the collective opinion, you've surely learned that the hotel is outside of the city center and is surrounded by car lots. The Marriott East is not exciting to walk around, but is close to the highway and a major thoroughfare. A short drive (under-10 minutes) will get you to Whole Foods, fast food or the very popular restaurant Havana Rumba. In 20 minutes, without traffic, you're easily downtown.Notes:* The sunrise or sunset from the upper floors is nice and can offer a nice view of the city.* The Concierge Floor is on 10. Lounge hours are fairly standard with a Saturday close and Sunday evening re-open for the week. Light appetizers are offered in the evening, breakfast is available in the morning and there is an honor bar with wine/spirits. Light snacks (cereal bars, fruit, etc). and soda/juice are available.My future husband and I stay here every year for our anniversary.  The past three years have been wonderful.  We live about 45 minutes away so this seemsLike a small vacation when we are here.  The staff is friendly, the roomsAre clean and we never have any complaints.  We even asked to have our checkout time extended and the were happy to oblige.  We get the romance package and have yet to be disappointed.  The breakfast bar downstairs is ok, if you get down there early enough.  The restaurant/bar is AWESOME.  ReallyCan't wait till we can stay there againHotel was very nice overall for our baseball team to stay at while playing in Louisville.  My problem with the stay was our beds.  They are not comfortable as I woke up with a sore back both nights.  You would think with such a nice hotel, the beds would be pillow topped or memory foam for a $200 plus night stay.Great experience at Louisville Marriott East.  All the staff we encountered was very friendly.  Quick check in that was able to meet our requests for high floor and early check in.  Room 703 was clean and well laid out.  Breakfast at the restaurant was worth the extra 10 dollars when booking the room.  Pool / Whirlpool / Workout facility area is clean and well equipped with modern workout equipment.  There were plenty of towels in the pool area and refrigerated towels in the workout area.Super clean hotel! The staff was very friendly and professional. The food at the restaurant in the hotel is superb. Great hotel. I highly recommend this for business travelers.Don't let the location throw you off. The hotel is actually very clean, cozy, and classy. The price for the night was very reasonable. Wish I had time to enjoy the pool and gym - these also looked very nice. Free wifi and parking is a plus too! If you want to eat the best burger of your life, stop by the hotel's restaurant. Seriously. THE best burger ever. Like ever.At the bar for dinner. Chop is awesome, one of the best. Service is 5 star. Too bad I booked the Fairfield this trip. These guys even remember me from my last trip 4 months ago. One of the best bourbon bars I've been to. Close out your meal with your favorite burbon an the chocolate cake. It does a body good.I travel to Louisville a couple times a month, and have stayed at many hotels in the area. This one is my favorite. It's still fairly new, and the staff is really friendly (especially Carolyn in the concierge lounge). I'm giving it four stars because the mattresses are too soft for me, and on weekends the hotel can be overrun by youth sports teams. The bar has a huge selection of bourbon, some of which is difficult to find elsewhere.Marriott is very consistent. This hotel is no exception. Comfortable. great service... I would stay here again.Excellent, friendly service. The room was clean and modern with an excellent bed and shower. The restaurant was excellent and room service was prompt and tasty. The desk staff went out of the way to be helpful. The wifi was free with adequate speed. Highly recommended even compared to other Marriott hotels. Top Notch.Just stayed at this hotel and was pleasantly surprised. Rooms are good and spacious. The lobby is nice and the bar has a large selection of bourbon.  I am not a bourbon drinker but I was impress with the wall of bourbon. Lastly, the front desk staff were so friendly. Great service!We're staying here during our time in Louisville...I felt the need to give this place five stars. This place looks like it's new, so spacious and so clean! We had booked our stay ahead of time and check-in was quick and service was great! There is no card swiping for the room lock, just beep your card against the lock to unlock. It probably helps that my sister is a platinum elite member so we have access to the concierge lounge on the tenth floor, which is always nice. Overall, great experience, they know hospitality!Travel a lot for work and stay in many Marriott properties.  This is one of the best.  A little off the beaten path, but the beds are the best!    Staff is friendly, but everybody in Kentucky is friendly.     Modern decor in the lobby and the bar seems to be a regular gathering spot for many.   Easy in and out with no parking problems like you get downtown.    No places to walk to, but for a place to stay its a good choice.I stay in hotels for work, and this one is amazing. $40 million in upgrades in Kentucky...best television in the room I have seen, great fitness center, superb in room dining...feels 4 stars for 3 star priceYou gotta stay and eat here. It is 5 star. I travel all over the world and eat and stay at the best of the best . Make sure you experience the Marriott Louisville East. Tom from prospect PA.","Awesome hotel, I stayed overnight for a flight delay. Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, rooms were large and modern, I really enjoyed the bathroom (walk in shower stall), the fitness center was very large and had a lot of machines/amenities.  One of my favorite hotels I've been to so far.Great facility, well managed, excellent service. But do not accept a room near the elevators, they are loud an will wake you.  i.e. Any or many time(s) per night. There isn't a coffee carafe in room 318!!!!!!!!Great hotel. Pleasantly surprised at how friendly all the staff are. Plenty of easy parking all around the hotel. Nice lobby area. Rooms are clean and beds are comfy with nice comfortable sheets and pillows. The washroom is a bit small but was not an issue. I love the shower stalls with the glass doors. The only negative is that there is a large gap under the door to the hallway so anyone in the hallway talking sounds like they are inside the room. There is also the same large gap under the door to the adjoining room and so there was some people in that room and I could hear every word they as if they were right inside the room with me. There should be some sort of weather strip or something there so that there is more privacy. But for the most part it wasn't a bother.The Louisville Marroitt East in Jtown is the best hotel to stay at in the East End! The staff is friendly, restaurant is top notch and it is conveniently located near Hurstbourne Lane and the I64 Hwy.One of the best Marriotts have stayed so far.  Great service friendly staff. Awesome hotel. free wifi is slow. Didnt want to pay $10 for the faster Internet.Had to stay here for work. Where to begin - big red stain on the floor - paint, soda, blood? Who knows.  Next, sand paper towels. Finally - sheets that don't fit the bed - how annoying.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-louisville-riverside-hotel-jeffersonville,Sheraton Louisville Riverside Hotel,3.5,$$,30,"We stayed here on a quick trip to KY. I found the staff very welcoming and rooms were comfortable and clean. Except the last night we stay they forgot to make our room while we were out, no worries it happens and the team was all over it. I was impressed at their concern. We stayed on the Club Level it was so worth the extra 10 bucks, great hot hotel breakfast and after 4 they had comp drinks and food. That is the big tip in this review! There are some great restaurants on the back side of the hotel, and all with in walking distance. We would stay again for certain!Gotta love a hotel with a pet policy that's not ""hey let's gouge pet owners"" This place was along our road trip route, and was pet friendly. That's how we found it, and I'm glad we did. The staff at check in was super awesome, and friendly. The room was nice, it wasn't amazing, but it was a pet room, so we weren't looking for amazing, Just comfortable.We arrived pretty late, and left first thing, so didn't get to enjoy the view or any amenities, but for what we needed, it was perfect!Kudos to the sheraton! They are the only brand between the edge of st louis and west virginia that allow dogs not only at a reasonable prices, but free!The location is in Illinois, across the river from louisville, plenty of parking, very friendly staff, only 10K points if you are paying by points and as i mentioned - free pet fee as long as the pet is under 80 pounds!The room was well appointed, a comfy bed, view of the river, comfy chair.The room was a bit worn - rug was stained - not sure if that had to do with being a pet room or not. Bathroom had a shower door - haven't had a shower door in years, and the shower head was tall enough for the hubby to stand up under! All in all a great stay! Thank you sheraton!Great hotel, friendly staff, and pet-friendly too! The view from the 10th floor was great, and the pool, hot-tub, workout facility, and lounge were all great as well. Would definitely recommend.A trip of a thousand miles, it is oft said, begins with a declaration of someone saying they know a shortcut.  Despite all the ridiculous detours around this city, I am always happy to stop and rest a while.After contending with the labyrinth that has become the Louisville highway ""system,"" this weary wanderer found her way to this hotel.  I don't care how cliche it sounds: the olive branch-wrapped S beckoned like the beacon it was for me on this very dark and rainy night.I had been driving throughout the day, stuck beneath a literal cloud of fog and mistakes by rain the whole stretch of I-70 and I-64 between KS and KY.  Imagine my delight at discovering the elegant simplicity of a room with view of the west.  The clerk who handed me my key was quite pleasant and helpful.  There is a reasonably priced room service menu (the pasta and scallops are delicious), and the bed is quite springy.If you happen to stray from your road and are lost, or if you deliberately plan to stay, maybe give this Sheraton a glance.Good location to hop on I-65 and in 5 minutes be in the heart of Louisville.  Hotel is a little hard to find due to all the construction around the area, but we found our way by keeping a look-out for the red Sheraton lights!Room was clean and spacious.  Bathroom was a bit of a squeeze but adequate (door had to be completely shut in order to walk around to toilet / shower).Upon check-out I had to get the front desk to research my statement as I was charged at a rate different from the one I booked at but had the proof in email confirmation that resulted in a quick change to the correct price.Dog friendly hotel that provides good signage on the doors for rooms containing a pet ""Let Sleeping Dogs Lie!""  Plenty of riverside places to take our pup for walks and he enjoyed his stay here on a floor with several other travelers with their dogs.  Smart to put dog owners on one floor since we understand one another.For the price and amenities, I have experienced much better.  From the beginning, and right out of the gate, the experience was a bit suspect, flaky and dicey. We booked this room through Expedia, which we later figured out that we probably will never do again. The Sheraton would not take responsibility for the booking that we thought we had secured. We originally booked a king size bed room on the upper level floor which is considered a better area of the hotel.    There was a 'complimentary' breakfast that was supposed to be included along with the room located inside a private access lounge. When we got to the hotel the gal said she did not have record of us booking a king size bed, so she offered us two queens on another floor. We said we wanted a king size bed and showed her the paperwork stating that - that is what we booked through Expedia.   She then reiterated that they're not responsible for what Expedia does.I now ask myself what is the point of booking something through Expedia if the hotel won't honor what you think you're paying for and getting?!  Next time we will just book directly at the hotel itself.  If you think you're saving money by going through Expedia, I'm now very confident that you're taking a big chance.  Booking through a third party seems to not be a very good bet; just a huge sketchy gamble at best!   Maybe we missed the fine writing in the booking when it probably said that everything is subject to change, and probably will - but NOT to your advantage !!! When we finally got to the room, there wasn't a mini fridge and there wasn't a microwave either.   Upon inspection of the room, I realized after a while that the bathroom sink had a really nasty clog, the carpet looked stained and dirty, and the ceiling above the shower was also stained like there was a previous water leak in a room above it. When we went to check out the lounge which was actually on the floor that we should've been on, it was nothing spectacular.   It was just basically a look out over the river and the city of Louisville.  It had a smattering of tables placed here and there and it also had an area with a counter set up that they use for the morning breakfast. There was a little cooler with a variety of complementary drinks, and that's about it.  Oh, and they also had a desk in the corner with a computer accompanied by a printer. We went out to dinner, and when we got back, there was a message on our phone in the room from the front desk. It was a message for someone else asking if their check-in was pleasant and acceptable. The hotel had an adjoining bar and restaurant that featured lunch and dinner only.  Later on that evening we went into the bar and had a drink and a dessert. The cake dessert was so-so.   It was basically overpriced and on the dry side.   We only stayed for one night, so in the morning when were going to partake in the complementary breakfast on the upper level lounge area, we got yet another unsavory surprise. We noticed the breakfast was very limited/bare bones and paltry. It was really nothing spectacular or anything out of the ordinary.  I have seen better at much lower scale/rated hotels/motels. It actually looked very sad and poor for what we paid.My fiance went down to the front desk and asked if we could get the better breakfast buffet that was offered downstairs.   It was a much more comprehensive breakfast.  The gal also argued with him about that and said that wasn't part of our deal. NOW she wants to honor it!He had pre-paid for the first breakfast which was actually more in price - 30.00 extra to be exact!  WOW   It was a very frustrating and strange situation overall. He actually ended up having to pay AGAIN extra for the breakfast downstairs at the buffet.  That buffet was acceptable, as the food was hot and had some redeeming quality to it. I think that is one of the few reasons I am giving this hotel one star.  Otherwise, it's all basically a bust as far as our overall experience.   Pardon me for saying, but the whole situation was really just a bunch of uncool, uncaring and low brow bullshit. They really got over us on us as far as what we actually paid for and what we actually got. And to also put it ever so bluntly, it's just amazing sometimes when you feel like you're getting bent over for every nickel and dime that you spend.  I take my precious money and the spending of it very wisely and seriously.  I also take proper and professional customer service very seriously.   Integrity in the backing up of what someone is selling is very serious business too.  How some businesses can pretentiously think they can do whatever they wish and get away with it  is beyond frustrating and annoying.  Karma will certainly have the last word.The next time we stay in that area of the country, we're going to travel vacross the river into Louisville and get a hotel over in that area.   Hopefully we will have better luck, as well as a better experience overall.I had a really great stay here.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Changed my room quickly when it was obvious someone had smoked in it. . .Place was clean and the breakfast was great with lots of options although very crowded.  There are a couple of eating options inside the hotel as well as within walking distance.What i really love about Sheraton is the shuttle service.  Not only did I get a ride from the airport, but also to places downtown for work and dinner.  Just let the driver know ahead of time.Hotel rooms are dated.  My room actually smelled a bit like cat pee.  I wore slippers whenever I did not have shoes on as I was grossed out by the carpet.  Wish there were better options of places to stay in the area, but unfortunately, I'd have to move to the Louisville, KY side of the river.Overall not impressed with the rooms (stayed in multiple) - in dire need of new carpeting. Heard a male and female wrestling (or something... Keeping it PG folks) in their room from the hallway, so sound proofing may be lacking.  Easily hear conversations from the hallway.  Staff was friendly, but overall I feel like I have higher expectations for this chain from stays at other locations.The staff and management of this Sheraton are fantastic. This was my second stay here in two years and I'll definitely be back. It's convenient to downtown Louisville -- right across the river -- with a fast, free shuttle that makes going out easy and safe (and you don't want to miss out on all the great Kentucky bourbons when you go out in Louisville, of course!). Shuttle driver Frank is a treasure -- he has lived in Louisville his entire life and is a great conversationalist and a gentleman. Housekeeping got me everything I needed. My room was spotless, quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel itself is a good size -- not too big, not too small -- so the pool/gym areas were never overly crowded (and were also very clean). The little bar/restaurant area downstairs is very convenient and serves a nice breakfast. I also really appreciate that parking is free. All good!I struggled with this Sheraton experience was so up and down. Some issues are out of the hotel's control, but overall I was not thrilled with my stay here.  I have stayed at numerous Sheraton properties with my husband and I expected a lot more, but I can't say it was a ""bad"" stay all around.First, what was great about the hotel. Convenient Location. We were a $8 cab fare from Louisville with quick highway access and a great view of the city.  This can't be beat in my opinion.  I don't know what hotel costs are in downtown Louisville, but if they are high like most big cities, staying here is a no-brainer.  Free Shuttle Service. It runs until 11pm, and we used that to take us to dinner on Saturday night.  You are of course at the mercy of their schedule but if you aren't in a huge rush or are flexible with time it's a really nice amenity.  Hotel Condition: Hotel is clean and the rooms we stayed in were very nice and spacious (upgraded to a suite the first night, ""business king"" room the second night).Had no real issues the first day.  Was upgraded to a suite and the room was great- bed was comfortable (as they usually are at Sheraton) but we had 3 in the room so my friend slept on the pull out sofa which was terrible with a huge bar right in her back, she ended up having to sleep long-ways on the bed so she could sleep at all. Was also an issue for the girls that were staying with us the second night. Won't deduct too much for that though, as I don't think most sofa beds are comfortable.  The real problem in this room, about 4 rooms down the hallway from the elevator, was the elevator noise.  We heard it all night which I have never experienced in a room not next to an elevator.  Again, this is not something the hotel can really change, but the walls are paper thin- we heard not only the elevator but doors slamming, people talking etc. The next night we moved to another room where we were hosting a few more people and this room happened to be right next to the elevator, and the bed was actually up against the wall where the elevator is!  Why it isn't on the other side of the room baffles me, but needless to say, ALL of us were woken up throughout the night by the elevator.  Also, I had requested a refrigerator several weeks in advance for both nights (which I paid for- $10 per night).  It was there the first night, but when we moved to the second room there wasn't one and I had to call down for it.  It was a problem because we needed to have things chilled quickly for the others that were arriving and that did not happen.  Also, it was half the size of the fridge we had the first night so that was frustrating. Overall the staff was fairly accommodating.  I didn't feel like they went out of their way to make you feel welcome, but they were ok.  We did have one woman who was pretty condescending when we were asking about the shuttle, basically saying ""too bad for you he'll get here when he gets here."" Everyone in my group ended up asking ""what was her problem?"" as we walked outside. Club lounge was overrun with unsupervised 10-12 year olds (in town for a softball tourney) who were pretty consistently cleaning out the fridge, again, not the hotel's fault but just added to the long list of things that made our stay less than memorable.  Will definitely stay here again if I need to be in Louisville because of the convenience, but will probably choose somewhere else if I need to host guests. I wanted everyone to feel welcomed and we didn't really get that here.Bottom Line: definitely not the level of service I would have expected.Came to Louisville for a family fun filled weekend. Decided to stay at the Sheraton. The room was quite a bit more than the website! I paid $215 for one night stay, and got 2 hours sleep due to the elevator being right behind my bed!! We were told it was close to the elevator and there may be noise from people getting on and off the elevator. We were not told that you would not be able to sleep due to the elevator being directly behind the bed and ""grinding"" all night! When I spoke to the front desk, I was offered a free continental breakfast that was included anyway!  Very displeased with my stay!!Great location right off of I-65.  Easy to find, ample parking.  Staff are friendly.  Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable.  Pool and hot tub are nice.  Hotel is pet friendly and accepts dogs with no added fee!  A great value overall.This was a great little hotel for our over nights on our road trip to and from FLA.   I like the ""new"" Sheraton - they way the chain has updated it's old stodgy reputation of dated hotels.The staff was super friendly.   I am a Starwood Platinum member and enjoyed the member breakfast at 6am so we could hit the road and not worry about having to take time to stop to eat.    The rooms were very clean and quiet.   They allow pets as we had my dog and my mom's dog.   The location was great for road tripping - easy on and off the highway.   it also has a nice view of Louisville.   Love the free wi-fi and free parking.  I hate when hotels gouge guest with crazy parking fees.  On our way back to MI we walked to a near by restaurant on the river.   It was nice to have that as an option.Great place to stay. Very pet friendly, comfortable beds, accommodating staff and surprisingly great room service! I never set my expectations high when it comes to in room dining but everything was really great and well priced! Indulge and get the Derby pie or the bread pudding. Yum! The creme brulee was a miss but 2 out of 3 isn't bad! Great wine selection as well. Free wifi is a plus and the business center makes business on the go very easy. The hotels in Louisville were twice the price and this place is practically in Louisville with a beautiful view of the river with great restaurants nearby! Except King Fish.. Skip that one!This hotel is nice! Totally rocked a deal online for well under a hundred a night - Shazam! Bonus - pet friendly, I do not lie. It will not seem like it when you pull up and I even had a few confused looks from other patrons on the elevator but you can rest assured that they are indeed pet friendly. On the Indy side of the river, great view of downtown Louisville from across the bridge. Just cross the bridge if you want to hit downtown, or stay on your side of the river and enjoy several dining options - seafood, buckhead (general), rockys (italian), hooters, pizza, Sheraton bar/grill - all well within walking distance. Some great riverside dining options for atmosphere. Tip - The area is currently screwed up pretty bad with construction so your nav system may puke. Just under 7 miles from Churchill Downs and I suspect a view of the big firework show as well? Not sure, but there is plenty going on within a stones throw of this place to make for some fun. I am tempted to come back for both of the aforementioned in 2014.As for the hotel itself, better than your average bear, on the upscale side as you would expect, rooms are nicely appointed with microwave, mini fridge, comp bottled water and starbucks for the instant machine. Even the TP in the bath was of the kinder/gentler variety ;-) Free Wi-Fi.Bonus - the ice bucket provided actually works, there was still unmelted ice in it the next morning. Parking was super convenient in front or back, check in was easy peasy and friendly. In fact the only thing I can ding this place for is that the water well in the coffee machine in the room was funky enough that I passed. I will definitely keep this place on the hit list for the future.Great service at this hotel! My fiancee and I found this hotel deal here by luck. I liked the workout facility and pool/jacuzzi it was very well kept and clean. In addition the hotel service desk were so friendly and had recommended good places to see in Louisville during our stay. We were so happy with our stay at this hotel!When I first got to the hotel I was shocked to find how nice the view was. The room I stayed in had  the perfect view of the bridge and you could even see buildings from Kentucky. The beds were comfortable and even had decant pillows. Then I got to the bathroom, and it was smallish and had no ventilation..then the hotel decided to charge $4 for a 5oz water bottle!! A water bottle I could get for 99 cents at a gas station!! The pool room was so hot and humid you could barely breathe. Then when it came to me having an issue, none of the employees were helpful especially Eric who decided to tell me that he was not going to get a manager when I asked for one. It's a shame that such a hotel in a great location had to be so disappointing with such unfriendly staff. I will never go to this hotel again and because I work with business travelers I will be sure to let them know not to go either.Stayed here for Thunder Over Louisville. Clean rooms with a very cordial staff. Added security personnel was appreciated. Room size and amenities are modest for the room rate. Certainly plan to stay here again next year.","At the last minute I found a gem on Expedia which made the Riverside Sheraton super-inexpensive for a weekend stay in the lap of luxury. The beds were too good to be true. Had I been able to fit one in my purse I would have taken a bed home with me. Certainly good enough for a good night's sleep. The staff was courteous and called the room to see if there was anything else they could bring us. In retrospect, I should have asked for something cooler than a newspaper. There were water bottles and all kinds of free goodies in the room. Double-plus-bonus?! ...while the Sheraton is a very classy establishment, they accept furry friends with only the signing of a liability waiver!! All of the staff loved my furry friend and made us feel very welcome.Note to tourists: if you plan to visit nearby Falls of the Ohio State Park during the winter season, please be advised that it will likely be underwater which the Park website will neglect to mention.  ;)I love this hotel.   from the moment I stepped to the front desk it's been perfect.   pet friendly, nice clean room, extremely accommodating.   they loaned us a charger for my daughter's phone.   they delivered a microwave and refrigerator to our room.   best experience.I arrived late and was pleased that even in the freezing cold someone helped get my bags. I had a comfortable first night. The next morning I had two different chargers on my card. I returned to an unclean room and was told the reservation they had was for a day even though I had a receipt for three! After talking it over they gave me an extra night stay and said the one charge has been  refunded. I go to check my account again and there's a third charge!! I haven't even left yet, but at this point there's going to be five or six pending charges and who knows what will happen?! They are suppose to call my bank and let them know they refunded two but can't explain why I've been charged so many times!!!! Probably will find another hotel when I'm here next time!!I and a co-worker stayed at the Sheraton Louisville Riverside Hotel this week and would definitely recommend!  Loved the room - it was quite spacious, very clean, and the bed.... awesome!  SO comfortable!  Originally we had planned to stay just one night there and then drive up to Indy and stay one night in Indy.  Due to a day/night of horrible weather (tornado warnings/watches all day long!), decided to cancel the hotel in Indy and stay at the Sheraton again instead of driving in the bad weather.  They were very accomodating, allowed us to keep the same rate as the first night (which for what we booked (using AAA) included breakfast), and even stay in the same room.  I will agree with another reviewer - if we had to pay for the breakfast I probably wouldn't have been too happy.  While they do have a good selection of items (eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, biscuits,gravy, fruit, yogurt, bakery items), you could tell most of it had been sitting there for quite a while.  However, we just asked the staff that was working for fresh items and they brought them right out.Staff is very nice and courteous. Hotel is very clean, the showe was awesome! Free parking too.Needed a place to stay since the Marriott around the corner totally screwed me over.  Called the hotel and spoke with Trish, she was awesome and accommodated me just as I needed.  Was given a room on a high floor with a great view of the Louisville skyline.  My 6 year old loved the indoor pool and we were treated awesome by every staff member that we encountered.  The only bad part was that the WiFi connection was iffy and only worked about 1/3 of the time but I was able to go in the lobby and use the computers there without any problems.   Beds were incredibly comfortable and the shower was amazing!  I liked this place a lot!Traveling with famille of 6. Two rooms adjoining worked well with the price being very competitive. Rooms appeared to be new and very clean. Staff was friendly and professional. They have an indoor pool which is important to us. Have to keep the kids busy or it gets real ugly. Lots of places next to hotel to eat. They also have a large pizza house attached to second floor.I recommend the Sheraton Louisville Riverside Hotel to all of my family and friends.If you need a room for Thunder Over Louisville.... this is the place to be!Not a bad hotel.  Pretty average for a Sheraton which is fine.  Avoid the hotel breakfast - nasty.This place was nice.  It was nothing special, but a good place to stay.  It had free internet, a nice room, a restaurant in the building (along with many in walking distance), a pool, and very nice staff.  No free breakfast.  I stayed here for an interview the next day in Louisville and it was an easy trip!",,,,"['quick', 'trip', 'found', 'staff', 'welcoming', 'rooms', 'comfortable', 'clean', 'except', 'last', 'night',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/econo-lodge-downtown-louisville,Econo Lodge Downtown,3.5,$,21,"Clean room. Well furnished and decorated. Very affordable and convenient to 4th Street and the Palace, where we were going for show. Pleasantly surprised to find the regular room had a mini-fridge, coffee maker, microwave, iron, and hairdryer. There were some cigarette burns but it was a smoking room, so it comes with the territory. Overall a very good experience. My only complaint is the parking lot is shared by a Papa Johns and the drivers seem to leave their cars just anywhere. Oh and parking at Econolodge is an extra $5. Which felt weird, but no big deal. I would stay there again for any downtown Louisville event.Clean, comfy cozy room. Was surprised by a little wet bar area in the room. The front desk is too small. Good location and worth the price.This is really great, low cost option to stay at in downtown Louisville. I went there for the ATA show which meant 3 nights there and had a great experience with the staff. Don't expect too much from it-it's still an Econolodge- but expect a clean place to stay. The area around it has a club and the ""Love Boutique "" nearby so I can't speak to what weekend nights are like, but the week nights I spent there were exceptionally quiet and unremarkable (I mean that in a good way.). In fact, it's way better than the comparably priced hotels nearby-some friends of mine tried to switch to this hotel after we shared experiences the first night. Would totally stay here again.Check in was fairly quick and easy. However the first room that I was given had a leaky toilet that got the entire floor wet. Even though I didn't discover the leak until about a couple of hours later when I went to use the bathroom, they were able to move me to another room a couple of doors over. You really can't beat this place with the price and the convenient location. But keep in mind that with the lower price per night comes some of the riff raffs, so mind your surroundings. Overall this place was a bit nicer and a small step up from a Motel 6.I'll have to agree with the other reviews and say that this is a surprisingly nice Econo Lodge.  Clean rooms.  They seemed to be updated rather recently as well.  Parking was plentiful and well lit.  The morning breakfast was lacking, but for the price of this hotel I don't think it's worth complaining about too much.  Very close to all the downtown attractions.  I'd probably stay here again for a short trip.The two stars are explicitly related to cleanliness as this hotel was clean and comfortable. The customer service, though, was atrocious. We were greeted by a man who responded to our questions with one word or a cold stare  I've seen more friendliness from an agitated moose. Then this guy begins banging on our door asking us to check out, THIRTY MINUTES before check out time and with a very clear, "" DO NOT DISTURB"" sign in place. If you're reading this, sir, take a minute to book a massage so that you might relieve some of that spite you can't seem to avoid hurling at your guests. Needless to say, we won't return.This is the type of place that could very easily be 'ghetto', run down, etc.It's NOT.  It's clean, the gentleman at the front desk (fish tank owner) was super friendly, easy to deal with.  The room had a good ac unit, reasonable parking (5 bucks).  Would return, stay again.I had one of the worst customer experiences at your Econo lodge in downtown Louisville KY.  I see on your website you are to provide clean, high value lodging and to make life easy for your guest. This certainly was not my experience.   Tim, at the front desk, offered no help with my check in.  The room was not clean and smelled of smoke.  Also in the room, there were burn marks and holes in the furniture.  When I called the front desk from the room phone, it was covered with personal lube. I would not recommend your hotel to anyone.Maurice at the front desk was awesome and so was the head woman of the cleaning staff. We were not happy with our room because some idiot had smoked in it. They changed our room immediately, no questions asked and quickly. They really made this experience enjoyable.So happy to find a decently priced vacancy when my father was airlifted to Univ of Louisville hospital. We were able to book our room at 3am. Check in was quick and easy. The outside walkways and stairwells are a little rough, but my room is great. Clean, comfortable and fresh. After an emotional and stressful day, it was beyond wonderful to be treated so well. Great job, Econolodge!We checked in Friday evening and even though I handed over my Driver's license and credit card with my names on them, we were checked in under another person's name that started with the same letter. We were called back down to the desk to fix this after 10pm and not charged for parking to make up for it. We stayed over a Friday and Saturday and weren't able to sleep well either night due to outside noise and a very saggy mattress. We tried running the air unit fan to drown out the motorcycles and other noises. The way this unit worked either the fan could be on or the A/C would run until it reached the set temperature. So we could either not sweat and deal with the noise or drown out the noise and sweat.The room was relatively clean, but so cramped my husband and I kept running into each other.  The room had a mini fridge and microwave which was a bonus because I don't think the site mentioned that.  They offer continental breakfast but we went to restaurants instead because it didn't look so great. I think due to the reviews here on yelp I really expected the place to be better.  This hotel made my husband and I decided from now on to get hotels at least $50 more per night to get out of this bracket of places.Clean, awesome location - don't expect it to be more than it is.Continantal breakfast was adequate and staff was very nice.Great location with reasonable price. I had a great stay at this hotel. Staff is amazing. Rooms are basic but nice and clean enough. I had a great sleep. I recommend this hotel for travelers who don't want to spend much on hotels and get great service and clean rooms. Off course no frills and fancy but it worked for me and I am sure it will work for everyone!!! Had a great time!!The location is mighty fine and the price is right.  This is a motor lodge meaning your door opens up to outside. Our room was clean with the basic necessities in working order. (hair dryer, fridge, microwave, tv) They only give you soap &amp; shampoo, so pack your own lotion &amp; conditioner.  This is definitely not the fanciest place to stay in Louisville but it most certainly does the job.This Econo Lodge was a good place to stay with a fair price in downtown Louisville. When other places are charging triple the price, why not stay here when it was reasonably priced and reasonably clean? It's walking distance from 4th Street Live and other restaurants/bars in the area. If you don't stay out until last call, you can have the displeasure of eating Papa John's Pizza right in your room since it is on the same property as this E-Lodge. Free breakfast served until 10am.Excellent value. Room was clean and I felt safe in a somewhat,  less than totally safe neighborhood. I was within walking distance to many good restaurants and to my clients facility and it saved them about $150/night over the Marriott directly across street.Perfect place to stay in Louisville. It was super cheap and right downtown.  The staff was perfectly cordial, the rooms were clean, the bed was comfortable and the wi-fi worked.I didn't partake in their breakfast but I wish I has as our breakfast that morning was sub bar.This is where I'm staying every time I'm in town!!It was cheap and the location was prime. But when i checked in the clerk was sleeping and the couch and acting like i was a dick for needing to check in. When we got to the room the hallway in front smelt like piss and the ice machine was integrated into our front wall.  At night the hallway of this place was like being in the dorms on welcome week. There were loud drunk stupid people everydayscreaming in front of my door til 4am. I dont expect much out of hotels, nice clean bed, quite room, and friendly service. I didnt meet any of these....Not bad. Not the ritz, but not bad. Also not 200$ like its neighbors. Right across the street from a 24/7 convenience store, walking distance to everything else. A little noisy; doors slam loud and there's traffic noise. The sheets were clean and bed bug free, but I suspect the coverlet was not clean. It's over there on the floor. lol. Nice amenities - fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Nice tvs with lots of channels. Furniture is all updated and I love the little armoire for my clothes. Bed was a little hard but I slept good. Overall I think it's a good value for the money.The Econo Lodge was a pretty good motel for the price we paid (Under $50 a night).  The room came with a TV, fridge and microwave.  The bathroom was clean.  The bed was pretty gross. The bedding had crusty stains on them.There was some noise at night outside our door and window but not as bad as I thought it would be.Breakfast wasn't great.  They did offer cereal, oatmeal, apples and toast.  The coffee was really bad.Tried to get a room for the next night again but instead of charging us $49 they wanted us to pay $130.  We left and went to a much nicer hotel ten minutes away.Econo Lodge is an alright place to stay if you are going to Forecastle.  We just left our car there and walked to the festival every day.They made us pay 5 dollars a day for parking which was a little odd since Louisville isn't a big city or anything.","We enjoyed a long weekend in the Kentucky area and this Econo Lodge was our hotel of choice. Located in downtown Louisville, it is very conveniently located to many attractions (Slugger Field and the Louisville Slugger Museum, among others!)Even though he outside seemed very dated, the room was clean and tastefully decorated and the bed was very comfortable. A microwave, fridge, blow dryer, coffee make and iron were available in the room.The free breakfast was perfectly acceptable...cereal, boiled eggs, toast, danishes, bagels, apples, juice and coffee. For afternoon, evening or for a late night snack, there is a Papa Johns is located on the same lot and they were very friendly!The only downside was the parking. At one point, we had to park across the street in the overflow area, but moved our vehicle back into the lot when space became available. This is an economy hotel, so do not expect to be pampered or have access to many ""extras"". But for a clean and comfortable place to sleep between excursions, it's great. We would definitely go back!",,,,"['clean', 'room', 'well', 'furnished', 'decorated', 'affordable', 'convenient', '4th', 'street', 'palace', 'going', 'show', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'find',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-louisville-east-hurstbourne-louisville,Holiday Inn Louisville East - Hurstbourne,2.0,$$,29,"To echo other reviewers, this place is definitely better as a meeting space / small event type uses than as a place to stay.  The common spaces were adequate and clean; parking is plentiful and available both on the lobby and event side of the complex.  Overall, it's a fairly small hotel, but with several meeting space options and event support.  It's located in a fairly busy / chain-oriented area - not exactly much of a ""Keep Louisville Weird"" feel, but for small or medium sized meetings or informal events, it gets the job done fairly comfortably and effectively.  Semi-convenient, in terms of location - avoids a lot of the local construction nightmares, just the usual traffic frustrations.  Hotel is about a block back from the street, but there's a small-ish sign indicating the boulevard  where one enters the access road to the hotel.Catering is fairly standard stuff, but definitely adequate (both in quality and quantity) for meetings and lunch.  Catering / event staff were effective and unobtrusive during a recent week-long training: they met all arranged needs in a timely and professional manner.  I didn't have any problem getting help from the staff, and everyone I worked with was pleasant, competent, and helpful.This place sucks. The Internet is garbage.  My room looks straight out of 1974. I work out of town a lot.  I am here for 2 weeks and I am dreading every second of it.  I work long hours when onTDY here. My roku stick and Xbox are how I wind down and relax.... this wifi is like dial up. I called their Internet provider and they said they could give more bandwidth to my mac address with management approval. I called the front desk and the manager wouldn't do it. . He said the hotel was full so that was why the Internet was slow.  Funny. . I have stayed at the residence Inn when it was full and the Internet speed was excellent. . I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn when it was full and the Internet was just fine WITHOUT HAVING TO ASK FOR MANAGEMENT APPROVAL  FOR EXTRA BANDWIDTH.A full hotel is no excuse when someone is paying an average of 200 bucks a night to be here. Avoid this place.Nothing new that hasn't echoed previous grievances. But to put it in an easier to consume format:1) Room they booked us in was still inhabited by other tenets. We were moved to another room.2) Air conditioner did not work. Room was boiling hot. We were moved to another room.3) Third floor smelled solidly of smoke in this ""non-smoking"" hotel4) Did not warn us that there would be construction on half of the hotel-- the noise of construction woke us up early every morning5) Walls are paper thin; could hear every argument in a neighboring room6) Alarm clock was completely non-functioning7) Room was not cleaned regularly8) Hotel promised free breakfast, but the dining area was under renovation. Luckily we were given IHOP vouchers.On the positive, the check in staff were very nice!Place is pretty hit and worn down. Paper coming off the walls. Fans, not running, in the hallway like something sprung a leak.  Needs big bucks put into it to bring it up to par.How IHG allows this sh*thole to use one of its labels on it is beyond me. Should have been demolished several years ago!No water pressure, outdated decor, stains all over the place, etc, etc. COMPLETELY DISGUSTING IN EVERYWAY,There are many other places to stay in town, go elsewhereThis place was ok but not the best Holiday Inn I've experienced.  Supposedly we were even in the remodeled wing but the elevator buttons were still broken and the hallways seemed very dark and worn.  The doors were paper thin so you could hear everything said by people walking through the hall.  The air conditioning was an old fashioned system, where you pick hi or low fan and have a dial for setting from hot to cold.  This meant the thing was blowing all night and we both woke up with sore throats. The ceiling of the room had the pebbly texture and there was quite a collection of dust (we hope it was dust and not mold) on the ceiling.  Not a pleasant thing to notice.  We were here for a wedding and the facilities there were nice enough.  Very simple ballroom layout but the acoustics were actually decent and we could hear the speeches clearly.  Staff as a whole was proficient but not particularly friendly.  Even with a concierge on duty I didn't get a greeting when walking in or out.I would give the accommodations 1 star, but the front desk staff deserves praise for trying to band-aid endemic problems of this very run down facility. The rooms are priced at the high range of mid tier Louisville hotels ($100-$150) but the quality is unacceptable.  The quality and accommodations in the competing $70 dollar a night Hurstbourne area hotels is much better.The manager will write a polite response attributing the problems to remodeling - nevertheless the same issues repeat in every Yelp review.  I had to change rooms 3 times.Many of these issues could be corrected for current customers by meaningful hotel management action:- Contractors smoke - the smell is pervasive. We observed contractors smoking in the elevators.- Contractors start hammering and making loud noises in the morning hours.- Rooms aren't always cleaned before checking in customers.- Advertisements are misleading.- One of our mattresses sagged and pillows in every room were uncomfortable (stuffed with puff balls). These were the some of most uncomfortable sleeping arrangements I've ever encountered.  In this price range other hotels have a selection of comfortable pillows. - Lobby restrooms weren't always serviced.- Water and towels in the gym weren't replenished.- Hallways in the pool area did not look sanitary.- Room air conditioning units did not cool and the hotel is uncomfortably hot, even in winter.- The fold out bed was almost unusable.Worst hotel.  We had a block of 10 rooms.  Each room was dirty and had bugs.  Gnats and roaches.  We brought it to the managers attention.  She could have cared less.  I told her about the cockroaches and she didn't believe  me until I showed her a picture from my bathroom.  It was disgusting.  If this was a $20 a night motel I would expect these problems.  It was so bad our entire group left and went to another hotel.  I alerted the manager of our intent hoping she would do something.  She said ""what do you want me to do about it"". Enough said!!!  We went to the Hilton Garden Inn and had a great experience.   Upon checking out, we noticed that they had charged different rates to the different parties in our group instead of the group rate they quoted when the reservation was made.  To add insult to injury, they charged and entirely different rate to our credit cards, which was $72 dollars more than our bill You should avoid this place at all costsI did not stay here. I attended a Mary Kay meeting as a guest of a consultant.What I *can* say about this location is that the conference room we used was clean and spacious. And the lobby area was lovely. And they are obviously open to being the host location of things like this. They look to have a conference center attached to the hotel, but we were in a room directly across from the check in desk. And it's in a good location, close to the highway, malls, restaurants and not far from downtown (for those who might be using the hotel to actually stay there...)We stayed here on 10/25-26 and I was not pleased. Check in was pleasant, the lady at the desk was friendly. When we returned for the night, we found that someone else was in our room. She was very rude about it, and we went back downstairs. The guy at the desk was nice, and he quickly got us another room. I'm glad wwe didn't leave anything in the first room, because I'm sure it would have disappeared. The room was your average hotel room. It was a bit outdated, but it was clean. Had a faint smoky smell though. The TV was difficult to operate with the remote. The room was also very warm, and the air conditioning did not filter into the room well. It was ok for the purpose of sleeping, but I'm sure I'd choose another hotel next time.Is this the low end of the Holiday Inn brand?  If so, and after staying here, I think the other Holiday Inn's with this name should immediately bump themselves up to the next level. This location was a dud.The front desk was was unengaged in the guest check in process to a point where they barely acknowledged me at the desk; although once they did, they were civil -- albeit barely.  The rooms were clean and spartan.  The decorations were old but in reasonably good condition.  It had been a long day, so I didn't really notice a lot of noise. Walking into the hotel didn't do much for setting the tone.  The entire outside of the building smelled like lysol or pine sol -- not sure which odor was more prevalent -- but it was overpowering.The hotel lobby was nice enough and actually elegant looking but for the price of this hotel, the level of service and amenities just wasn't anywhere close to a value.If I could leave no stars then I would.  We checked into our room, got our keys and had to leave due to working a large event.  When we returned , other guests were given our room.  The Horrible evening front desk manager would not bring us new keys for our new room.  We had to take our weeks worth of luggage down stairs to get a new key to a room that was not what we reserved.  We never got our wake up calls, which we needed because the alarm clock didn't function.  The AC unit was not functioning correctly, our room didn't get clean most days and when it did we didn't get towels or dirty items were left in he room.   Cash was taken out of luggage and the staff was not helpful when it was reported.  Horrible experience .Bed Bug Issue:  Very disappointing. Stayed at this Holiday Inn, Louisville East-Hurstbourne, for two nights in September, on 5th floor. Immediately following this stay, my wife and I noticed many bites on my son who sleeps on our bedroom floor next to my suitcase I routinely keep in our room. When we noticed a bug on me one night, we pulled back our mattress and found several bed bugs. What followed was a $2,250 tab to an exterminator to heat our home, as they had spread to other areas very quickly.When reported, the hotel Manager ""verified a small incident"" in my room. The Manager originally extended 5000 pts. When presses for some consideration of my $2,250 exterminator fee, the room cost was refunded. I am still stuck with an exterminator bill for which they would not help. Unfortunately, I am in the process of having to pursue a legal solution. I have traveled over 20 years and never had a bed bug issue until after staying at this hotel. Would not recommend.The staff service and convention areas were very nice. The restaurant inside the hotel was a nice touch as well. But so far the rooms arw the worst I have ever seen for a holiday inn. Maybe it is because we are at the older portion of the hotel. All the decor are cheap and bad quality. The lights in the hallway all have spider webs on them. I would say be here for the conference but stay somewhere else.We walked into our non-smoking room and were blasted with the smell of cigarettes. After a 9 hour drive we told them we will sleep there, but we don't want to pay the fine. We go back to our room to find the toilet won't flush. There is also a dirty, hairy fork on the floor next to the foot of the bed. Stepping on it wasn't pleasant.We were given another room. The key didn't work and we had to go back to the desk again. Our pets were really stressed by this process. They also took us from a king to a double bed room.Worst of all? Nothing but a shallow, fake apology. Nothing given as compensation. Even something as small as a free breakfast would have made all the difference in customer service.Kinda sucks.  I see this place averages a two-star. I'm putting one in an effort to pull the average down further.  I asked for a room which was quiet, but they gave me a second floor room across from the ballroom. 6am Saturday morning we wanted to sleep in a bit and there were dudes for a weekend conference sitting at a table outside yaking away which woke us up. We could hear the conference activity loud and clear within the room. The room (#280) also smelled like maybe it was a smoking room at one time. Stinky = Not cool.  Staff at front desk is...not super friendly. We were able to move to a better room on fifth floor(with a view) though and get a discount which smoothed things over a bit. We were disappointed that the breakfast was kinda yucky and the waitstaff 50% did not speak English and were absent/inattentive/rude and bothered with basic requests like ""may I please have silverware"". Don't plan on having breakfast here.  There is an IHOP and a Waffle House within walking distance. You luck will be better there.  Or, BYO breakfast provisions. The TV control interface is a major pain in the behind just to try and watch TV and channel surf (which annoyed me). One last thing, the pool in the hotel is cold and the water is kinda cloudy(dirty?).  The hotel posts a sign that says no more than five(?!) people allowed in the pool at any time or face up to $100 fee. Crappy rule. Good luck. There are better places to stay for sure.  Don't expect extras at this place, nor ""extra mile"" service.  That's all for now, folks.Somehow, I feel like I've been staying at a different hotel than the other reviewers. I'm presently in my second week here, and will be back next week, happily. My room is clean, comfortable, and well maintained.  My TV is a a large flat panel with good picture. The restaurant and bar staff have been friendly and ready to serve every time I walk in. The free breakfast is usually at Holiday Inn Express,  not the regular Holiday Inns, so maybe that's where some confusion came from. I've had nothing but good experiences here, and do recommend this location.This hotel is-- in one word-- bland.Even their update looks like it was designed for the 70's. Everything from the furniture to the TVs is straight out of the disco era.Location is very good, however, with lots of restaurants around. But good luck in getting out the parking lot and back to the highway. Ask the hotel on how to do this...One upon a time in a grander time of proms &amp; homecomings in 1982 Holiday Inn Hurstbourne was a spectacular place! But just like our bad 80's bangs &amp; shoulder pads something's should never come back. RIP Holiday Inn Hurstbourne I will remember you as you where in 1982 in my imagination.Literally the worst holiday inn I have ever stayed in. The rooms stinks like old fryer grease and smoke even though there non smoking. I figured the hotel chain had standards but obviously not the case. We stayed at a hotel on the other side on the road the week before and it was very nice for $10 more. We didn't even dare go to the pool, for the many shady occupants that had half the hotel smelling like Cheech and Chong had been walking around. Surprised the place isn't condemned let alone being a part of a major hotel chain.","Totally underwhelmed. So many better choices for the same price.  Not a one star, just not impressed.This hotel gets one star because you can't give them zero stars.  The bed had blood on the comforter.  The room wreaked of pesticide.  There was noise from maintenance.  There was noise from the house keeping staff.  The water in the shower was barely warm.  The maid ignored the DO NOT DISTURB sign and just walked in to the room.  The room service is awful and not edible.In the past I had co-workers report bed bugs at this hotel.  On the bright side with the strong pesticide smell maybe they killed most of them.  The hotel is the worst Holiday Inn that I have ever stayed in.  Don't stay here.We were just all over the place with good and bad things throughout our stay. I will list them here:GOOD: We arrived 2 hours before the official check in time and were told we could have our room right away.BAD: Getting in and out of this location is very difficult. There is this roundabout way to exit which is not marked clearly. If you dont use this exit you will be forced to make dangerous u-turns on the divided highway out in front (Hurstbourne).GOOD: The room was spacious, clean and updated.BAD: Someone vomited on the carpet in the hall outside our room the 1st night we were there. Even though attempts were made to clean it and reduce the odor, it remained very noticable until we left 5 days later. GOOD: Breakfast in the dining room was a large, hot buffet with many choices. $8.99 for everything, $6.99 for just fruit, cereal and bread.BAD: If there was an ""included"" breakfast, we did not see where it was or have it offered to us.GOOD: The workout room was well equipped with free weights, machines and TV.BAD: It took a long time for the room to be cleaned and restocked with water and towels.GOOD: The hotel offered an ""environmental"" service, where you could opt to just have your room ""refreshed"" rather than have new sheets, towels, etc.BAD: How environmentally friendly can they be when the tub faucet dripped a stream of water continiously for the 6 days we were there, and reporting it to the front desk yielded zero results?Basically, for what we paid we could have done a lot worse, but all in all just expect a very basic stay.This is one of the poorest Holiday Inn locations I have ever stayed in.The hallways and doors are in SERIOUS need of updating and/or replacement, and the rooms aren't in much better shape.  The location isn't the best in town, and the staff are less than great.I'd skip it if there's any other choice available at all.Booked this hotel via priceline for $39 (plus fees/taxes) on a weekend.  So for $39, this wasn't bad.  If I paid normal rate, I would have been unsatisfied.We arrived at 1 in the morning, checked in, requested a 7am wakeup call, and planned to be gone by 8.  At 745a we woke up, wake up call never came.Room appeared to be clean, everything functioned properly.  Just looking at the outside of the guest door (which appeared to be 70s era vaneer) though, you understood this is not a 3 star property.  Again, nothing gross, but certainly not a deluxe hotel.The white baby grand piano in the lobby was ostentatious to say the least.  It's horrendous when hotels don't provide most relevant services like wake up calls.If you're going to be in Louisville and get this for cheap from Priceline, not a bad value for that price -- but be sure to set your own alarm clock.Stayed here overnight for a business conference.  The hotel is convenient to the interstate and several restaurants nearby.  Accommodations are typical.Rooms and service are good; has a Starbucks within walking distance.We are a couple of weary California travelers who booked a room here via Hotwire when we realized we needed a room to rest and recuperate before seeing family after our red eye flight.  I called from the airport to see if we could have an early check-in.  Spoke with Molly, who was soooooo accommodating.  She let us check in right away, gave us a nice, clean, huge room with a pretty view of a little lake.  She signed us up for their free rewards program and sent us to our room with 2-1 drink tickets, discount meal vouchers, and complimentary bottled water.  It's so refreshing to receive five star service at a three star hotel.  Molly, you are going to do just fine in life.  It was a pleasure!Poor service by the front desk.  Spoke with Marie Boone &amp; she refused to help me switch rooms, despite the hotel's emptiness (I suspect a common occurance).Rooms - noisy &amp; dirty.  Poor renovation with unsightly post construction attention to detail.Considering the price - one could do much better.",,,,"['echo', 'reviewers', 'place', 'definitely', 'better', 'meeting', 'space',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-louisville-east-louisville,Hyatt Place Louisville East,4.0,$$,24,"I love this hotel brand and this location is exceptional. Extremely friendly staff and great location walking distance to good restaurants and such. They have great 24/7 food options and a step above the microwaved processed egg breakfast. Their rooms make you feel like a king. Extremely comfortable pillows and beds in every room and every room is a suite with a pullout couch. Oh, and the best part is the price is pretty inexpensive for what you get.My only real gripe is that the Internet was a little slow, but if you are in the area I highly recommend staying here. For while my first choice for staying somewhere in Louisville is the Brown... This is a good backup in East Louisville.My family and I went to Kentucky for my cousins wedding back in July and stayed at this Hyatt. I've been to a few other Hyatt locations before, and this one was a little different. Rooms: the rooms were basic. I hated that the sink was outside of the actual bathroom, and the shower area was way too small. The beds were semi comfortable, but the sheets were extremely uncomfortable. They had a sitting area with a couch and aside from the bathroom sink being outside the actual bathroom, they also had a desk and another area with a sink. The AC worked phenomenally thank god. The first night I was barefoot and when I was putting shoes on, I noticed my feet were black, so.. that's disgusting. I called to ask them if they could re-clean and they did thankfully. Price: I didn't pay for this hotel stay, but for the 5 nights I believe it came out to $2,000.... a little too much...Staff: They were friendly. I guess it's true what they say about ""Southern comfort."" And they constantly brought us room service since we didn't have our own car... Location: it was literally 5 minutes away from my aunt and uncles house so it was ideal for our family, but it was awkwardly placed right by a main road which I found slightly annoying. It's one of the nicer hotels in Louisville, so I would recommend it. I guess us spoiled Californians are used to the nice beach side hotels.The Hyatt would not change my reservation due to bad weather. I booked on trip advisor so they were unwilling to change my reservation. So some business is keeping my $227. Your welcome for the free money trip advisor and Hyatt. Thanks for not helping.I love the hotel from the service to the comfortable beds. The breakfast in the morning is amazing and late Check is ok you would just have to let the desk know. If you need help with anything just let them know. They have a shuttle that can take you a 2mi radius and picks you up. You don't have to drive your car.it's also walking distance from restaurants and stores. I live in louisville and find time to get a night here away from homeI am a business traveler.  Here's my perspective:This place and the rooms are funky. It's hip and trendy which doesn't always translate to easy and convenient.The rooms are more geared to a leisure/social setting with a large portion of the room designed for the couch and sitting area.  It is not well equipped in the bed area for rollerbags, etc.  (again much of the space attention is devoted to the living room and desk area (with another sink and counter).  The bathroom really is small to the point it is difficult. The sink is out in the bedroom area and the commode is in with the shower. This space is very tight and it is made worse because of a lack of room to put clothes, towels, robes without dipping them in the toilet. I am picky about not sharing my immediate shower space with the toilet.  If you are a big person or need room to dress and undress in a closed-door bathroom---forget it. If you want something pretty clean and a little different---especially for a social get together, this is a good choice. For a professional traveler, it seemed to be a little awkward for just sleeping and ""getting ready"".  3 stars for that reason. The staff was nice and eager to please. Breakfast choice was better than most similar hotels.We very much enjoyed our stay. We were limited on hotel options because we had our two small dogs with us. The staff was friendly and we enjoyed a very nice complimentary breakfast the next morning (it feels like that's a dying trend at hotels anymore). The only nit picky things I'd have to add are the reviews are right- the bathrooms are soooo tiny. Not a deal breaker but I wish they would just make the doors into pocket doors and it would be a game changer. Also be warned it is pricey to bring dogs. They came with a $70 cleaning fee which I understand but is a bummer when we were only there one night and they stayed in their crate anytime we weren't there. Ah well....that's the cost of furbabies. I'd definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area. It's a quick 15 minute drive to most touristy type stops.A hotel room 10 minutes away from downtown for $80? I was shocked at the price, and did not hesitate to make a reservation here recently. My wife and I were in town for a friend's wedding and we loved our stay here. The stay is friendly and the accommodations are really nice. The room itself featured a great king size bed and also a large sitting area with a kitchenette and fridge. Traveling for the first time with a newborn, I thought we were going to run into some issues but this experience was great!Free hot breakfast buffet in the morning is a huge bonus!My only knock on this place is the lack of ""snack"" options - one night my wife and I wanted a snack and they don't really have much to offer. No vending machines or anything like that, just a counter in the front with some sweets and soda.Stayed here for business. Despite booking ahead of time the only available room was on the first floor next to the pool. So I got to experience the terrible sound insulation. It's alsmot like there are no walls between the bedroom and hallway. Would be great if you could close off the living area and sleeping are for extra sound insulation. Breakfast was very good if you get there before the rest of the guests or else the room fills up, nice touch that is often overlook in today's world. Really wish they placed the loud families in the spots that they will make loud.Great location near plenty of restaurants and shopping.   Several places within walking distance.  The staff was extremely friendly,  housekeeping was excellent.   I like the room set up with the sitting area and desk.  Wi fi was speedy and reliable.  Would definitely recommend this place.If you can tell from the amount of pictures I took, I love this place and any other Hyatt Place! I love the upscale modern feel of the whole hotel. The furniture and decor are really nice. I love the service. I have been to 2 others in different states and they are always on top of their game when it comes to the front desk and much of anything else. I love the rooms with the flat panel TV that swivels between the living room and bedroom. The sink is really nice with the stone counters and I like that they have a refrigerator with a whole separate sink by the door. The couch is always comfortable and has a good amount of throw pillows. I also like the nice warm throw blanket that they also supply. the breakfast is actually one of the better ones I have had for what it is. they have oatmeal, cereal, bagels, toast, donuts, juice, milk, fruit, yogurt, and they also have a menu that you can order from at a cost. I would probably go out if I wanted something warm because the prices are a little high for what they offered. This place was in the middle of what ever you wanted to do, everything we did was no more than 15 minutes away.I stayed here when I attended a wedding at the Olmstead down the street.  Not only was the location great, but the rooms were very nice for the very low $80 a night price tag.  I liked that there was a lounge area separate from the bedroom area that had a sizable flat screen as well as a coffee/tea breakfast nook.  My party was very well accommodated by the staff.  They let us get rooms on the same floor and didn't bat an eye when we asked to change our taxi arrival time not once, not twice, but three times.  I can't help it if my beauty routine takes longer than anticipated!To top it all off, checkout in the morning was a breeze and made even more delightful by the complimentary continental breakfast.  I highly recommend staying here!I recently stayed here for a business trip, this was my first visit ever to a Hyatt Place and was uncertain on staying there but I did review some of the prior reviews which made it a bit more comortable.Upon my arrival, I was immediately greeted by a gentleman at the front desk who was friendly and helpful to say the least.  He processed me through quickly, explained about the complimentary breakfast and off I went. The rooms are spacious, it gives you the sense of staying in a suite....the sectional couch is extremely comfortable, the flat screen tv is awesome....the in-house coffee was great, the mini fridge came in handy to stock up some snacks.  The bed was ultra comfortable.  The entire staff there was helpful and friendly...they definitely have my business for my next visit out there!Rooms are ""cool"" looking, but (call me crazy) I prefer a room thats comfortable &amp; functional...I care less how trendy it looks. The bathroom was a joke. If someone's on the toilet, you can't open the door. It must be 3x4 feet...literally. The bathroom sink is in the bedroom area (weird, right?) Big flat screen tv, but it's located in between the living room and bedroom (which are only separated by a thin ""shade""), so if u have a kid sleeping on the sofa bed, you can't watch tv without disturbing them. Also, I was told it had an indoor pool when I booked it, only to find out there wasn't. The only good thing was the breakfast, but that's not enough for me to ever want to stay there again.Probably the best hotel room I have ever stayed in. The bed was comfortable and you have a separate living area with a couch that folds out into a bed if needed. The TV is mounted on the wall and you can move it so you can see while laying in bed or sitting on the couch. The rooms also have a small sink, mini fridge, and coffee pot. Pool was nice other then a little crowded. The only downside was the air conditioner. When we got in it was extremely cold so we turned it down. After that it was really loud the whole time.We got in late and they were happy to help us with the bags to our rooms. The beds were very comfy and they have a mini media center you would hook your xbox or laptop into if you have a vga or HDMI cable. The rooms are big and it smells great and the floor and bathrooms are spotless. The wifi worked ok but I didn't expect a fast connection at all. The pool was nice to use and I happy to have it there. We didn't eat breakfast there because we wanted a hot breakfast. Would I stay again yes.Alright...I want to give this place more stars, but I can't.  I absolutely LOVE the actual rooms.  They're huge. They have 42 in flat screen tv's mounted on a swivel on a wall between the ""Bedroom"" and the ""Living Room"" That's right...all the rooms have a living room. With a big L-shaped couch and ottoman. All very very cool.  But, I think in all the updates on the rooms they left the bathrooms exactly the same, but they moved the walls or something and smashed up the bathroom.(Disclaimer: This next part of the review revolves around pooping)I was injured while pooping in this hotel room.  The toilet was so close to the wall/door of the bathroom that the toilet paper roll holder actually hung over the toilet seat.  I'm not a small man.  But, it hung OVER the toilet seat.  So, it dug into my side while going to the bathroom.  Also, I had to sit sideways on the toilet because the toilet was so close to the door.  RIDICULOUS!  It was so uncomfortable that I honestly would have preferred pooping elsewhere...(Pooping stories over)Other than that, the staff was nice and helpful. They gave us advice on where to go and what to do while we were in town. The contenintal breakfast was....ok....pretty much what you'd expect.  But, the bathrooms in the room are awful...and made me give them a not great review.  Pooping comfort is important!Just checked in.  Staff is incredibly friendly.  Room is awesome.  Bed is comfy.  TV is HUGE.  No complaints at all.  Seriously for the money, awesome hotel.  Missing finer touches of a luxury hotel but for my money this place is incredible.I've stayed in 2 Hyatt Place hotels now(Louisville and Indianapolis) both exactly the same even the lobby is the same layout.   I really love them.  Nice set up with the large flat panel TV.  The bathroom is small but the sink is outside the bathroom so it's great for a couple to get ready at the same time.  Great breakfast... Very healthy:)  Only thing I don't like is no trash can in the bathroom!?Hyatt did a great job laying out the rooms for the business traveller.  I like the big comfy room.  The only thing that would make the room better was being able to see the tv from the desk whiile trying to work.  The room was clean and tidy.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.This hotel provides value with a contemporary, classic flair. The lobby area is really nice, it feels like a boutique hotel which usually comes with a much higher price tag. The hotel features self check in and has a nice snack bar/coffee shop and Starbucks cafe. Guests can order and pick up a variety of items through touch screens. In fact, the Internet features are a striking feature of this hotel. In addition to the standard wi-fi, it was nice to have a gaming console which also permitted a mp3 or CD player hook up to a large 42 inch plasma screen TV. The hotel staff were very friendly and gave me a tour of the facilities. The room was very clean. The only drawbacks...hence the 4 rather than 5 rating was the bathroom which felt really tiny and the lack of storage space if you were staying for more than one night. But, on ambiance and creating a nice experience on a reasonable budget, this hotel is definitely a step in the right direction!","booked a room here last minute on a road trip to the east coast. our first experience with a ""Hyatt Place"". we were already in a good mood because of what a great price we got last-minute (advertising well under $100 for a handicapped-accessible room (we didn't really care, but it does affect the bathroom layout in slightly inconvenient ways); they are being rational and pricing down leftover rooms at the end of the night ... an empty room is revenue lost). we weren't expecting much, but this far surpassed our expectations. hyatt has obviously thought pretty hard about what typical travelers need and don't need, made sure they get the stuff they want, and cut the other stuff. feels like the garden inn or residence inn concept, but they just do it more nicely.walking in, we weren't sure we were at the front desk, but it turns out they had one guy playing bartender and food server as well as doing check-in. in a hotel of this size, though, the lean staffing seems to be fine. if you think about it, how many non-resort, non-big-city, passing-through-town hotels really need bellmen, front desk staff, concierge, room service, etc? it feels very european in terms of how cleverly used the space is. everything is ultra-modern; automated check-in/check-out kiosk in the lobby, and i was struck by the number of input options for the big-screen TV.  but the rooms themselves don't feel cramped at all; you have a sitting area, plus a bedroom area, and (at least in our room) a big bathroom.and yet when I remarked at check-out how new it all seemed, the woman on duty said this location was actually due for a thorough renovation. !!! renovating a property where everything already seems extremely up to date: now that's good management.service here was both friendly and efficient: to have one person doing everything, that person has to be very efficient, but it seems like they did in fact find very friendly and efficient people. another nice bonus: conveniently located next door to a Brick House Tavern (open late, good food, reasonable prices) as well as a Barnes &amp; Noble. and near the freeway.oh and to top it off?  the *included* breakfast is actually good and includes savory items - mcmuffin-type sandwiches.  none of the usual lame ""some bread, jam and juice' continental breakfast business.  this is a *real* breakfast.  and more of the clever efficiency: the plates are stacked above the buffet, saving room, and enabling them to put their money where guests stay.honestly, i have stayed at hotels that charge 4x more that were not as good as the stay we had here.we will happily try another Hyatt Place in the future and would definitely stay here again if passing through Louisville.  heck, we'd even consider paying $100 to do it.I traveled to Louisville on March 16, 2008 and stayed at this hotel.  The service is excellent.  The front desk (Wayne) loaned me an umbrella, and I was grateful for that.  The bathroom downstairs had complimentary pads and tampons in each stall.  That's a detail that I sincerely can appreciate.The hotel has a ""boutique"" hotel theme.  The room has a plasma screen t.v.   The bathroom is a little small, and I didn't like the sink being separated from the toilet.  Gift shop would be nice.Overall, I give this hotel a 10 for friendly service and for details.Can't wait to stay here again!First off...I'm IN LOVE with the couch...I'm stalking on where to buy one for my house;-)Service was great, bed cozy, etc.  I do agree with the smallish bathroom.wifi was nice and reliable.  Room was spacious enough to lay out all of our clothes and gazillion bags so I could restructure for the next leg of the trip.  (and clean....wouldn't get heebie jeebies from sitting on the carpet;)But really....I love that couch....did I mention that?There is a Hyatt Place near us and I told hubby we should go stay there for our anniversary just to cuddle on the couch and watch a movie;-)  lol  (It doesn't take much...)Compared to our last stay in Louisville at the dive-y-est Motel6 ever, it was a complete 180.  My perpetually uber-frugal, cranky if he spends money hubby, is sold on hyatt place.  We cant wait to bring the kids back next time for the convention.  Every 2nd February we'll be staying at Hyatt Place East;-)Breakfast: Yum.  A step up from your average, fresh fruit, tazo teas and well staffed to keep up with the clients eating.tv's are cool, rooms are clean and comfortable. but the wi-fi didn't work on my first visit, and I commented on that. I got an email they fixed it, but on trip # 2, still no working wi-fi.",,,,"['love', 'hotel', 'brand', 'location', 'exceptional', 'extremely', 'friendly', 'staff', 'great', 'location', 'walking',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-hotel-louisville,Embassy Suites Hotel,4.0,$$,28,"Great hotel. Clean, spacious and beautifully decorated. Easy check in and check out. The only thing that bothered me was that the pictures of the pool on the website compared to what it actually looks like. The pool is tiny compared to the actual size. I expected more, and partially booked this placed based on the pool in the photos. We did enjoy the complimentary breakfast. They also had snacks and drinks in the evening but we were out during that time so we didn't get to check it out. I liked the over all layout of the room but they put us right next to a birthday party with at least 15 kids, and that was extremely irritating. If I wanted to hear screaming kids I would have brought my own. I guess I can't blame them for it, just bad luck. They were out by the second day. It is located on a business campus which made the scenery a bit blah. There are many things nearby though. Downtown was about 15 minutes away.Would I stay here again, maybe, depending on what kind of weekend I'm trying to have.This Embassy Suites, located in an obscure business park, should be marketed as an amusement park for kids and adolescents.  The centerpiece of the hotel is a large indoor pool located in the lobby.  Since this is an architectural atrium design, the sound of screaming kids echoes throughout.  In addition, groups of children, wrapped in towels, frolic in the hallways leaving moisture seeping into the carpets. It is an ersatz Disney hotel, great if you want to entertain your children.  We came here for a restful night before we embark on our move from Louisville to Salt Lake City. Restful? Hah! Our one bedroom suite was large and tastefully decorated, but the screams of ecstatic children eliminated any peace or respite. In addition, they charge an extra $75.00 to bring your pooch with you. Thus, I wouldn't call this a ""pet friendly"" hotel as advertised.  Fortunately, we talked them into not charging the $75 at check out. In summation, this Embassy Suites is great for kids and miserable for adults. Caveat Emptor.Very nice hotel overall.  Clean and comfortable with small but good laundry facility and mostly friendly and helpful staff.  A few small things kept it from getting the full five stars though.  Front desk staff member at check in was kind of a grump which is never a great way to start a stay, smiles are free and go a long way for customer satisfaction.  The bedside light had a broken on/off switch and I had to stick my finger in it to turn it off which was a bit scary.  Finally, the wifi was HORRIBLE.  Trying to watch a movie was impossible as it kept dropping and surfing the web was tough.  In closing, I would stay here again but would like to see the above issues addressed.This review is so belated! My S.O. and I stayed at the Embassy Suites-Louisville about four times between December 2014 and February 2015, and our travel backgrounds vary but our experience at this hotel was something we definitely agreed on: they kept us coming back and we always had a great stay. Our longest duration here was an 8-day stay, and we enjoyed the most obvious perks of the Embassy Suites: the free cook-to-order breakfast every morning, and the Manager's Happy Hour (which is every night between 5:30 p.m. - 7:30 p.m.). Our rooms were always clean, and despite what I've read on other reviews, we never heard anything from the atrium -- even on New Year's Eve. Here's what we learned (i.e. a few tips &amp; tricks): * The hotel gets busy with kids from Thursdays through the weekend, probably because it's in the popular East End and is an incredible value (the breakfast/bar amenities mentioned above, plus we saw they had a pool, which kiddos probably enjoy). * The gym has two treadmills and two ellipticals, plus a selection of free weights. It gets busy around 6:00 a.m. Guests here get free access to the Louisville Athletic Club, which might be more worth your time if you want to drive 2 miles. We didn't. * One of the elevators is a little wobbly, but seems strong. * In all of our rooms, the fridge was always set to ice-cold (literally) and we could never find a way to change this. * The pretzel nuggets served during Happy Hour might change your life for the better, but if you don't have any self-control, you'd better just back away slowly. * Actually, the food here is pretty good, especially for a hotel restaurant, and the kitchen is very accommodating. The veggie burger is good and tastes homemade; the flatbread pizza is easily customizable; the turkey reuben is awesome and healthy. Even the snacks during Happy Hour are pretty reliable and contain a fair amount of fresh vegetables!Overall, here's what we REALLY loved: The friendly service everywhere in this hotel. By the time we finished our last stay, we actually had a running list of everyone we wanted to acknowledge *by name* for going out of their way to give us a great experience: * Chauncey learned our breakfast order by heart, but she also greeted us by name each day and gave us a friendly chat and ""Good morning,"" even when we didn't get anything in the cook-to-order breakfast line. * Diana, the morning hostess, was so friendly and sweet. * Justin, one of the night cooks, made us an awesome dinner one night and gave us great menu advice since we had eaten just about everything on there. [He's a talented guy.] * Angela and Simone provided excellent kitchen support and service.* Nick and Monty went out of their way to bartend with excellent service and advice. ""Bartend"" is actually quite an understatement: Monty is a true gentleman, very soft-spoken and polite, while Nick suggested a great local beer for us when we pried him for other drink suggestions outside of the hotel bar. * Kyle always greeted us with a smile from the front desk and helped us out with all of our room/hotel questions.* Erica, one of the housekeepers, was extremely professional while she was in our room AND while she was around the hotel. This staff is just so impressive and I truly hope they are well-compensated for their service. This team definitely helped us feel comfortable and they set the bar high for future travel.Really enjoyed my time here. Clean, contemporary, and large rooms with more than enough space. Always nice to have a fridge and microwave and plenty of desk space (in your own suite, and also plenty of room to work in the lobby). The highlight of this place is the stellar complimentary breakfast...omelets/ scrambles and other hot foods made to order and a nice selection of oatmeal, fruits, donuts, breads, potatoes, yogurts, etc.Stopped here for non business and had a pleasant experience.  The rooms were clean and modern and the workout area was adequate for me to set up my bike and trainer which was great.  One of the highlights of this place is the made to order breakfast and the word is out on this group.  So if you want a good shot shorter lines and getting everything you want get up early!  They experience quite a rush and they do get cleaned out of some of their items, especially if it's toward the end.  Certainly worth another stay next time i'm in the area.In town for a music fest, and staying 3 nights, we were out for a fun, safe, weekend with a few perks. This Embassy Suites (EB) did a fine job with the pre-prep. I coordinated with Clay Cadarette, the Front Office manager to ensure my friend, who arrived before I did, would have a smooth check in. (Great job, Clay!) He e-mailed me the paperwork and I got it right back to him with his stamp of approval. Super nice touch! Very responsive!Staff were **all** smiles and Southern charm. I mean everyone! Not one grump in the group.The room was clean! Nice-sized fridge; bar sink; microwave; those weird two pouch coffee pots, good supply of toiletries,  and comfy beds. The bedroom even had a nice vanity area. I'm not sure I've see one before in an EB (and this trip just put me in Silver Elite status - woot!)Hotel is located as they advertise, ~ 15 minutes from downtown. It is an ~ $36.00 cab ride from hotel to Champion's Park, one way.Friend called because she thought there was an issue with the toilet. Maintenance was lightening-fast and looked right into it. (There wasn't really an issue anyway, but the keys are ""lightning fast"" and ""friendly"")The reasons this EB doesn't get 5 starts are the following: **no on site shuttle (I thought their web site said they had one, but when I rechecked it did not, so no issue there), it's just odd to me that an EB anywhere doesn't have a shuttle.**No *real* room service. The Atrium restaurant (inside the EB) had a decent standard breakfast with ample food out for all the traveling families, (cheerleaders, student atheletes, etc) but rolls up their service at 11 to reopen AFTER the complimentary b'fast buffet at, I think, 11:30 AM. That leaves a serious food/bev gap if you are a group of metal heads attending a music festival and wanting to relax in your room with some chub grub following a late night show. So, step it up Atrium, don't advertise all those delicious eats and drinks and cut us off at 11PM for 12.5 hours!  [To their credit, the sweet folks at the front desk turned us on to a restaurant that delivered until 4 AM - SCORE! So, that kept the munchies at bay, as we used them two times).**After hanging out at the festival and dodging crowd surfers all day, a body needs some R&amp;R, so we couldn't WAIT to hit the hot tub. Again, closes at 11 PM. No ifs, ands, or buts. Night one, we missed it and night 2 we were able to squeeze in under the finish line for ~ 20 minutes of hot tub goodness. It was a clean hot tub, stocked with two types of towels, one is super plush and large and the other more like a hair towel, but big enough. On our checkout day, Monday when we hoped for one last hot tub before hitting the road, we are greeted with a ""Hot tub is out of service, sorry for any inconvenience"" sign. Again, not a big deal, just a little bit of a let down. **disappointing coffee maker. This is my personal pet peeve, so I can't really blame them. Friend called this EB and was told that the in room coffee pots *were* Keurig. That's all we brought w/ us were Keurig pods. If I had known that actually, no, they do not have Keurig, I would have brought my own, or my 4-cup. On day 3, the ""just outside of the buffet area"" giant coffee pot was empty. So, we doubled up the little padded coffee thingys that go in the drippy thingy into the paper cup and made do. The in room phones are wireless, so if you program in your wakeup call make sure the phone is on the hook. Ours wasn't which nearly mucked up our departure time. So, keep the phones charged and on the hook or the auto-wakeups do NOT work. Bring a little alarm clock.Across the street is a McAllister's deli and there are shops and restaurants super close by (within 2 miles was a nice looking outdoor mall).If you are looking for a full service EB; complete with something like a Ruth's Chris delivering all night right to your room, and an in-house spa, with a shuttle van that will take you anywhere within a reasonable radius (25 miles) look elsewhere. If you are looking for a solid EB, with friendly folks and super-great management (Clay) who do want to meet and exceed your expectations, in a safe, comfortable, lovely suburban setting close to shops and eats, stay here. When in the area, I'll be back, but I'll bring my KeuriSo my last few stays at Hotels in the Hilton chain have not been so great. So when my husband booked our stay at this Embassy Suites I was not expecting too much. I was blown away. This hotel was very nice. It was clean, updated and laid out well. The staff was nice. It was full and there was a wait to get food in the morning, but they worked to keep the food refilled. The only issue was there were not enough tables to eat at but like I said they were fill. Would go back again in a heart beat. Very nice!Beautifully decorated, good staff, great location and nice amenities.  Of course, the evening reception and cook to order breakfast are always a highlight at Embassy.  The photos on Yelp are outdated; the hotel has been remodeled and has a nice modern vibe.  So, why three stars and not four or five?  The beds.  My wife and I both tossed and turned all night.  And, two queens would be so much better than two doubles.  Someone else may find the mattresses just fine--I'm sure it is a preference thing, but boy does my back hurt this morning!ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS WOW! Okay, I'll say a little more...It is a great hotel - especially for the price. The value is amazing and the location is great. It's a super safe and fancy area.  We were greeted with free snacks and cocktails in the evening, when we checked in. They also have a free cooked to order breakfast. The room - or actually a 2 room suite - was comfortable, clean, quiet and had everything we needed. The wi-fi was fast and the little kitchenette was nice, so we could have a ""home cooked"" meal. We are on month 2 of an almost 4 month national comedy tour, so we really look for places that are a stand in for ""home"". That is not always accomplished but IT WAS HERE. It really did feel like home, only a fancier and more modern home than ours :-)Exceptionally clean and hospitable. By far our best hotel experience since our two year old was born. Breakfast was good and had ton of options.  Cocktail hour was low key and refreshing.  Lobby was welcoming and room was large, clean, comfortable and had a convenient layout.  Price was good, too! Makes me want to seek out more Embassy Suites!Clean and pristine! Staff was phenomenal. Chaunacy the cook rocked!Quite possibly the very worst Hilton property I have ever had stayed at in the last 25 years!Front desk staff is incompetent.  Junior managers are not empowered to satisfy the customers.  Senior managers are absent on the weekends.  General Manager absolutely lacks customer-focus and has a ""fine...we don't want customers like you"" approach to troubleshooting problems with his staff.  Their response to my first problem caused my second and third problems and the whole experience just spiraled downwards.  Thanks to these people I was late to a business meeting and had to shave in the car on the way there.  Not exactly the experience I expected when I made the reservation at my favorite brand of hotel.  I had enough problems with this property that I will NEVER stay there again when I am in town on business.  It is worth noting that I stayed in 3 different Embassy Suites hotels within the 10-day period I stayed here (Chicago - Louisville - Nashville) and this place just doesn't measure up.Of note (and the reason they received even a single star) is the omelet guys - very friendly and banging out great food.  Other than those two...this place represents a complete waste of money!  Do yourself a favor and sleep in your car or on a park bench instead of making a reservation at this property.Super solid two-room suite hotel. Fresh hot breakfast selection in the morning was well stocked and varied. A non-dairy milk option would have been nice however... The room and bathroom were very clean and the Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries smelled great. Bed was on the softer side, down pillows. There were huge flat screen TV's in both the bedroom and separate sitting area. Used the laundry facilities and they were reasonably priced at just a dollar per load. Only complaints were the noise on friday and saturday nights. The atrium layout amplified the sound coming from the pool, ballroom and bar areas and we could hear it all the way in the back bedroom. Probably would not have stayed at this hotel if we hadn't received the military discount, but at around $100 a night with, it was a good deal for the quality.this review is long over due.  My crew and I have stayed here 3 times now. Everyone on the staff is great from the front desk, to the bar, and the morning breakfast staff.Theresa, Trent, Danielle, Nick, Monty to name just a few. And especially Diana who works the morning breakfast shift along with the two lovely female Chefs.  Oh yes and the rooms are comfortable and clean.  Thank you Embassy Suites for your welcoming hospitality. Mary Donaldson - LA, CAWhile on business in Louisville, I stayed here for a couple of nights.  The hotel is a typical Embassy Suites, including the signature layout.  Rooms were clean and were modern.  I took advantage of the complimentary Happy Hour which included free drinks and finger foods.  The lobby and lounge are quite nice as well with modern furnishings.  The complimentary made to order breakfast was great as well.Stayed there last week, great place great pool clean and the free breakfast was a big plus for the family would recommend it to everyoneThis hotel can't seem to honor their reservations. Had a reservation booked per our usual through the Hilton website. Was placed in a smoking room, then told ""those are your preferences online."" O rly? We are Hilton Diamond members, stay over 30 times a year and have NEVER stayed in a smoking room, nor have our preferences EVER reflected that we want a smoking room. But according to the staff all of a sudden we're smokers after 12 years. I checked the website and, as stated, we do not prefer smoking rooms in our preferences. They were unable and unwilling to make it right by finding another room in their hotel or in another Hilton property.  We also called the Hhonors line and the rep also noted that we did not have ""smoking rooms"" checked as a preference. If you're gonna overbook you could at least not lie and claim that it is our fault that you only have smoking rooms left. We walked out and went across the street. In the future try not to lie to your customers.We have stayed here 3 times and I am now ready to write a review. This hotel is the ultimate in southern hospitality.The employees are cordial and attentive. This is the cleanest hotel I have stayed in anywhere in the south.The only thing with this hotel is it's ALWAYS full so make your reservations ahead. You can't walk in and get a room. Some things are worth planning ahead, and this hoteli is one of them.Oh yes, free breakfast and happy hour too!Excellent rainforest coffee N made to order breakfast. Room odor was stale. HVAC has no thermostat. I like the modern setting.","A very good place to stay if you are out in Louisville, KY area. The hospitality is very good.This hotel is lovely.  Lovely rooms, lovely ambiance and all around it smells clean and fresh.  This is a must for a hotel.  I would have given it five stars but it was too crowded at breakfast on a Sunday morning.  I think they need to add more tables and chairs to their breakfast area.  We did come when people were having a family reunion and maybe that could have been the reason.  Other than that it was a pleasant experience.The best hospitality of all the hotels I've stayed at in the last 10 years.I was very impressed with how the staff operates.  Front desk staff is very professional and the wait staff is the reason I ALWAYS come back to this place.  This location is a further drive for me, but well worth it.The atrium set up can make it a little noisy if you're directly above the bar area, but quiet in the bedroom if the door is closed.Nice setting. Staff is friendly.The staff is friendly, has what you expect from a Hilton location. The rooms are dated and could be refreshed a bit.The only reason this hotel received four stars it is isn't the most glamorous modern hotel out there, but for the price it was very nice, clean, and had great service. We came for the Kentucky Derby and it was such a great experience. The staff were all extremely friendly and excited for everyone going to the derby. Breakfast was delicious and fresh. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Also, we were celebrating my birthday and they surprised me with Champagne on ice with chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us in our room.Excellent hotel, however, I downgraded it one star because the HVAC unit is antiquated (no temperature control) and the toilet had trouble working correctly.  However, the complimentary reception and breakfast were good. The rooms (and public spaces) were clean and modern. The bed was comfortable and overall it is in a nice neighborhood.I chose this hotel because of its proximity to family I was visiting, and it proved to be an excellent choice. Check-in was quick, and I was able to get into my room immediately even though I was a bit early. The room was clean, comfortable and absolutely enormous. Bigger than my first apartment!  The suite style is an excellent setup for parents traveling with small children.  Any parent who has been stuck in a hotel room at their child's bedtime, unable to turn on the tv out of fear of waking them up will know what I am talking about!  Guest Services was truly wonderful. Though I am normally very organized, I forgot to pack a razor.  They sent one up within 5 minutes of my calling. The included breakfast is just what a hungry traveler needs- a FULL yummy breakfast cooked to order by some wonderful chefs who showed this Jersey girl some true Southern hospitality.  Thank you, Embassy Suites for a wonderful stay.We usually try to stay at Embassy suites whenever we can, We came into Louisville late and stop at another hotel, they were full, but, said Embassy Suites might have a room, we couldn't ever find Embassy suites in autoclub book or yellow pages.  Nice hotel, but we stayed at embassy suites Lexington the night before and it was far superior....DO NOT eat at the restaurant across the highway, I think it was called

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fern-valley-hotel-and-conference-center-louisville,Fern Valley Hotel & Conference Center,1.5,$$,28,"This place was chill little ghetto spot for a very reasonable price. Located near a score of good restaurants and easy freeway access. The service staff was super friendly and helpful which makes up for a lot.The room left something to be desired. It wasn't particularly clean or at least did not appear so. I had some insectoid roommates that didn't cause me much problem although some folks might object to these free loading 6 legged freaks.All in all, this place served its purpose, a place to crash my face into a pillow and wake up warm and dry the next morning. Good enough for me. If you find yourself frequently complaining about what a hotel may or may not lack.. this may not be the place for you.Do Not Stay Here. This was the creepiest hotel ever. I swear we were the only ones here. We asked for a non smoking room. Nope. I swear I could feel my lungs screaming. We did check for bugs. Didn't find any a plus. We still slept fully clothed. Then to top it off at 12 (midnight). Someone tried to come into our room. I shouted ""Stop"" and ran to slam the door shut. The guy apologized &amp; said he was a security guard. You could hear him checking all the rooms. And then went up next floor to check those rooms. (Weird). I wish I had checked the yelp reviews before booking this place. My sister booked it for me because it was close to the airport. Never again!!!Would love to give the quality of customer service a big fat ZERO thanks to Laquana and her complete lack of customer service skills. Called simply to discuss adding an additional night to my stay, instead was treated extremely rudely from the moment Laquana answered the phone. My simple call turned into a one sided debate, with me being lectured by Laquana... Poor customer service costs businesses billions of dollars each year and besides losing my annual business, Fern Valley just lost the business of my entire Salesforce which routinely travels to Louisville on a quarterly basis. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this placeBusiness travel isn't always glamorous. There are delayed flights, luggage getting lost, rude people, stinky taxis, etc. But usually when you get to your hotel room, you can kick your shoes off and sit in peace for a minute or two.But I wouldn't take my shoes off if you're staying here. In fact, I'd keep them on, along with your clothes, zipped and bundled from head to toe.My company booked a block of rooms for us in October for a convention down the road. The first red flag was the reception - dingy, indifferent front desk personnel in scrubby-looking polo shirts, keys that weren't registered/didn't unlock rooms... and oh, those rooms.To get to the rooms, you have to walk through the seven layers of hell, or, rather, the dilapidated and decaying lobbies and hallways. Carpets are pulled up or curling, elevators smell like dank cigarettes smoked 20 years ago, garbage piled up in the receptacles. I mean, there's not really a nice way of saying it, and I don't feel like I have to be nice because it's so gross, but this place is just dirty. It's old, it's dated, it's dirty. The people working there don't give a flying fook about the property - it shows.The fire alarm went off 4+ times during our stay. At night. And why? They didn't know and were not fussed enough to FIX IT.The bar didn't take credit cards. There's no on-site food. It's just.... no.No. No. No. Never will I step foot in the Fern Valley Hotel &amp; Conference Center and I urge you to most likely never do such a thing, either.*I know there are many more details I am leaving out, but I feel the need to post this here because I wrote an original review the day after I got back on Trip Advisor and it's NOWHERE to be found. Interesting.If you'd like to feel like you're staying in the hotel from ""The Shining,"" go ahead and book yourself here. But don't expect the mountain views. It's that creepy; doors left wide open with no one in them, piles of laundry in the hallways, holes in the walls and chicken nuggets on the floor (not kidding). The front desk, which is mediocre at best, says they are being ""renovated,"" but after two nights here, I have seen zero work being done. I didn't even bother with the breakfast, seeing as how it's probably as good as the ""free wifi,"" which is completely nonexistent (goodbye data). I would have never stayed, but was booked here for work, and you know what they say... All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.Gross. Never again. Loud kids screaming down the hallway, old looking rooms, no room service, no drinks...3stars? I think notZero stars!!  DO NOT STAY HERE!!  I cannot even understand how the health dept hasn't shut this place down. Inside and out this place is a &amp;#!@ hole. From the floors to the ceilings, it is completely falling apart,  EXTREMELY run down, dated, has a old, somebody -died- there type -of- musty odor. Many of the doors don't have room numbers on them, so they got real classy and wrote the number of the room on the door with a black sharpie... then. when you walk in the room, you're greeted by BUGS  climbing on the curtains in your room. Keep in mind, this room is going for $150 a night!! The room is no bigger than a 1010, the wallpaper is peeling off the wall, the baseboards are separating from the wall, the ceiling has patchmarks, paint is literally coming off the walls and the carpet reeks. The second we walked in and took a look around, we went online and looked for another place to stay. To make matters worse, the front desk could care less and still charged us a full night, even though we explained the situation and told them we're leaving. So, we are currently driving an hour away to a much, much nicer hotel. (There is a convention in town near that bug- infested dump,  so everywhere else was fully booked.) We GLADLY jumped in the car to drive away.  Disgusting.I have stayed here in previous year but for the price the facilities are not up to par like they should be........but the staff is courteous and accommodatingThis is a sad excuse for a hotel. Don't let the pictures on their website and descriptions fool you- first of all there is no free continental breakfast, let alone breakfast of any kind at all, no wifi, pool, restaurant, bar, or even an accessible ice machine. Let's just say that I am not picky with hotels, I have staged at some very cheap hotels with not the greatest accommodations, but this is by far the JANKIEST place I have ever set foot in. You walk in to a lobby with caution tape everywhere that you look. A gift shop is on the left, AKA a closet with 3 bags of fun sized chips sitting on a shelf. As you continue walking though the hotel, you realize that literally every accommodation that is advertised on their website is either broken, shut down, or roped off with caution tape. The carpet smells like mold and is peeling off the ground. The pool is drained and has something growing on the bottom of it. The elevator was last inspected in 2013 and smells like urine. The hotel room has the deadbolt literally ripped off of the doorframe.  When my room of 4 people ran out of toilet paper, we asked the front desk if we could have some more and were told that they couldn't provide more toilet paper, so we had to find a closet to get more from. When we tried to call the front desk to ask where the ice machine is, we realized that the phone was merely a decoration and had no cord to the wall. To actually get to the ice machine, you have to limbo under a roped off area of caution tape, walk down a dark hallway on carpet that surely has mold or something else growing on it, and go into the depths of this sketchy excuse for a hotel. Some rooms are missing room number plates and have sharpie written on them instead. Do I need to go on? Save yourself your money and spend it on somewhere else. PS there's literally a White Castle in the parking lot of the Fern Valley.... That's gotta be the biggest red flag ever...I'm a military officer and travel all over the country. It is very frustrating when I stay in a 4 to 5 star hotel and they charge me internet when the less expensive hotel down the road has free internet. I state the previous to really say that this hotel is a 1 or 2 star at best with the WORSE free internet I have ever experienced in my 15 years of traveling around the country. If it wasn't for a huge convention being in town I wound NEVER-EVER stay in this hotel again. Stay away from this hotel if you can if you want good dependable internet.....this hotel ABSOLUTELY sucks when talking about the internet !!!!  14Feb2015....this is an update, above was written couple days ago. I had booked this hotel until the 16th but could not take it anymore and had to change hotels. The experience got worse. The day after above review there was no hot water the next mooring and then the cable went out on television most of the day. I will say to a minor credit to hotel they did reimburse me for one night, but that still does not take away how horrible this hotel is.....i really feel sorry for staff because they are very nice and try to be professional but the hotel itself is just awful. The owners need to wake up and take care of this place.This place is a dump. I do not say that lightly. My room is scary. I'm looking at the floor and there are about 6000 colored stains on the carpet - like gum or the result of a pinata party with red velvet cake. Absolutely disgusting. I'm not going to even think about walking barefoot on this carpet. I haven't yet checked the bed, I'm actually afraid. Stay away, far far away. This place wants $150+ a night which should cover the copay on your trip the emergency room to treat whatever fungus or disease you will pick up by actually spending the night here. If I wasn't so tired I would blow this place and just drive the 4 hours home and demand my money back but now I actually have to brave sleeping in the bed.The folks who manage this place should be ashamed and embarrassed. I feel sorry for the people who work here, they are overworked and have to apologize way too often. Definitely the worst place I have ever stayed.I would say that this place is losing money hand over fist.  Came there for a couple of days for a training class in one of their conference rooms, our company reserved rooms for our attendees. When I arrived the night before I drove around the place looking to see if it was open. Both sides of street looked dead and there were just a few cars. Like only the workers??  I cancelled and stayed elsewhere. The next morning at training I saw the expected. Everywhere you go you smell the carpet, see the disrepair and notice the deferred maintenance. This is a hotel from the sixties or seventies and has not been updated since. This place needs a lot of budget to update throw away items and a team of maintenance to start actually fixing something. Everything looks like a twelve year old has worked on it, they can tear it apart to see what's inside but can't identify problem much less reassemble/fix. Not sure how they pass inspections.First day. Just had the lunch. The lunch is as bad as the rooms. Rosemary chicken, wild rice and green beans. Chicken resembled raw hide chew toys, rice was like plastic filler and the beans were just funky.  Brownie was pretty good.someone pissed on the carpeted elevator 2 days ago and they probably still haven't checked on it.The staff was friendly and they gave me an extremely reasonable deal upon arrival. I had  a great stay and it was an incredible deal.This was my worst hotel stay in memory.  Nasty smelling common areas around a cloudy indoor swimming pool.  Dirty carpets in my room.  4 fire alarms the first night.  Ancient mattress with tired pillows.  It was a complete horror show.  I returned home exhausted with some kind of insect bite on my shoulder.  Never again!We stayed here in Nov. 2014 and I will never stay here again.  The first room we were assigned to the keycard would not work.  Finally got it to work and someone else was already assigned to room.  Next room again keycard would not work and finally got it to work.  Once in the room the toilet had a long black hair on it.  There was mold on the heat and air unit.  The air did not work and has to ask for a fan just to cool room down. Ask for a refrigerator took us 3 refrigerators to finally get one that works.   Beds were not only small but very uncomfortable.  Staff was friendly and said they would give us a discount.  They have us 10.00 off our bill.This is the shittiest hotel I've ever stayed in. Incredibly grungy, no dark curtains to shut out lights that are on ALL NIGHT LONG at the pool, toilet running constantly, sink dripping, no soap or shampoo, gross foam pillows, lumpy bed, etc. It's almost as if the place is going for some kind of shit-tastic trophy. Yuck.My first stay here tonite. Probly not again though. Room is ok. Adequate elec outlets but hidden on wall at bed's headboard! Tv is not so good with very limited channels. Otherwise a pretty good room. Pillows are obviously needing replacement long time ago too. Heater works good, and is cold weather now, so sure needed. Bedding is otherwise pretty good. $165 is a lot for this. Nicer and newer places usually avail for same prices. Big farm show in town, so rooms are scarce. Thos works ok and is close to Atlantic Aviation where our airplane is parked. Wi-fi does not work either.Not a good place to stay. If you have any other option go for it. Room has everything broken from TV to restroom sink. I was too tired to call at 2 AM so had to crash there anyway. But if you have option, find another hotel to stay.The hotel that renovation time forgot.  Lobby smelled like a sewer.  Garbage overflowing in bathrooms.   Conference room was so hot and no one took any action to cool the place down...people were leaving. Automatic doors broke,  shower drain not working...stood in a foot of water during my shower.  Fire alarms kept going off, electrical wires hanging out of wall,  checked in to a blatantly dirty room,  no electricity in replacement room.....  dont stay here.","I like this hotel very clean they offer free WI-FI ,has a swimming pool, flat screen television for those of you that have gaming systems such as myself who knows how important that is LOL. and is nicely priced for the amenities and level of service you receive I would definitely recommend this hotel.THIS PLACE IS A DUMP!  Funny thing is - at the checkout counter they encourage you to visit yelp and rate their facility. I feel like this is the Bates Hotel. I grew up in Louisville and rememeber company parties at this site - when it was a Holiday Inn. The sayig holds true - you get what you pay for. But heck at least at the Super 8 or Motel 6 they invest to make their property look appealing. I am checking out tomorrow and CANT WAIT! The location is ideal to airport and lots of restaurants, but until the owners invest in this properey ......ewww!The staff ws pleasant and I made my reservations via <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a>...... they lied!!!! Gave this hotel 3 stars. If I could have went below one star I would have. I don't consider myself overly sensitive but this place is icky!No no no no!!!!! Don't stay here!!!!!!I called the hotel an hour before I got there and they still gave me a great deal on a set of 3 rooms that we needed for one night. The parking lot was huge and big enough for our 5 commercial trailers to be parked there for the night. Great food   Great serviceGreat priceWe attended a conference at this hotel where the reservation had been made for us.  We checked in late and found the night staff to be a bit over-bearing...like we were children who'd never entered a hotel before and we had to have everything explained to us in great detail...when all we wanted was to pay, get our keys, and go to bed. There is one elevator for the place and God forbid if your room is on the opposite end.  We had to walk the entire upper circumfrance of the hotel to get to our room that was...right above the front desk.  The man who insisted on walking us around talked down to us and reaked of cigarette smoke, which did nothing to help my allergies.However...the room was fine.  The bed was big and comfortable and the shower was very hot and accommodating.  We did have to make several requests for toilet paper refills. The bar was simple and have standard fare like burgers, chicken tenders, skins, sandwiches...which were good.  Our bartender was fantastic...very friendly and took care of us with quick service.  Too bad they didn't offer music or a DJ or karaoke.It's an older place that looks like it was a Holiday Inn in a previous life.  It worked just fine for our purposes, but I don't think I'd purposely go back.  The pool was like bath water and it was filled with about 20 screaming kids.  That's not the hotel's fault...but there was an employee keeping watch over the pool and he allowed tremendous horse play and running...someone could have gotten hurt.  Oh...and it's not a hot tub...it's a luke warm tub, but the jets in it kick tailfeathers!This place was horrible.  We went on a 3 1/2 week cross country trip and this was the worst hotel of the whole trip.  I booked it because of the cheap price and it was not worth it even then.  It was in a questionable part of town, the front desk people sat on the phone while i stood there and didn't even address me, they also MESSED UP billing me and checking me in, and somehow it took 3 people to fix the problem.  The place was dirty and i didn't feel comfortable walking in bare feet.  And the elevator was terrifying.  It made horrible noises and swayed and even got stuck!  Don't get a room here!! Go on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> or <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotwire.com&amp;s=d1b28cf279608588b1b4e17dd9db61331484f85f0a19df039be53a56d65a4076"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotwire.com</a> or something and pay the extra 10 or 20 bucks and get something decent!!Possibly the WORST hotel I have ever stayed in. Do NOT stay here. Heed my warning and the cautionary tales of other travelers, or you too, will be adding your rant on this Hotel profile.Hands down the worst hotel I've ever had the opportunity to stay in. Found it on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> for almost $70 a night....probably should have been more appropriately priced at $25 a night. If I had not pre-paid I would have left immediately.To begin, its not in what seems like the safest part of town. I am not from Louisville, so I admit I am making an assumption, but the general area seemed to be less than inviting. The desk clerk, although very nice, didn't seem to have a firm grasp on what he was doing. There seemed to be a lot of 'sketchy' characters loitering around the building. The room we had was fairly close to the pool, which was full of screaming children, even at 10:30 pm when we checked in. The pool, probably due to the insane amount of children, seemed dirty and not very sanitary. There was food all over the ground of the pool area, and in general the entire place had a smell that was just a little off. The room sort of stank of old urine...the toilet paper roll in the bathroom was half used, and hadn't even been changed. The mattress had what looked like a huge blood stain on it. We ended up just sleeping on top of the comforter. I probably could go on for ages, but I'm sure anyone whose read this far gets the idea. I would have rather just slept in the car or drove straight through. If I could give negative points I would.",,,,"['place', 'chill', 'little', 'ghetto', 'spot', 'reasonable', 'price', 'located', 'near', 'score', 'good', 'restaurants', 'easy', 'freeway', 'access',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-louisville-airport-expo-ctr-louisville,Crowne Plaza Louisville Airport Expo Ctr,3.0,$$,57,"I stayed here for a business convention a few months back. The location was perfect for the areas I needed to be in. But the real reason for my review is the customer service. I had a leaking water noise coming from the ceiling in the corner of the room. It made noise throughout the entire night. I called Maintenance and they said they would send someone to look later the next day. OK, sounds good I thought.Then the room service girl brought my breakfast in. She asked how my stay was, and if there was anything I needed. I joked about the water noise and how I had called Maintenance. I don't quite know what she did. I didn't take it for more than just small talk. 30 minutes later, Maintenance was at my door. It was a surprise, and I know it was because of the conversation with the room service girl. I appreciate it when people go out of their way.We're in Louisville every February for a show at the KEC, and since the rates were cheaper here this year, we decided it give it a chance. Rooms were clean, the bed was comfortable, but over a five-night period, I was awoken three times at 4am each morning with yelling in the hallway and the slamming of doors.Also, after checking out about 8am and driving over ten hours towards home, I remembered I left my iPhone charger plugged into the wall of our room. I immediately called the hotel and had someone at the front desk check with housekeeping to retrieve it for me. To no surprise, they didn't see it. I guess it's 'finders keepers' with the maids at this establishment. I know it's my fault, but have they never heard of a 'lost &amp; found'? Highly disappointed and we definitely won't be returning next year.Huge disappointment. I heard the area was shady but took a chance. Well when I got to my room and the door was repaired where it had previously had the deadbolt busted I knew I didn't want to stay!  One elevator wasn't working and the other one was screeching and most of the buttons were busted for the floors. Very dated decor. Canceled right away!!!!For the price I certainly expected more.Probably one of the best airport hotels I've stayed at.  Super close and convenient to SDF...one right turn and you're headed to the airport.  The rooms are immaculate, the beds are super cozy, the staff is very very friendly and helpful and the restaurant is convenient.  I would say the only downside is lack of free coffee or continental breakfast in the mornings and as always, the room coffee isn't worth the bother.  They were very accomodating as ""Snowmageddon 2016"" approached and the room rates were awesome!  I definetly recommend it!My husband and I got one of the ""executive"" first floor rooms that opened up to the big conference or exhibit room. It's weird - and makes for a dark room.  I would rather be on the 7th or 8th floor.Kids were here for a YMCA event. LOTS of noise all around us.Eventually noise in the exhibit room stopped only to have the hotel crew take down (and at 6am set up) tables for the next day. But my biggest complaint being adjacent to this space is that the lights were on in that large room all night and the curtains are hung away from the wall so you can't block it out. We'll I suppose I could have taped it close! Perhaps it would cut down on noise, light, and traffic (if management was concerned about our complaints) if they would turn out the lights and lock the doors at a reasonable hour (like 11pm)?The walls ARE paper thing, we hear talking coming in from all four sides -- next door, in the hall way, and in the conference room - even when the kids aren't yelling. I can concur with the fact there is no refrigerator in the executive suite. REALLY?  But I found out small refrigerators are in other rooms.And right from the beginning ...both hotel vans were parked under the portico (nice and dry) while the guest were left to unload their cars in the rain.  Perhaps the vans could stay on the far side and not be parked on both sides of the entrance?And don't look for a ""do-it-yourself"" luggage cart because they only have 1 ""for rent"" and it was in use. And I only know that because the bell hop did not come out to greet us so I had to go looking for help. So if you need a luggage cart, the bell hop has them locked in their storage area. With a property this large, I guess the carts really do go missing.The positives: the king bed was VERY comfortable, wi-fi is not an extra, the room was clean, there was a coffee maker, a lighted make-up mirror, and the TV worked. The restaurant was a nice retreat from the kids. Food was ok.These are a lot of complaints for $169 per night. I MIGHT come here again only if I get a room on a top floor.I was here for a company gathering. The ballrooms were using were clean, and the staff bussing the tables/dealing with the food were pleasant and cleared dishes and this away quickly. The food was good, I was at the front of the line, so it was fresh and hot. The drinks were expensive. I knew to expect this a bit, but it was still a bit high for the limited bar that was available.I can only comment on the conference/exhibit area. My employer held a very nice reception here for recent graduates. There are huge chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and as far as I could tell everything else was very nicely cared for (tables, walls, etc). The food was alright, I wouldn't say phenomenal, but what I ate was good. Fresh fruit was awesome! The wait staff seemed to be very accommodating, I requested coffee and the waiter came back with a carafe and cleared our tables promptly.The great thing about this hotel is that it's literally right at the airport.  It's an enormous property with something like 600+ rooms.  Normally with a hotel so large it's hard to pay attention to the small things, but not here.The rooms are clean but a bit outdated and the hotel should definitely consider some modernization.  The outside of the hotel is more impressive than the inside.   I think it doubles as a conference center so it's almost always busy.  They offer a shuttle service to the airport as well.  Unlike some Crowne Plaza locations, this one doesn't have an executive lounge.For a quick overnight stay this hotel was fine.  If I were staying for a longer period of time, I'd pick a hotel in a more fun area with more modern rooms.This is not a bad hotel, but for me it's always a comedy of little things that make a stay unpleasant or annoying. *Took 20 minutes to check in-on person working front desk on a Saturday afternoon. *Shower not functioning in room, but managed to jury-rig it-had to scramble to get ready for meeting. *There are no lock boxes in the rooms, at least in mine-not wanting to tote my laptop around all day, I just risked it, putting it in my large suitcase. *Pool in center of hotel courtyard open late-screaming kids not conducive to getting work done. *The walls and floors are paper thin-I heard kids and people yelling until about 1 a.m. and I could hear every door on my floor slam all night long. (I can normally sleep through anything, but this place is loud.)*CFL lighting makes the room dingy and sort of depressing, and, the whole place could use a refresh, as it is quite dated.*The whole hotel smells like a cheap car air freshener. Long story short-not a hotel geared toward business travelers, in my opinion, and not totally on top of its game. That said it is a stone's throw away from airport and conventions center, making it awfully convenient. Also, at around $120/night, it's certainly affordable.Room was clean and very nice. The only issue we had was the a/c didn't work. Tried to call the desk and kept getting busy signal. Went down to desk and a maintenance person was sent to the room and repaired a/c. This is the 3rd time I have stayed here and I will come backSee that picture below?  Yeah, that's the view from my room.  No, really, my room looks out into the exhibit hall.But, hey, there are pros and cons to this arrangement.Pros:* If you're an exhibitionist or ever wanted to be one of those gals in the windows in the red light district, well, there you go.* If you're not planning to be in your room a lot and want to get some sleep, this room is great.  It's dark, it's quiet, and as long as you leave the drapes closed, it's almost like your own private cave.Cons:* Well, it looks out on the exhibit hall* It's dark and actually quite depressing if you're just sitting in there on a nice sunny day.  I will say that the dark and depressing actually motivated me to go out at night, which is a good thing.  So should this be a pro?  I don't know.The thing that makes this place 4 stars is the service.  Actually the service makes it 5 stars but the exhibit hall view takes it down a notch.  Everyone that I encountered over the duration of my stay bent over backwards to make sure that I had everything I could ever need.  Everyone kept a smile and a great attitude too, even though it was a crazy Derby weekend.  I was seriously impressed.  That alone would prompt me to return.  It also doesn't hurt that this place is super close to the airport, convention center and Churchill Downs.  I didn't sit in any insane traffic like I expected.I really enjoyed my stay at this Crowne Plaza, way more than expected.  I'll definitely be back the next time...just maybe in a room where I can open the curtains.One star, and that's for the plants in the gym to liven up the place. Decent food I hear. But my room tv was completely not functioning. How am I suppose to fall asleep while watching my programs? Fuck. Oh and I better not get bed bugs, Kentucky.I'll have to say this was a step down from the Crown Plaza in Jacksonville. I'll have to say that the front desk was very stuffy &amp; not apologetic for my bad nights sleep. My room smelled of mildew and the heater was so loud that it kept waking me up.I do have to say, I was rather surprised by the overall three star rating for this place.  My experience was four star fo sho.So I was meeting my brother for Lebowski Fest and regrettably, we were only able to stay for one night of it.  COMPLETELY his fault, as he had to keep repeating to people we encountered the entire time we were there.  Historically, when in town for Lebowski Fest, I've only ever stayed at the Courtyard Marriott across the street.  My brother had taken his bar exam at the Crowne Plaza a year ago so had some familiarity with the place.  I had left the booking of the hotel room up to him for this trip, and the Crowne Plaza was his choice.  I arrived at about 5:15pm Friday night.  The first thing I noticed (after scoping out the Lebowski Fest pre-party scene in the parking lot of the Executive Strike and Spare across the street) was that the parking lot was PACKED.  Could these all be fellow Achievers (??), I wondered aloud.I finally found a parking space and then had to haul all of my $h!t (and there was a lot of it) inside.  I staggered into the lobby and up to a check in counter.  I had to make prior arrangements via email with a very helpful lady since the reservation was in my brother's name and I knew I'd be arriving before him and wanted to be able to get into the room right away so I could begin assembling my Lebowski Fest costume.  Check in itself was rather quick and painless, though there was an awkward moment when I noticed the fellow checking in beside me was given a parking pass for his car and the woman checking me in didn't say anything about it.  I then said to her ""Do I need anything for my car?""  ""Oh, you have a car?"" she asked, incredulously.  ""Nah,"" I thought to myself sarcastically, ""I rolled out of an airplane carrying a giant sized plastic bag full of toiletries, among all of these other completely impractical things."" So I got my vehicle pass (didn't put it in the car until later) and dragged my crap into an elevator where I rode up to the 6th floor.  After dumping said crap in the room, I immediately grabbed the ice bucket and my little cooler and strolled down to the ice machine so I could get my Stella cooling on the rocks ASAP.  I noticed a curious paper taped outside of one of the doors to a room.  I tried to read it, but it was a bunch of weird, scientific words that made zero sense to me.  Interesting, I thought, but continued on.  As we later found out, they were having some sort of tropical fish convention (guess that explained all of the cars in the parking lot) and people were advertising the fish they had outside of their doors.  Anyway.  So the room itself was very nice.  I don't think I took any pictures of it or anything else besides my costume, of which I will spare you the sight.  We had the standard two queens.  The bathroom had that awesome setup with the two sinks, one inside where the shower and terlet are and one outside.  We overlooked the airport and part of the parking lot so I was able to both watch planes land (I'm terrified of flying and airplanes in general) and see if any parking spots opened that I could direct my brother to upon his arrival.  That actually came in quite handy as he parked quite literally, in a space right below our window.  When my brother arrived, we lounged comfortably in the room drinking our beers and watching YouTube videos on my laptop, thanks to the free wifi.  Oh, the code was given to me at the front desk when I checked in.  We arrived back in the room after the Fest at about 1am, promptly fell asleep and didn't wake up until like 9:30am.  Nice beds.  My brother was not a fan of the pillows though.  I can't comment on the shower since my plans to utilize it completely fell through due to obscene laziness.  I'd hauled that huge shopping bag loaded with shower goods all the way to Kentucky for nothing.  Overall, according to my brother, the rate was the same here as it was the Courtyard Marriott but this definitely felt like a nicer hotel, not just a stop-through place to lay our heads.  I just might decide to stay here again when in Louisville for Lebowski Fest next time.  In the past they've offered a discounted rate for Achievers, which is awesome.  I don't know if they did this year and if so, if my brother took advantage of it.I was in on the remodel a few years ago and was pretty much in every room redoing the cable...... So when the lady and I decided to stay in Louisville after the concert at freedom hall we picked this place..... And it sucked. There wasn't a single working vending machine on our floor or the 3 above it.... No fridge in the room.... And the staff was extremely rude. Absolutely not worth 150 bucks a night.We stay at this Crowne Plaza every year for Lebowskifest, as it's right across the street from the venue.  The group rate is very reasonable, and the rooms are overall very nice.I've seen some complain about the quality of the rooms, but so far, I have yet to find a room that isn't clean and in relatively good shape.  The beds are comfortable, the shower has good pressure, and the rooms are quiet.  Another bonus is that the free in-room wifi is actually fast, which is nice for a change!The only downsides are the severe lack of elevators and the room keys.  If you're on a top floor, you can expect it to take nearly 5 minutes to call an elevator and make it to the top.  Just one more elevator off the lobby would solve this issue.  As for the keys, the keyreader for our room this year and last year was very unreliable, as were the key cards, which seem to get too easily wiped.  I had to request several sets of room keys over the weekend, which was annoying.All in all, this Crowne Plaza is a nice place to stay, and is certainly a decent place for the money.We've stayed here every two years for ICUEE trade show and it is always a little old and worn. They try to update it periodically and seem to have done a good job this last update.Room is comfortable and the bed is very nice.They have been extremely friendly and accommodated any reasonable request.Kind of pricey, though, for the age of the property.My sister and I came yesterday. She has a Nursing Classic here today.  When she checked in, in the midst of TONS and I mean TONS of LARGE white Huskys (YES DOGS), they were very kind and told her they had a suite available.  She discussed she didn't book a suite. They said oh it's a very nice room. Same price (?), you'll love it.  So it was a nice large two room suite.   We dropped our bags off and immediately went to dinner.  Well, needless to say, the food was good, service quite slow, but we didn't mind.  Time to chat,  etc.  AND for anyone who knows me, I'm a dog lover.   Two fur babies of my own, but as we were sitting in the dining room, a lady with 3 of those large dogs, proceeds to walk them  through the middle of the dining room.  They were not quite under control as she was tangled in the leashes.  One of the dogs stopped at another table of people.  One patron said something good to the lady and I overheard her say, she was told she could come through the dining room.  One gentleman at the table where the dog stopped said something and the other one said, oh it's OK as long as he doesn't try to sniff my ___.   There was a service dog in the dining room as well, but it was well behaved and layer under the table.  But as I said, love my babies but dogs have no place in a public dining room in a hotel that LOOKS LIKE THIS ONE (FROM THE OUTSIDE).  SO, dinner is over and we walk back to our room and my eyes had been burning and we're red from the time I came in here.  We noticed I need the halls such a STRONG  odor of someth in no like cheapy air fresheners.  Plus, our floor had fans running in several places.  We get to our room, I jump in the shower and when I get out I hear these LOUD BARKING and HOWLING DOGS.  they were across the hall and on both sides of us.  My sister had a class and was NOT going to be able to sleep with that noise.  So, she tried to call downstairs. It rang over 50 times before they finally answered.  She explained and they said we should've been placed on another floor.  Yet, that wasn't our fault.  They decide where you go and they could see we DIDN'T have a Big White Dog!   They offered to move us but said that's all they could do.  I called back to say yes, we need to move if we want sleep.  She said they would do that and so kindly said there WOULDN'T BE A PENALTY CHARGED FOR MOVING.   I said oh there won't be a penalty.  We came upstairs waited for the security guard to bring our keys (he walked up and said, here. As he handed the keys. Never offered to help with our bags etc.  We come into a suite.  And OMG....DEBATED WHETHER TO LEAVE OR TRY TO BE CAREFUL AND STAY IN THE UNCLEANINESS!  YOU COULDN'T sit in the chairs at the table. They looked as if someone had not been able to make it to the restroom...or chocolate syrup had been poured on them.  The sofa had strange looking stains that resembled other bodily fluids. The carpet was filthy with sections cut out and replaces and the door to the balcony had just a raw piece of wood nailed to the bottom.  It was 10 pm by this time.  We were tired of dealing with the stuff.  My sister wanted to lrave.  I was worried about her sleep because of the class.  We decided on staying. So, we walked around with our shoes on.  I MUST COMMEND THE MANAGER ON DUTY THIS MORNING FOR SHOWING SUCH POLITENESS AND GIVING US A DISCOUNT.So A bunch of us got together and put on a CON called Imaginarium. On Sat night ball room C was rented for a party, of course the hotel came in with their ""cash bar"".Once a guy seen I and several others had our own drinks we were approached and was told that unless we bought their alcohol we had to take ours out and drink in the hallway or anywhere else but that ballroom because it was a ""liability"". All bull sh*t of course. So we, and we as in 15 of us abandoned the room to move to the hallway just outside the door and proceeded to open bar for the whole party.  Next year i'm bringing  70 bottles with me. Wow. Whats next? No sex in the rooms unless we buy the condoms, K.Y. and toys from you?Very displeased about this. We as a whole spent ALOT of money on/at your hotel. Next year i'll make sure to book a room across the street and walk over to work the convention.Not to mention I open the curtain of my room window and all there is there? A stupid wall with a drain pipe.  No view,  had there been a fire it says to break window and get on ledge? What ledge?  Trapped is what I would of been!. I will be posting this review in every place I can.I booked a room here because it was the official hotel of Lebowski Fest.  The hotel was also hosting the American Cichlid Association National Convention.In case you were wondering, a cichilid is a fish that you put in fresh water aquariums.  There were actually aquariums set up in people's rooms and they were selling fish out of them.  Strange does not even begin to describe the atmosphere.The room was okay, especially for only $89 per night.  The hotel could have been a lot cleaner.  There were crumbs all over the hallway.Or maybe that was fish food?","Really not a bad hotel.  We used Hotwire to order &amp; I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews about the dog show guests.  Prior to arrival, I did call the hotel to voice my concerns and Michael assured me that he would change our room to ensure that we were not in the same vincinity as the dog show guest.  Upon arrival, the checkin was helpful and professional.  The reasoning behind the 4-star rating is just due to the dated decor in the hotel.  The room was very clean and we slept very well.  We drank the coffee which was pretty good.  Parking was a mess, mainly because this is a large hotel.The bed was ok. The lobby is nice. The people were friendly. The price was ok. I would go back.If you like having your sleep interrupted, this is the hotel for you! We stayed there three nights, and were woken up every night. If you do have to stay here, make sure they don't put you anywhere near the elevators, as drunken morons will be sure to wake you up at 3am. That and a 2am fire alarm the cleared the hotel sealed the deal. Other than the noise, not a bad place. The rooms are fine, no bedbugs, no ghosts...I'd just avoid those elevators, maybe the whole ground floor.Needs some updating but was overall a good stay. It was on the expensive side but I believe it was because the FFA conference was in town. The hotel was very busy. The breakfast was worth the money. Would stay their again if it cost less.this hotel is clean and busy!  although the staff isn't very personable and not as friendly as other Crowne Plaza's in other states.  it's almost as if the Louisville location doesn't have enough staff to accommodate the volume of. Guest they have!     But , over all the rooms are nice and I can  rely on that!  RESTAURANT bar only had one waitress and not enough time to wait on everyone in the bar!1 mile from the airport.Cute, detailed rooms. Comfortable beds. Cush chairs. Subtle decor.Hot headboards. Spacious desk area. Plenty O space Rooms.Friendly Staff.Good stuff. One of my favorite chains, and POW BAM BOOM in one of my favorite cities.Did I mention the free wifi?Double like.Friendly staff. Even though it's located across the freeway from the airport -- which is super-convenient -- they've maintained that Louisville charm that so many of the downtown hotels have. Nice IHG Rewards Club benefits. Enjoyed the in-room 3-step #Relaxation spa amenities. I almost ranked 3-stars bc the bed linens had a weird rubbery texture and the hallways need a spruced-up makeover. Next time I'll book a later return flight so I can try their Sunday breakfast buffet. Sounded delish!Very nice hotel. This is like a 3.5 hotel close to 4. Huge king size bed. Some rooms like mines have a 47in flat screen tv. There is a nice pool and pretty nice fitness gym.It is minutes away from airport. 20 mins from train station and on a bus route.Right now they having a dog show in conference room of the hotel. Watching dogs no bigger than 6 inches high strutting around head high, walking around jumping over things for prizes. Was a funny sight to seeThe 6 flags amusement park is about 10 mins from here. A host of museums if you like history and fine arts. Not much of a night life from what I am told unless you wish to roll down in the hood. But I am sure somewhere you can find a good time. I am here for a bowling tournament so night life entertainment was not my focus. But over all this is a nice hotel to be inHotel is nice and in a good location. Customer service needs improvement.  Waited in line for check in, the lady gave me the wrong room (one that was occupied) after hauling my stuff back down to the desk, I waited in line again.  No apology, nothing.    Later that night while eating at the blue horse, I found it nearly impossible to get service.  All in all the trend was lack of customer service.Decent place! Our room was clean, the heat worked, but was scary loud when it kicked on. It reminded me of the furnace from the basement in Home Alone.Each bed came with four pillows - That's Right!! 4! And not just those stupid decorative pillows, either. I'm not even counting that one. The bathroom was nice because it had a separate sink and mirror from the toilet and shower. One thing I disliked - why is the air so dry?? Not sure that had anything to do with the hotel operations, but dang.I'd stay here again.Great convenient location. Have stayed here before. There was a gas main break on the street the hotel is on and we couldn't get to it for hours. When I finally got in, even though it wasn't their fault, they gave me a discount on the room. The only down side is the hotel bar. It closes early, even when it's packed and the manager is really rude.Five stars. Room exquisite, clean and quiet, a feat as it was Derby week. Staff oozing Southern Charm. Head Chef Paul is #1-he assisted me in the evening to locate my lost package for an event the next day. Hat shop ""Hey Lady!"" was wonderful their staff too was terrific. Best filet in memory at the Blue Horse Restaurant too. Please don't hesitate to book your next event/room at this jewel near Louisville Airport!The Crowne Plaza is a well-used hotel.  You'll find imperfections on the walls, fixtures loose in your room and noises coming from the ceiling and walls in some areas of the hotel.  The hotel itself is fairly clean, but it definitely is in need of large-scale renovations.  The staff, however, is pleasant to deal with and generally helpful.The hotel does accommodate many professional events through several of its large conference rooms and dining areas.  The indoor/outdoor pool is nice.The hotel itself is pretty typical Crowne Plaza. What I really liked about it was the customer service and staff. Very willing to please, sincerely polite, and ready to go the extra mile to make a stay special.Room was nice and clean. Bathroom was nicely kept up. Very convenient to the airport, just a few minutes away. Relatively quiet, but being this close to the airport you have to expect some noise. Wifi speed was good, and complimentary. Bartender was great albeit a little overwhelmed with little to no help. Chicken sandwich was ok, and the prices were good.Nicely decorated, loud hotel within a 5 minute shuttle ride from the airport, and located next to the Fairgrounds. This Crowne Plaza offers a) no refrigerator in room without request b) microwaves only next to some vending/ice machines c) no lock boxes in the rooms, and d) no hot tub. They boast of a shuttle anywhere ""within 3 miles"" yet even though scheduled an hour ahead to get to a yoga class, and after receiving a friendly ""see you then"", once I arrived to the lobby, another driver refused transport due to a group movement to/from the fairgrounds. The women's stretching room rug is worn and dirty. Think carefully and choose more wisely, my friends.I hate this hotel with a passion.  It feels so dark, and secluded, and just weird.  I've been here at least a dozen times and hated every moment.  The beds are comfortable, and the rooms are clean.  It just has a weird vibe that I don't like.  And it's an epic-freaking-journey to get to the higher floors (which I invariably always get put on).  Half the time my room key doesn't work and they rarely apologize when I make the Tolkien-style journey back to the front desk to get it fixed.  Oh well, there are still plenty of worse properties to stay at.Room is nice and everything's clean, but I can't help but feel it lacks a lot of amenities for a more 'upscale' hotel. No refrigerator, for example, was a bit unexpected- not to mention our rooms were ready about half an hour late. The beds are comfortable and the staff is friendly, so that's a plus.It's a good hotel for short stays, but the lack of useful amenities is disappointing, and makes it a lot less appealing to anyone looking to hole up somewhere for a while.Writing this post bright and early since the lawn clean up crew has been working for about an hour now outside my window. What's the point of putting up the sleep do not disturb sign on the door when this happens. And when I called the front desk a rude lady named Kim said...""oh is there a leaf blower outside your window?...is he waking u up?..."" DUH and they she says...""yea they have to get that done there on a schedule"" SAY WHAT! Yea they have to get it done but not in the morning! Rooms are mid level at best, food was bad last night...never again.The wife and I stayed here when moving her from Louisville to Raleigh, NC. The fact that it happened to be Derby weekend was an unfortunate coincidence.That said, it was a great stay.The bed was really comfy, and it was decent-sized bathroom. We were only there one night, so I can't really speak to cleaning service, but even booking at the last minute, the room was clean and well taken care of. Free internet - it was fairly fast and reliable, and we ended up watching a few things on Netflix without issue. Such a welcome difference from the ""higher end"" hotels that attempt to anally rape you for internet service. *coughHiltoncough*No fridge, microwave, or other amenities, but it was a great place to sleep before driving for 10 hours the next day. The kids that were running all over the place weren't actually heard in the room, so that was nice. Good experience here, and I'd recommend it for others.","Really nice rooms. The view in room 213 is a breathtaking vista of a/c units on a roof. The pool is super awesome and large. There are a bunch of conference and banquet rooms for various events. No laundry facility on site, but there is a decent laundromat about one mile away on Preston. $150 bucks a night.Decent hotel with all of the basics you'd need while traveling. The heating unit comes on with a big clank, but other than that it was fine.This hotel has the Most ridiculous customer service.i stayed there for literary 10 hrs for one night, they charged me for 2 nights, and when I called, they put me on hold for more than 10 minutes. Eventually I called from another phone and someone picked up and told me the manager was not there, I have to call again to fix the deal. When I asked for slippers during the stay, they were surprised like hotels are not supposed to have slippers for customers. There's no late check out neither.  Worst hotel experience ever, of all the hotels I been to, this one is shitty, customer service is shitty.I assume they get most of their business by being near the airport.  I don't see any other good reason to be there.  The internet was free but did not really work.  It kept dropping off and on every minute and I gave up after being frustrated for a bit.  In this day and age, if you can't offer a decent internet connection, that's just poor service / infrastructure.  I won't be staying here next time.This hotel has a lot of great things to offer. 1) location is great, easy access to highway and close to expo center 2) great pool staffed w / lifeguards! 3) good buffet especially for kids 4.95$ price! Now the disappointing things are things that make an enjoyable hotel experience! Accessible Internet access. They stated that it was free but in my room it was spotty and only could access near the door but who wants to stand at the door to use wi-fi. Another disappointing thing was the plumbing above us was super loud!!!! I thought there was a flood above us because I heard so much gushing water and very frequently!  It woke me up about 4x throughout the night and I worried that I was going to wake up in a puddle of water in my bed ;( couldn't enjoy my night due to water!!! Don't stay in room 159 this had many bad experiences especially paying $200 a night for a room:(Having the fire/smoke alarm go off while you're in the shower is not fun. A person at the front desk called as I was exiting the room and asked, ""were you taking a shower"". She then explained that the humidity was too much and set the alarm off. It took over 10 minutes for the security guard / maintenance staff to disengage the alarm. I called the front desk to ask if it would go off again, as I was going to finish showering, she said, ""it shouldn't since I re-set the alarm"".Of course, it went off again. I called the front desk and another representative answered the phone. I asked him if he was sending the same guy to repair and he said, ""if you'd like me to, yes"".This time, and actual maintenance person came to explain the issue. At the conclusion, he asked if I left the bathroom door open when I showered and I stated I did. He then asked if I would be staying another night he would fix it. I assured him, I'd never be staying at that property again. I posed a question to him: why fix it now? Apparently, this is a known issue since the front desk person knew what set the alarm off. I told the maintenance employee he might want to ""fix it"" so the next guest wouldn't have to go through the same thing.I've stayed at your property before, but this was the last stay. Having the alarm go off is one thing, but the response was not ok.It is, however, a great looking property.Here are the things I like about the Crowne Plaza Hotel:Centrally located near the freeway.Respectful and efficient staff.Even at its busiest, there is still parking.Great dining options near by.Clean and classy without being pretentious.While all I require of a hotel is little more than shelter from inclement weather and smile when I check in from the lonely night. The decor reminds me of the hotel the Ghostbusters first found slimer in during the first movie. So... yah... bad ass.The staff is super friendly and is not comprised of unhelpful parrots that only give you one of the 3 answers they are trained to when asked a question. On more than one occasion staff has thought outside the box to help me with a request. Big plus in my book. There is free wi-fi, however no refrigerator. The rooms were exceptionally clean. There is a restaurant attached, which I have reviewed separately however I will mention that if you decide to order in; walk down to it and order from the hostess and not the bar. Most of the times I have been there the bartender seems over tasked all the times I've been there and had much greater success with the hostess. Overall, this hotel comes with my recommendations.This is the site that the American Board of Radiology uses for its oral examinations...  The scent of adrenaline permeates the dark hallways palpably for those days.  Both the Executive and Executive West will be undergoing rennovations... but the kind of sprawled out layout really recalls a different era of American History.If I didn't have to go here every 10 years, I might like it more.  As it is, it's an indelible memory of hotel stress.  :)If you like hard mattresses and foam pillows this is the hotel for you, I don't.Pros: awesome beds super cold A/C nice front desk staff clean free wi-fi close to the Strike &amp; Spare bowling alley Cons: no continental breakfast $10 grilled cheese half a roll of toilet paper in our room no refrigerator$110 a nightOverall: Too expensive for what was lackingAll you need to know is this: BED BUGSI have stayed here twice in the last month.  The place is okay, not great.  There are other hotels on the same street that may be worth a shot.  I expect more from a Crowne Plaza.  Their hotel here is drab, old, and dreary.  It needs a major makeover.  The worst part about this place is the Internet.  The hotel is wireless and it is awful.  If you are able to get a connection, good luck finding any available bandwidth or being able to stay connected.  These hotels needs to beef up their internet connections!Food is no where to be found near the hotel, except in the restaurant.  I will say the hotel restaurant had excellent food!  It made the stay bearable.This hotel has been renovated and it's real nice. I know some people who have stayed here way back when and they say it's changed a lot. The room is clean with FREE wireless. So a star for that. No fridge though. The price is under a hundred bucks but the company paid for it and maybe they got a good discount. I'm not sure what the normal rates are. The parking lot is a pretty good size. They seem to have a bunch of meetings and conventions here. There were a few downstairs. I'll check out the pool and the gym tomorrow. GVERY EXPENSIVE !  for what you get, which is no more than a nice Holiday Inn.  The only advantage for me was it was right across the road to the fairgrounds for the NSRA street rod nationals .Very nice hotel, but the thing that gave this one 5 stars was the excellent service.  After a long day it was really nice to experience it.   Even though the hotel is next to the highway and airport it is extremely quiet.   WIll stay there again..First, allow me to apologize for this review. It's going to be very, very, very long. I have only been to Louisville once in my life so far, and I was traveling there in July of 2007 for the amazing and exciting Lebowskifest. If you've never heard of this Lebowskifest, then please do Google it, and get with the program, man. So, for the Lebowskifest, the festival's hotel was The Executive West. It's very close to the airport, so that's a plus. Looks like a really nice place from the outside, but without looking like a cookie-cutter, modern McChain-Hotel. This place is old school, and I hate to use that term because even though ""Yo-MTV Raps"" was a great show, the term old school has been raped by overuse. The interior decor of this building is rather attractive, even though it's dated as hell. Lots of wood paneling, old furniture, and ancient wallpaper. I think there has obviously been a few construction expansions in the history of this building because this place is huge, and it can take quite awhile to walk around inside the halls just to get to your room. There's a pool, and a gym, but you may get enough exercised just getting to and from your room. The outdoor pool area was beautiful, and it had a cool fountain/statue thingy out there, as well as a bar. I discovered one little hallway that faced the outdoor pool, and there was a long row of rocking chairs lined up so you could sit down inside the air conditioning and watch the people in the pool through large windows. Pretty neat I thought. This hotel is overpopulated with a very rare wild animal, a wild animal that once inhabited many American homes and hotels, but has since been killed off by modernists. This animal is the classic American rocking chair, complete with seat pad. Seriously, these are the best chairs known to human butt-kind, and they were everywhere. We had one in our room, and it was lovely. Staff was very friendly and efficient in their business. The room was great, cold air, comfy beds, little desk, high speed wireless, so even though it looks old school, (my sister and I kept joking that our Grandma was charged with decorating the rooms and interior of the hotel), it has modern amenities. There was also a very noticeable smell inside the hotel. Smelled like water damaged carpets to a certain extent, or mold probably. I didn't think it smelled bad, but I did notice it. I kept looking for the high water mark on the walls where the flood waters must have been some years ago, but I think the smell was a combination of old carpets and wallpapers, old furniture, and possibly an overzealous carpet shampooing schedule by the hotel staff that leaves a musty, damp tinge to the air. Whatever, it's great, it smelled like old people in there. As if my grandparents were all alive again, and sitting around smoking their Camel cigarettes. Have you ever seen, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" with Johnny Depp? If you have, just imagine the scenes of him when he's running through those old Las Vegas hotels with their kooky carpet and mirrored walls, it's a step back in time, and I felt like I was Hunter S. Thompson himself, (Louisville born and bred), stalking the long forgotten hallways of the American Classic with a can of beer, and on a quest for some pot and a good story.THE KEETHI stay at the West often. It is like a home away from home and the friendly staff makes traveling easier. It has been recently remodeled and tragically the crown molding in the rooms has been painted. There is a pool, workout room, bar and dining on property.",,,"['business', 'convention', 'months', 'back', 'location', 'perfect', 'areas', 'needed', 'real', 'reason', 'review', 'customer', 'service',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-regency-louisville-louisville,Hyatt Regency Louisville,3.5,$$$$,58,"What a beautiful hotel and fantastic staff! The bar and waterfall downstairs aren't too shabby as well! The rooms are accommodating and beautiful. Perfect for a staycation! And this hotel is near everything you could ever want to do or anywhere you could want to go while visiting downtown! Brendon's Catch 23 is next door and will blow you out of the water!!! Meta is a few blocks over along with 8Up! And you can even cross the street to hop into the Seelbach hotel to look at the beautiful chandeliers! All in all... I would stay here again!I loved my stay at the Hyatt here!! The room's have been completely remodeled and the people here are really nice. There are lots of really nice restaurants near by and I tried Sway for the first time that was really tasty. I just wish there were more elevators.Nice looking - close to shops and downtown. Rather large and inexpensive.... No fridge in room , both sides were adjoining rooms, they charge by the half hour to use the computer and or printer, pool closes early. Fix those issues and two more stars here we come.I was in Louisville for an event and the organizer reserved a block of rooms for what must have been an extra fee as the $250/night our group was charged for a room with two double beds is more than the price advertised on a couple travel websites I checked. Why would you charge more to reserve several rooms (ours weren't even grouped together or in the same floor)?This hotel is awfully stingy for the price and although the location is very convenient if you are going to a convention or to live on 4th Street, that doesn't make up for a variety of faults. For a room at this price point, I'm going to have some expectations that I might not have from a lesser priced hotel. For example, there is a parking garage connected to the hotel, but it is neither free nor is the cost reduced. The rooms do not have a mini fridge, though there is a note that one is available if you request it. The beds are doubles instead of queen beds. Nothing is free...Bottles of water in the room cost $3.50, no free breakfast for guests and if there was free WiFi, my room didn't have any instructions as to how I could access it. They did have little jugs of water with fruit floating in it (tastes like water) in the lobby with a big sign next to it that reminds you that this exclusive benefit is for hotel guests only. I ended my stay thinking, well at least I can get a free cup of coffee with the little single serve coffee maker in the corner. I added the water and put the little coffee packet in...""oh, it's not plugged in"" and then I realized the plug is so short I have to put the coffee maker on the floor to use it. Gah!Well maintained hotel, perfectly good rooms and friendly staff.   Location ideal for someone coming in from out of town to hit up fourth street parties.Only problem I experienced was the elevators.  There are 18 floors, and for some reason the elevators take a very long time to come back to the lobby.  I believe there was a convention in town, so that perhaps was slowing the elevator due to traffic.I'd stay here again. :)They have a restaurant/bar here that looked decent (if not expensive) but I did not try it.We traveled from NYC and ended up staying what we thought was a decent hotel but treated like 2nd class citizens by gossiping employees.  Advice that your family stay at other friendly hotels in town.  The room service was bad due to lack of staffing. If you like hot meals cold,  this is your kind of place.  The there was a bank robber hiding in the parking garage.  What a welcome.We arrived in Louisville at night and checked into our room at the Hyatt Regency. It's a nice King Suite on the top floor with a very comfortable bed. With the business rate, we had free wifi and buffet breakfast every morning. The restaurants buffet was incredibly delicious and southern gourmet with some healthy options as well. Each day I went down to the buffet and took it back to the room, trying the different breakfast dishes. We also ordered up a refrigerator for our room for free, to keep our beverages cold. All the comforts of home, while being on the road. The location is right in the middle of a bunch of restaurants and the convention center. On our first day in Lousville, a snow storm hit and dumped a lot of snow. While the snow falling was romantic and fun, it also blew out the power to the hotel. Although it was not their fault, we had to relocate to the Marriott for the night until it was fixed. It was a pain, but they handled the transfer smoothly for all of the guests at the same rate we paid at the Hyatt. When we came back, we were treated with champagne and appetizers. Everyone here was very nice, even after I got sick and couldn't leave my room - the housekeeping lady and room service lady offered to bring me hot tea with lemon. That was the moment that completely won me over, the hospitality.Just arrived, they gave away my room but ""did me the favor"" of booking me at a hotel down the block.  Had to walk around downtown Louisville in the middle of the night because of them.When I got checked in the next day, the manager left an apology note in the room... Addressed to someone else.  Not a big deal but shows the lack of attention to detail in the organization.The staff at the Sway bar are great, best part of the hotel.But, stay somewhere elseThe Hyatt is an amazing hotel.The location is great. It is easy to get to, it is central to downtown. You've got a short walk to the stadium, conference center, and 4th Street live.The in house bar and restaurant are both good if you are feeling lazy.A hotel room is a hotel room to me. The rooms are clean enough and nice enough.  I'm much more focused on location and price.The hotel is in a nice location walking distance to many bars and restaurants. The Sway bar and restaurant is clean food was good and the staff was very friendly. The new rooms are great nice artwork, bed and pillows were comfortable and the TV is a nice size. The staff from start to finish were helpful, pleasant and extremely professional.A very nice place to stay when visiting downtown Louisville.  Clean rooms, friendly staff and great location.  Of special note: they host college interns from all over the world and I had the opportunity to interact with several from Romania and South Africa who are pursuing degrees in hospitality management.  Nice kids!  I am guessing their presence probably indicates something about the internal ranking of this property within the Hyatt brand.Nice small Hyatt Regency.  The layout of the lobby and car is a little funky - you sit at the bar with your back to the front doors and a bit on display.Nice friendly staff.But no Regency Club or floor.  So while it is a Hyatt ""Regency"" it is missing the ""Regency"" aspect.REaaaal close to giving this place the 5 star... recently stayed here for the first time, second time here for a conference. Can't get over how friendly and accomodating the staff is at this place. Srsly everyone from the lady at the parking garage, the people at the desk, bartenders, everyone. The hotel itself is quite nice. I was so busy doing the conference, I don't even know if they have a pool ;)Very convenient how they have the hotels connected together via walkways on the second floor. That's something I think I've only ever seen in the colder/snowier places.This was our first time in Louisville and the room was very nice, clean and well stocked as most are.  However, there were no outlets on either side of our king size bed, on one side the lamp and ihome radio were not even plugged in, although the sheets were clean they were not fitted and once you layed in bed you got tangled up.  The morning buffet breakfast was ok, but not all available options were set out.  We did not know they offered pancakes, waffles or omelettes and other meals as part of the buffet.  All in all it was still a decent place to stay but a bit of a disappointment for a 4 star hotel.Great hotel.  All decked out for the PGA Championship.  Staff has on cute golf outfits and they have FABULOUS golf themed flowers all over the hotel.  I love how they are celebrating the PGA!  My associate didn't receive his luggage and had a cocktail party to attend and one of the managers loaned him one of his very nice sport coats for the evening.  His wife brought it to the hotel.  How nice is that?  Thank you Brett Ambrose and Mrs. Ambrose for going way above and beyond on that one!!  Really, who does that??  Brett needs a big promotion!!!!!!!  Kelly at Sway is very nice and personable.  The entire staff has been super nice.  I usually stay at the Galt House when in Louisville but this was a nice bright change.  Bad was my shower floor was warped and could be unsafe.  Great were the FLOWERS and the staff.I was walked here due to my other hotel being full. At 2 in the morning, the front desk was unmanned, and I had to go around the corner of the partition to get service. The service I got was awesome! I even scored a free breakfast buffet for two, a $36 value.The room was typical Hyatt. I expect the consistency they provide from property to property just as I assume a Big Mac is the same in Louisville or London. Great location in the heart of the party district of 4th street.My wife and I got a deal to stay here last weekend. It's right on 4th street, so you can walk to all the bars and restaurants. The parking is a little deceptive. You park in a garage that costs like $10 per day, which they don't tell you, and there's no validation or anything. But it is easy to get from the hotel to the garage.The hotel itself is very nice. The staff was very friendly. The room was clean and spacious. It came with an alarm clock that had an iPod dock. They have a nice pool and an outdoor rooftop tennis court, which I've never seen before.Overall, a solid hotel.Seriously convenient location if you're here to party - 1Walking distance to a LOT of really cool stuff - 1Horribly slow service for check-out...20 people waiting for 2 employees - 0Need a card to get into elevator after 11 p.m....not good for the drunk people - 0No hair dryer in hotel - 0Can hear through front door into hall during sleeping hours - 0T.V. remote sucks - 0Over-priced - 0Unhappy, grumpy employees - 0Did I say seriously convenient location? - 1This is my favorite hotel in Louisville and I am here at least 6 times a year.Clean hotel, courteous staff, good hotel gym, and a good restaurant. If you go to Louisville, KY you should stay here.I like this hotel fine, but it could use a little renovation, or at least some new carpeting. The rooms are fine, but outlet placement isn't the most convenient. Having said that, there are definitely enough of them, just awkward to get to if you want to charge your phone and not have to go across the room to retrieve it. Registered guests are given free internet access. Love that!My room smelled a bit too much of Febreze, or whatever that 'hotel smell' is. I believe they use it when someone smokes in the room previous to your own arrival...wish they'd find a less obnoxious scent, a nice citrus perhaps? :)The location is phenomenal, easy to get to from the airport and very convenient to some great restaurants and entertainment.Staff were very friendly and welcoming, answered any and all questions I had.Beds are comfortable, no problems there at all!","Great hotel.Great location.Too many bachelorette parties.Great food options all around.Comfy beds, amazing interior!I would have rated it higher if these issues didn't exist.1. Mini fridge to keep my drinking water cold.2. Hair dryer (instead of contacting the front desk). Aren't hair dryers a standard in rooms? I know at other Hyatts they are available in the bathroom.3. More outlets in the room. Having plugs in the lamps to charge your phone. Especially when you are relying on your phone as an alarm and want it plugged in all night.4. IHome clock radio has a dock, but doesn't work w iphone 5. The port is different. And couldn't set the alarm in the clock for some reason.5. The walls seemed to be paper thin! I could hear the person in the room next to mine peeing, talking on his phone, and taking his 30-min shower. It was ridiculous.Also, there was another conference and all the floors are visible from the 1st floor. Kind of like an atrium. The bad thing about this design is that every single sound resonates throughout and it was like people were talking right outside my door. Having to attend a conference in another hotel at 8am every morning made it difficult for me to get a good night's sleep. Plus, the paper-thin walls and hearing someone on their phone until 2am didn't help either.Overall, the inside of the hotel is very nice. It can be a bit dizzying looking down to the lobby from the high floors. The room was decent. The bed was comfortable.I had a great view of the Aegon Center. The hotel is right across from 4th Street Live and near the river so you can just walk around and do some sightseeing.All in all, I probably wouldn't stay here again. Mainly because of the thin walls and lack of sleeI love the Hyatt chain in general but this particular hotel needs a little buff up on service. My room was okish. Older tile surfaces and wall treatments. The maid service was a little below standards. I stayed 4 nights, no dusting happened next to my bed, and my sheet would not stay tucked under the mattress. Woke up every night in a sheet twist. Old rough towels in the room. First day,  door hanger for breakfast was present, next 3 days I had to tape a piece of paper to my door from the bedside with my breakfast order. If you get a room on the 4th St. side, it's gonna be loud. Tip of the day... if you park your car, don't go to the obvious driveway front of the hotel, go to the back behind the hotel. No sign to tell you this, so good luck. Otherwise friendly service at the bar, and front desk staff.A fairly unremarkable hotel.  The room was pretty much average.  No in-room safe, mini-bar or fridge.  Sealy mattress was comfortable, furnishings nothing remarkable... generic cabinets, etc.  The internet connection was abysmal.  The hotel doesn't have nearly enough bandwidth, and in early mornings and evenings it's like using a dial-up internet connection of 20 years ago.  There's also a shortage of elevators.  There are 3 to service a large high-rise.  During AM (corresponding to most people's checkout time), on three successive days to get an elevator took on average of 10 minutes.  And then the elevator stopped on virtually every floor, with people waiting to - and unable to - get on to the elevators. This is NOT a 4-star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.I wish I had known there was some religious children singing group in the hotel before I booked. They sing the national anthem at 11 pm every night.  I get that every group needs needs their outlet but I would like the option to opt out if possible. Maybe it's because of the people but the ice machine is empty. Probably because all the adults in this group are hoarding  the ice for their cooler. Also, the people at the front desk gave us this typed note from the manager reading that this group was here and how you would be hard pressed for hot water in the morning and the elevators would be jammed up. Basically it said it sucked to be you unless you were part of this group because we are catering to them and only them.    We come to louisville at least once a year because my husband is from here. Needless to say we won't be back. You have to call from the front desk for everything and they have an attitude. Just stay somewhere else and I promise you'll be happier.This is like my home when in Louisville.  I love the room service, food is ALWAYS excellent. Housekeeping is very thoughtful--they seem to arrange my make up brushes in ways I would never think to, and it's always nice to be welcomed to this cleanness when returning from a long day out.The Hyatt is always accommodating with early check in.  I like the convenience of the bag check up front, and you can also check out umbrellas and highlight markers at the front desk as well.  Eisteen bro bagels is in the building, as well as the gift store which has a decent selection of items for a hotel gift store.The hot tub and pool are on the fourth floor and is always a treat--except for my last visit in which it was being painted and was not open.What really irritates me about this place is the business center.  Apparently we are being charged to use the computers now.  So you have to swipe your credit card in order to use the computers.  It's like $5 for 30 minutes of use, even if you just want to use the printer.  I find this ridiculous, especially when you can go to lower level hotels and use computers and printers for free.  Yuck.Nevertheless, this is my one and only gripe about the Hyatt.  I just steer clear of the business cubicle and pretend it does not exist, and I'm fine.Celebrity Sightings--Tommy Lee                              Eddie MoneyThe Sway Restaurant wasn't staffed greatly. (I was there for a conference.) The waitress was overwhelmed and was probably just as frustrated as we were.Place is clean, rooms are nice but the front desk leaves something to be desired, the valet service was slow checking in as well.I had booked a room with two queens but the changed it to a king which was a problem because I was travelling with another couple and we aren't doing the 3 to a bed thing.  After arguing with the clerk a manager finally came over and solved the problem by giving us two rooms for price of one...but that was after being rudely interrupted several times by desk clerk and basically told that I was screwed and I'd have to live with it.Top notch service.  If you're in a pinch, Priceline bidding can usually yield a room here for only $50.  Parking is $10, with cheaper on the streets if you're really watching your wallet.Room was nicely turned out, with a deep blue and off white color scheme and spotless clean.  We were well treated and will return if in the area.  I highly recommend it  - and if you do Priceline bidding, know you can get an incredible steal!!Great location. Valet parking. Comfy beds. Friendly &amp; accommodating staff. Thank you for a great weekend!I booked this hotel on a whim for the Derby Marathon, price was good and location was great.The room was nice, king size bed, bathroom etc.However the noise outside the door in the central area carried up and was noticeable in the room. The adjoining room doors seemed like they were made of paper and the walls of cardboard, I could hear the conversations in each room.The tv was not in a favorable watching place, and many channels did not work.The internet was provided free of charge from the front desk otherwise they will charge you.I would not be staying there again due to the noise.I found myself kind of annoyed while here and feeling a bit pickpocketed.  This is why.Upon arrival, I had to pay additional $$ for parking.  I would have preferred to have known that in advance. In the room, I did not care for the the dim lighting and low quality toiletries.  Instead of finding two drinking glasses in the room, there was instead bottled water that upon use, is charged to your bill.   Can Hyatt spare an extra towel in the bathroom?  How bout an extra coffee pod?  Hotels used to let you brew your own pot of coffee, now its brew your own cup and only a cup.  Geesh.More importantly, who ever heard of AN UPSCALE HOTEL WITHOUT FREE CABLE OR FREE NETWORK TV?  Even cheap motels have, are you ready, color television and cable.  Can't read a book in the room cuz the lights are too dim.  If I wasn't out enjoying the city life of Louisville and had to spend more time in this barren room, I'd have been pretty pissed.  But alas, I only had to sleep there and laughed it off vowing to never return.I was in town for a convention and stayed here for one night. The location is perfect, adjacent to the convention center, 4th Street Live just down the block and a few blocks from the Yum Center. Lobby is nice and open, room was clean and service was excellent. I had booked a king but received a double, not a problem for me but they were very apologetic and gave me a voucher for free breakfast. Overall my stay was great!  If I ever have to stay in downtown Louisville again this will be my first choice.We stayed for two nights over the weekend as part of a wedding block of more than 20 rooms, and it was a constant string of disappointments.  First, we arrived more than an hour past check-in, and the rooms weren't ready yet -- not ours (the maid of honor), not the bride's parents' room, not even the bridal suite was ready!  When a party books more than 20 rooms months in advance, there is absolutely no excuse to not have those rooms ready by nearly 4:30 p.m.Next, I had to print a simple 8 page, black and white document.  I was directed to the business center, and at $6 for the first 15 minutes and 70 cents per page, it was going to cost me $12 to print an 8 page document.  Not very accommodating.When I got back to the room and tried to take a shower, the drain was backed up, so I had to stand in four inches of other peoples' filth while I was trying to clean myself.  Another disappointment.Finally, it took us 20 minutes to check out because there was a line in front of us all complaining about their poor experience (none of whom was part of our party).The room was fairly nice (as you would expect from any Hyatt Regency), and the location is great, but for $200/night I expect much, much better.Ehhhh....A perfectly serviceable hotel in an ideal location for those looking to sightsee.  Besides that, ehhhh....The Hyatt seems to have one foot stuck in the old school, and one stuck in the present.  Example: why does any hotel in a vibrant downtown area need a restaurant (let alone two!)?  Every time I went past they were either nearly or completely empty.  During breakfast, there was more of a crowd in the adjoining Einstein Bagels.  You have to figure that part of your hotel charge is going towards keeping those relics of hospitality alive.  Least they could do is shut them down and have wifi included in the rooms.  It's a $10 charge btw, but free in the lobby.Our room, and the hotel in general, seemed a bit dated.  There was nothing BAD.... just felt dated.The pool was refreshing.  I've been to so many hotels that have indoor pools that are more like hot tubs.  The water is warm and feels more like a soak in a community bathtub rather than a swim.  I was glad that the Hyatt was a bit different.  The water was nice and cool.... which was a perfect remedy after a full day of sightseeing in sweltering Louisville.For the advertised rate (full disclosure: which I didn't pay.  We booked our stay as part of a package.), I expected more.  But again, there was nothing lacking.... this hotel is just due a facelift.  But man.... the location is perfect.  Right in the Museum Row area, literally across the street from 4th Street, and a five minute drive from the Bardstown Rd neighborhood. Recommend.Do not stay here. Horrible service, and grossly unorganized. They do not honor their event contracts, and sway you to downgrade your rooms without offering compensation.  Much better options around town for your friends, family, and events in downtown Louisville.Was here for a trade show.  Staff was very nice and friendly.  Giant open atrium style. Similar to embassy suites.  Easy to get vertigo.  Tons o food choices across the street.  Eats b good.Would have 4 or maybe 5 stars but any hotel that doesn't provide a coffe maker or free bottled water in my room doesn't rate.Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel has a $15 dollar special per nite which covers Internet, parking and breakfast. I chose that option. The Internet in my room was very fast, pleasant surprise and made paying for wifi bearable.Food and drink prices are $$$$ at this hotel, I recommend closer restaurants and bars on 4th Street Live.Visited this hotel for a conference, and they were ill prepared. Front desk staff was rude and unhelpful. Facilities were adequate but not impressive. Ridiculous charges for in-room internet access. Good location if you're looking to pick up 50 year old women drunk on box wine who think Front Street Live is cool.Other than location-wise this hotel sucks. No food from 11pm to 5 pm unless its breakfast on the weekend. The restaurant, Sway, is horrendous. An hour to get the food and it was not busy. The food was VERY salty and too much pepper on EVERYTHING. I saw multiple others returning food. Compared to the standard mid-high end hotel service I am used to, this hotel is way below par.","I was attending an event at the adjacent convention center and the location could not have been better for me.  It's the closest of any hotel and connected by the LouieWalk skyway.  On the down side, on Friday and Saturday nights in summer bands perform at 4th Street Live and the music goes until about midnight --it makes it a little tough to sleep unless you have earplugs. The bed was very comfortable--nicely appointed, and the desk provided a good workspace.  They have iHome alarm clocks so you can charge and play your iPod/iPhone if you need to. The bathtub and sink could use a little renovation.  There were visible cracks, but there was plenty of hot water and is wasn't really a problem. I ordered room service twice during my stay, and both times it was delivered by Inigo who was ridiculously polite and helpful. The food was quite good and a welcome treat after a long day out.  Every person I came in contact with at this hotel was warm and helpful.  They really make customer service a priority.   They were really busy when I was there with several large groups, but the hotel didn't feel crowded and over-extended. The housekeeper accidentally broke my AC adaptor for my laptop while I was out for the day, and by the time I returned to my room --before I even noticed anything was wrong --the front desk had sent someone to the Apple Store to buy me a brand new AC adaptor--nicer than the old one I had. I was shocked by this INCREDIBLE customer service.  Talk about going above and beyond.  I've never had customer service like that. As a female traveling alone and never having been to Kentucky before, I felt very safe here and highly recommend the Hyatt Louisville.  I hope to stay here again.Stayed here while in town visiting friends, scoping out a long-distance hiking trip (American Discovery Trail), caving in KY and seeing Widespread Panic at the Palace. Warning, this place fills up fast when a convention is in town. It is conveniently located on 4th street. Not really much stands out. I like Einstein Bagels, in the lobby, so that helps.Went to check the car into valet and they said we needed to hide all beverages??? All beverages was in our bags and all others in a plastic bag and in paper bags.. Crazy ass Kentucky laws... We ended up not even checking into Louisville and left for Chicago... Corrupt lawmakers!!!!I hotwired this place recently for a quick overnight trip to help my friend find a place to live (she's moving to Louisville, lucky bitch). The room was clean and had been updated, so the sheets were nice, as were the toiletries. You can tell it had some older fixtures (like the tub), but they did a good job modernizing the rooms. In terms of size, it was definitely spacious for two people. The lobby, even though it's at the bottom of the atrium, still felt dark. The staff was pleasant. There was an Einstein's Bagels, which I thought seemed a little odd, but I guess it's okay for business travelers on-the-go.My favourite of all the hotels we stayed at on our road trip.  This Hyatt was big, comfortable, and the room we were given had a pretty cool view of 4th street.  The bathroom was well appointed and luxurious.  Really enjoyed the fact there was an Einstein Bagel shop in the lobby, which made getting hot coffee early in the morning a snap.  The fitness room was pretty great, a bunch of machines (treadmill, elliptical, bikes), weights and weight machines.  The room itself was nicely decorated with comfortable beds.  My two gripes would be the fact that we were given a room with double beds. When I requested a king room the girl at the desk said ""Oh we don't have any available."" The hotel appeared to be only about half full so that statement grated on me a bit.  The other was the supposed internet access through the TV in the room.  It never worked.  It was $10 for that, but to be fair, they did remove the charge when I explained the problems.All in all, its no Brown Hotel, but I would stay here again.Visited this hotel and conference area with my husband on a business trip. His company had a booth at a conference here and I wandered around the hotel and went to a local mall to shop.Very nice facilities. I used the Internet/computer area reserved for guests, which was nice. Although we weren't staying there, I saw one of the rooms that my husband's coworker was staying in and it was comfortable, stylish and clean. It's convenient to several restaurants and bars. Almost looks like a mini-Vegas in this area of town! We chose the Hard Rock Cafe but there are other options.Great location but nothing special.You have to pay for Internet, you have to pay extra to get in and out of the garage, no free breakfast. If you are going to charge more for your hotel, you have to give something back in terms of perceived value, even if it's sticking a serve yourself coffee area in the lobby. It does have fast elevators, but things are a bit worn around the edges. The pool is one of those things. The water was cold, there was no hot tub or showers in the bathrooms, the door to the outside was not closed and it was low 30s outside. The tiling and room itself were old and in need of updating. Double beds look like they are made for hobbits. You kind of get the idea that someone from the airline industry decided to do what they do to air passengers but in a hotel setting. The difference being I have way more choice in choosing a hotel and won't be choosing this one any time in the near future.Valets - 4 stars (cute and helpful) Front desk staff - 3 stars (some great, some okay) Elevators - 3 stars (fast and kind of cool) Pool - 3 stars (nicer than average and a way cool whirlpool with seats) Rooms - 4 stars (great toiletries, well appointed even though our view sucked and BIG televisions with flat screens) So, 3 stars over all with a bit more for the cheap <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotwire.com&amp;s=a2f79f2cdab1c74528a1118e4784e2d0adb267d9b7d724950a2e223f2d97e199"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotwire.com</a> rate (woo-hoo!).Nice place. Nice staff. Didn't have a reservation but they accommodated nicely and set me up with a nice room with a nice view that had a nice bed with some nice pillows.Many ""earthy"" tones abound. Soothing. Thanks.Thank god for the $77 Hotwire rate as this hotel is no better than a Hampton Inn or Fairfield. For a 4 star, room service was over at midnight as was the bar. Our room was underwhelming with a broken closet door that was off track. Portico bath products were too perfumey for most guests. The only saving face was our check in experience as the front desk clerk was nice and prompt when we arrived at 1amConsistent with the rest of the Hyatt's that I've stayed at. The heat/hot water was better than some of the other hotels i've stayed at. I'd come back here again if I had business in Louisville in the future.This is OK for a downtown hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the room was big enough for two. It's proximity to downtown Louisville attractions, especially 4th street live, is it's best feature. Honestly, I've had nicer rooms, more amenities and free parking at suburban Holiday Inn Expresses, but of course they don;t have that downtown buzz. You can get some really good rates on hotwire.Excellent customer service from all staff levels: Jean at the bar, the front desk staff, the housekeepers, and the bellmen. Only issue was the thin walls.I just attended a conference here, and everything went very smoothly. The staff were friendly and attentive, even when we arrived to check in at almost 4 in the morning. The hotel has obviously been remodeled recently because despite the rather dated and generic exterior, the interior and the rooms are surprisingly fresh and modern. Our room was extremely aesthetically pleasing, with simple lines, neutral colors, and solid dark wood furniture with granite countertops. The beds were the best - squishy and comfortable with ample pillows - too many pillows, about which I will never complain. I usually have to call down for more. The beds were dressed with soft down comforters with classic crisp white duvet covers and sheets. I loved the bed the moment I saw it and slept like a baby for my three nights there.At around $100 a night from Travelocity, this is a dang good deal. The rooms are nicely appointed, comfy beds - not spectacular but very nice.  They have little iPod docking stations that I loved! The tv sort of sucks - no HBO so why even have the TV? I mean, I missed ""Game of Thrones"" but . . water pressure is good and the facility itself is quite comfortable with an indoor pool on the 4th floor, a restaurant that is open until midnight and a handy little 24 hour gym.  You can't really get a better deal . . I paid just $20 less to stay in a La Quinta on the outskirts of town with no where near the services or perks.Great location, great service, clean &amp; modern accommodations, and a great price - I booked a room on a Saturday night in November on Priceline for only $65! There's a parking garage on site with reasonable rates, 4th Street Live is next door and it's in walking distance of downtown attractions. The best thing about our stay was the down pillows and blankets - a phenomenal night's rest! We also had a few drinks in the hotel's lounge, which was cozy and nice. I would definitely stay at the Hyatt Regency again, whether I was in Louisville for work or fun.My husband and I stayed here the night and night after we got married, and I am happy to say that those at the Hyatt Regency treated us very nicely! When they saw me walk up to the front desk in my wedding dress, they immediately upgraded our room and gave us breakfast vouchers - for free! This was especially nice considering I reserved our two night stay via <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> - totaling to only $79 a night! The wait-staff at their restaurant were a delight and my husband and I had a long conversation with the chef about up upcoming honeymoon in culinary Las Vegas. The hotel also has boundless conference rooms and a few nice art shops. The Hyatt makes Louisville look good - real good.Stay at the Hyatt Regency if: You are visiting Louisville for any reason; you live in Louisville and want a nice break from the monotony (or just want a nice view of the city from the 40th floor); you want to visit 4th street Live and need a place afterward to crash (the Hyatt is next door to the entertainment block); you are on business in Louisville and need a nice place to stay! This place is also probably child friendly and accommodating. Don't stay at the Hyatt Regency if: you don't like nice-ness!The very best thing about this hotel is....the EXCELLENT staff, the fitness center, and the pool area.   These three things are what got 4 rather than 3 stars.   I personally had issues with the lack of attention from the housekeeping staff from a dirty tub to dusty furniture and will soon write a letter to the hotel manager.  If you are reading this hopefully these issues will be resolved and your stay will be better than mine.  Excellent location, and enjoyed breakfast at their revolving restaurant overlooking the river and the downtown area.   Their meeting facilities are excellent as well.   Please note that this is an atrium style hotel so you might get some echo noise in your room during busy times...also during busy times there will be a longer wait for the elevators.   Night one wasn't as restful due to the blower for the heater which is directly above the bed.  Night two I asked for an extra blanket and turned the heater off.   The pool area was gorgeous...yet cold....it would be nice if they checked the temperature to ensure that it is warm enough in there.   I was so cold that I was not able to relax on the chairs after my swim.  Also extending the pool hours to 11 PM would be great for those who dine out...gives us time to get back to the hotel and sit in the whirlpool a bit.   Since it closes at 10 there just wasn't enough time.  One of the very best fitness center I have ever seen at a hotel.  Truly... one of the very best group of employees at a hotel....VERY attentive and kind.",,,"['beautiful', 'hotel', 'fantastic', 'staff', 'bar', 'waterfall', 'downstairs', 'shabby', 'well', 'rooms',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/louisville-marriott-downtown-louisville,Louisville Marriott Downtown,4.0,$$$,55,"Very nice hotel, located in downtown Louisville (aka Looavul, Luhvul, Looeyville, Looaville, Lou-e-ville)!Location:  The hotel is convenient to 4th Street Live, across the street from the Louisville International Convention Center (hotel connects to the Convention Center through a skywalk) and a few blocks from the Louisville Slugger Museum &amp; Factory, KFC Yum!  Center (home of the UL Cardinals and @ 20k+ seat concert venue), Muhammad Ali Center, Kentucky Center for Performing Arts (3 theaters: 2,400, 600+ and 139),  Louisville Palace Theater and Louisville Waterfront Park.First Impression:  they provide Valet parking in the front of the hotel on E. Jefferson and guest underground parking garage located around the corner on W. Liberty St.  The lobby is usually decorated nicely, especially festive for the holidays w/ plenty of seating (3 seperate areas with couches and chairs).The front desk/concierge is located to the left and usually has 2-3 staff for check-in (+ check-in kiosk for elite Marriott members).  I've stayed at this hotel 5 times and have never waited long.Rooms: very clean, modern and comfortable.  All rooms have large comfortable beds (either 2 double or king), flat screen TV's, refrigerators, medium-sized closet, desk and chair w/ ottoman.  The views are ok, I suggest staying above the 15th floor to get better views.  Note:  the 16th floor has the concierge room, which provides breakfast (starts at 6am).Ameneties:  Fitness Center, Business Center, Indoor Pool/Hot Tub, Indoor Parking Garage and Onsite StarbucksFood/Drinks:  there are 2 restaurants in the lobby of the hotel:  Blu Italian Grille and Champions Sports Bar and Grill, Bourbon Bar and Starbucks (next to the front desk).  They also have a small store that has snacks, drinks, toiletries, medications and gifts.I ate at Blu Italian Grille twice and both meals were good (I had the Filet w/ side of Crab Mac &amp; Cheese and Salmon), but fairly pricey.  I have also had a quick snack and dessert in Champions, which is a Sports Bar with pretty good casual bar food and drinks with plenty of TV's to watch the games.  Good place for larger groups.Final thoughts:  the Downtown Louisville Marriott is a very clean, comfortable, convenient hotel for anyone that wants to stay in downtown Louisville.  I like that if you are weary from your travels and want to stay in the hotel, you have good food choices, a gym, business center and indoor pool.  If you want to venture out, there are plenty of restaurant and venue choices in all directions.Skip the other local ""historic"" choices, this Marriott is the place to stay in Louisville- Safe travels!Justin Johnson, the front desk receptionist ensured that our stay here was beyond great. Upon learning of our stay we remembered us for our duration (four nights) and every time our paths crossed he made sure we felt welcome.  His willingness to go above and beyond his duties is one warranted for myself to recommend a stay at this Marriott and return in the future. He is knowledgeable of the area and gives great recommendations for any type of entertainment, food, etc that you may be looking for in the area.I called the same day we checked in and the rate was residual its. However they do a military rate which have us $100 off! Phew we will take that for sure! The hotel is actually very pretty inside. The staff was very friendly. It has champions sports grill and bar, and also a bourbon bar if you are just looking to have a night cap. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Overall our stay was great. We only laid out head down and were not here for more than 8 hours but it was at least a comfortable 8hrs. If we come back to Louisville and stay over again I will def be coming back here.Our school stayed at the Marriott for one night.  All of our rooms were clean and tidy.  The beds were absolutely comfortable.  We all really enjoyed our stay.  All of the staff were extremely polite and helpful.  When we come back to Louisville for the state convention next year, we will absolutely stay at the Marriott again!Christmas brunch was over all good waffles roast beef and coffee was excellent i had some attitude problems with one of the managers over my service dog Kiki but they took half off my bill so I am happyI was so not pleased at all with this so called ""4star"" hotel. The bedding felt like shower curtains, u had to pay $27 for parking (which they dont tell u when u make reservations) and good luck trying to get out of there parking garage there exit signs r not helpful, took us 30 minutes to even find our way out with the help of someone. The maid knocked twice told her to hang on, she still walks in my room even after telling her. No complimentary breakfast. Atleast at motel 6 you get that. I would of rather of stayed at one of them. I will not ever stay at a Marriott hotel again.Great hotel very clean and well maintained staff is very attentive. Walking distance to most anything downtownI haven't stayed in this hotel yet, so I can't speak on that, but I did go to a conference here and I can say that i was absolutely blown away. It was possibly the best food, most prompt and pleasant service, and constant attention I've ever received at any hotel or conference.  I'm sure it came with a price but at every turn there was someone waiting with water, fruits, treats, and you wanted for nothing during breakfast and lunch spread. At one point there was chocolate dipped strawberries, an ice cream bar, and a whole tray of full candies to choose from. My only semi-complaint was that the bathrooms were a bit far away from our conference rooms. It's a semi-complaint because with all that eating, it was probably for the best. To top it off, the location is superb - if I was an out-of-towner I would have loved being downtown during the evenings!My husband and I stayed at the Marriott in Downtown Louisville for a conference, leaving just today. Seven days of conference and other meetings and I have to say that this hotel has the most attentive and kind staff I've seen ANYWHERE! Staff were stationed in the lobby always checking to see if there was anything they could do to make our stay better.One gentleman whose name is Bill, seemed ever present. Last night at our banquet he and two other staff members were basically at attention as they watched and waited and on cue removed tables from the stage so we might honor our newly board certified chaplains.  He cued the waitstaff and kept the evening running smoothly. He became the staff member I went to with any need, partly because he was ALWAYS there when we needed assistance. Bill was who I went to when a colleague's hand was injured. Was the hotel perfect? No, but darn close! Bill, Cory and Eamon were the gentlemen whose names I remember: gracious, kind and engaging, always asking if there was anything we needed. The housekeepers were amazing and our server in Champions was both professional and engaging. I forget her name, but I remember her as the mom who took her daughter to see Taylor Swift the night before!Marriott Downtown Louisville has a formula for success that works! I recommend it highly, and even though its prices are above my regular budget, I might just save my pennies and return. I've been to enough conferences at enough hotels to know that this one is truly exceptional!Never have I had a worse experience with a hotel. Especially one that is supposed to be upscale.I stayed in the Marriott Downtown for 2 nights for a Bachelor Party weekend, and after arriving home an hour after checking out, I unpacked my bag only to realize that I had left my brand new, tailored white dress shirt hanging up in the room. No problem, I thought. I immediately called them, talked to a customer representative, and was assured that the dress shirt would ""show up after the maid cleaned the room"" and they would call me. Okay. I believed them. I called the next day -- nothing. I waited a few days, called again, and nope. Now it has been a month and 5 or so phone calls, and it looks like either a maid stole the shirt, or they lost it. My nicest, $150 dress shirt down the drain. I would expect this kind of service from a cheap Motel, but not a hotel of this price. Ridiculous.I'm a regular Marriott user, but this was the worst Marriott experience I've had to date. I arrived at 10pm after a long day of travel to find out they had oversold the hotel and they would be moving me to the Hyatt next door. Ok, so much for reserving 4 months in advance! Well my room at the Hyatt was a welcome upgrade and the walk to the Marriott where all my meetings were being held wasn't bad. In fact, the Hyatt room had been newly reconstructed and was a welcome place to sleep. That evening I was locked out of my room at the Hyatt and informed I had to go back to the Marriott because the Hyatt was sold out. So I packed up to spend my 2nd night at the Marriott. Disappointing room! OMG the comforter felt like it was made of plastic and linen. Glad I'm not sleeping in that room again. And the room was tired and in need of an upgrade.When the power went out in our hotel nearby, we were relocated to the Marriott. It was actually really easy to get to and checking in was very easy. The hotel is very nice and modern. The lobby with the decorations for the Holiday season were just beautiful and festive.We were given a nice King Suite at the same rate as the other hotel for the night. We liked the room and considered staying at the Marriott instead, but we ended up just staying for the night. They were very accommodating to all of the guests that needed to be relocated.Pretty hotel and good location. It's pricey as are all the downtown hotels,  but really nice if you want to go out to eat or to a show. The indoor pool is a nice plus if you want to take a dip. The beds were not as comfortable as I would have liked and I'm usually pretty easy to please. We were only there for one night so didn't spend much time in the hotel. We were a bit disappointed in the morning to find a long wait for brunch at the restaurant, even though there were a lot of open tables and there was a brunch buffet- we ended up going somewhere else.This hotel is your average Midwestern downtown Marriott...clean, courteous staff, and comfortable. Though we stayed on a Saturday night, the hotel was a ghost-town as was the rest of the neighborhood.  The bar had last call at 11:30.  Worse, the Starbucks in the hotel, the only place to get a decent cup of coffee in the area, wasn't opening until 9:30 am.  Because of this I'll never stay at this hotel again....not sure if I'll ever stay downtown in Louisville again!Recently stayed here while in town for a concert.  The location is outstanding if you don't need to leave the downtown area, everything is pretty much within walking distance.  The staff is very friendly and always ask if they can assist you with anything.I saw/heard some live music on my way out of the lobby this morning, I think they had a jazz quartet for Sunday brunch...nice.  They could stand to upgrade the towels and toiletries, but those are the only changes I'd recommend.Clean, nice, friendly. Short walk to restaurants &amp; bars. Stay here for an RV convention and they are very attentive to customers.It'll get the job done, especially if you're traveling for business.Although I didn't spend too much time at the hotel other than to change clothes and go (and lay my head for a few), I was satisfied with my stay.The lobby is grand and was beautifully decorated in spirit of the holiday season when I visited. There is a restaurant within as well as a sports bar adjacent. At the time I arrived, the restaurant was not yet open for dinner (although the lounge and bar area was) so I had to pop on over to the sports bar for a quick bite. The rooms were pretty traditional with few bells and whistles, but most importantly it was clean and comfortable. There is also a Starbuck's within the property, so no need to hunt that down if you're a 'bucks fiend. You can just head downstairs and grab it on your way out. Not the sexiest hotel out there by any means, but definitely a solid choice.Everything was great especially the staff. There are more unique places to stay downtown such as The Brown but the Marriott is very reliable. Since its not unique it would be nice if WiFi was free to have some kind of perk for staying at a run of the mill place.I am a Marriott fan, but this was a good one.  We were there for a convention and the banquet meals were much better than the usual rubber chicken.  Not only did they have a local flavor, they had good size portions and nicely sauced.The hotel itself has a great bourbon bar off the lobby and I much preferred that to going into Characters for a drink.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the bourbons and they offer the option of flights for tasting.The Marriott staff was the usual over-the-top friendly, the rooms nice, clean and comfortable and the maids had fun turning the towels into animals and shapes both when the room was made up and again at the turn-down service.First of all, it's a Marriott.  As far as Marriotts go, it is a nice one.  Clean, updated rooms.  Good, friendly service.  Stayed in the one-room suite.  Nice EXCEPT for the fact there are no plugs at the desk for devices.THE FOOD IS TERRIFIC!","Very well run hotel.  Accommodating staff throughout.  Comfortable, clean and quiet rooms. Champion Sports Bar serves excellent food.  I'd certainly come back.Beautiful hotel and awesome costumer service. They have a nice pool/jacuzzi area next to a fitness center where my husband and I worked out. The workout room was small but convient. I loved eating breakfast at the Blu restaurant in the lobby, very delicious food. I would stay here again if I'm ever in the area.I was given a room for a business trip. Very nice hotel as you would expect from Marriott. Accommodating staff. Luxurious rooms and amenities. I wouldn't normally stay in this hotel as I seek out less pricey hotels but a great choice for those willing to pay. Parking is $27 per day so be sure to consider that when booking as well. No complaints for a free stay.We stayed here while we were in town for my brother-in-law's funeral. We were originally booked at another hotel, but a friend offered up her rewards points for us to stay at the Marriott. The room was nice, not what I would have expected for an upscale hotel, but no complaints, except that the wifi is $9.95 a day. I have never heard of a hotel charging for wifi. However, we were presented with a bill on our last day for the room and parking. We never parked in the Marriott garage, yet were charged $27/day for parking. We had been assured by Marriott several times that the room was covered under our friend's rewards points. We have called and talked to several people at Marriott (hotel and corporate) and they will not remove the charges from my card. Instead of paying $250 for the hotel I had originally booked, I now have to pay almost $600 for the room and parking fees that we didn't even incur. We confirmed with them several times before we checked in that the room was covered under the rewards points. I will never stay at this or any Marriott again. You can stay at a hotel that's equally as nice for a lot less, plus you won't have to pay for parking or wifi.Very comfortable hotel. Comfortable bed, adequate bathroom, good location. All of my needs were met while I was here.Looking forward, I think that this hotel will need some updating in the next 3-5 years to stay current. However, it will be well poised as a great downtown location because of great staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds, and a great location.If you've seen one Marriott, you've seen them all . . .and I mean that in a good way!  With the Marriott chain being my preferred hotel chain- I have stayed at them all over the world and they consistently provide me with a functional. clean space during my stay.  And that is pretty much the minimum for me!On this visit- I was here for all of about 10 hours- just long enough to sleep, make my presentation and head out.Located downtown- this Marriott has a large welcoming lobby area and friendly front desk staff (even after 11pm which I appreciated as I had had a horrendous time just getting here!).  In fact, everyone was friendly here as they directed me around and made sure I had whatever it looked like I needed!  They were out of my standard king bed so I ended up with two doubles but at this point I really didn't care.  The room was clean, the bed was soft and I slept well.  There is free in room coffee although you will be charged for Internet access (which drives me nuts as it is free in their lower end properties like Courtyard)The meeting rooms at this hotel are quite nice.  Large with a nice reception hall on the side to host your pre function gathering or to lay out breakfast as was the case on my visit.  And the bathrooms are perfectly located right across the hall from the ballroom . . .not down the hall and around a bend as is the case in many hotels.My final view of the graciousness of this hotel came from the bellman as he worked to find me a cab to the airport.  ""Thanks for visiting"", said he.Now that just put a smile on my face!I was in town for a conference with a fellow co-worker last weekend. The stay was fine, decent room and location. The problem came with billing. I had pre-paid two rooms (one for me and one for my co-worker). The person at the front desk said he needed a credit card for incidentals only (because the room was prepaid). I asked him to verify the credit card I used to prepay and he did correctly. Come to find out, he charged my co-workers card for his room- not the credit card I had used to pre-pay. I have tried calling several times over several days to get this rectified. I am always transferred to accounting where I have been instructed to leave a message because they never can take my phone call. I have left messages and have called the hotel multiple times to no avail. Now, my co-worker over drafted his account and has fees associated with Marriott's mistake. Have stayed in a lot of different hotels for work and have never had a problem. We will not be staying here again.Valet damaged my car but didn't say anything. The hotel tried to check me out two days early even though my confirmation clearly stated the correct check out date. The workout room is extremely dirty. My room had food crumbs on the floor when I checked in. So far, no bedbugs at least.Just a note, I was not compensated for the damage to the car, I was still charged the full valet price!Very nice hotel. I am a fan of Marriott. The lobby looks like it is new. The location could not have been better. You can walk to 30 difference places to eat. Louisville is such a fun town. So i say stay here. You will not be disappointed. Marriott will take care of youA wonderful Marriott Hotel, pretty typical for the most part. They did a good job hosting our conference, with plenty of comfortable rooms to work in. Walls could be a bit thicker between rooms.What I loved best about the Marriott however are:- Loud music in the lobby. Walking off the somewhat boring, wide street into the hotel was like walking into a nightclub by the beach. Loud (but not too loud) dance music, trendy interior, friendly welcome. Cheered me up after a long trip!- SWANS. OMG SWANS. My towels were folded like SWANS in my hotel room *squeeeee* Love. Love. Love. (See photo)Now how can you go wrong with a hotel where your towels are folded into swans?I travel all over the world and this is one of nicest hotels that I've ever stayed in.  The rooms are immaculate and well-appointed. The interior design is modern yet warm and welcoming. The beds are so very comfortable. Sometimes I go to Louisville just to spend a weekend in this hotel. If I could move in, I would.This hotel is absolutely gorgeous!! My flight was canceled so I needed a room at the last minute and they came through. Beds are super comfy, decor is fabulous and the staff is very accommodating.  I will definitely head to this hotel if I make my way back to Louisville.The rooms were just what I expected from a chain hotel; the carpets looked brand new.The staff was extremely helpful and on top of everything going on. Case in point:I am African American, and ""gasp' I arrived in town with my hair undone. I needed to get it done, as my brother was graduating from UofL the very next day. The concierge Leeann Gillbrannock and Andrea Palmer were extremely helpful. They helped me find a place to get my hair done, and it turned out awesome-so that was great. They also helped my mother find everything she needed , in the area, to make my brothers graduation party and event to remember.The atmosphere was very family friendly and they attended to all of my needs. We did have an issue with the wifi, we thought it was free, but it wasn't....the front desk took care of that immediately.Be aware, there is a meretricious sex shop across the street, however, they cant help that...LOL. For some people, this could be a draw. If I was to return, I would definitely pick this hotel.<a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gentrifried.blogspot.com&amp;s=d6fc5730a4cd58fab87dee0bae9b58bccb99c0d1655ebf4cfdb08e3fc175c87d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">gentrifried.blogspot.com</a>I love this hotel and location.  The sports bar right off the lobby offers a great selection of beer, and the prices are decent.  Also not too far from Churchhill Downs, which is what brought us to town in the first place.I particularly loved the bedding and pillows, and I'm usually a hard sell on that kind of stuff.  I also love that they use Bath and Body Works products and upon returning home, I went right to my local store and purchased the Ginger Citrus lotion that this hotel introduced me to.We will definitely be back.My place in Louisville, when in Louisville. Easy self parking, walk to everything. Good rooms and excellent staff.If you have breakfast in the hotel at Blu make sure you ask for the waitress,,, oh crap I cannot believe I forgot here name. Anyway, she has brown hair, long with only the sides pulled back. Darn Senior Moments!!!! Anyway, she is outstanding.If you do not feel like going out to dinner, Champions is also connected to the place. It is fair, fare. But if you are traveling alone and want a burger, beer, and a game it's right across the hall.Enjoy.One of the better marriott's.  Great location, friendly staff, clean rooms.  Only downside is parking at $20 a day and no free internet.  But excellent gym and very close to 4th street.  Stayed two nights last year and one night this year for our bourbon trail weekend.  Using Louisville as our hub .  Easy to get to traffic wasn't bad, close to freeways and about 45 min to all the bourbon trail attractions.  And came back for the city for dinner and drinks.  Louisville has a lot to offer, great food hub too.Grand hotel. Good Marriott quality as usual.Only drawback - 22 for self parking (27 for Valet)Welcoming and accommodating staff, clean and modern guest rooms. What more could you ask for. From the moment I arrived to checkout I really felt like a valued guest. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.This is a typical full-service Marriott with a couple restaurants, bars, etc. The workout room was great with plenty of equipment and not too busy. My rrom was recently updated and they were renovating some of the floors below me. Love when a hotel keeps up with the times. As with most Marriotts the rooms are on the smaller side, but they did include a small refrigerator and coffee maker. Hotel room coffe is typically awful, but its great to make Starbucks Via with. And if you really need a triple foam latte there is a full-service Starbucks inside the lobby.In addition to being a very nice hotel it is connected to the convention center.Nice hotel, rooms facing the street are loud. Close to 4th st live. Hotel staff very friendly. Bed was ok not amazing. Shower head in bathroom amazing.Friends were getting married in Louisville, last week, and this was one of the hotels that they'd arranged for a block of rooms to be booked in. It's a pretty standard Marriott. Attentive, friendly staff - though, as typical for most Marriotts, few of them are local or have long spent time in the area, thus not able to really give you a good idea of great, off the beaten path things to do.Appointments were Marriott standard. While the Marriott standard isn't a bad standard, it kinda sucks when you can't tell that you're in any particular Marriott. Used to be, there was more diversity in Marriotts. However, as they standardized their lower tier properties, so have they standardized their marquee hotels. So, this Marriott feels pretty much like every other Marriott you might have stayed in in the last 4-5 years.Room service was speedy if pricey. The downstairs restaurant, Blu, is actually pretty decent. Definitely *several* steps up from the JW steak houses that seem to be present at most of the other Marriotts. The attached bar had a competent staff, knowlegeable in their bourbons and wines and attentive to patrons.Like every other marquee Marriott, they charge you for internet service. If you've got a smart phone or other cell-enabled mobile device, do NOT pay for the internet service. It's so slow that you half expect to hear the screeching chirps of a 1990s analog MODEM. If you've got DSL or better at home or a 3G phone, the speed will be appalling to you. Even watching the concierge struggle with helping us find a movie theatre to go to was painful to watch. Seriously, guys: if you're gonna try to charge me $12.95/day, at least give me enough bandwidth that Google searches aren't slow. Fortunately, Louisville is one of the cities that the major carriers have deployed 4G to. So, I used my cellular data service rather than the joke that the hotel was peddling.","Very nice lobby, good service upon check in, nicely decorated rooms, decent internet, good concierge room.  Not much else to stay, if you have status with Marriott, this is the place to stay in town.I chose this hotel because it was the recommended hotel for the Kentucky Derby Festival Marathon and offered a group rate. The race organizers chose well, overall this is a great property. I can't comment on the hotel's location to the business district, but it is across the street from the Kentucky International Convention Center, near the Yum! Center and a few blocks from Fourth Street Live. The hotel seems to have undergone a recent renovation and houses meeting rooms, a pool and jacuzzi, two restaurants, a bar that serves bourbon flights, and a smaller Starbucks (with habitually long lines). The lobby is quite beautiful, lots of marble, wood and an open airiness. The rooms were nice, clean, well laid out and up-to-date with amenities. On my last morning, we had breakfast at Blu. The breakfast and brunch spreads are quite impressive. For $15.95, I got the breakfast buffet which included hot and cold items, an omelet bar and a choice of juice or coffee. Even if you're not that hungry, the buffets are a sweet deal! I'm a sucker for lox and for $1 more than the menu's lox plate, I was able to enjoy the buffet, which included lox, bagels, all the fixings *plus* a whole slew of other breakfast treats. It's worth noting that the dessert cart for Blu looks amazing too, I wanted to try several items during my stay, but the timing never worked out.There are a few reasons, I can't give this place more than 3.5 stars: 1) My key stopped working one night; rather than waking up my roommate, I went to the front desk. They didn't ask for my name, ID or anything other than the room number to reprogram two keys for me. It's frightening to think that it would be so easy for someone to gain access to my room. 2) The entrance. I hate the automatic revolving door; if someone touches it, it stops. I almost face-planted into it twice when the person ahead of me inadvertently touched it. This is not the time to check your phone or chitchat, unless you like to play russian roulette with your face. The valet also backs up quite easily causing cars to back up into the street at popular times like check in/out and dinner. 3) No exhaust fans in the bathrooms 4) No free wifi, it's $13/day5) Lack of outlets in the room. For an up-to-date room I expect more, well-placed outlets; I've got stuff to charge, yo!I've lived in Louisville all my life and have dealt with most hotels here either as a musical entertainer, guest and lately as a trip advisor contributor.  Saturday, Aug 27, my husband and I celebrated an anniversary with a dinner and night at the Marriott. It was an Ironman weekend and the hotel was busy. The first room they assigned us had no air conditioning. Not wanting to wait for maintenance we agreed to stay in a conference room with a Murphy style (pull down) bed. We snuggled in and rented a movie. My husband got up to get the remote and tripped on a protruding part of the frame which couldn't be seen with the covers down and lights low. Later, barefoot, I got up to use the bathroom and ran into the metal protrusion which sliced my big toenail in half. I bled a lot , had extreme pain and lost 3/4 of my big toenail. The next day, I wrote to The Marriott via their website and told them of the incident and the dangers I saw in that bed. Corporate Marriott wrote me the next day saying the local office would contact me in 3-5 days. It's been 12 days now, even after I wrote a second letter attaching a picture of my mangled and painful toe.  I have yet to decide how to pursue this, but I will caution anyone from booking here based upon this experience. God help the person who may suffer a life threatening injury!!Friendly staff. clean room, great view, amazing location. Worth the weekend trip.Decent, clean, standard Marriott. Rooms have been updated in past 5 years but are getting close to needing some updates. I would stay there again.Another great Marriott property located in the middle of DT Louisville. Gives you walking access to many restaurants and the convention center. Beautiful lobby with a choice of restaurants and bars. The staff is well trained as are most Marriott employees and very helpful and friendly. Rooms are clean, beds comfortable. They do a nice job with groups and meetings. Food service for the masses is very tasty. The hotel is attached to a sports bar with lots of TVs for your viewing pleasure. Typical spots bar (average) food. The only negative is the parking garage fees. Pricey. Overall with room and taxes you are in for $230 per night unless you grab a special deal.I have stayed at my fair share of Marriot properties and, this one ranks as one of the best. Located conveniently in downtown it is minutes to most destinations. The rooms are spacious and well-kept and the lobby is welcoming. I found the service to be very helpful almost to the point of doting. This is appreciated, I believe, as it is always nice to be treated as important. The concierge lounge is comfortable and well-appointed with a wonderful view. I would rank this as my go-to Marriott in the greater Louisville area, likely staying here for anything I needed to do within a 45 minute drive.Great hotel in a great downtown Louisville location.This Marriott is within walking distance to both the KFC Yum! Center and the Fourth Street entertainment district. Don't feel like venturing out? There are two bars, a restaurant and a Starbucks in the lobby.The workout facilities are stellar with several treadmills to get your sweat on. Conference facilities are also well laid-out and roomy.Not that I've ever slept on a marshmallow, but if I did, I'm sure it would feel like the Marriott beds. Our room had a great view of the skyline, and walking around felt pretty safe. The staff was gracious and helpful, and also well prepared with local information.There is a Starbucks in the lobby for a quick caffeine fix, and a cool loungy area with an extensive Kentucky bourbon selection.I tried out the fitness room, which was clean and well maintained. They supplied towels and a water cooler, as well as tvs to watch.The little extras that make this place a joy to stay.  The cucumber lemon water / grapefruit cranberry water in the lobby is just refreshing. There is always a nice, fresh, crisp smell when you walk into the lobby :)I never once had to wait for someone to assist me.  In fact, there were several attendants always waiting to assist someone in the lobby.  I have never seen anything like it.  Everyone, from the front desk staff, housekeeping, bell men, concierge were very helpful and friendly.A Starbuck's, Champion's sports restaurant and BLU Mediterranean restaurant is downstairs as well.  The hotel is attached to the Louisville city walk, so you can walk to the Hyatt next door, the convention center, and several other places without going outside.  Valet parking seems too expensive to me.  It's $16 0-4 hours, and $25 for anything more.  I did not have a car this trip, so I'm not sure of self parking rates.The rooms are what you would expect from a Marriott, and the bed. . . OMG!!! the bed.  It's like sinking into billowy clouds. . .very comforting and snugly.  The room also has a refrigerator, a microwave would be nice, however, I did not ask for one.  I like the easy check out using the TV as well.  Will definitely make a point to return when I'm in town!Such wonderful accommodation! Friendly and helpful staff! The room was bigger than my house haha! SSooooo epic!!!Enjoyed a recent 5 day  vacation stay at this excellent downtown hotel located within walking distance of many restaurants, pubs, etc.  Upgraded attractive lobby and rooms with personnel always available to answer questions.  Be aware, that this Marriott doesn't have a shuttle service to/from the airport.  Although the nearby Marriott Courtyard does offer a shuttle, guests at the Marriott Downtown cannot use it.  For those of us not on an expense account, that's an extra $40 round trip for a cab.Just another excellent Marriott hotel - not that I'm biased.This place is basically my second home.  I roll in Monday afternoon every week after work, and the friendly staff instantly recognizes me, pulls out my weekend bag, assigns me a decent room on the concierge floor, and send me on my way!  House keeping is always up to par too.And there are all kinds of great little extras. A Starbucks downstairs next to the desk so I can grab my coffee on the way to the office.  Flavored water in the afternoons.  Updated gym facility.  Thanks to my extended family at the Marriott!Excellent Marriott located in downtown Louisville. Walking distance to just about anythign you would need to do in town. Concierge lounge is large on one of the highest floors and has a great view. The attendant in the lounge told me they did not have Verses on thier cable systme, but there is a sports bar locate din the lobby....which sure enough, there is! Had wonderful service at the bar including no problem getting Verses for the Flyers/ Penguins game. As a Flyers fan, I sat next to a guy who came over from the Hampton Inn, was a Penguins fan, and was told this sports bar would have the game. Had a wonderful meatloaf w/ mashed potatoes dinner (it was about 10 degrees outside, needed some comfort food) while watching the game. Would recommend this propertry to anyone traveling into Louisville for biz or pleasure.Yes, of course, the Flyers won the game.If you can figure out the layout of the rooms before you look for your meeting, then you are a step ahead of the game.  Very well-kept Marriott Property.  I did hate that the startbucks charges $6.75 for a muffin and iced grande; whereas my Los Angeles one charges $5.40 for the exact same thing.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/seelbach-hilton-louisville-louisville,Seelbach Hilton Louisville,3.5,$$$,86,"Best Brunch in Louisville! I am never, ever disappointed. Tables and tables of endless food, including mounds of crab claws and fresh shrimp, lox...an array of hearty local cheeses and loads of hot options.I recently enjoyed a moroccan style pork loin with couscous, it was amazing. The waffle station and omelets to order are a nice touch, with an overwhelming array of other traditional breakfast items--sausage, bacon, rolls and muffins. The desserts are plentiful and range from house-made toffee to deep, dark chocolate mousse, derby pie, tarts and plates of cookies and truffles, Whew!Free cocktail! A glass of complimentary champagne or a mimosa is my fave part, best to order two. Enjoy, be sure to call for a reservation, also they stop the seating at 2:30, the buffet ends at 3PM unless it is a special holiday.Stroll along the mezzanine and take in the lavish lobby and stunning antiques, close your eyes and dream of the gilded age and life during another era and time...guests have enjoyed the Seelbach for many generations and it is still fantastic. Bon Appetit!Stayed here for one night in May 2014, travelling with family. The hotel is very opulent - the lobby is an art deco dream and the Rookwood pottery room downstairs a sight to behold.The service though was pretty shoddy - we arrived in the middle of a torrential downpour - valet parking guy came with his umbrella to ask if we were parking, which was fairly obvious. He then disappeared, leaving us and our luggage to get absolutely soaked. He didn't fill in our valet ticket either, which meant his colleagues had to search for our car for some time when we left.We stayed on the top floor, our room was spacious and clean. Very high ceilings. Bathroom was nice, but lacked space to put anything down in. The bed though was fabulous, very comfortable. Access to the executive lounge was great, free drinks and canapes and an honesty bar for spirits. The hotel comped us breakfast after our poor welcome - buffet style in the Gatsby breakfast room, it was plentiful and tasty, with omelettes made to order by a friendly chef. The bar has a massive selection of bourbons which pleased my partner, as we were heading off on the bourbon trail afterwards. The bar isn't as swish as you'd think from the rest of the hotel though.The hotel is situated right next to main street live area which is good for bars on a saturday night. the microbrewery on the corner of the main street live block was good.All in all, I'd stay there again, just for the bed - so comfortable!Having spent a weekend in Louisville at this hotel I think I can give you some helpful info for your visit. First, if you're going to a wedding in this hotel - definitely stay in the hotel. Max convenience. It's very old. Like featured in the Great Gatsby old. (Not a joke - they are proud of it.) Anyway the rooms show the age, but they do meet Hilton standards. Barely. Note: some rooms have an extremely loud cooling and heating system so maybe have a listen before you get too settled. Gym - it's got the same two generations old Precor machines my 24 Hour Fitness has. But it has a gym and it does have 4-5 of every basic kind of equipment as well as a cold water dispenser. The seventh floor has a cooler full of free bottled water and soda. From what I can tell you have to pay cash money to a vending machine on the other floors. The Old Seelbach Bar makes some great drinks! Our server informed us the ""Minted Gold,"" a take on the classic Kentucky Derby cocktail, recently won some national cocktail competition. It was good but probably not that good. Warning: They've done some pretty bad things with the interior decor (best description is Courtyard Marriott furniture and a bunch of sports TVs installed in an otherwise beautiful and historic space).The room (a bookable event space) in the basement is cool. Check it out. The hotel itself is pretty well located for most things in downtown Louisville. Things that seem like a far walk on the map are usually a maximum 15 minutes away.I unfortunately cannot rate the rooms or any of the amenities that this hotel has to offer, I am basing this off of the rooms I have been to for two different events held here. So living in the Louisville area I had not officially been to The Seelbach until last week. I know, sad considering the history of this building and how beautiful it is!On Thursday I won tickets to go to ""Your Maker's Makers Louisville"" in the Rathskeller. The event simply would not have had the same effect had it been anywhere else. Walking into this room you are taken back to the 20's. There is intricate designs on the ceilings, walls and floor. The room is breath taking. The bar is gorgeous as well with hard wood and a very unique backdrop. The acoustics in the room are amazing and while talking to some other people at the event I learned that back in the 80's (for a short time) they did some concerts down there and I would have done just about anything to be there for those. There is not a single drop of modern in this room and I. Love. It! If you've never been down here then I encourage to take the trip and just prepare for the architectural shock that you're getting ready to experience. The second time I got to visit was for Louisville SWIG. It (unfortunately, but fortunately) was not held in the Rathskeller as that room would have been way too small to hold all those people. So SWIG was held in the ballroom, which was still a little packed as there were a lot of vendors and people dancing and having a blast. The room also gives that prohibition feel to it and has amazing ambiance and acoustics as well. The live music carried throughout the whole room and there was a decent sized dance floor laid out in the middle. The whole hotel, from the outside to the inside reads history, glamour and Louisville. I'm super impressed and if I ever want to have a staycation in downtown I know where I'm rooming!I've never stayed at the Seelbach Hilton. So, I can't review the rooms, or what any other aspect of staying there as an actual guest is like. However, I do park my car in their garage, and I have for the past four years, so I walk through the hotel twice a day most days. And I've gotta say, the hotel is very nice. It has a very pre-repeal of prohibition feel to it, which is fun. They renovated a few things a couple of years ago, and they put in new carpet, etc. to give (at least parts of) the hotel a more modern feel. In addition to the main part of the hotel I have also been to several other spaces in the Seelbach. One of those spaces is the Old Seelbach Bar. I visited the bar before it's renovation, and I really enjoyed it. The cocktails were good, there was a nice wine selection, and again the space is beautiful. I've also been to the smaller restaurant downstairs, Gatsby's on Fourth (previously Otto's), and it's a great lunch spot. They have a pretty good buffet and several reasonably priced menu items for a quick lunch. And there's a Starbucks in the building as well, so that's convenient.  I've also attended events in both the Rathskeller and the grand ballroom. Both spaces are awesome. The grand ballroom is great for larger events, or weddings. And the Rathskeller is really cool. It's located in the basement and is completely decorated in Rookwood pottery. It apparently used to be a restaurant, but now it's only used occasionally for private events. The decor is awesome and when you're in the Rathskeller you feel like you're in a speakeasy during the Roaring 20's. I highly recommend taking a trip down there if given the chance. Overall, as a spot to eat, grab a drink, attend an event, or just go look at I would definitely recommend the Seelbach Hilton.Gorgeous historical hotel.  The lobby is gorgeous with preserved wood detail in the ceilings and walls.  Gilded mouldings and marble detail speak of yesteryear.  The murals that surround the foyer area are faded but perceptible.  There is one of George Washington.  The original bookcase behind the reception area deserves a good look.  I did not stay here so I can't comment on the rooms but I imagine they are gorgeous too.Historic hotel. A true landmark in Louisville. They have done a remarkable job trying to keep the original look of an elegant hotel from the 1900's. Rooms are small but very comfortable. Their beds and pillows are heavenly. I normally preferred newer hotels, but I loved the 5 days I spent at this hotels. Their lobby is a masterpiece!!! If you are in Louisville, definitely go check it out. You will fee like Al Capone!A stunningly beautiful historic hotel in downtown Louisville!  From the moment you step inside, you will be in awe of the amazing historic decor.  Our room was perfect and the bed was very comfortable.Every staff member we encountered was very friendly from the valet to the bellman to the front desk.  We did get bad information from the concierge on the actual time Churchill Downs opened which did not make us too happy because we got there an hour after they opened and we were short on time.We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Louisville.my experience here went from bad to worse with the discovery that this hotel apparently has a roach infestation. the largest roach I have ever seen paraded his way into my room (under the wide gap at the bottom of the door) on day 2. someone from maintenance came up and took care of that issue, but then I saw another dead roach in the corner of my room. he had obviously been there for some time and housekeeping just never bothered to vacuum it up.  also on day 3 housekeeping barged into my room even though my privacy sign was out (response was - uh sorry. we thought you checked out. but we made a mistake on the room number).  many many other issues with the room and this property in general. it is the most dismal property I have ever stayed at.  never again!This is a classic old hotel in downtown Louisville.  As an old hotel, the rooms are somewhat small when compared to the newer but more antiseptic hotels found in the suburbs.  This is a Hilton hotel and Hilton has done a marvelous job of retaining the historic character of the old hotel and of making it a very comfortable place to stay. The size of the rooms aside, the rooms were extremely comfortable with super comfortable beds and beautiful decor.  All of the staff was quite helpful -- starting with the parking valet, the doorman and the front desk.  All of them seemed eager to be helpful and I didn't encounter any staff members who displayed any kind of a negative attitude.  If you're looking for a large, generic room -- book something out in the suburbs.  If you're looking for a very nice, very historic downtown location, this is a great hotel and I would highly recommend it.GORGEOUS property.  Hilton. Enough said. . Location is downtown which is ok though I don't believe the parking valets were prepared for a law firm retreat this past weekend.  Very unorganized and just too hard on the parking staff. Felt bad for them.  Front desk team rocked.  Saw we were diamond members and quickly put us on the honors floor.   The food/beverage staff in our breakfast and lunch room were perfect. Considering it was a large event the food as really good. I usually manage my expectations with a big crowd.  This place did a nice job .  The fitness center was awesome.  Starbucks on the first floor which was perfect.  CVS across the street which is always a relief when traveling in case one needs last minute items. Tried venturing out on Saturday and its best to stick to the 4th street commercial area.  Anything outside of that isn't much of a desirable area.The rooms run cold. Take layers.  Our room had a safe in the closet - SCORE.   I love that.  The shower pressure was amazing.  Bed was comfy.  We'd go back.The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room was clean, but they forgot to put shampoo and conditioner in my room, so I had to call the front desk to get some. Because it is an older building, noise travels through the doors and walls. I could very clearly hear every word from the tv in the neighboring room until it was turned off at midnight. I could even hear my neighbor put the remote down on the bedside table! I could hear doors opening and closing in the hall, as well as people talking and walking. Eventually, I turned on white noise so I could sleep. Stay on the concierge floor (7th) if possible!This hotel is AMAZING. If you love a historical feel, and a good ghost story, along with BEAUTIFUL architecture.... then this place is for you. From the moment we pulled up, i knew i'd love this place. It's just beautiful!  Both the Valet and Bell Hop guys were ready and waiting the minute we pulled up to the front! The down-side, valet was super expensive ($27). I'm from Chicago, and that's about what they charge downtown - I certainly don't expect that in Louisville, KY. My mouth hit the floor when I walked into the Lobby. The old-world charm,and grandeur of it!! The Room: I was kinda heebed out walking barefoot, the carpet felt a little greasy. But the room itself was nice enough. Somewhat basic, but nice amenities. The bathroom was pretty, beautiful sink and large tub, although hardly any counter-space. The beds, like most Hilton properties, was amazing. Super comfy- and the linens were soft. Very nice.  Since the person I was staying with was an Honors member, we stayed on the 8th floor, and were able to partake in the morning breakfast, which was nice.For the price you pay, each room should definitely have it's own mini-fridge. Hands-down. Quite an annoyance, as it's become the standard across most hotels. What really made the stay here lovely was the service. Every single person we interacted with was super-friendly and very helpful. They really score an A++ on the Customer Service. From the valet, to the bell-hop, to the front-desk folks, etc etc.. everyone was sooo nice!! Definitely take some time to explore the hotel, and ask the front-desk for the little history-packet they have. Definitely check out the Oak Room, The Bar, and The Rathskeller.  Part of the Great Gatsby was written here, Al Capone used to hang here, a woman killed herself here in the 30's (?) and is now ""claimed"" to occasionally ""visit"". SO much history - it's awesome!! Now, the individual rooms may not be as super-fancy as some Hilton's, but what it lacks in that area (minorly) it makes up for in history and architecture and ambiance. I would totally stay here over a typical ""fancy"" hotel any day. It just made my heart happy. I guess you could say i was totally geekin'-out over this place.What a beautiful historic hotel!Check in: easy,  breezyRoom: quaint, clean, and comfortable. Reminds me of the Drake hotel of Chicago sans gold trims and accents. I stayed on the concierge floor, so the room also came with a couple of plush robes and 24-hr access to the business center on the floor and refreshments refrigerator stocked with water and soda. I will definitely be going back!I recently stayed here for a professional conference. It's an old world hotel that is now part of the Hilton chain. The rooms are all a little different in shape and set up but generally smaller than what you might expect. My room was clean enough, but it  was never made up earlier than 4 pm. Generally, the staff here is not what you'd expect from a Hilton property. The desk staff in particular are understaffed at check in and out, and when we asked them to split the bill for myself and my colleague who was sharing my room, they were happy to do so, but seemed bewildered at getting it done, and it took two tries! (I should mention I was not the only one who had trouble with that). Its well located, but if I go back to Louisville, I'll look to the Brown Hotel as an option.I live in Louisville and don't often find a reason to say in any of the historic hotels downtown, but on New Years Eve my boyfriend and I attended a wedding and said ""why not?!"" I've always wanted to stay in the Seelbach and the lobby/entry way is as grand as I imagined but I was extremely underwhelmed by the size of the room/bathroom but everything was clean and surprisingly quiet considering it was New Year's Eve. I was the most disappointed to find that the hotel charges valet parking for each individual day (30 dollars a day) despite us only being there one night and checking out on time. My one piece of advice would be to park on the street and if you are looking for a spacious room, look elsewhere!I can see why this hotel is so pricey to stay in! This is by far THE fanciest hotel I've ever stayed in!Despite living near Louisville, I opted to stay at the Seelbach on March 4th this year before snowmaggedon hit. I work at Kosair Children's Hospital (KCH) and nurses don't get snowdays. Instead of trying to commute to work, I decided to ""rough it"" at the Hilton instead!I parked in front of the building and was greeted by a valet. For an additional $4/night the valet parked my car for me. I came inside, got a room key and went up to my room. This place is NICE on the inside! I believe this hotel had to be used in the most recent Gatsby movie because the decor seemed familiar. Anyways, once I made it up to my room (I got the double beds room because it's cheaper) I made a bee line for the tolietries. I had to call the front desk for more tolietries because they're all Peter Thomas Roth brand (hello! ) so I just had to have more!!  After that I went to work out in their fitness facility, which is much nicer than any gym I've been to in a hotel! They had several cardio machines, some free weights, a few weight machines, some yoga mats... I mean seriously I doing to pay money to be a gym member there! so I worked up a good sweat, took a nice long hot shower and ordered some room service.I regret not taking a photo of the food or see it with room service because it was so delicious! I ordered a Gatsby burger with no bun add bacon and cheese, with sweet potato fries, a glass of wine, a Side of cauliflower gratin, and some chocolate gelato for desert. The cauliflower gratin was so creamy, Rich, and the cauliflower itself was just the perfect amount of crunchy to it! The portion was gigantic! I really could've made a meal out of it to be honest, but since I just worked out I was ravenous. The burger was cooked perfectly to how I ordered it, the sweet potato fries were light and crisp. I loved the little Heinz glass bottles of ketchup and mayonnaise that came with my meal too! So cute! The chocolate gelato was easily the best chocolate gelato I've ever eaten! It was super creamy, had big chunks of dark chocolate inside, and the portion was way too much, but obviously I ate it all  The glass of white Zinfandel was a perfect touch with my bubble bath but I enjoyed it with my Peter Thomas Roth bath products.Of course the most important part of staying at a hotel is the sleep you get. I didn't hear anything going on in the hallways, so they must do a pretty good job of insulating the walls. The pillows and bedding are so comfortable, therefore, I am looking into getting some pillows from the Hilton website. I believe these pillows are about $80 a piece. A good night sleep to me is worth all the money in the world!When it came time to make the 1.5 mile commute to work the next day, the roads were covered in snow! Thankfully for me, the valet safely got my card to me and I was able to make it to work on time and in one piece. The next time I have to work at the hospital and there's an impending storm coming, I am definitely going to stay at the Seelbach again!Absolutely beautiful hotel , stupendous service with a great restaurant ( The Oak Room) &amp; a nice bar. The drinks in the bar are short, and service is very slow, though the atmosphere is nice.It loses a star , because the room was very small. Beautiful, just too small.Smallest rooms in the world. Not of any Hilton standards that I am aware of..... silly not true BS marketing hotel website made me believe this is an upscale special hotel in louisville.  Come on..... what a joke . This is an old outdated hotel. Nothing special here. I feel like a fool for telling my wife it is a wonderful hotel to stay at.....OMG.My wife tells me I'm being hard on the hotel. Well... it is overall sharp looking in the lobby and the staff is very friendly.We booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary weekend and was really looking forward to our trip.  The interior of the hotel such as the lobby and the common rooms are beautiful, the staff was attentive and courteous and there is a Starbucks right on the property.  We did not eat in either restaurant however we did have room service from Gatsbys for our breakfast which was mediocre and they forgot something each time; however it was prompt within the time frame, the food warm.  Our only real complaint is the rooms.  We were upgraded to a junior suite however the room was musty, the furnishings worn and the bathroom was not functioning properly.  The toilet wouldn't flush properly and the hot water took minutes to arrive making me wonder if it was broken, however, when it did show up, it was fine.  A staff room was right next door and we could hear them talking to one another at all hours of the day through a vent.  Our upgrade was more a downgrade.We moved to a regular room the next day which was a bit better., more open and less cramped but with the same tired, scratched furnishings, decor, peeling wallpaper (repaired but obvious)  and cracked lamp shades.  The rooms weren't as clean as I expect from this type of hotel.  A Hampton Inn would have been more comfortable and the breakfast offered would been on the same scale as the food we received at the Seelbach, a significant difference in room prices.  The hotel is conveniently located to 4th Street Live and we were able to walk to our restaurants, etc.  The valet was quick and courteous.  Overall, if our rooms had been updated, fresher and cleaner where we felt more comfortable I would have returned to this hotel but I'm afraid we will choose differently the next time we come to Louisville.","Sure, the Seelbach Hotel was something special in its heyday... 50 years ago. Now  it's just a dated, overpriced hotel that is living off its storied past.If you opt to self-park ($18 overnight), the garage entrace is on Muhammad Ali Blvd. DON'T blink or you'll miss it. DON'T follow the signs for ""Rear Hotel Entrance"" up to the 6th level or you'll find out the hard way it was for nothing. Park on the lower level and take the elevator to the ground floor. Entrance to the hotel is across the alley way.The lobby is nice -- ample gathering space and the front desk agents are friendly and helpful. There's the renowned Seelbach Bar and the Oak Room, great options when you consider what other hotels have to offer. I had a room on the 9th floor and MAN, THIS ROOM HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS. There are chips and dings all over the doors and walls, dripping shower, yellow stains on the tub, period stain on the desk chair.... should I keep going? The bathroom is TINNNNNYYY. I'm no KG, but I'm pretty sure my 5'4"" wingspan can touch the door and tub at the same time.The saving grace of this hotel is the SOLE FACT that it is across the street from 4th Street and a handy CVS for those little items that you left at home.Before the 21C hotel was created in Louisville, there were 2 grand hotels that were built in the early 20th century: The Brown, and The Seelbach.  Up until the last weekend, I had only stayed at The Brown.I was in Louisville for the weekend, and I had some Hilton points to burn.  Since the Seelbach is operated by yup, you guessed it- Hilton, I decided to give it a shot.  Opened in 1905, the Seelbach is a gem to the city of Louisville with a lot to offer.I drove, but I didn't feel like valet (which is on the 4th St entrance), I took the deck- be careful and keep an eye open, as the deck comes up quickly on your left (don't worry, if you miss it, you can go back around the block).  Look for pedestrians, as it is kind of narrow.There is a back entry to the hotel, with 2 automated doors.  You walk through some conference areas (or ""salons""), and then approach the lobby.  The lobby is kind of small, but packs a punch.  Its dark woods, pretty carpentry, and marble fit it appropriately.Check in kind of took a bit, and it was weird, as the area is tight, so when you stand in line and people are sitting in the chairs, your junk gets up close and personal with random people.  Definitely cozy here, throughout (keep that in mind) the hotel.Apparently, there were 2 weddings at the hotel that evening.  They must have thought I was part of one of them, as they put me with one of the parties.  Hmm..  However, with my Gold Status, I got free club access, which came in handy for pregaming.Out of 10 floors, I was on the 4th, in 424.  It was one of the larger standard rooms, but it still had that cozy feel.  The appointments were old school, and it was nice it had an air purifier in the room (not sure if it was a PURE allergy room or not).  When I went to the restroom- it was nice- but honestly- I have seen more room in a porter potty!  You could literally shave and take a crap at the same time- maybe their intention was the invention of multi-tasking?The water pressure in the shower was alright, and took a minute to warm up, but be careful, because when it gets hot, it rips!  Also, there are ""oh-shit!"" bars in the shower for a reason- if you are using the house soap, USE THE BAR when washing your feet- it gets slippery!!!  When I ventured up to the club level to pregame, I took the elevator to the 7th floor (key card req).  There was not a sign to the club, so I just walked the whole floor (I didn't look like a creepster, at all!) until the path dead ended into it.  It was small and filled with a bunch of dudes, but I was just there to get some booze.  They had beer, a small selection of liquor, some snacks, sodas, and juices.  It was relaxing.  They also serve breakfast in the morning there, but I forgot to get it.When I came back to the hotel later that evening, I decided to get some room service (which is 24 hours).  I ordered a cobb salad and a turkey club- noticed how I ordered a cobb?  When the gentleman came, he had brought me a turkey club and a caesar salad.   I wanted something different that night, but they must have known of my munchies and my love for caesars.  But still, they got it wrong!I slept well that evening- that bed was extremely comfortable.  It was nice, after a long week.  Room service kept knocking on my door at the ass crack of dawn (should have put up the thing on the doorknob)- keeping me awake.  I could have used the extra hour or 2 of sleep.I went downstairs to the giftshop, and bought some goodies.  This place is definitely unique in many ways, and have suites here that you will not find anywhere else- be sure to ask about them!  Also, in the basement, they have the Rathskeller- the only surviving room made of pottery and leather in the world!  Be sure to check that out.  However, if you need your space, this place is probably not for you...I was in town for a conference at another hotel, but stayed here.  So, I did not get to eat at the Seelbach or drink in the bar.This is an interesting historic hotel, with all of the cool stuff and all of the baggage that comes with that type of place.  Everything is old, but in good condition.  It is very interesting to look at, and I like the old time feel.The elevators are small, and fact many of the doors are small.  A lot of the fixtures are old, but functional.My room was modern enough, and a decent size.  The bathroom was quite modern, although there was virtually no bathroom counter space.  Even sitting on the toilet is a bit cramped between the sink and the wall...The bed was comfortable, the A/C worked very well, and everything was quiet.All in all, I had a pleasant stay.  The location is great -- just steps from the very popular ""Fourth Street Live"" area.  The hotel even offers a free shuttle to and from the airport, which is a nice touch.I had a great stay and would definitely return.I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. They were extremely accommodating, from the valet, to the bellhop assisting me with bags to and from the room, to the front desk allowing for a very late checkout time (I was getting married the next day &amp; needed the room in the AM to get ready) to the hassle free checkout. I am a Hilton Honors member, and I will definitely return for a longer stay ass soon as possible. The history behind the hotel is intriguing and I loved that the old doors are still used, and the old mail ""tunnels"" are still in tact. The room was much larger than I anticipated which was a pleasant surprise as well. My only complaint is the pricey breakfast ($50 + for 2 orders of French toast &amp; an eggs Benedict).Being from Louisville, I get the whole Seelbach nostalgia thing. It is nice. The front desk staff however is NOT. First, they need more staff. This is not a boutique hotel in the French Quarter with 20 rooms where you can get away with one snarky/evil little troll who thinks she is the Queen of Everything including appointing herself your Time Master. While she was busy flirting with the married man (Hellooo honey, look at the ring finger! Notice anything? Of course not because you are different and morals must not apply to you!) I was left standing and waiting for attention. After several minutes (and I am a very patient person normally. I mean really, we aren't standing in bread lines in this country people so be grateful and try to relax and wait. At least that is USUALLY my motto!) I finally spoke up and asked for her to pass me something. She said in a very nasty tone that she would be with me in just one moment. Of course that was several more minutes. I asked her what took her about 15 seconds to complete and walked away. I know I totally put her out but hey, I thought she could take a moment to be a helpful employee of her company. So that is my rant on the nasty girl at the front desk. As far as the room is concerned, it is a postage stamp and if you stay on the second floor good luck figuring out where you are going. Even the bell-hop was confused. (That part was actually comical and made me chuckle ;) ) Way too small to pay $179 + taxes and fees for a night. It is kind of convenient but you are by the tourist draw of 4th Street Live. Go check out NuLu, it is way cooler with better food and drink. This would never be my first choice of hotel in Louisville.Patrick took us on a late night tour to the basement and it was incredible! He's the man!Creepy and outdated are two words for this hotel. It's very small and the bathroom is awkward. Bad experience here my first time as there were a few maintenance issues that I didn't appreciate. I was put on the so called ""haunted floor (8th)"". Things like that do not worry me at all but I was a little shaken so I requested I be put on another floor. The front desk personnel were very nice but I would prefer not to stay at this hotel ever again. I'm a big fan of the hilton franchise but would gladly stay at the Marriott close by. This hotel is a one time thing but for the price tag, I prefer a hotel with up to date designs and furniture.Stayed here the weekend of Forecastle Festival. Nightly rate for queen ~$300. This is not a $300/night hotel. This feels more like a $129/night hotel, and if you are lucky enough to get that rate you are likely to be happier than I was. Seems like the rates jump wildly -- a fellow festival-goer got a last minute $120/night deal. Boy do I feel like a chump! The common areas of the hotel are stupefyingly beautiful and the service is great. Do visit the Rathskeller in the basement. The rooms, however, left a lot to be desired. The quality of toilet paper and tissues equaled what you'd find at a truck stop. No mini fridge. Shower took 10 minutes to get warm. Wallpaper was worn and torn. Bathroom grout was black in areas from years of wear. Toilet ran and ran and ran when flushed and only excessive jiggling of the handle shut it up. Regarding useable bathroom space, there is ZERO counter space and NO hook to hang a toiletries bag. Initially, I didn't think this would be a problem because there's a small shelf above the toilet. But the shelf is full of hotel junk and not easily accessible in relation to electrical outlets. There is also no mirror near an outlet in the bedroom. Using a flat iron required placing the iron in the sink when I needed to put it down, and placing my brush and hairspray on the toilet lid. There is space between the sink and toilet for a table; it would be nice if the hotel provided one. It would also be awesome if they ponied up for some Charmin and Kleenex.I disliked this hotel for many reasons.1. Parking... if you do not valet park, call ahead and get directions to their secret garage.  Oh, it's $22 per night to park in the secret garage too.  Was the garage easy to find? No. 2.  8th Floor room 681 was my room.  You can hear everything coming down the hall way.  The door, while it looks cool, allows all conversations and housekeeping to echo right into the room.  3.  I've had roomier showers in an RV camping.4.  $149 +tax, $22 for parking and I would have had to pay for WiFi.  No.  This place is not worth it whatsoever.Once you get pasted the complaints, the bed was comfortable, the shower had great pressure and the AC unit worked well.Is this worth $149 per night.  No!I like this hotel, but it has its shortcomings. I think it's riding on its historic charm, great location, and the like. I think customer service is a little lacking though. I showed up at 2 in the morning, and was notified that I was being walked to the Hyatt. Annoying at that time of night. They were nice about it , and so was I.Then, the next day, I had to check out of the Hyatt by noon, and check into the Hilton. My room wasn't ready. Annoying, but I was nice about it. I checked my bags with the bellman, and went to Churchill Downs to bet on the ponies. When I returned, they had upgraded me to a queen junior suite. Nice! My bill was slipped under my door on the morning of my checkout. My room rate was double what my company had negotiated. Unacceptable. They fixed it, but the whole experience was a pain. Good property, just failed me a number of times on this visit.Stayed here this past Saturday night. Very convenient to fourth st live and good location. Half of Louisville is under construction though not there fault, husband is hilton diamond and when we checked in we were assigned a room without an upgrade. We called down and Katie offered to move us and meet us with the new keys. Seriously we needed to ask to be upgraded? Ok but new room was nice. Had  lounge closed so instead offered us a coupon each for a drink and the. One coupon for an appetizer to share. The lounge was closed since occupancy was low. We went to the Rathskeller to use the coupons. They allowed you to pay a charge to upgrade the liquor choice which my husband did for $3. The appetizer was six pieces of chicken wings or three each. The menu said regular price was $10. That's ridiculous. They were decent but smidgen undercooked and not worth the price if we paid for them. Breakfast was nice and coupons said continental but Armondo our server advised for all items and offered eggs fresh from the kitchen. We chose to have an omelet which was really good.      The decor is very pretty. The staircase and lobby very grand. The rooms have strange layouts because older but a very nice place to be. I would stay again but maybe when hotel and area are busier. Still nice grand dameWe stayed at two different Hiltons while honeymooning and this one was by far the worst! The room was old and stunk like a old ashtray. We walked in and thought the person who stayed before us must have been smoking in the room and after two full days it still stunk! Not that I'm looking for free goodies but no one even acknowledged it was our honeymoon and then charged us $15 for a hotel guest(me his wife!) we had to pay for wifi which should just be standard or built into the rate. Overall we are really disappointed with the room and lack of service. Location is the only good part about this place.Stayed here for 1 night during a recent trip to Kentucky/Tennessee.  A colleague booked us here and I'm glad he did.  Some highlights of my brief stay:+ The bar at the hotel has awesome Beer on tap, served in frozen glasses, yum!<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0E_YbJbQ9_dBQdsMfBHqaQ?select=m0L-VaRjpCUgpYyqZj9NWg#m0L-VaRjpCUgpYyqZj9NWg"">yelp.com/biz_photos/0E_Y...</a>+ The hotel has an older ""historical"" feel to it...I don't know the history of the hotel, but it gave me the same historical feeling that I get when I'm at Wrigley Field.<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0E_YbJbQ9_dBQdsMfBHqaQ?select=p_nBU-Jok8agSuRFxrsAnQ#p_nBU-Jok8agSuRFxrsAnQ"">yelp.com/biz_photos/0E_Y...</a>+ Rooms were well appointed and beds were super comfortable.<a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0E_YbJbQ9_dBQdsMfBHqaQ?select=qgLsR9ochooGhl5AZc1k4Q#qgLsR9ochooGhl5AZc1k4Q"">yelp.com/biz_photos/0E_Y...</a>+ Every employee, from the valet guy to the front desk, was extremely helpful and friendly.Overall, it was an awesome stay despite being so brief.  If I return to Louisville, this place will be on my list.Return Factor - 90%Beautiful hotel. Very charming and historic. Clean rooms. Beautiful decor. Excellent location!! We loved our stay at Steelbuch, it was exceptional. The only reason I took one star off is because they don't have free wifi. Also, Parking was bit pricey..Cool colonial style modernized hotel with great food and service. my room, sadly seemed to have a heater as loud as a diesel generatorHave a much greater appreciation of the hotel now that I have had the ghost tour. Ask for it, it's amazing! The shuttle service is great because you can ask for rides to places other than the airport. For example, we got a ride to Mayan Cafe which saved us a huge walk. The concierge lounge is cool as well, and the staff is very helpful and accommodating. I still would rather have a large bathroom with counter space (definitely not for girls like me who travel with tons of toiletries), but it's a nice stay.My husband took me here as a birthday surprise and it was FANTASTIC!! It's old and beautiful and sophisticated and opulent and classy! They treat you so well there and are so warm. We had drinks at the Old Seelbach Bar, they were delicious, cold and fairly priced. I also love the history of the hotel, so many fun facts! We've decided to make it a tradition and I can't wait to go back next year and for many more to come!This is a beautiful property, rich with history and atmosphere. I wanted to move in once I saw the gorgeous suite they gave us for our stay. The concierge lounge was nice, the staff helpful and friendly, and the resident ghost gave us no trouble at all. Make sure to check out the little room off of the Oak Room restaurant on the mezzanine level, where Al Capone played cards and made his getaways through the secret passageway. If you like ghost stories make sure to talk to John, a 30 year veteran of the hotel, who has also written a book about the woman who died here and still roams the halls. Fun stuff!With all of the history and uniqueness, what really set this place apart is the customer service! Second to none - every request (from a mini fridge being brought up to the room to a 4 a.m. pizza delivery) was handled with a gracious smile. Early and late check-in requests were honored, and the staff even dropped off some complimentary deserts. You get what you pay for - the Seelbach is more expensive than other hotels, but not by much. The extra $20/night we spent over the standard chains down the street was beyond worth it for the experience.The Seelbach is in a great location for exploring Louisville. Stayed here on a girls' weekend trip to the Forecastle music festival and this hotel is now in my top 5 of all time. The rooms were on the small side and offered nice furnishings, a large bathroom, and the most glorious pillows I've ever slept on in a hotel room. Historic touches like the wooden doors with a box to leave your dry cleaning out and the original post office boxes are cute details. The lobby and Seelbach bar are gorgeous. Go downstairs to the Rathskeller and take pictures - and do so on the staircase as well! The only downsides were: Paid WiFi (this is 2014 so I just think that's tacky)The room could have used a second mirrorThis historic hotel has a great history.  Although the lobby is not as elegant as some historic hotels, it is still gorgeous with its painted murals of old Kentucky scenes.  We learned that in the 1960s the murals were covered up in an effort to modernize the look of the hotel and rediscovered when the hotel was renovated.  If you go, if even for a drink in the Old Seelbach Bar, don't miss the Rathskeller on the lower level.  When it was built in the early 1900s, it was decorated completely with Rookwood Pottery (from Cincinnati)--floors, walls, ceiling--everything.  It appears it is only used for private parties now.  Like many historic hotels, the guest rooms are small.  Elevators are quite tight here as well.","I love this hotel.  It's beautiful and the staff was really great.  The breakfast was good.  I think it's much better at the Hilton Tyson's Corner in VA which is my benchmark or I would have given this property 5 stars.  The concierge lounge was just ok as well.  This is all really nit picking as this is an historic and fabulous place to stay if you are ever in Louisville.Stayed at the Seelbach this past weekend.  Fantastic historical hotel.  Staff was exceptional.  My only word of caution... We used the valet service for our stay.  Dropped off Friday morning.  Saturday called to have car brought down and the low tire pressure light was on.  We didn't drop it off like that.  8lbs low pressure. We filled while out.  Checked out Sunday and luckily got home before we had a flat tire.  There was also another vehicle parked at Valet Sunday morning,  that had a completely flat tire.  Just saying with the construction across the street no one is safe from a screw in their tire.  Ours wasn't fixable,  needed to buy a new tire.The nostalgic factor makes the place more than it really is.  Something about a resident ghost and a bar and escape routes that Capone used to take advantage of makes it feel more important than it really is.  The focal point of this place is the foyer with it's sweeping staircase.  It's pretty cool.  But the rooms are small... and mine was an interior room so I just faced a wall of other rooms.Anyone who is a Hilton Honors member (ie. business travelers) should stay here when visiting Louisville.  Don't even both with the Hampton Inn a few blocks away.  The Seelbach is a historic property that's been well maintained.  Don't try to compare it to ultra-modern Hilton properties - think classic and retro, with a splash of southern charm.The rooms and suites are spacious with high ceilings and large windows on every floor.  Decor is simple - bordering on drab, especially the sofas and chairs - but the beds are comfortable and TVs are modern.  The gym is on the mezzanine level behind the small elevators and has a good selection of modern equipment, all decked out with TVs.  Bathrooms are well-stocked and not cramped.On property dining options should not be scoffed at!- Otto's Cafe does a good breakfast and better lunch, especially on Tuesday; fried chicken plate.  Prices are very reasonable and not inflated hotel fares.- The Seelbach bar is classy and historic; a great place to grab drinks with friends or co-workers away from the neon and noise of 4th Street Live.- I've never eaten in the Oakroom, however the Oakroom bar has the best selection of bourbon on site.  Knowledge local bartenders will give you a lesson on all things bourbon.Overall the Seelbach staff is excellent and I've never had an issue with any of the employees.  I recommend that you call ahead a couple of hours (well before you land at SDF) if you need a lift from the airport to the hotel.  Shuttle departs the SDF terminal at :15 and :45 after, but during the morning and early evening it can get bogged down by traffic on I-65.  Keep that in mind.Terrible, terrible and more terrible.  For just over $ 300.00 for one night this is what I received.- Getting laughed at because I asked if there was a place to get a good bottle of Bourbon for a gift- No heat- Tiny room- No service- No late check out even though I was a presenter at conference at the hotelNever againJust a quick note. I travel pretty much every week for work and I am Diamond with Hilton. I stayed here with my wife last friday night on our way to Makers Mark distillery. We enjoyed our night there completely. The check-in experience was great; he was quick , thorough and very personable. A great combination!The room we were in was gorgeous. The hotel has done a great job of keeping the history of the original hotel but having modern conveniences. The room door had the original mail box and the closet had the glass cabinet that looked original. It was just a pleasant surprise in the era of keeping the original exterior but gutting the the interior of buildings.The location is great for staying in Louisville. You really are in the middle of downtown.I stayed here for a month and it was the best experience.The staff was excellent.The food was great.Comfort and class...The historic Seelbach Hotel is a great place to admire the elegance of historic grand hotels of yesteryear. Our room was standard Hilton fare with a nice view of the neighboring high-rises. Great breakfast buffet, albeit a little pricey.Here's some history of the Seelbach Hotel:""The Seelbach Hilton is equal parts historical landmark and architectural masterpiece. It began as the dream of two Bavarian brothers -- Otto and Louis Seelbach -- in 1869 when Louis came to Louisville to learn the hotel business. In 1903, after several years of running restaurants and gentleman's clubs, the brothers began construction of a new hotel at the corner of 4th and Walnut Street (now Muhammad Ali), creating a lavish, turn-of-the-century Beaux Arts Baroque hotel. Sparing no expense, they imported marbles from all over the world, bronzes from France, hardwoods from the West Indies and Europe, linens from Ireland, and valuable Turkish and Persian Rugs.Billed as ""the only fireproof hotel in the city,"" the new Seelbach opened in May of 1905 by offering a 5-hour public inspection and drawing an incredible 25,000 visitors. The hotel was so popular, the Seelbach brothers began a 154-room addition in the fall of that same year.In 1907, the expansion was completed and included the famous Bavarian-style Rathskeller, decorated with rare Rookwood Pottery. Today the Rathskeller remains the only surviving ensemble of its kind.Because of its lavish elegance, The Seelbach attracted celebrities of all kinds. Al Capone played blackjack here, never far from a series of secret passageways where he could make an escape if necessary. F. Scott Fitzgerald sipped brandy and smoked cigars here, once banned from the hotel after having ""one too many."" The Hollywood classic, ""The Hustler,"" starring Jackie Gleason and Paul Newman features scenes shot in the old Seelbach billiard room (now The Oakroom, the hotel's 5-diamond restaurant).""If you haven't had a chance to stay here, do so. This is Louisville's Palmer House or Waldorf-Astoria. It's beautiful inside. The history and the decor are truly amazing to see. They don't make them like this anymore.Your view varies. Some of them face out towards the city. Others face inward. If you want the sunlight to be more subdued and don't care about the view, go for the inside room. If you want a view, go for the outside.Here's a tip: Park first. If you're like me and don't need in-and-out privileges, it can be cheaper to just pay when you leave. As of now, it's $14 for 12 hours at the gate. If you put it on your room, it's $21.So why 4 stars instead of 5? Why do I recommend this if you haven't stayed here but not every time? It's a little pricier than the other options once you factor in the parking. Owing to the age, the rooms are smaller but they are well decorated. It's a great hotel but it's not completely competitive with other offers even within the Hilton family.My wife &amp; I stayed here recently &amp; had an ""OK"" experience.  The location is very close to ""Fourth street live"", literally two minutes walking from all the activity on offer.  The general neighborhood is dilapidated with lots of vacant storefronts &amp; homeless people staggering around.  The hotel itself is nice &amp; grand looking inside, if somewhat tired.  The staff were very good &amp; friendly.  Our room was so-so.  The bathroom was tiny!  You could not fit two people in there &amp; the wallpaper was coming away from the walls.  The room size was adequate, but it didn't have a mini fridge or bathrobes.  I thought the room service charges/cost were way too high.  A service charge + a 21% tip comes with your bill &amp; wine is 3x what you can buy it for anywhere else.  Valet parking is $25, which I thought was too high given the quality of the neighborhood.We would not stay there again, to be honest.  If you are wanting to party the night away at Fourth street live, then this a great location as it is ""staggering"" distance from the bars!  I couldn't recommend it for families or a romantic getaway, based on the declining neighborhood outside.  It's better suited as a business or a special treat when you're partying &amp; don't want to drive home location.I've listed this hotel as ""pricey"" based on their room rates &amp; what the rooms actually look like when you enter them(bathroom included), as well as room service &amp; valet costs.I stayed here the weekend of 22 April 2011. This is the first hotel which I have valeted my vehicle and I get it back with the original radio station not adjusted. This is truly a historic jewel, I agree the rooms do not have some of the amenities or features of a newer hotel but it is the best place to stay if you desire a taste of Kentucky. How many dishes can come bourbon soaked? The decor is gorgeous and this is one of the many things I love about my hometown besides Churchill Downs....Not often do I return to a place for a second time &amp; immediately feel the need for an update... but... ... when you wander back to your room you'll notice a giant cooler of water in the hallway -- a free, open, unlocked cooler of water bottles no less. And you can have that water as a guest. Sure, I could get tap water with the plastic cups in the room. Or, I could get filtered / spring water in bottles that are cold in the hallway cooler. I've stayed in hundreds -- yeah, hundreds -- of hotels -- this is rare &amp; this is bloody good. And worth of its own review update. The valet is still pricey *$25* but essentially essential. The Seelbach Bar is still connected *schew* and if you need to print your first draft of your prequel to On The Road in the business center on the 7th floor.. no one will notice. In all the Hilton updated hotels... the beds are always-always worth the price of admission. Free Water! (post zombie apocalypse you'll love this even more.)This hotel is beyond historic, it is a classic spot in Louisville. Beautiful walls, ceilings, winding banisters, columns. Even small, cute, old elevators (that surprisingly don't feel scary.) Going down into the basement is a must see, incredible room. As far as the rooms, they are quite nice - still that historic feel, with antique headboards. The room itself that I saw was a bit small, as was the bathroom, but the bed was comfy and there was a desk and chair and all the amenities. Not to mention a fantastic (though expensive) restaurant and classy bar to boot. At least go walk around and bask in the beauty that is the Seelbach. Tip: If you are here on the weekend, don't pay for valet! There are usually plenty of spots within a block. Meters are free Friday after 6 until Monday morning.Omg!!! Best breakfast buffet EVER!  Tamela made our day!*** HAVE TO ADD THIS***  HIT AND RUN...  LITERALLY!!We were guests of the hotel for 2 days &amp; the rooms were quaint, the breakfast was AMAZING, but the real issue arose when we went to leave... an employee of the hotel had hit our car in the parking garage &amp; left the scene of the accident.  When the hotel was made aware of this by the eye witness and later myself &amp; the police, the hotel did NOTING to compensate me or make it right in anyway.  I know they cannot be responsible for everything that happens with their employees, but come on this happened in the hotel parking garage and the employee willfully avoided the situation. Not only did the hotel ignore the issue but then I had to pay for parking, I mean seriously $21 a day is pricey for self park as it is but then to have my car seriously damaged with not even so much as an apology??? What happened to customer service?  I will NOT be staying here ever again and I suggest that they focus on restaffing with responsible and HONEST employees.  I hate to draw conclusions, but if the employee who committed a hit &amp; run was in YOUR hotel room... what would stop them from committing another crime??Thank you Mr. Eye Witness for leaving that note on my car otherwise I would have no legal recourse and would be paying for the thousands of dollars worth of repairs myself!I am leaving my rating artificially high because Tamela in Otto's Restaurant as well as Mike and Peter at the front desk made this an enjoyable visit.  The rest of the stay was average, if not below.Glorious old hotel. A real gem. Nice, homey rooms. Great service. Stately. Rathskeller room worth a 5 minute peek even if you don't stay here!Everything was great until...we left our room at 3:00 p.m. I asked the maid on the floor if she'd be cleaning our room. She said ""yes."" I apologized for not being able to let her clean the room earlier and gave her a $5.00 tip. We came in around 2:00 a.m. and the room had never been cleaned. The next morning I didn't want the maid to get in trouble and wasn't going to complain, but then became irritated b/c we had to hunt-down coffee and towels.  I called downstairs to the front desk (9-29-13) and informed the gentleman at the front desk that the room was never cleaned. His response was ""well unfortunately a lot of the staff don't understand English. We'd be happy to refund you the tip you gave her. Sorry about that, I will let the Head of Housekeeping know."" End of story. I inquired, don't they work off of a list and check off the rooms that had been cleaned? And shouldn't it have been obvious that our room was never cleaned? He said yes they have  a list, and that we should have called (at 2:00 a.m.) to have it cleaned b/c they have 24 hr. housekeeping staff.Weird and unacceptable. What is so great about Hilton Hotels? I would not stay here again.This was a comfortable and relatively spacious room for an old school hotel. In short, it is classic, old ambiance with modern touches. The Rathskeller bar in the basement is awesome. Never seen anything even remotely like it in America. It ought to be the regular hotel bar but, it's not. Overall, the place was worth the money. They had genuinely friendly and helpful staff and, if you're in that mood, being right next to 4th St. is good.I've only ever been to the bar here.  Classy establishment, even if they did let me in at one point.Great historic hotel, and more. It certainly is a grand old hotel, with a beautiful lobby, cool bar (naturally with a nice selection of local Bourbon's), and with a neat past featuring many significant people in its history. Make sure you check out the rathskeller, on the basement level. the downsides are pretty much the same for any retrofitted old hotel.. small bathrooms, lack of pervasive wireless, etc. I have stayed here many times and the staff is always great, make sure you call ahead to get your car from valet. The location is terrific if you are interested in downtown events, or 4th street live.If I could give this Hotel more than five stars I would.  It reminded me of the grandeur of the Fairmont here in San Francisco.  The rooms were comfortable and cleaned on a timely basis.  The breakfast buffet was excellent, I especially like the biscuits and gravy.  The service exemplary.We did not even hear all the noise and commotion that was going on on 4th Street.  I would definitely go back again.","Elegant historic hotel. So while it adds to the southern gentile charm of the lobby and Oakroom bar, it also means the rooms are old and the hallway doors paper thin. Still, it is steps away from 4th street live and it really is nice. Above average toiletries. Starbucks attached is always helpful after a night of misbehaving. Also there is a room in the basement that would be perfect for infiltrating a reception with an open bar. The name of the the room escapes me but it is very cave like and trippy.I really like staying here while in Louisville. The rooms, especially the bathroom can be small. Each room is different so it's hard to say the exact layout. The hotel has a lot of perks. They have a complimentary shuttle service that will not only take you to and from the airport but other locations around the city. The concierge lounge is nice and the staff in the lounge are nice to talk to. Also it's not a bad continental breakfast in the lounge in the mornings. The ghost tour is awesome and will take you to parts of the hotel that you may not go to otherwise. They have nice toiletries for the guests with Bath and Body Works shampoos, etc.The location is also in a good area, right off of 4th Street Live.Louisville and I are like the chemicals you combine to blow stuff up-everytime i go, I leave town with a massive headache/hangover combo. I think we need an intervention from each other.  But that's neither here nor there, so I'll get on to the hotel. Stayed here twice. It's historic and pretty, which also translates into small rooms. And super small bathrooms.  But I'm usually here for 1 night so I don't really care. The lobby is really pretty and the hotel bar makes lovely drinks. (From what I remember). They have jazz on Friday and Saturday nights in the bar. The location is perfect if you want to go to 4th Street Live-it's literally right across the street.  I've never eaten at the hotel so I can't really comment on that.I'd probably stay here again because the location is perfect.The Seelbach is a unique historic hotel that's a great place to stay on business, but probably less so for leisure. The hotel is centrally located in downtown Louisville. There are plenty of nice bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. The hotel also houses the Seelbach Bar which is also pretty nice.The only cons to staying here would be the age of the hotel and the small rooms. The hotel can definitely use some renovating, but its not that big of a deal for the seasoned business traveler who is only there to sleep.Checked out of the hotel today.  It's an okay hotel.  But really a Hampton Inn offers more.   don't get me wrong, it's very clean, very nicely decorated, the staff is quite responsive and helpful.But you get nickel and dimed to death.  Charge for parking $25.00/night,  wireless is 7.95/night or 45.00/week.We stayed at the Seelbach for a wedding over Labor Day. The property is located in a prime section of Downtown, a stone's throw from 4th Street Live. This was perfect, as both nights the group decided to venture over for some drinks.Rooms were really clean and decorative. Bed was very comfortable and compares to my Temperpedic mattress back home. Bathroom was small, but manageable with a large tub/shower. I was kinda thrown off by two things though: the lack of counter/sink space for toiletries and the inverted placement of the toilet/sink. In comparison to most hotel rooms, the sink was located between the shower and toilet. Thanks to my height (6'4"") and the lower placement of the shower-head (about neck height, so roughly 6'), my toiletries and dob-kit would get soaked every time I would shower. I must say, the water pressure in the shower certainly made up for these minor issues.Didn't have an opportunity to experience the fitness center, but it looks very nice. Lots of cardio machines. Sunday brunch at the Oak Room was epic. We of course didn't pay, so not quite sure of the value, but damn it was tasty!The most valuable tip for anyone staying at the Seelbach with a vehicle would be to park 1 1/2 blocks away at the 5th Street Garage (630 S 5th Street) operated by PARC. The Seelbach Garage charges $16/day (without in/out privileges) or $21/day for hotel guests (with in/out privileges). Since transportation was provided for wedding guests all weekend and I knew $42 for two days was borderline robbery, I Googled nearby parking garages and found this one. The daily rate is $8.75 (without in/out privileges), but because we checked out on a Sunday (and holiday weekend), the parking garage gate was up and $42 was pocketed! If you are checking out of the Seelbach on a Sunday, I would give it a shot; worst case scenario, you save over $12/day ($21 Seelbach - $8.75 5th St). Let's just pray you don't have to retrieve your car during Tropical Storm Issac like I had to...I was just here for the 2011 Getting In Touch With Literacy conference. The hotel is beautifully breathtaking when you first enter it. The hotel staff were very accommodating considering there were many people who are blind or visually impaired staying at the hotel. The staff helped when needed and were kind. The food that was catered for the event was absolutely delicious. The rooms were small but had a lot of charm. Overall, I enjoyed my stay there.The best thing about this hotel is the staff.  So helpful.  We had an issue in our room which required immediate attention and within a few short minutes 3 people came and helped with the matter.  We were provided another room quickly and efficiently.  The hotel is stunning.  Wish we had more time to enjoy it.  One of the best fitness centers in any hotel.This was a beautiful hotel.  During my stay in Louisville (or...Indyucky...) this was a highlight.  The lobby of the hotel is beautiful--with a huge large staircase...it would be nice for a fancy affair.  The beds were heaven (though small.  they were like mini-fulls...fine for me, but maybe not for everyone)  The linens and comforters were clean and crisp and you could just fall into the pillows.The staff was sweet and nice--though they did not really give good tips on where to eat, we had to go to the Tourism Center for that...They had a nice shuttle to the airport (holla to Rick).  The hotel was quiet and clean.  There are two sets of elevators--one fast and one incredibly slow (I think that might be the haunted one...)  Crabtree and Evelyn goodies in the bathroom.The bar was dark but cozy--the wine filled to the rim.  Otto's the restaurant inside the hotel was good but the service there was so slow.  Like you should just get the buffet.  Actually when I asked for more food at the buffet (they had run out of tomatoes and mozorella...the host told me that he ""thought"" he could find some more...hmmm)  There is a Starbucks in the lobby (hello Lance and Will) and a little gift shop (hello advil)I had a hilarious time in Louisville--this was the best place to crash and call home for those few days.  A nice place to rest your head after your adventures.What an excellent place to lay your hear for the night! I will work my way from the outside in. Location, location, location. Situated right across the street from the night life, and walking distance from the restaurants you may want to dine at the Seelbach Hilton puts you in the mix. You can just leave you vehicle parked for the evening.One you enter the hotel, you are instantaneously aware you are in one of the finest in the city. The vibe is very classic, old world. There should have been theme music as I walked into my Fred Astaire dreamland. The chandelier was particularly impressive.The bar was perfect, enough said! Dinner in the restaurant was a good experience, breakfast was as well. Good job on keeping history going Hilton!I've stayed there many times and spend a fair amount of time in their bar, which has a good selection of bourbons and some decent live music (although I was told by one of the bartenders that the schedule has changed).  The rooms feel a bit cramped to me; it's what I like to call, the European feel.  But overall it's worth less than 100 dollars a night if you can get it, and you can...Old historic hotel, but lacks the cool vibe and amenities of modern boutique hotels. Staff is very nice, but stuffy. I guess it just isn't my vibe. What convinced me? The roach I woke up to sitting on the floor near my shoes! Gross, who wants to battle that at 5am. I will go to 21C next timeVery STRANGE hotel.  Back in 2002 came back to get my car from Valet only to be told that they had 'mistakenly given my Avis rental away.'  Then, one of the valets came out with my bottles of bourbon and CDs I brought with me and I was handed a 'hold harmless' agreement form letter.  You mean this happens all the time????  Told corporate travel when I got to airport and the hotel was placed on a 'no-go' list.What a beautiful place. Came here to eat at the Oak Room. The old world architecture of this place is wonderful.Visited April 2011.  3.5 stars ... service was nice; our room was not cleaned for some unkown reason but that wasn't a huge deal (hmmm ... or does that secure another star?).  Rooms are tiny.  We were upgraded to a suite which was nice 'cause my significant otter and I would've been trippin' over one another otherwise.Front desk staff was less than friendly but the bell hops more than made up for it. I would agree that the beds and bathrooms are small but the rooms are clean and well maintained. Even with my sporadic schedule, housekeeping cleaned each day and provided turn-down service each evening. If you are lucky enough to have access to the concierge level, you are in for a treat after 5pm and good company for breakfast. My primary complaint would be that hotel staff was rather loud in the hallways early in the morning even when I had my ""do not disturb"" sign hung. I was woken up several times.I wish I could have stayed here on my recent trip to Louisville. Stepping into the lobby is like stepping back in time. It made me want to dress up like an Edwardian lady, corset and all, and swish around the lobby with a parasol in hand. The interior just screams classic turn of the century luxury hotel, with lots of details wainscoting, huge ceilings, frescoes, tile, dark wood, and bronze. The hotel is a welcome change after walking through the abomination that is Fourth Street Live. I was glad to just walk into somewhere semi-civilized that returned my trust in humanity. The breakfast at Otto's was delicious, featuring a buffet with smoked salmon, creme fraiche, fruits, pastries, bagels, biscuits and gravy, french toast, eggs, omelets, and several different juices. For such a spread, the price was not too outrageously expensive. We had tried to find somewhere open downtown, but it seemed all the little cafes were closed on the weekend, so Otto's saved us.Would Stay Again.Excellent ServiceBeautiful LobbyNicely Appointed RoomsNice Lobby BarFirst Rate Dining at The Oak Room on 2nd floor.Enjoyed the history, the architecture, &amp; the location.No complaints and room price was reasonable.I have a Love-Hate relationship with this hotel.  My company had a contract with them so this is where everyone stayed when in town for meetings.Love the Old Seelbach Bar. Lots of good times here. Beware of the bourbon-soaked cherries that the bartenders hand out to unsuspecting females!  I learned to appreciate Woodford Reserve at this bar. (I'm a wine drinker usually)I love the Big four poster Beds in the rooms. Always cozy.I love that the breakfast that is always delivered on time. Food is so-so but at least you can get a bite in and some coffee before you are ready to greet the world.I love the historic painted frescos in the lobby and the story that the hotel is haunted.I do not love that there is only a tiny shelf in the bathrooms and almost every one is tilted so that your stuff rolls right off!I do not love that the doors have a good 1 1/2"" crack under them so that you can see people's feet as they walk by in the hallway (and enjoy their conversation). Not to mention the blinding light shining on you as you try to sleep.Last but not least, I do not love that the rooms are all so very dark even with all the lights on and that the elevators work sporadically.PS. Never had any problems with on-time shuttles but never trust the wake up call system!Very friendly staff, great hotel overall with lots of things to do and places to eat within walking distance. The front desk was able to upgrade me to a queen junior suite due to my diamond status with hhonors. My only gripe is that parking is a hassle as I generally prefer not to use valet.","Legend has it that this hotel inspired the setting of The Great Gatsby.  It's worth a stay for the history and architecture alone.  The Oak Room used to serve much better food.The Old Seelbach Bar is still a great place to hang out and pretend to be a movie star.nice to stay somewhere that was not Generic America.Great hotel with great service.  My room had a four poster bed and was very nicely finished.The only downside with an old hotel is the size of the rooms, if you tried to swing the proverbial cat, you would bang it's head on at least two walls!The hotel bar is awesome, listed in some magazine somewhere as one of the 50 coolest bars in the world.  I dont know that I would go that far, but it was quaint.I will stay again if in LouisvilleCrappy overly priced hotel... good central location but better to stay at the Marriott or other hotels in the area.  It might be historic, but the room doesn't need to feel like it.  The food was horrible... thankfully a Starbucks is caddy corner to the place.Overall, crappy. Don't waste your money.Thankfully it was a decent hotel considering it was teh only one with a room left before the Derby.  There is a Starbuck's off the lobby for your morning jolt.A historic hotel, indeed. The Seelbach had a part in The Great Gatsby (called the Muhlbach Hotel in the novel, F. Scott Fitzgerald was stationed here prior to WWI) and was also a haven for Al Capone in the whiskey-running era. These days it's a well-maintained, small, stunning establishment.It was ok. Lots of history and character. We do occasionally bring out of town guests here to peer in on the al Capone room and the rathskeller. We stat a couple of years ago--just not my taste. Room was very small. Bed was very high. And the abundant ghost stories made it a bit spooky (especially in light of the decor).  3 1/2 stars--giving an extra 1/2 star bc of the oak room and rathskeller.","['best', 'brunch', 'never', 'ever',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/gralehaus-louisville,Gralehaus,4.5,$$,111,"Girlfriend found this place on Yelp. Yes I turned her into a Yelper and it is working out well for me. Super friendly staff! A woman spilled coffee in her car they gave her wet rags and even went out to help clean the woman's car. Food was delicious and the drinks are great. I would certainly stop by for lunch again.I don't understand the hype with this place. I had the lamb and grits, and it was SO SALTY. Seriously, the only flavor I could taste was salt (and a hint of mint). I couldn't finish it and had to drink two glasses of water to balance out the saltiness of the meal. My partner ordered the speculoos crepe, and he enjoyed it quite a bit. No complaints there.How delightful is this adorable home with a bed and breakfast above it?You walk into a quaint room with an open kitchen and dining room. Well, not quite a dining room but tables and a ""bar"". They offer local brews and fantastic options for vegetarians and meat lovers. My dad went with the bahn mi tofu and I went with the duck biscuit and gravy? Why not? It was my freaking birthday!I feel as if we waited less than five minutes for our lunch. Seriously. It came out as soon as we both ran to the restroom and came back!The food was delicious and our beer paired nicely. The man at the register is to thank for that!There are a few other items I am intent on trying... Including the bahn mi. Pops adored it. See you soon, Gralehaus!We have been dying to try this place since my boyfriend moved to Louisville. The kombucha on tap is what sold us. We finally made it, and I wish we would have tried it long ago! The decor is awesome- the place is so fun inside with the decorations and the furniture. It has tons of different beers and signs around and it just looks great. We studied the menu for a while... There were multiple options we both were looking at and could decide. I ended up going with the veggie hash and he ended up getting the lamb and grits. And of course, a kombucha. The veggie hash was SO GOOD. it was better than expected-- it had potatoes and broccoli and Brussels sprouts with awesome sauces and an egg on top. I wish I could buy a jar of the sauce and put it on everything. The lamb and grits was also awesome. We devoured everything in less than 10 minutes. The kombucha was top notch-- a little pricey for 5 bucks a pop, but it was good.We will definitely be back for breakfast again and hopefully to try holy grale as well too! The food was pretty quick and service was good overall.The charm of the Holy Grale and its Biergarten continue in the Gralehaus, a must-visit spot for brunch. It also offers a unique bed and breakfast in the Louisville Highlands -- I'll just have to have my next out of town guests stay here so that I can check it out!  Situated in an old Victorian house, the atmosphere is just as one would expect from a Holy Grale- affiliated establishment -- warm, inviting, and come-as-you-are casual. The staff is friendly and enthusiastic, with excellent recommendations on the menu.  I visited recently with a group of friends for brunch, and we were immediately struck by how comfortable and charming the place was.  We sat in the corner by a window, and were quickly greeted by a staff member. Orders were to be made at the counter, they told us, and we quickly filed up to place them. I went with a decaf coffee (pour-over, but worth the wait for it to be prepared), and a vegetable hash. The food was brought out as it was prepared, and we each ate our meals while they were piping hot. I dug into the hash and loved its hearty mixture of root vegetables with a sunny-side-up egg over it all. Hot, savory, and filling, it was just what I needed for a brunch meant to tide me over until dinnertime.  After a filling meal in great company, we vowed to return again. A new favorite place may have just been found!Mocha is best, doesn't burn your throat with sugar, soft and nice. Hot chocolate and other coffees are very nice too. Chess pie is too sweet for me but is good. the cups are really nice and the place has pretty details.Holy crepe! This place is delicious!After some confusion about the location, which is directly behind the Holy Grale, I arrived in front of the quaint house that the Gralehaus occupies. The sign out front clearly indicates this place is for brunch, but also for snacks! They offer a soft serve ice cream that looks yummy, but I did not order. My mind was on a savory crepe.While waiting in the line to order, I decide on the country ham and cheddar crepe. The crepe itself was a beautiful soft, fluffy texture. It was shaped almost like a pie crust around the contents of salty country ham, cheddar and runny egg. On top were some greens for additional texture. It was absolutely delicious and they didn't skimp on the meat!To drink I had fresh hand-squeezed orange juice. It was $5, which I thought was a little high priced. However, I am not a coffee drinker, so this was one of my few options. If you are into the java I would highly suggest a latte or espresso because they have a very, very expensive piece of equipment to make those. It looked like a Modbar.If you are into the booze for brunch. They have that handled too. Grocery refrigerators line the back, full of beer options. There's even a beermosa!My friend ordered the french toast. The size was unexpected. It was one very thick slice of white bread topped with some sort of pumpkin butter and whipped cream. Also, very yummy but I wasn't blown away by it like I was with the crepe.Keep in mind this is a small restaurant. A few tables and then some bar style seating on a wall and another section right next to the expresso machine. In cooler months make sure you have jacket/coat as you may be eating outside if it's super busy.I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Gralehause, the ambiance and the people watching (people flow in and out with drinks, food, soft serve). It's a do not miss in L'Ville.Great little spot. You would miss it if there was no sidewalk sign. Great interesting menu, nice comfortable interior and the Porchetta sandwich was great. The brunch menu looks great and it would also be a great spot to meet friends after work.I have been there twice for Sunday brunch the staff is rude. I will not be returning. This is very disappointing as it is in walking distance and is in a great locationInteresting place, you order at the counter then find a place to sit. I ordered the bacon egg biscuit and it was delicious! Staff was friendly and Accommodating. Will definitely come back for brunch.This place is pretty tucked away! If it weren't for yelp I wouldn't have known it were a place for the great bites. I tried it for brunch! Yummy! Try the the duck biscuits and gravy! It was a great take on biscuits and gravy without being anything you've tried before! It's also a great place for coffee! They have all kinds of brews to try. If coffee isn't your thing try the beer! Wow! Lots of great choices!Just one more note . This place is pretty tiny so don't bring a party of twenty! ;)If ""brunch"" means four trips to the all-you-can-eat fried chicken bar to you, this might not be your joint. A dude can very quickly go broke just coming in here for a biscuit and coffee.Rest assured, you're not just paying for the surrounding reclaimed wood or the cook's beard trim.You're paying for the ridiculous glory that is their speculoos crepe. You're getting local ingredients and ""haus""-made sodas and soft-serve flavors and garnishes. Craftsy kombuchas. Capriole cheese. Wee tins of fancy homemade things invented for Instagram. Great beers, great patio, and great attention to detail.It's taken me more than a year to admit this, but you win, Gralehaus. Here's my paycheck. I'm yours.Gralehaus was smaller than I expected, but don't let that fool you, it's still deserves an A+. The tonic/soda drinks were great and very refreshing. The crepes were AMAZING! I had the country ham one and my sister had the speculoos one, so I was able to have both sweet and savory. I highly recommend the speculoos one. The breakfast sandwiches are delicious. My other sister had bacon egg and cheese on a biscuit, and it was divine. The biscuit was so soft and fluffy--perfection! I also ordered a beet salad but I recommended you skip out that as it seemed to be half a cup of canned beets :/Other than that, everything was great! Also, the outdoor area is beautiful and I recommend sitting out there on nice days!After driving in to Louisville late the night before, we wanted to kick off derby weekend with a solid breakfast. We checked out Holy Grale the last time we were in town, and apparently the same owners opened up a breakfast spot right next door. From the outside it just looked like a regular house. In fact, I accidentally went up the stairs while looking for the bathroom and the rooms upstairs looked like furnished bedrooms. I think I heard that they are expanding to become a bed and breakfast sometime in the future. The atmosphere kind of reminded me of one of the hipster brunch places from some of the neighborhoods around Chicago. The vibe was definitely casual and laid back, with wooden decor and unfinished brick walls. While the breakfast menu was small, all of the items seemed to be original and unique. They didn't just serve up the usual pancakes/eggs/bacon dishes that you can just get at any diner. In addition to breakfast, it looked like they also specialized in coffee and craft brews, since they had fridges full of different beers and the bar seemed to have a type of taps for espresso. We stuck to breakfast food, but the lunch menu also looked great (too bad it wasn't 11 yet).  You order at the bar and just find a seat yourself.Affogato - Their version was served with soft serve instead of regular ice cream. It had a stronger coffee flavor and didn't really combine together to create the richness I wanted.Biscuit and duck gravy - Excellent dish. The biscuit was fluffy and airy, and wasn't mouth-drying like how biscuits can sometimes be. The gravy was super thick and rich and had huge chunks of meat in it. The egg on top was cooked perfectly and the overall presentation just looked really nice as well. I also really liked the drizzle of syrup around the edges to give it that bit of sweetness among the heavy and savory items in the dish. Crispy pork hash - This isn't really what I was expecting. I was picturing something more like corned beef hash that had a crispy edge from the grill. Instead it was almost like a deconstructed hash with huge chunks of roasted potato and a little bit of pork. There was also broccoli and a smear of salsa verde on the plate. I think the meat ratio was off and could've used more pork in the dish. Overall, Gralehaus seemed like a cool place to enjoy some beer or coffee and grab some original, re-invented breakfast dishes while you're at it.I absolutely LOVE this place...the Tofu Banh Mi is the best I have ever had.  It's a perfect lunch with a kale salad and a date to share.  They give you plenty of tofu, and it's thick, savory and delicious.  The people who work here are very friendly ----environment is visually wonderful! Great space.I couldn't rave more about the brunch I had there many times. It's by far on of the best in the area. The Duck Biscuit and Gravy is amazing. I've probably had it more than any 1 human has. I'm also a coffee lover and they serve cortados here and they too, are outstanding. Give this place a try and you'll keep coming back.It's a super cute, tiny brunch spot! It got that hipster-ish, country chic feel to it. I came here for brunch one Saturday morning with friends and would definitely come back for more happy meals with small groups. It's another great spot to show off Louisville, or to just love and enjoy Louisville. It's perfect for mornings when you feel slightly hungover (or ahem tired) and not wanting too much fuss (water being refilled, server asking if you want anything, etc...) over your meals. Just you, your favorite people and good food.Space: It's small and cozy. That means you might have to squeeze a little if you have bigger groups, or just don't expect to sit at tables that will fit 8 or 10 peeps. There are about 2-3 tables that could fit bigger parties (of 4), some seats around the bar and a few smaller tables. We were able to squeeze around a small table. It was tight, but the good food made up for it.Bellies: The ""super fat"" drink was ""super good."" My rich, sweet drink came in a mason jar (cute) and tasted like a delicious combo of caffeine and soda (I forgot if it was rootbeer or coke). This is not relevant, but the chef in the kitchen that day had curly chef-style mustache, which screamed to me ""great food!"" I had lamb sausage and grits, which was delicious. I'm not a sausage fan, but occasionally will try and if I like it, that means it's really good. I loved it! It tasted lighter than usual sausage and not at all gamey. I finished most of it (minus what I shared) and wasn't as eager to share as I usually am. The trout salad looked pretty, but wasn't as popular at our table. I'm guessing the fish was cured or smoke and tasted fishier than we would've liked. It was probably an acquired taste, like the shrub. The prices are a bit higher than your average self-served cafe, but the quality of the food is also above average.Service: You order your food at the counter and things are brought out to you. You're on your own for the rest, so there really isn't much to complain about, since no service was expected. The guys were friendly at the counter and patient when we asked about the drink. None of us knew what a ""shrub"" was.Summary: yes, I will definitely come back.Went last night for dinner with a friend of mine. The restaurant is really cute, but I didn't get the vibe that this place required you to go up to the bar to order at first. So after about 10 minutes of going over the menu and waiting, we decided to go up to the register to order. Figuring out that you go up to order was the only thing odd about this place. I ordered the lamb and grits, my friend ordered the Friday special (fried cod, roasted cauliflower and hash brown casserole) and we split some potato salad. The food was delicious! My grits were creamy and cooked all the way, her fish looked flaky and didn't reek, and all the sides were awesome!! The drink menu was fun too! She got a beer mimosa and I got some kombucha tea. I also like how you can refill your own water from the giant mason jar thing!I definitely want to go again sometime. Since it was cold yesterday, it wasn't really busy... But I can see this place being popular in the summer!I love how many fresh, items there are on the menu here. We went in for brunch and we're not disappointed. My hubby ordered the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a pretzel croissant. They ended up forgetting the cheese but it was still tasty. I ordered the country ham and pimento cheese tartine. It was the perfect blend of salty, sweet (with the bread and butter pickles) and savory.  I only had 2 real issues. One, there wasn't really a good side option for either sandwich and the sides were a la cart, which makes breakfast for 2 about $35-$40, including drinks. The other problem is I really like coffee. I like brewed coffee, but they only have pour over. It's not the same. It's weak. Other than that, I really enjoyed everything. The back patio is beautiful and has fresh herbs growing in the back. Overall, this is a great place to try.Amazingly good food and a boatload of craft bottled beer. A treat! Shares a courtyard with Holy Grail.","Our favorite breakfast and coffee in Louisville! The patio is great, when weather permits. French toast and any coffee drink has been delicious and consistent.Delicious food, great atmosphere, and really good coffee and espresso. The staff are super friendly. It's all about the details!Yet another fabulous meal! The Pork Hash was a great surprise typical of this place. The crispy pork was complimented perfectly by the verde sauce which changes based on whats fresh locally. Roasted broccoli and redskin potatoes hidden under a perfect sunny side up egg was an awesome combination. So many places burn the egg and ruin the dish. Thanks for the perfect yolk to burst and mix with the other flavors!  I love the house made hot sauce!Went there on a Saturday morning and was pleasantly surprised by how fast we got our food. Cappuccino and biscuits and duck gravy were amazing. Girlfriend loved the tea. Service was awesome and prompt. Relaxing atmosphere. Small but in a good way. Will definitely go back soon.It's an easy place to miss if you aren't looking for it, Gralehaus is located in a normal residential looking home. The ambiance and food is not so normal. The menu is small for breakfast and consist of crepes, southern dishes and an assortment of tea/soda and coffee that I'm excited to explore. Plus there is a selection of beer on draft AND bottles/cases for purchase.The Food: lamb and grits. The grits was so creamy and delicious I could eat another bowl of it alone. I've never had grits without shrimp and the lamb patty it came with matched well in flavor.  Plus the dish left me feeling very satisfied despite walking in starving.Corned beef and hash: it hit the spot! Especially the brussel sprouts it came with. The potatoes were rather large pieces but flavor still got in. It's definitely an adult hash.Pretzel croissant (without butter): okay croissant with salt is a hit or miss in my mind. This time Gralehaus definitely succeeded in hitting. The salt is present but not overwhelming. Plus the pretzel without a slathering of butter actually helped balance the flavor better.The restaurant seems small at first with some four tops inside and a bar. A bar that allows you to watch the food being made. This is the definition of an open kitchen! I was so distracted watching Andy cook. There is a nice back outdoor seating area that's 21+. If I had a small celebration or party I'd love to use that space!This place has quickly grown to one of my favorite, ""I'm in need of an ice cream"" places to go.  On a very embarrassing number of occasions I have come to this place simply in need of a cortado and a huge bowl of soft serve and brownie.  Really, there is more to this place than that, but I can't stop getting that every time I go.  The flavors of the soft serve ice cream rotate and so far I've had lavendar, blueberry, and a few others I can't even remember.  But I ALWAYS get the brownie and it is superb.A few other favorites:Cortado (or any espresso drink, they use Intelligentsia coffee/espresso) and it is yummyA specialty beer infused with espresso (this rotates too, just choose whatever they have!)PRETZEL CROISSANT.  salty goodness right there.  Also, come for their Sunner nights on Wednesday and Thursdays for some 'never ending' $2 7oz pour kolsch beers on the patio.  It is crowded and on a hot night, that kolsch really hits the spot.Came here for breakfast while going through Louisville on a road trip with really no idea what to expect. First impression from the outside and inside was that it was a hip little spot, reminded us of Portland. You order at the bar area and the two ladies behind the counter were super friendly and helpful. The menu is pretty simple but everything sounded good, especially the wide variety of specialty coffee drinks. I ordered a beermosa (a cider and orange juice), I have to say it was the perfect morning cocktail. My girlfriend got the crispy pork hash and I had the biscuit and duck gravy, both had really good and unique flavor to them and although the portions looked small they were actually perfect and filling. Would definitely come back again, especially since they told us they're working on adding a bed and breakfast upstairs.Gralehaus is a transcendent experience. A holy trinity of coffeehouse, restaurant, and Biergarten. Und gothic masterpiece. Split fantastic biscuits and gravy, and a lamb sausage and grits, alongside a hot pretzel croissant. Everything was so good, we wanted to double down for seconds. A fantastic place to come for brunch, dinner, anything. The only criticism was the quality of the cortado I had; but it was still incredible. I can't wait to come back to louisville and visit again.Coffee is out of this world good!  Crepe was beautiful but a bit too salty. Nice place.I couldn't have loved Gralehaus more. From the moment we walked in, I knew I was going to love it. The smell of coffee and bacon smacks you in the face when you open the door of this little house - turned - brunch and beer haus. This little gem is warm and welcoming, with simple but well thought out design, and friendly and happy employees. The worst part about my visit was deciding what in the world to order! The menu is chalked full of tasty breakfast and lunch options, coffee/espresso drinks, and interesting cocktails. I went with the breakfast sandwich made with country ham and a biscuit, accompanied with a maple iced coffee. Completely divine. My friend had a BLT with a side of the best grits I've ever had. (Creamy, flavorful) she also had a watermelon mint soda. I can't wait to revisit this cozy little place and try something new! Louisville is kicking butt.We were hungry tourists trying to find some good cookin' in Louisville and found this gem. The food was amazing, the staff was so friendly, and the environment was pretty chill. The place has cool exposed brick and authentic wooden floors. You order your food at the front and get to pick your own table. They had a really cool self-serve water pitcher at the front with mason jars. Overall the food was really good. I got a Country Ham and Egg Crepe and it was delicious. I would definitely recommend that and a beermosa (beer and orange juice).If you're looking for a great brunch in Louisville, then look no further! 3 days at the Forecastle Festival means 3 days of brunch, and for my money this is the place to be. Take your seat in a small, almost crowded (but not quite) seating area, pick one of a handful of delicious, interesting options that add welcome twists to traditional brunch fare. Don't miss one of their ""Beermosas"" either, made with fresh blood orange juice or ginger, and a Belgian Blonde Ale. Bigger isn't always better - Graelhaus churns out top notch food in a small little kitchen in a cramped little brunch bar. Avoid the crowds and get the good stuff!After reading previous reviews, my sweetie and I selected items based on recommendations ... Duck gravy biscuit for me and the Speculoos crepe for her.  Both were fantastic! Research later revealed what Speculoos actually is and found a recipe we will likely attempt at home. Had no knowledge about this delectable Belgian spice cookie but the crepe was a winner. You might come up a little short on coffee (quantity) because they wonderfully drip-roast each cup individually.Still cranking out wonderful foodCrispy duck biscuit and gravy totally rocks everything great on your pallet and fills your tummy with plain ole goodness my rating still there five YUMS!I love breakfast food and this does not disappoint. Ended up getting the bacon egg and cheese biscuit and the bacon was to die for. The biscuit was perfection. Will maybe branch out to a speculoos crepe next time! I will be back!I don't think the woman who has taken my order during my two visits likes me very well. She doesn't seem too happy to see me and her manner is what I would call ""officious."" She corrects my pronunciation (porc-hetta not porch-etta) but not with a caring tone of voice as if she were speaking to someone new, but rather with the tone of voice that indicates a person who's already been told a thing, but has failed to understand. That's not the case so let it be, I figured. And, I confess, I find the menu here not only baffling, but my order time has been a bit rushed here on both occasions given how challenging the menu is. Meanwhile, folks lined up behind me (exposing every lack of knowledge I might have). Today, I asked about beverages (having tried the ginger ale on my prior visit) and settled on something called a coffee cherry soda. It was explained to me that ""coffee cherry"" is a part of the bean. I like coffee--so I ordered it. Along with a corned beef sandwich (I'm not eating a thing I've been corrected over!) and a side of potato salad. Once I sat down with it, I realized it has a vinegar flavor that was, for me, unbearable (they called it ""shrub"" whatever that means). Two sips and I was working on a bit of heartburn. So, I walked back over to the counter and asked to try the coffee soda instead (I had seen the woman in line after me receive hers and it looked OK). The server acted a bit miffed with me but said all the right things. I offered to pay but she insisted I just take it in substitute. I wondered if she thought maybe I'm addicted to sweet flavorings as every sip I've had at Gralehaus has been, erm, bitter in flavor. So, I tipped an extra couple bucks and went about my business. The coffee soda was a bit more to my liking, but still a bitter concoction, at least I recognized the flavor of coffee. Soon, as I gazed at the chefs doing their thing, all was forgotten.  The rye bread used for my corned beef sandwich was real dense and dark just the way I prefer it. The potato salad was interesting, if not spectacular. As my meal progressed, I caught the chef whistling along to Black Sabbath and a few of us at the counter got a mild chuckle out of what must have been a first ever in the known Sabbath world. I am not yet shaken by the consequences of my ignorance (and perhaps a modicum of server attitude). Third time will be the make or break experience for me and Gralehaus.The food is surprisingly good. It's a tiny place and it fills up fast. We fortunately were there for breakfast just a little after nine on a Saturday morning and had no trouble finding a place, but by the time we were leaving, it was standing room only. We ordered an egg and cheese on biscuit and the famed duck gravy and biscuit. I don't understand how they can take a fatty cut like duck and make it so non-fatty. Hats off to the chef. The egg on both plates were cooked just right and the light greens dusted on top, combined with the gravy to create a perfectly balanced combination. The coffee is drip and consequently slow. Not very good either, but that wasn't terribly important compared with the food. You order at the counter and they bring out your food when it's ready. There is a bar which adds more seating and it's done nicely. The place is cozy with reclaimed wood and a wall fridge with a zillion kinds of canned beer. They have some on draft as well. You serve yourself cold water that is positioned at a window overlooking a bunch of overflowing trash containers--just not pleasant. A single cup of hot tea runs $5 so the bill adds up quick. Tea, coffee and two portioned breakfast entrees rang it at a little over $26. Don't expect anything like a Diet Coke or Equal--how inappropriate you heathen! Overall it's good, but a little too trendy for me to have it as a go-to place.Another win for the owners of Holy Grale and the Louisville Beer Store!I finally got to enjoy brunch at this tiny spot, and I'm really looking forward to going back ASAP.I started with the maple latte, which provided a sweet start to my meal. And that continued into my brunch entree, the speculoos crepe.Never heard of speculoos? Well get ready to have your mind blown! This is a devilish concoction that is also known as cookie butter. It's as if peanut butter and biscotti cookies had a baby ... that you want to eat as quickly as possibleSo at Gralehaus, you can get this in a crepe. Perfection.I also tried the cheese grits, which definitely stand on their own.Gralehaus has a selection of single beers available to purchase, and I'm hoping to try one of their breakfast beer cocktails soon.The restaurant is super chic on the inside. Like with the owner' other spots, style was definitely top of mind. I particularly love their choice of light fixtures, use of chalkboards at the main counter and subway tile around the kitchen.Gralehaus packs a big punch in a small space and is worth a trip.oh there's something about this place that will keep me coming back. Not sure if it was the decor, food, or the atmosphere. Actually, it was all of them. When arriving, it was rainy and I was waiting on a good friend (emily h.!) for brunch. It was quiet. A few people enjoying their fancy coffees, mimosas and intricate crepes. Right then, I knew this was the perfect day to be here. I grabbed a table by the window and saw the barista working her magic behind the counter. I wasn't in a hurry but noticed that no one was waiting on me. After several minutes, she came over, handed me a menu and said to order at the counter whenever I'm ready. Then it hit me (duh!) this is just like holy grale where you order at the counter and they bring you your food. ah ha! Makes sense ...I ordered the organic blend 333 tea. It was a nice compliment to the ricotta toast. Light and not overwhelming. The ricotta toast should be named something more elegant like ""heaven on toast"" or something. When it came to the table, the presentation was fancy, but it looked like i would be starving afterwards (only 2 pieces of toast and some ricotta. whoohoo.) it did have a good amount of pistachios and greens. Plus, everything together was the perfect marriage ... the flavor was soooo lovely and delicate. I ate it slowly because i wanted to enjoy every bite, and since I ate it at a turtle pace, I was full afterwards :) win, win! I'm excited to take my husband next time. He'd love the beer case and the overall feel of gralehaus. The best way to describe this place:   Gralehaus = brunch.I started with the maple latte, which was a great choice, it was sweet and fun.  I ordered the lamb grits and my wife ordered the duck gravy and biscuits.  The lamb grits I didn't like much, it's probably because I don't like grits but I wanted to try something new. The lamb was amazing I'm just not a fan of grits so if you are, it'll be very good.  Now the duck gravy and biscuits was absolutely mouth watering, it's they twist on the sausage gravy and biscuits.  The flavors were very fresh and the duck surprisingly taste almost like a bacon.  We will be back to have more brunch","Came here for New Year's Day Brunch. Had the best cheese grits EVER!. Also had the Crispy Pork Hash, this had potatoes, broccoli, pork and a fried egg. It was full of flavor. My wife had the Ham &amp; Egg biscuit.Will be trying the crepes on our next vist. Inside was neat also. Brick walls hard wood floors.I love this place, but I really don't go that often.  For breakfast... I'm normally elsewhere, typically Toast on Market and for lunch/dinner, I'd almost rather go to Holy Grale(same owners) if I'm in that vicinity.  Going in the middle of the day... I usually end up with a breakfast item &amp; a lunch item.  I'm not sure I'd be satisfied with one or the other.  I can't really knock it because the food has always been great.  I'm not really a fan of the ordering.  It's not that it's bad.  You order at the register and they bring the food to you.  That concept isn't a bad one because I don't have an issue ordering in that manner at other places like Holy Grale or Grind.  Something about the way this particular spot is set up throws off my balance.I'm not really knocking a star off for any of that.  I am going to knock a star off for the tipping here.  I don't mind leaving a tip.  I normally tip anywhere in the 20-25% range, even if the service is mediocre.  Here you pay at the register which is an iPad and it asks if you want to tip.  Of course it's not a problem to just not tip and wait on your food, but that question shouldn't be put in front of the customer until after service has been given. Food is great.  Atmosphere is great.  Layout is okay.  Ordering &amp; paying could be worked on.  I really wish you could order, eat, then pay(&amp; tip if you choose).Great, artisan breakfast/brunch items. A little pricey, but very good. Duck biscuits and gravy was amazing. Unique breakfast drinks, stout ran through coffee beans, beermosa, and flavored belinerweisse. Great beer selection in the fridge. Multiple rare lambic a as well!Food was fantastic.  The biscuit with duck gravy was good, but the ginger crepe was one of the most unique dishes I've had in a very long time.The coffee was a pour over and a little bitter.  This also means you don't get refills.As far as service it was neutral.  Not friendly, but not rude.  You're going to come here for the food not the warm southern welcome.I made it very clear I am pregnant and the egg must be thoroughly cooked. However, they served running egg in my crepe, I did not notice that until I am half way through the crepe. The egg in the second one is still running, they refunded me but still, an unpleasant experience.I think I am not cool enough for this place. I have been here a couple of times for brunch and have been absolutely mesmerized by the food. The duck biscuits and gravy, the crepes, the cheddar grits - I mean, heavenly.But, why is the waitstaff always acting like they would rather be anywhere else but here? They sort of skulk around silently, don't smile, have a rather ""meh, so you are here"" attitude. Our waitress brought coffee once, and just set the mugs down. When I asked her for some sugar, she reacted like she had just been snapped out of a trance - like asking for sugar was the most incredulous request I could have made outside of ""Could I be spoon-fed my grits while reclining on a down filled cushion and being cooled off with 2 handsome men waving palm fronds at me"". Look, your coffee is great, I will give you that - its just that some people like cream and/or sugar with it!It makes for a somewhat uncomfortable dining experience, and on an early Sunday morning, I just want to relax and enjoy myself - not worry that I am doing something uncool that will have people sighing and rolling their eyes. Maybe I have just hit this place on two bad days - the people leaving five star reviews seem to say that I have - and I really hope so too. I have to order those crepes again!$13 for a burger seems a bit steep. When you realize that is for just a burger only, it seems even steeper. When it takes over 30 minutes to receive that burger and the two employees working that day are rude and defensive, it seems outrageous. For that price, you may as well go across the street to Jack Fry's, get an actual server and the service that justifies a +$10 burger.Gralehaus may be one of my new favorite weekend breakfast/brunch spots. I came here on a quiet Saturday morning and there was no wait. It was actually fairly quiet, but it was also 10:15. You order at the front and then they give you a number and they bring out your food. It was nice enough to sit outside so we enjoyed the porch seating. I had the Egg, Ham, and cheese sandwich on a biscuit. It was wonderful! Portion sizes are comfortable too! I also tried the beer cheese as my friend ordered it. The beer cheese here is the cold cheese, but I'm a fan of that so no problem with me. The actual pretzel itself was probably one of the best I've had in Louisville. I tried one of their APAs on tap and would definitely order again. I think it was called Bruxton. All in all a great laid back morning. I'll be returning soon!Awesome cheese grit, hash and gravy. Plus, they share the same outdoor patio with Holy Grale, so it is a great place for brunchThe people who started Louisville Beer Store and Holy Grale don't do anything just halfway. So of course their third venture in town is amazing. Incredible sandwiches ... I love the porchetta, but the turkey is also great -- and a very cool atmosphere. They recently started serving dinner and the one time I tried it, it was great. Have also heard excellent things about their coffee -- I'm not a coffee person but my wife is, and they use Intelligentsia from Chicago -- and the soft serve. And you can buy hard to find craft beer from the cooler (or have a beer float). Love it.Okay so you can say I'm addicted. Mimosa's for $7 and the winter squash crepe and lamb and grits...what more could one want to start the day. The eggs are always cooked perfectly and the atmosphere is super.This is the most unique coffee shop I've ever been to. Walking up the concrete steps, it looks like you're about to enter someone's home. Hard to believe a business is actually there...Once inside, the place clearly is an industrial coffee shop with exposed brick, metal, and wood. I fell in love with it at once. It's got more character and feel than 99% of every other coffee shop. Don't be boring and opt for a normal latte-- try the maple latte, a beer and espresso shot combination, or a slew of other unique mashups that you won't find anywhere else. Whoever came up with this concept is a creative Einstein. I travel the world in search of hip and cool coffee spots, and Gralehaus now takes the top spot honors. If you love coffee and an un-Starbucks-like experience, this is your place. Go, go now. You'll thank me later.Decided to come this restaurant with my friend after church since another place we checked out had a long wait. I was definitely not disappointed that we missed out on the first place! This restaurant is a tiny place but the atmosphere is extremely nice. The old wood and highlands feel is exactly what I wanted on a sunny Sunday for brunch. We both decided to get two different plates since we were hungry. I got the Speculoos Crepe and the country ham and egg biscuit, both which were presented so nicely and tasted just as great. I'll definitely come back and check out this place. The prices are a little higher than some brunch restaurants but since it's all local and everything is so fresh I think it's well worth spending that extra money. See ya soon Gralehaus!I arrived in Louisville in the early afternoon on a weekday and decided it was time for second breakfast. Gralehaus definitely delivered.After several days in Kentucky, and not yet having biscuits with any meal, I chose the biscuits with duck sausage gravy, with maple syrup, duck cracklins, and sunnyside-up egg. This was hands-down one of the best things I've eaten in a while. I also had a side of the white bean caesar, which was okay, but paled in comparison to the biscuit. I want more. Now.It looked like seating was very limited and I feel lucky I visited when it was relatively empty. The staff varied in their warmth; some were friendly, others stone-faced. Interesting, considering the lowest auto-grat available on the square app at checkout is 20%, and it isn't even full table service. (Maybe this is somehow tied to the coffee, and the ability to tip $1 on a coffee drink, I dunno.)All the dishes me and my friends had for brunch were amazing! The place is cute,  looks like a house but inside is very cozy.  Definitely recommend for brunch.  Cappuccino is also very good.My wife and I visited Gralehaus on a Sunday morning for brunch. There was no wait to order from the disinterested employee behind the bar. We ordered our food and coffee and went out back to the beautiful outdoor seating area. The coffee was delivered and was exceptional. The food took about 25 minutes, but that was fine.  We had coffee and an excellent morning with nice surroundings. When the food arrived it was very good.  So, the coffee, food and atmosphere are great so why not more than 3 stars?  The people. Unfortunately the staff act as if they are doing you a real favor simply by allowing you in the door. The employee taking orders could not have cared less whether we ordered food and coffee or if we left. Coffee was delivered to the table by another frantic hipster who said nothing before running away.  In fairness, the third employee who brought our food was very nice and helpful when a problem came up in the order. Gralehouse employee number 4 was less than interested in fixing the problem, and was quite annoyed that I wanted the food I had ordered. So it's really up to you, the food and coffee are very good. If you don't care that the people seem too cool to be bothered with you, it's worth a trip. I prefer when I spend 30$ on breakfast, to not feel like a burden on top of it.It's a super cute little place with a great patio for days when it's nice outside. The lamb and grits is so delicious!  The lamb is perfectly seasoned and pairs well with grits and eggs over easy.  They also have a great selection of beers.  We are always going back time and time again.Appreciating this coffee bar more and more after getting over the shock of the Euro-pretense, which I don't get. Isn't really very reminiscent of any German or other European establishments I know of . . . beside the point, I really like the alternative choice here to the dumpy, dark, average seems okay, coffee houses in Louisville. AT least here we get to read the menu on the wall, where it belongs. And you don't have to bring your reading glasses or a flashlight to guess what is available here for pastry or, yes, lunch items!!! Imagine that in the third wave of Louisville . . . you can eat here! BUT.... I can do without the $5 latte, $4 Cortado and $3 Mexican Coke pricing, and maybe that's all this place has to do with any euro-place - pricing. Coke in a bottle is not cold (more euro sensibilities), espresso is not extracted well, Intelligentsia I have had hundreds of times elsewhere, and here I don't even recognize the Black Cat - something is up, perhaps too fine a grind to start with - that's my two cents. ""Barista sez"" extraction is automatic and below the fancy steel machine. I vote for more by-hand control, perhaps a normal LaMarzzoca would do nicely. And then steal the barista culture from the other shops to run it! I'm running out of reasons to go here . . . besides the cozy feel in a Highlands house.??!Excellent lunch in a comfortable setting. Nice people with a great bottle beer selection and just a few really good taps. Strongly recommend for small groups or single people. Not a good place to bring a crowd. Try the picnic plate to get a good selection of most everything. Pimento cheese was the best I've ever had.Dude, the maple latte is awesome. Atmosphere is great and the food is great. We had brunch and it was fairly quick. Again off Bardstown road so parking isn't great. A win for holy grale.","The country ham and egg crepe was amazing! You have to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen!We went here while we were waiting for space to open up at the Holy Grale. It was the 2nd night they had been open for dinner. Their menu is brief  - 3 breakfast options and then an array of pub food. They don't have liquor but several refrigerators full of microbrews wine and non-alcoholic beverages.It is small inside! I was with 5 more people and there wasn't a table that could accommodate us so we just took over the bar and high-top table area which was pretty decent for socializing just not a fancy atomosphere.I had the chili dog which was just okay. The hot dog was meaty. The chili was very middle of the road. The pretzel bun it came in was somewhat stale and didn't have any salt on it. My colleagues got the burger and raved about it. I also had the beer cheese and pretzel. Though the cheese was decent, it would have been more enjoyable warm so if you go here, ask them to warm it up for you!I'm giving this place 5 stars because it was very convenient. Their menu is exploratory (alabama fried rabbit, what?), their beer selection is awesome. It was affordable and the employees were easy going and enjoyable. I'd definitely go again though I'd probably get something else.Oh! I forgot about the grits! The grist were awesome. Sharp cheddar cheese on them. I ate them all. I've tried grits many different places during my Louisville travels and I enjoyed these the best.Blown away! Coming from the Seattle coffee scene,  I never expected to find Intelligentsia coffee, kombucha on tap, knowledgeable baristas, unbelievable micro brew selection, clean, simple, delicious food, all in a little tucked away cafe in a historical district of Louisville. The food was made with love, and the shredded ham on the breakfast sandwiches, and in the crepe was salty and flavorful. The server who took my order over the phone was very friendly and sweet. He also put our pour overs in an empty beer carrier. Really brought it home!!!Need a good little breakfast spot?  I've found it for ya. This quaint restaurant was perfect for this morning's breakfast catchup with a friend of mine.  I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich (I opted for the biscuit instead of the pretzel croissant, which I probably should have chosen), and it was scrumptious.  Maybe my favorite hidden treasure of Gralehaus was that they carry Sprecher sodas.  If you are a cherry cola person (I am! I am!), Sprecher cherry cola is the best out there.  I'm not a coffee person, but my friend is.  He loved his cup o' joe. The environment was much like a coffee shop, but it's in the back of Holy Grale, which is an old church converted into a bar/restaurant/cafe/coolest place there is.  It was a cool way to start my morning, and I look forward to going back in the future.  I felt much more hip just by having been there; and I'm probably the most un-cool person on the planet.  Thanks, Gralehaus, for starting my day off with some good food and great vibes.Super friendly and so ridiculously tasty. I had the country ham crepe and cheesy grits. I had to buy a bag of the intelligentsia gralehause blend coffee. Seating was kinda sparse (I sat at the bar) so I wouldn't come here with a big group. I can not wait to come back again during my visit , probably tomorrow!Whenever I have an out-of-town friend visiting, I take them to The Gralehaus. While the menu isn't kind on the calories, if you're looking for a hearty meal which is heavy on the classy, comfort food spectrum, this is the place for you. They do a wonderful job with their German-American Gastro Pub fusion. I've had both the Biscuit and Duck Gravy and the Lamb Sausage and Grits - both times, it was a lot to get through, even though the portions weren't massive (compared to American standards), but worth the distended stomach. Every moment was like being in a gravy-smothered heaven.On the beverage end of things, they're just as impressive. They're the first coffeehouse in Louisville to serve Intelligensia Coffee, and while I have a bit of a heartache on the non-local choice, Intelligensia is a treat. Gralehaus has perfected their Sorgum Latte, which they serve with a Biscoff cookie. It's a strangely savory drink, but don't let that deter you from ordering it. They use local, full-fat milk in all their espresso drinks, and so the Sorgum Latte is what blues standards on vinyl and a pile of knitted blankets taste like.Finally, the shrub sodas. I had the Rhubarb and Tarragon, and I'm going to warn you now: they don't sweeten them. But you don't want them to. Because this tart, vinegar-y drink is strangely delightful. Fresh, crisp, and more refreshing than any carbonated beverage I've had the joy of experiencing.This review is getting to long, so I'll make this part short - the inside is stunning. I want my house to look their restaurant. Intimate, wooden, rustic, hand-crafted. Very pub-like.I just need to start writing love letters to this place.They put the Stir in the Hip""stir""!Brunch in Louisville is a tough crowd. Tough because we love it so, so much that the first brunch after their official opening I found myself heading to gralehaus. To start I was lucky. Lucky, because there is very limited seating inside this eatery but I got one of the four tables. The other eating spot is a long wall table with stools, but the place probably seats around 25. Lucky, also because even for their second day open there was a crowd. A crowd of all the coolest 20 somethings in town. We say and probably watched them serve 50 people in an hour. So be prepared to place your order to go or wait for a table.Table service is at a minimum, we got menus, but then stood in line to place our orders. gralehaus gives you a number or takes your name for your order. We had to get up and grab our drinks and dress our coffees with creamer and sugar at a side table. However we had a server who brought out our meals. The meals came out as they completed so there was a small bit of staggering until everyone was eating.Our group tried the fresh OJ, your basic Americana coffee, and a Sorghum Lattee. Apparently, the coffee is made from beans that require you to have your pinky up while brewing. Understandably while drinking our beverages we could taste all the love within the amazing flavors. My latte was a memorable personal experience. For our meals we ordered the duck crepe, the ham crepe, and the grits and sausage. The food was light but filling. The flavor of the dishes were balanced, savory, and well executed. I believe my entire group was impressed by how perfect our first visit to gralehaus was considering it was only their second brunch!When I return I will be reordering my Sorghum Latte with the ever so spicy sausage and grits. The gralehaus experience allows me to hit pause on my personal life and check in to a quality thoughtful personal experience without being as uncomfortable and inflexible as yoga!There's not a single thing on the menu that I don't like. The atmosphere is great, I love all of the outdoor seating, and the affogato - DANG Y'ALL.This is my Saturday morning/brunch spot nearly every weekend (I only miss the weekends I'm out of town...)Louisville To Do's blog post on Gralehaus : <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FGVkeKn&amp;s=b22da6bad3a6f367d6aeccc0c06eac64e82e55ebbe8aa149609475509fbcbf6d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">goo.gl/GVkeKn</a>Highlights: Best crepes I've had in the States. Incredible espresso drinks. Intelligentsia Coffee. For about $20-25 two people can have a lovely morning. My girlfriend and I love this place. If you're going for breakfast I recommend going between 8-930am, especially on weekends, since the sleeping-in crowds and the church crowds start to get heavy after about 1030 or 11am. Haven't tried their sandwiches yet but they look delicious. The interior decor is simple, minimalist, yet very cozy and charming. It's a treat on the eyes as much as it is on the palette. Now to address complaints: First off, this city doesn't appreciate what it has with places like Gralehaus. Common complaints I've heard are lack of seating and how busy it gets during peak hours. Yes, Gralehaus is small. So don't be a jerk and camp out all damn day like Louisvillians tend to do. Trendy brunch spots in Portland, Oregon, for example, will urge patrons to sit with strangers if they have empty seats, and don't linger any longer than you must. People in this city are friendly enough, and often pretty open to a nice stranger joining them. Same etiquette applies for the Gralegarten when the picnic tables fill up. As far as complaining about a place being busy during peak hours, just take a second to think about how obvious that is. If you're in a rush and don't like crowds then maybe rethink where you go for food. You might have to wait a bit and be flexible, but it's worth it to chill out and adapt. For good crepes I also recommend Java on Bardstown Rd. and the crepes stand at the Beargrass Creek Farmers' Market on Saturdays off Browns Blvd in St. MattsThe fall squash crepe rocked. The cortado punched through the morning fog. The kitchen watching was fun. Do folks really spend 16 bucks for a bottle of beer?Kombucha on tap? A for effort but I'm not a fan of the current pineapple flavor. The seating is quirky as noted previously. Dining counters should be wiped away from cooking surfaces, not toward them. Did I mention the fall squash crepe rocked?I have never had anything here I didn't absolutely love.  Crepes are amazing!  They are a must try.  Get a beer bloody mary or mimosa to top it off.Went for breakfast. Unique menu. Everything was delicious! Get there early, it gets busy and there isn't much seating.Went to Gralehaus for breakfast with the girlfriend. The decor was very nice and does carry the feel of its neighbor Holy Grale. The reclaimed wood ceiling was pretty cool to see.Everything on the menu looked enticing. We settled with ordering the lamb sausage grits and biscuit with duck gravy. For drinks we got one of the teas and a sorghum latte.Girlfriend had the lamb sausage and grits dish. The tastes I had of The lamb sausage were absolutely delightful and reminded me of the lamb merengue from 4505 meats in San Francisco who itself is a delightful meat purveyor. Grits were the right side of creamy, and mixing it all with the seasoning dusted on top with a runny egg just oh so good.The biscuit with duck gravy itself is something I would recommend I others that are looking for a tasty hearty breakfast item. The biscuit was tasty but might put others off looking for the usual buttery flakey type of biscuit. The pepper biscuit was of a somewhat cakier texture, but does well with the duck gravy. The gravy had substantial heft in flavor and thickness, and the drizzle of maple syrup provided that a pleasant sweetness. The sorghum latte was good too and not overly sweetened. It just had the right mix of ingredients for a creamy, slightly smokey sorghum finish o a typical latte.Thank goodness I am far away enough from Gralehaus so I am not tempted to make it a weekly breakfast stop otherwise I might go broke visiting so often. I am reserving giving a five star rating till I visit a couple more times to get a feel for more of the menu items, but do think Gralehaus will be able to obtain it.I enjoy crepes and they deliver some tasty crepe options. I also enjoy imbibing during breakfast, of which they have very tasty alcoholic and non alc options. Huge fan of the tonic treat, and pimento cheese, and anything they offer pretzeled.Note: This review is only for Gralehaus as a coffee house Derby City Joe Review #11What makes this Coffee Shop Sing? - There are a ton of reasons to visit the unique Gralehaus. However, if your primary goal is discovering a great coffee shop, you might want to head elsewhere. Tucked away on Baxter Avenue, Gralehaus' presence is marked only by a couple of tables outside and a small sign. If you need a landmark, try looking directly next door to the world's only KFC 11 adding to that strange, wonderful dichotomy that is the Highlands. The cafe joins a somewhat crowded landscape of places to grab coffee within a mile of one other on Bardstown Road. But Gralehaus is certainly different and not just because they don't open until 8:00 AM (take that as a note of caution, bleary-eyed early risers).In fact, it's a bit of stretch to label Gralehaus as a coffee shop. It might be more apt to describe them as a loveable mishmash of a dozen other entities - cafe, bar, breakfast nook, beer store and even a dessert shop. They ONLY offer pour over style coffee as opposed to conventional drip coffees.  And it's not the kind of space where you feel invited to sit for an extended time. However, there aren't too many places where you can purchase coffee and pickled eggs and beer mustard. Not that such a need usually arises, but, hey, one can never be too prepared. It feels a bit like you've stepped into someone's old home when you first enter because...well, you did. When the proprietors, who also own the beloved beer tavern Holy Grale, gutted the house late last year, they did a fantastic job. It would have taken Bob Villa and Norm Abrams at the helm to produce better results. There are also plans afoot to convert the upstairs into a small bed and breakfast by late fall. All that being said, Gralehaus doesn't make for a particularly good coffee joint. The rest of the menu features a relatively limited selection of coffee beverages, but enough to satisfy most basic orders. There were virtually no other patrons besides me since I'm guessing most of the activity is later in the day. Beyond coffee, there are extensive, eclectic menu items such as soda teas, duck gravy and a variety of unique beers on tap. The back door takes you to an adjoining patio that directly connects to the Holy Grale.As I said, it is probably not fair to judge this one as a coffee house. Gralehaus is a cool place to visit but lacking as a standalone coffee joint. Coffee of the day: The two pour over options available that day were custom blends from Sunergos and Intelligentsia.  I tried the Sungeros and found it watered down and weak. I often find that pour overs typically have more flavor, but my brew tasted a bit like a cake that didn't quite rise. Hard to discern any specific flavors. I was a bit disappointed.Cost of a small mug of Joe - $3.18 (The higher costs due to the pour over method being the only option)Cost of a Refill -   Also $3.18Staff:  Given the full range of the menu, both my server and the cook were affable while busy prepping for the day. Crowd: The morning I visited, there was virtually none. Decor: Fairly limited seating and certainly one of the smaller spaces around. However, Gralehaus makes impressive use of every inch of space resulting in a comfy and cozy environment.  One nifty touch is the old bags of coffee beans that have been repurposed as artisanal window shades.Wi-Fi: Locked with password.Music: I was treated to tunes by Iggy Pop, Real Estate, Roxy Music, Wave, Max Demarco, The Clash, and Foxygen. My ears approve. Bonus: The coolers on the back wall are full of endless six-packs of truly unique, craft beer available to grab and go.Gralehaus was a joke. The staff were in over their heads and couldn't recover. If you risk it here tip AFTER your service is complete. After clicking the lowest suggested 20% tip at the counter ordering service I got robbed since I got my own water, my own silverware, my own drinks and had to prompt my own food from the servers. We sat for 20 minutes next to two soft mannered gentlemen astonished at the haphazard service.  We brushed it off but with no sign of our coffee my girl went inside to inquire. What she received was an angry bartender assuring us that he delivered our drinks but to the wrong table as if this was to clear him and satisfy us. Finally he apologized for his rudeness to my lady and she brought back our drinks. Then our food seemingly came outside and circle the patio only to go back in. When it came out a second time I gained the clueless server's attention. If you don't know who's food it is why not call it out instead of wandering like a lost, hungover puppy? The grits were good, the breakfast sandwich full of butter and tasty. Nowadays a sleek metal and wood lined eatery with good beers are a dime a dozen. If the servers are going to make me do all the work and yell at my girl forget it. I'm out.Hit up Gralehaus for brunch the last time I was in Louisville and absolutely loved it. It's a well-cared-for house across the street from the church and makes for an amazing setting. The patio is clean and well-groomed, and the lines of gutter-pot gardening on the back shed looks great.The food is awesome. I had the biscuit &amp; duck gravy, which was easily the best thing I'd had all weekend.The service is a bit ad hoc; my friend didn't get his food for some time after I did (as well as a party that had arrived about five minutes after us) until someone wandered out and noticed him still waiting.I'll definitely visit again the next time I'm in that part of Louisville.This place is GREAT! Yummy, hipster, intimate, and fun. I came here with my beau for a bite of mindfully made food &amp; cool options. We ate our food too fast to take pictures, let alone talk between bites. The soda didn't stand out as particularly interesting flavor-wise, but it was a great alternative. We can't wait to go back!Delicious in every way. A fantastic atmosphere. But my husband needs a lot of food to get full. The portions are great for me but too small for him- especially for the price. Special occasions place for our budget!Absolutely perfect atmosphere. The small space somehow manages to feel incredibly open and the dining area is surrounded by low-set windows that breathe in just the right amount of light on this rather overcast day. The food was delicious and well-executed. Plating was pleasing without being over-the-top or pretentious. Overall, the food was the least surprising element of this excursion - coming from same team that brought us the Holy Grale, you just EXPECT delicious food.  One critique:  more vegetarian options are needed. My only disappointment came from the last place I expected - the coffee. While you can tell the Intelligentsia Coffee is superbly roasted, the beverage itself was weak and watery. I'm sure they'll have everything in this department perfected in short order, given the fact that there are some familiar baristas here that seem to have migrated from Please &amp; Thank You.  With that being said, my latte was spot-on.","We wanted to check out a new brunch place in Louisville and this popped up so we gave it a shot. The place is very small so but the turnover is pretty quick. I had the duck biscuits and gravy with a maple mocha beverage. The duck was seasoned and cooked very well and the gravy was just the right amount of sweet and savory. Overall I thought that the meal was delicious. My counterpart had the pork hash but it had too much garlic on it for her to enjoy it. I am a fan a garlic and have to say that it was even too much for me. We also ordered a side of hashbrown casserole which to us was just par for the course. Overall we had a good experience but for the price I think there are better options in the area.So glad I discover Gralehaus! The food quality is suburb and the pour over coffee is the best I've ever had. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to coffee and I could not wait for the next cup of coffee at Gralehaus. Yes, I bought the coffee ground too so I can have it every morning. Both breakfast and lunch items are delicious. I highly recommend the lamp sausage and grits as well as smoke pork hash. They are well prepared, very flavorful and most of all, you'll come back for more! So glad this place exists.I had the duck sausage biscuits and gravy and cheese grits. Both were pretty good. Service was efficient but very unfriendly . Decor was beautiful . Beer selection and overall menu is pretty diverse . Good place to stop for lunch or casual dinner.Went in today to enjoy a nice lunch with my dude. Ordered the Porchetta with a side of grits. He ordered the BLT. The holy trinity of lunches to say the least. The Porchetta definitely stole all the limelight. Probably one of the best sandwiches I've had in Louisville so far, and, man, I really love me a good sandwich.Tried Gralehaus out for a Saturday brunch with a friend and we LOVED IT! The atmosphere is so cute and quaint and the food is amazing! We had a breakfast sandwich on the haus biscuit and the crepe with the gingerbread cookie thing in it. Both were delicious! Definitely a new favorite weekend spot!For the aesthetic alone, this place is worthy of its exceptional reviews. Inconspicuously located behind the infamous Holy Grale, this little cafe reminds me of a more bohemian French bistro. The food is incredible. I've been six times for breakfast and the dishes are savory and cooked to order. Spicy Lamb sausage with cheese grits, duck gravy biscuit with honey and an egg that's always cooked perfectly. I still can't fathom the depth of flavor in these items. It's insane!They are one of a handful of American coffee shops with a Mod Bar system. It would be more impressive if the Intelligentsia they serve tasted more like their coffee from Millennium Park. It's simply harsh, and not balanced like shots they'll pull at Sunergos or Quills. Cappuccinos come out really hot, and shots taste over extracted and bitter. I would write this off as a fluke, but I've had five now and it's the same every time with different baristas. I love they serve Intelli, just wish it was Black Cat and as epic as it's supposed to be. If you're not into coffee, it's ok - as their fresh squeezed orange juice is superb. Try it in a mimosa! Beer selection is diverse and plentiful. So many great Belgiums and IPAs. I would rather them slightly markup the beer, dislike paying an extra $1 for a glass - but I'm sure it has something to do with their license or profits. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone coming into Louisville seeking insanely high quality brunch and good coffee. I have no idea about the bed and breakfast upstairs, but the downstairs has me hooked. Go right now, and put everything in your mouth!When I heard that the owner's of my beloved Holy Grale were opening a bed and breakfast/deli/cafe/lunch spot, my salivary glands began working overtime in anticipation. Close to a year later, they're open and gralehaus is as good as it gets. The prices are reasonable, the food is flavorful and the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. Despite our better judgement, my boyfriend and I arrived at 12:30...on a Sunday...on Valentines weekend. However, we were pleasantly surprised to discover that, despite our poor timing and gralehaus's limited seating, we only waited about ten minutes for a table to open up. In that ten minutes, we ordered the Sorghum latte and pour-over coffee. The pour over was awesome and the sorghum complemented the espresso beautifully. It wasn't too sweet or syrupy tasting. For our meals we ordered the the Lamb Sausage and Grits $7 and the Biscuit and Duck Gravy $6. Both were to die for! they both were full of flavor without being too rich. We didn't get around to try their beer cocktails but i'm sure they are equally as impressive as the food and coffee.The atmosphere and menu is unique but the breakfast we ordered was just not spectacular enough to justify the price. The artisan coffees are a nice touch, but also on the pricy side. I also don't like that the iPad app that you pay with asks for a tip before you even get your food.Great little cafe. Came here while traveling on business, and was not disappointed. The food was amazing and the coffee was full. Had the Haus Bologna and a cappuccino. My friends ordered the chorizo crepes and the biscuits and duck gravy. Everyone had good things to say about all of it.Phenomenal. Great ambience. Incredible mind blowing perfect coffee. Delicious food. Perfect location. I really hope it stays a little secret because they are in a teeny tiny space - but they have used it really well.Definitely not going there again.  $8 for a plain BLT with no sides and $8 for French Toast that was skimpy with virtually no flavor and a really odd crunchy texture.  After adding on a single coffee and tax, the bill was $23 and we were still hungry.  For that price, you walk out of most restaurants fully satisfied.  The place was crowded and noisy right after we sat down.  Might be a good coffee house but the food and coffee is really overpriced.  We'll be heading out somewhere else for our Sunday brunch.I hate that I even have to give them one star. The service was horrible, and the prices were insane. The food was good even though over priced. I don't recommend this coffee house.Sensory perfection. Thoroughly enjoyed: the indoor aesthetic, outdoor patio/garden, cappuccino, pour-over, courtesy &amp; expertise of staff, lamb sausage, grits, and breakfast sandwich including homemade biscuit, fresh parsley, &amp; just the right amount of seasoning. Wish I could have tried everything on the menu; beer cocktails, kombucha on tap, and sodas sounded especially interesting. Can't wait for the haus part of the vision... Hope next time I'm in Louisville this place has launched their B&amp;BGreat food and service without all of the pretense. Get in my belly! :Pbrunch, beer for here, beer to go.FYI: It is small: two four tops and the rest is bar seating. 8am - 8pm EVERY day!Yum!I loved Gralehaus and would definitely recommend. I had biscuits with duck gravy, lamb sausage w/ grits and trout hash. All three of these are served with a fried egg on top. Can't go wrong with any if these entrees!I want gralehaus to be successful. I really do, but part of me wants it to stay a little less known so I can go there for a quick breakfast or drink whenever I want.I visited gralehaus just a few days after it opened with my breakfast loving boyfriend and a good friend of mine. Immediately upon entering, my boyfriend stated that he felt like he wasn't in Louisville any more. gralehaus does have a unique atmosphere somewhere between a tiny coffee shop and a Waffle House. It's clean, cozy, and beautiful inside with an aesthetic that I would liken to a fresh take on a wood-filled lodge. Once we took in our surroundings, we noticed that there wasn't really a place for the three of us to sit. Seating in the small restaurant consisted of two bars that seated four each, two or three high tops that sat two each, and two picnic tables that looked like they could fit six each. Unfortunately, the tables were occupied by groups of two, and at the bars sat single diners who chose to sit in the middle of the grouping of seats, preventing us from sitting together. We awkwardly stood by a high top trying to figure out what to do when a group of two sitting at the bar offered their seats to us and moved to a high top instead. We placed our coats on the hooks under the bar facing into the kitchen area and went up to the bar to order.When I asked about vegan fare, they replied with ""not yet,"" a response which left me hopeful for the future of the restaurant. There are only a few options for vegetarians, but some of the dishes with meat can be modified to be vegetarian. I ordered a haus mimosa, biscuit and sorghum jam, fennel and ricotta toast, and a side of grits. My friend ordered a coffee, side of grits, and ham and cheese crepe (without the ham.) My boyfriend ordered the biscuit and duck gravy and coffee. Our order ended up being around $60. We were handed a number and sat down.I'm actually happy that we didn't get a table, because the bar we sat at was the best seat in the house. Directly in front of us, the chef expertly prepared dish after dish, executing every crepe effortlessly. Our food was handed to us, and we dug in.My boyfriend is extremely picky about coffee. I wouldn't say I'm as picky as he is, but I do think I have a pretty good handle on what is ""good"" coffee. He was so excited to come to gralehaus strictly because of the type of coffee that they served and the training their baristas received. This coffee was wonderful. Even as we progressed through a single cup, the flavor evolved. Truly wonderful. My mimosa was not a traditional mimosa, which I knew going in. Featuring beer and grapefruit juice instead of champagne and orange juice, it was more of a shandy than a mimosa, but it was good. I don't think that grapefruit juice is quite as effective a pairing with beer as orange, but it wasn't bad.My fennel, ricotta, and grapefruit toast was good, but I didn't feel it was worth the price that I paid for it. Next time, I will definitely get the ham and cheese crepe, without the ham of course. I can't imagine how good it must be with the meat included because even without, that was one of the most delicious breakfast items I've ever had. I was expecting strictly egg and cheese flavor, but it was so light and flavorful that I wish I could have eaten more. My boyfriend also loved his entree. I liked the biscuit and sorghum jam, but I felt the jam was too rich for the portion I was given. The grits were cheesy and wonderful, though my friend thought they were a touch too salty.After we finished our meal, we wanted to sit and chat for a while, so I ordered my friend and myself a kombucha on draft and a peanut butter and jelly con panna for my boyfriend. Those kombuchas were so light and refreshing that I truly think that I'll be coming back just for them sometimes. Vastly superior to store-bought kombucha and for just a little more, I highly recommend them. The PBJ con panna was also excellent, but was so rich that we couldn't finish it.I hope to return soon to try some of the other items on the menu, especially the soft serve and sodas, but I think I'll try and hit it at an odd hour when it won't be so hard to find seating. I definitely recommend gralehaus, even though it may mean my new beloved breakfast spot becomes a little more crowded.Only disappointment- the $2 chips are a pre-bagged product. Otherwise a great food experience.We tried to go to the Holy Grale but they were super busy so we walked out back to the quiet sanctuary that is the Gralehaus. Delish! I loved my Burgoo - which was essentially yummy pork shoulder &amp; sausage soup with white bean and chickpeas. I'm going to try to make it at home and wrote down the ingredients. My friends ordered the croissant sandwich, crispy pork hash and squash crepe. All were delicious!Five stars for the food, three stars for their pricing and policies.  Just had lunch and it is definitely one of the best burgers in town.  All of the ingredients were good quality and most of the toppings appeared to be made in-house.  One issue I had was the price.  $13 for a hamburger for lunch.  I understand using top ingredients costs money but $13?  For lunch?  With no sides, no chips, no potato salad?  Then my other pet peeve.  Many of these type restaurants are doing this these days but they have the checkout where they ring you up, swing the monitor around and ask you for tip and signature.  The options were 20%, 25% and 30%, or custom tip.  First thing I am of the school of thought that you shouldn't even have to tip when you're ordering at the counter and all they do is ring you up and drop your food off without asking if you need anything, etc.  How can they expect a 25% tip, the same as a full-service restaurant. I would also say how do you tip before the service is rendered, but they're not really rendering any service.  I suppose he pushed the right buttons on the register. Anyway they're not the only place who does this.  I would love to go back because the burger was so good, but I probably won't because the checkout process irritates me.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-brown-hotel-louisville,The Brown Hotel,4.5,$$$,160,"Such an excellent hotel!!!!! Everyone from the bell boys to the front desk to room service and housekeeping was superb and extremely friendly. They're extremely accommodating and affordable. The food is great and they have a free shuttle to and from the airport which is very convenient and it's less than 10 minutes to the airport.Room was very nice and clean and thermostat is very responsive which was a godsend as it was blizzarding when I stayed.I told you that I'd be back! This time I brought my daughter. She loved it and said that she'd rate it a 5 (she's as picky as I am).Again, I scored this hotel on Hotwire, as a 4.5 star listed hotel. The only reason that I I'm not going to rate it as a five star, is because the first room that I got over a year ago, was smaller and less impressive as this last time. This time... room 531. It was a corner room, that over looked the corner of W. Broadway and Forth Street. This room was a lot more spacious and the noise level of outside feedback was non existent, completely different than the last time. In a nut shell, I agree that it's a 4.5 star hotel. Another alteration since my 2014 stay/review... now there are several other hotels, closer to Forth Street Live. The brewery that was across the street was demolished.  Did I mention that they have free wifi? The valet parking is now up to $24 per day, but after spending $70 per day in Chicago, that rate didn't seem so bad.The Brown is charming and has a lot of very lovely old features. I was honestly going back and forth between three and four stars. Not because I had any bad experiences but because The Brown needs a little sprucing up. I ultimately decided with four stars because everything else was really truly wonderful. The building is very very neat. Built in the 1920's it retains much of it's original ""parts"" for lack of me knowing the exact term. Original molding on the walls and ceilings, lighting, furniture, doors and windows etc. This makes the hotel so cool, it is truly beautiful. We were able to just walk around the whole place, some of the ballrooms were open and we peaked in. Really really beautiful and from a bygone era. Our room was small and quaint. Very clean and the bathroom was a nice size. The bed (king size) was very comfortable and there were plenty of pillows. I called ahead and asked about getting a room with a good view. They gave me a view of downtown and while I could see some of the city it was not a stunning view. Maybe that is just the location of the hotel, I don't know anything about the area so I don't know. It was still a lovely room. The bar is definitely a place you will want to check out. It's just as beautiful as the rest of the hotel and a very nice place to sit and have a drink. They have lots of bourbon!!! Our bartender was fantastic too. There are a lot of small tables to sit and order food in the bar area and it filled up quite quickly on the Saturday evening we were there. The service at The Brown is definitely a high point. From the moment you pull up to the valet you are treated like a VIP. The front desk staff was excellent, very friendly and accommodating. Overall takeaway is this place is beautiful and a very nice place to stay. The only down side is it does need some freshening up, new paint and carpet (no bad carpet smell though so don't worry about that). Just a few updates could really let The Brown shine. I don't know if I would for sure stay here next time only because there is another hotel I want to check out in Louisville but if there was a great offer I probably couldn't turn it down. I absolutely recommend a stay at the historic Brown Hotel!Great, beautiful hotel. Free hot apple cider and delish hot chocolate at check-in, BUT nooooooooo coffee in the morning! Really? Come on now. :|The small bowl of the ""Soup of the Day"" or ""The Potage"" as they call it, in the bar was waaay overpriced at $9. I would guess the shallow bowl help maybe 4-5 ounces, at best, and didn't taste good at all. It was cold. It was mushroom. It will not be ordered again.Gotta love it when you get to stay in a little slice of history!  And that is just what The Brown Hotel is.  With it's nod to the grandeur of an era gone by, this hotel is understated elegance at it's finest that hasn't been seen since the 1920's.The rooms are large and the beds super comfortable. And the bathrooms are large and well stocked with toiletries.   And if anything seems wrong, it's the flat screen TV that is hanging on the wall.  I kept having flashbacks to another time . .what was that movie . . .oh yes . . ""Somewhere in Time"" and that's what this reminded me of.The lobby is up on the 2nd floor and it is stunning with the soaring ceilings, the gilded cage area and the sweeping staircase up to that level.  Stop in the bar, have a drink and then sit and linger awhile.  And if you have time- swing into the restaurant and have a Hot Brown.  This open faced turkey sandwich is huge, smothered with cheese and bubbling hot.  And they serve it all day!If you drive, the entrance is around the corner from the main street.  Valet will take your car on that side or you can park in the parking structure.Love this town!  And The Brown just adds a little more class to the entire place!This is a grand old hotel that has been beautifully restored and shows a lot of elegance from old ago.  The hotel is also the home of the original HOT BROWN -- a classic Louisville sandwich tradition.  I've have ""hot browns"" elsewhere in Louisville but you owe it to yourself to try one at the home of the original hot brown.  We were there on a Sunday afternoon and ate in the hotel restaurant which is really quite elegant -- not your typical casual or quick causal dining place but a fancy sit-down restaurant with white table clothes and the works.The hotel itself is a nicely restored older (1920's era hotel on the fringes of downtown.  It's not right downtown but is close.  As an older hotel, the rooms are on the small size but are nicely detailed and quite comfortable.If you're looking for a big generic room - this isn't your kind of hotel.  If, however, you're looking for the elegance and grandeur of a long gone era -- this is the place for you.  It's a classic and they just don't build them like this anymore.It's almost unnerving how personal the service is at check in.  From the stunning old world architecture to the classic antique furniture in every nook of the place, to the incredible servers in the lobby and the chocolate on your pillows and the spacious, modern bathrooms...this place rocks.  The chef is an award winning, serious professional.  Every dinner I had here involved him coming personally to my table and offering various samplings of seasonal experimental offerings.  The dessert was to die for.This hotel is very grand and lobby is beautiful. Our room was a king size standard. It was still very spacious and the style felt really classic, it was not extremely modern like some other hotels. They preserved the original vibes of the historic hotel. What I was really excited for was the famous Hot Brown and boy...I was not disappointed. I was staying in one night and wanted to try it and room service had it delivered within 20 minutes. It was the best thing I've ever had. It was turkey cheesy goodness. Overall, this was a must see historical site in the city and loved my stay there. Very professional staff and clean. Also very accommodating.Not impressed. 4 star hotel? That's silly I stayed here because of a week long seminar that was booked thru the seminar. Checking it out online gave me a relief to see that it was a 4-star hotel. But staying here for more than 1 night, I beg to differ. Now I don't want to take away from the staff, they are incredibly friendly and willing to help. Very professional. So I appreciate that part of my stay. But the hotel it self is bunk. Really old and to be a 4-star hotel u would think they would at least have water in your rooms. Nope. No water. In fact you have to go to the vending machine if you want water. And hope your vending machine takes dollars, by my 3rd attempt I just ended up getting 10$ in quarters because the damn machines wouldn't take my money. Lol. Silly. The rooms are very out dated. But they do keep nice sheets and towels. Cool. Wifi is fast. We did get a visit from the security, which was a load of poo. We literally just got off the elevator and the dude was talking about how he was getting complaints about noise. ???.........fucker it wasn't us. ! O well. All in all the stay was pleasant. Just wasn't impressed at all on the claim that it was a 4-star hotel. If you want to stay at a 4-star, go a couple blocks and stay at the 21 C hotel/museum. Now that my friends is a real 4-star. From service, to rooms (that have water) , to the whole experience. ............I've stayed two times at The Brown, and have been blown away each time by the impeccable service of each employee I had the pleasure of speaking to. The first time we stayed was on our wedding night. Upon booking our room my husband mentioned that it was our wedding night and they upgraded us to a suite (for free!) and although we didn't get to spend as much time as we would have liked at the hotel the sentiment is still the same. We loved the room, the service, and the history of Louisville felt while staying here. The room was extremely clean. The beds are comfortable. And check-in/check-out was a breeze.Upon our second visit to The Brown we were looking for a low-key anniversary celebration and decided to stay here. They asked if we were celebrating anything when we booked the room and my husband explained that we were staying for our anniversary. They upgraded us to the ""club level"" which gave us access to the club lounge. From 5p-7p each night they have a spread of appetizers, and each morning they have a breakfast spread and Starbucks coffee available. Everything was delicious, and the service was very friendly. If you're looking for a modern place to stay... READ: The Brown is not for you. The Brown is not hip, modern, and new, but that's all part of its charm. The Brown doesn't aim to be hip and modern, it aims to preserve the history of this Louisville landmark and present it in the way it was when The Brown opened in 1923. If you're prepared to enjoy this iconic hotel in the way it was meant to be enjoyed then you will love your stay!I was told that while in Louisville that I needed to try a Hot Brown and that the best place would be where it was created, the Brown Hotel.  I came here for dinner and got a little confused on where to go as far as a restaurant is concerned so I ended up in the Lobby Bar. The name says it all.. its a bar in the lobby of the hotel on the 2nd floor.  It was open seating so I found a little two top and was promptly greeted by the waitress.  The selection of bourbon is as you would expect here but I opted to stick with water as I a more of a beer person and had my fill the previous night (they do have a decent beer selection).  When my Hot Brown came out it was really hot, as to be expected.  At first I was bummed that it didn't look like what I saw on Man vs Food but then again, does it ever look that good?  The flavors were pretty spot on.  The bacon was really tasty and the turkey was not overly dry (a tad but nothing like mom over cooking the turkey at thanksgiving).  The sauce was to die for and I only wished that they would have added more than they did.  The dish was filling but the price point seemed a tad high given the type of dish it is but definitely worth doing if you haven't had it before.The ambiance is nice but very loud. It may have been the people but I believe that since the piano playing in the back ground was so loud it forced everyone to yell at their table mates to have a conversation.  The service was excellent and the architecture is pretty amazing.  Even if you don't stay here, come for dinner or lunch.I did make a stop inside the gift shop on the first floor as I was leaving.  They had some really nice items to buy as souvenirs so I picked up a few packs of bourbon balls a gift back of bourbon smoked spices. Giving this place 3 stars was a tad rough, but after thinking about it and having experienced it once I may not go back unless I bring my wife.  Not that it was a bad experience because it wasn't, but because there are a lot of restaurants to eat at in Louisville.A group of friends &amp; I decided to travel to Louisville for New Years Eve. A friend was able to get 3 rooms on Priceline for around $100 a piece, including taxes &amp; fees. To my understanding, the normal prices for these rooms are a lot higher. I think $100 bucks a room is a steal in downtown Louisville. We arrived around 6pm on New Years Eve. They are currently doing some type of construction on the street that has a the garage entrance &amp; its a little hard to find. Once inside the garage we noticed that overnight parking is a step 20 dollars. I don't know why, but paying for parking when you stay at a place REALLY annoys me. If the room was $120 &amp; the parking was free, it wouldn't bother me. Something about having to pay for parking when you pay for a room just annoys me. Anyway, off my soap box. We parked on the 4th floor. We had to take the elevator in the parking garage to the 2nd floor to get to the skybridge that connects the hotel with the parking garage. The door to get into the hotel had a key card lock on it, meaning you had to have a key card for the hotel to get in. We were lucky enough to be entering with a person who had a keycard. We checked in to get our key, a little hiccup because the front desk clerk gave us a key for a room that another person in our group had already checked in. We went down to the front desk and we were able to sort it out. Our room was on the 5th floor, we had two queen beds &amp; a bathroom. The view was of a roof of the building. I didn't expect much for being on the 5th floor, &amp; we weren't planning on looking out the window all day. The bathroom was quite large for a regular hotel bathroom, a lot of floor space. The bathroom had one sink in it, not two. The closet was large as well. I think how our room was laid out had to do with the large bathroom &amp; closet. Each of the beds have the knitted blanket with he horse on it, a signature of the hotel. The elevator in the hotel is very old. I think that it might be from when the hotel opened. It's a little slow &amp; rickety. We had a great time out, we got back to the hotel at 4:30am. The only room service available was a club sandwich or a chicken caesar salad. I got into the shower &amp; found that the controls were a little confusing. I don't know if it was because I was a little intoxicated, but the gauge of the shower looked like from a 1955 Cadillac. I got into bed &amp; I was surprised with how comfortable the bed was, it wasn't super soft, but it didn't feel like a stack of books either.We woke up in the morning &amp; my boyfriend was feeling worse for wear, so we got packed up &amp; left before we could try the ""Hot Brown"" sandwich, which is a nationally known sandwich that originated at the hotel. Our friends tried it &amp; said it was amazing. Next time we are in we will have to stop by &amp; try it.A lovely hotel filled with history. Friendly front staff.  Rooms were clean. Decor was appropriate, highlighting horses and racing.  Located very close to the medical center and within walking distance to many restaurants. Only took off one star because there were some shady people outside the hotel on 4th street asking for money which made me uncomfortable as I was walking around alone.My fiance and I were here for a little weekend getaway - from check in to check out, the hotel was a fantastic experience.The location was perfect - far enough away from the madness of Fourth Street and the bars on Main/Market, but close enough to walk there (or take a $5 Uber). The hotel offers free shuttle service to and from the airport, which is fantastic! It was maybe a 10-12 minute ride there.The rooms were spacious and clean. The bathroom was bit and well lit. my only small complaint was that we had one shampoo and two lotions (no conditioner) - I dont know if thats normal or if ours was just a mistake - but I accidentally lotioned my hair the first night (that'll teach me to only read two of the three bottles)We also had a small bite in the cafe downstairs - we split a hot brown and some fries... while tasty, it was extremely pricey ($18 for one piece of bread, a few slices of turkey, two slices of bacon, and cheese sauce?!?). When we split it, it was the perfect amount of food for us to hold us over for dinner a few hours later.Overall - the staff were friendly, the food was tasty, and the rooms were comfy... a great stay!The lobby bar is a nice place to visit--it's absolutely gorgeous and feels like visiting history--but is it worth the money? . . . that is the question. We tried the Hot Brown, minus the bacon, the unfortunately named signature dish of the Hotel (turkey and a rich sauce over bread and finished with slices of bacon), and the open-faced steak sandwich. They brought the Hot Brown out with bacon, and when we said we'd ordered it without bacon, they brought out a new one suspiciously quickly. The first few bites were very tasty, but the richness of it made me feel a little ill after a few minutes. As for the steak sandwich, it was really, really good. It was served with a sunny-side up egg (which I liked because it reminded me of brunch, which was what we were hoping to get at their downstairs restaurant but we arrived too late, quarter to 2:00 when they close at two, hrmph). I also very much enjoyed the chimichurri sauce served with the steak. When I think ""Kentucky,"" I don't think ""chimichurri"" --and that's okay; it was a delightful surprise. The food arrived before the coffee we'd ordered as soon as we got our server's attention (he was slammed), so they did not charge us for it, which was nice. Overall, it's a lovely space, but I'm not convinced I would return.We spent a wonderful Derby Day at the Brown Hotel. We didn't have tickets to the Derby so wanted to find a fab place to watch it on the TV. The Brown delivered. The food &amp; wine was excellent, the staff were so friendly and helpful and the venue is stunning. We could not have done better! If you are looking for a beautiful place to relax, eat and feel very welcome, the Brown Hotel is the place for you.We were in town for a family wedding and truly enjoyed joining our son and DIL for breakfast at The Brown Hotel Cafe. When you walk into The Brown it's easy to see why this historic hotel is a Louisville landmark. The ornate hand-painted plaster relief ceilings are beautiful!! The marble floors and mahogany furnishings give the lobby a warm welcome feel and truly does make a statement. The combination of old and new will make you fall in love with this hotel!  The Brioche French Toast was so delicious ~ thick brioche bread perfectly fried and served with fresh berries and warm maple syrup ~ YUM!At the end of the day we enjoyed relaxing at The Brown Hotel Lobby Bar for dessert and coffee. The cappuccino was a little strong, but the Chocolate Striptease dessert (milk chocolate mousse, espresso steam cake and salted caramel) was incredible! At the same time we ordered the Derby Pie ~ similar to pecan pie ~ with fresh berries. The berries were so good that we ordered an additional two bowls! The guys ordered, and split, The Hot Brown (roasted turkey breast and toast points covered with mornay sauce, pecorino romano cheese, baked golden brown and finished with bacon and tomatoes). The Hot Brown is a pretty good size dish so can easily be split. It's been a Louisville tradition since 1926 and definitely a dish worth trying! Our son and DIL stayed at The Brown and invited us up to their room. The rooms are spacious and beautiful ~ the bathroom alone was huge! The beds were covered with a soft Egyptian cotton linen with an Egyptian white down comforter and screamed ""come lay on me and snuggle!""The Brown has free valet parking for patrons enjoying dinner at this beautiful hotel. From the valet guys to the wait staff, everyone was friendly and helpful. Although the rooms are very pricey, the restaurant prices are moderate.Overall: 5 stars.  The hotel did a great job in embracing it's history from the 1920's.  They had up-to-date touches but didn't lose the historic charm.  The service was top notch.  The room was a little cramped, but it was acceptable.Lobby &amp; Lounge Area: 5 stars.  The hotel is from the 1920's, but was still up-to-date.  The decor and ceiling in the lobby were magnificent.  The main floor lounge bar was very nice and they had a great selection of local bourbons.  The elevator was a bit slow, but it's understandable with the age.The Room: The room was relatively small, but they fit in a desk, queen size bed and side table.  All the usual furnishings were there, but just not much open space.  The bed itself was very comfortable.  The real wood furniture and paintings were a nice touch over the typical fake stuff in mid-range hotels.Service: 5 stars.  Everyone was eager to help.Price: 4 stars.  The wedding block rate was $139 plus taxes and $20/night for self park.  This is higher than another wedding at the Hyatt ($110).  Free Wi-Fi was great.  Wedding: 5 stars.  We attended a wedding in the Crystal Ballroom.  It was beautiful and I liked how they had lounging areas with couches off from the main ballroom.Totally lived up to the billing. Took a cab right from the airport to the Brown (even though I'm staying there) to get me a Kentucky bourbon and hot brown. Sarah the bartender took great care of me. This is a must eat in downtown!We had a nice stay here over Labor Day weekend.  We'd originally wanted to stay at the 21c, but I balked at their high prices.  My husband said he once stayed at the Brown in the early days of Priceline for $25.  We definitely paid more than that this time, but we got a good deal on their website, especially considering it was a holiday weekend.  Our room was very nice, and it had no strange smells.  (I have a lot of allergies, so I hate rooms that smell moldy or musty, and I also hate rooms that smell like perfumes or cleaning products.  This room passed my test on both fronts!)  On the 12th floor, we had a great view of downtown Louisville, and the huge windows let in a lot of natural light.The package I booked online included a $20 meal credit, so we ate brunch in J. Graham's Cafe on the 2nd floor on Sunday morning.  The buffet is $26 per person, and we'd been considering splurging for it, but neither of us were that hungry, so we ordered off the menu instead.  Most items are in the $10 to $15 range, so you can save a lot of money that way.  It ended up costing the two of us $14 out-of-pocket after the meal credit and including tip.I'm not sure if I misunderstood or if something changed, but I'm pretty sure the package I signed up for also said it included free valet parking.  When we got there and had already given our car to the valet, the desk clerk said we were actually getting $4 off of valet parking, making it $20 instead of $24.  That's a pretty big difference, but since they already had our car and I couldn't find anything in writing about what our package included, we went with it.  The valets actually were wonderful during our stay.  When we realized we'd forgotten something in our car, they sent someone to get it for us, and they also got our car for us quickly and cheerfully every time we needed it during the weekend.  We never would have splurged for this service if we hadn't believed it to be free, but it was really, really nice, and it probably was worth $20.","My wife and I visited for a night to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. Let me split the review into two parts: the hotel and the room. The hotel atmosphere was incredible. You may recognize parts of the interior from the movie Elizabethtown, and it was chosen for the movie because it's stunning. My wife kept mentioning how the decor, music, and overall ambiance really helped to create an incredible experience with an old time feel. The bar had a long list of bourbons and offer various hotel packages that take advantage of their wide assortment of Kentucky themed cocktails. Both the English Grill and J. Grahams cafe were, overall, very pleasant.We stayed in a luxury king and the room was very spacious. Besides the space, the room was very average. There weren't any special amenities that made the space pop or the experience stand out. Overall, it was clean and slightly above average.I'd definitely recommend the hotel anyone looking for a special nights away in downtown Louisville.An old historic building with expansive public areas.The elevators can be painfully slow so be prepared to be patient.The bar service across from reception was exceptional. Both the bartender and staff were very attentive. Repeatedly refilling the bar snacks during my visit. Rooms are fairly large and comfortable. Somewhat dated, but still nice. Valet parking attendants were also very attentive and social. Overall the service is really what won me over about this hotel. Definitely will look to stay here again next time I'm in Louisville.LOVED our stay here. Wonderful service from everyone. Our room was beautiful, clean, and the bed was very comfortable. Yes, the hotel is old and it is an historic landmark. So everything isn't absolutely perfectly, but it has been well-cared-for and looks beautiful. We had ""second dinner"" late one evening at their lobby bar. We split their Hot Brown and I immediately regretted offering to split this with my husband. It was amazing - so good that we went back the next evening to order it again before we went out to dinner! Oh my - just delicious!!! If you are in Louisville, even if you don't stay here, you NEED to come here to order this dish!Valets were very friendly and helpful suggesting places we should see around town. In fact, service anywhere in this hotel was fantastic. They have complimentary beverages in the lobby at least in the afternoon and evening. However, when we checked out in the morning, there was nothing there. We had been hoping for coffee and went down to their cafe where a very nice server prepared coffee in to-go cups for us. This was a great experience - we would love to stay here again!First they pick you up for free from the airport. They have a phenomenal restaurant with great deserts. The J Graham's breakfast simply cannot be beat. The rooms are well appointed.  Rates are excellent. This is a great place to stay. Closets are huge. Fourth street is fun. Lots of restaurants.We reserved  the ""Four Diamond"" package for my 40th birthday. While not cheap at $375, it included a large king room on a club floor, access to the club lounge (free wine/beer/apps in the evening and continental breakfast in the a.m.), valet parking ($24 value) and a $100 dining credit in the English Grill. Oh, and a nice assortment of various Kentucky-related goodies, like some bbq sauces, shot glasses, a mug, a bedazzled horseshow, bourbon balls, and several other things. See, honey, it was a great value! Service was impeccable, starting at the front desk. (I had shamelessly mentioned it was my birthday. I'm no fool.) Even when we checked out the next day, I was wished a happy birthday. The hotel itself is gorgeous and seemed to attract and older crowd (most of the people on the club lounge seemed to be at least in their 60s). But, when we went to dinner, the lobby bar had a very mixed crowd, including many people in very casual dress, eating dinner. If you're looking for someplace hip, the Brown isn't for you. If you're looking for a place that has curtains that reminds you (and I'm showing my age here) the Carol Burnett ""Gone with the Wind"" sketch, make your reservation now!Had an outstanding experience staying here.- Complimentary shuttle service to/from the airport and nearby businesses.- Outstanding staff. Everyone was incredibly hospitable, warm, and welcoming. Eric H. in particular was outstanding.- Enjoyed wonderful food and drinks in the lobby bar.- Complimentary upgrade to the club level.- Very spacious and well-appointed rooms.- Convenient location- Beautiful, historic propertyWill definitely be staying here again should I find myself in Louisville.Staff from the Valet who greets you, to reception, to room service, to housekeeping were exceptional. The building is charming with the exact blend of modern updates (wifi, flat screen) and historic preservation. The room was well kept and quiet. The bed and linens were clean and comfortable after my long drive. Towel and toiletry supply was generous. But, the hot brown - that is the memory which will stay with me forever - quite simply the very best dish I've ever eaten. I'd got back to Kentucky just for the Hot Brown at The Brown. Special thanks to Angie T and Simone for all your help during my stay and seminar.We came here for a Valentine's Day weekend retreat. Honestly, we had hoped for better. We received terrible service everywhere we went. Our keys wouldn't open our door, so we were constantly going to and from the front desk. When we tried to have dinner and drinks at the bar downstairs, there were no waitresses. We sat at a table for 50 minutes before we decided to go up to the bar ourselves. Even then we had problems. There was a very loud group of men SHOUTING, I mean literally SCREAMING at the bar. They were so drunk, and no one even attempted to quiet them. Later in the night, one of the people from that disruptive group harassed me. There we were sitting in a fancy hotel, and it felt like we were at a trashy sports bar. Luckily we are pretty easy going, otherwise these things would have completely ruined our evening. Regardless, we will never stay here again and would caution others against doing so.when you've been at luxury hotel's in Vegas... its kinda spoils you.....But I am a fan of THE brown Hotel... rooms are some what simple.. but ... the luxury part of this hotel is the hotel itself the fact that its been here since the 1920's...the gorgeous ornate ceilings and marble floors are lovely... you do feel like ur in a 19 century movie... there has been a handful of movies filmed here ...  the structure is beautiful... your room its self is ok.... we were in the club deluxe king...unless of course you get into the suites.... I love the uber soft egyptian cotton sheets and down comforter... it was so nice to melt into.... the robes are ok they aren't as soft and comfy and certainly not worth $75. The beds are comfy and good quality... Finally a hotel where we can sleep and not complain about crappy beds...The service is good hereHouse keeping does a thorough job of cleaning your room,  i was in a hurry one morning and had all my makeup, hair products just everywhere in the bathroom and they neatly placed by things on a towel so they can still clean the vanity... love it... it was a relief coming back to our room so tidy..... also parking here is $20 a day for guest.. but ur in the perfect location here and they have a 24hr shuttle to and from the airport so u hardly need a car... They do have free valet for guest that are visiting the cafe, lobby bar, or their restaurant. WE love love the hotel lobby bar.... desserts are great... my motherinlaw had the striptease dessert, its one of those fire show desserts, its worth trying.We had the derby pie, if you like pecan pies you'll love the derby pie.  both desserts were served with berries, goods berries, raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries.. we love it so much we had to order two more bowls of just the berries.One night i had the mint julep mixed drink, its delicious... with a couple wedges of lemon, i like my drinks less sweet, so the lemon was perfect...That conditioner...oh, that complimentary, abnormally good conditioner. If your mane is part lion like my own, you probably understand that hotel conditioners (most often ""conditioning shampoo"") are weak to put it gently. So, first off, I want to applaud the Brown Hotel for sporting some killer conditioner yo! (Snaps, smiles, high fives all around)Other reasons I fancied my experience:-friendly and helpful staff-spacious rooms that make me think ""Kentucky"" and ""old money"" all rolled into one-historical charm that oozes throughout the architecture and interior design of the building-fantastic walkability- my morning walk led me to fourth street in around ten minutes-lastly, the fact that this is the original source of Kentucky's famous hot brown sandwich- how great is that, right?-I'm holding the fifth star (mainly half a star) because they could really use a vent in the bathrooms (steamy!) and the gal working the gift shop was less than friendly on the friendly spectrumHot Brown!  The only reason I went was to check it out.  Saw it a bunch of times on tv so I had to check it out.  People, this dish lives up to the hype. Out here on business and this was a destination spot before I headed south for work.  It's a big dish so you might to split it with your date but it wasn't a challenge for me since I had been flying all day.  Turkey is brined in house, cooked off and added to the Mornay sauce, Texas toast, and house cured bacon.  There was a group of about 8 people and every single one of them ordered the Hot Brown.  Good choice!  And too bad I had a long drive because the bar has about 50 bottles of the local Kentucky liquid gold.  It's a old hotel (built in 1920s - thanks for the history Greg(?)).  Anyway, you'll have  stop in and have one.  You won't be pegged a tourist if you order one.This hotel is seriously beautiful and a really great experience.  They have preserved the 1920's feel of the hotel in a great way.  The rooms are definitely more traditionally decorated and the bathrooms are on the small side, but it wasn't an issue for us.  We upgraded to the deluxe room so we had a nice large sitting area and walk in closet as well which was nice. The staff were great and super accommodating.  We had just gotten a new car, and asked the valet to try to park it away from other cars if he could- and he actually put cones around our car for us!  It's within walking distance of some great restaurants and conveniently located in general.  Will definitely be adding this to the top of the list of places to stay in Louisville!An art nouveau treasure.  If you enjoy beautiful spaces, you would enjoy eating here.  I haven't stayed at the hotel overnight, but I have eaten at the bar several times.  Sure, you're going to be sitting with a lot of middle aged dudes in polo shirts and golf hats, but you can imagine that once upon a time there were young hipsters wearing white pants and navy blazers dancing the night away.   When those guys (and their flapper gals) got tired, they needed a late-night snack.  And what the Brown Hotel came up with for them was the hot brown sandwich.   A calorie bomb consisting for two slices of bread, turkey, bechamel sauce, parmesan cheese, and topped with two strips of bacon since before bacon was cool, the hot brown will really hit the spot.  Basically if you come to Louisville and haven't had a hot brown, you've wasted your trip!   The drinks are way expensive, but you may as well get something with bourbon since you're in Kentucky.   Oh, and since the hot brown isn't sufficiently calorie-rich, you'd better finish with a slice of derby pie....mmmm.....   Last tip, for some reason, the hot brown is a few bucks cheaper if you get it in the bar as opposed to in the restaurant.I had seen the Brown on TV and since I was in Louisville I decided to drop by and try the famous ""Hot Brown"" sandwich. It did not disappoint!  This sandwich is probably one of the top 10-20 things I have ever eaten in my life and that's no exaggeration. Eating in the lobby bar at The Brown made it even better. What an amazing place!  The decor is immaculately preserved right out of the 1920s and the hotel is stunningly beautiful. The waitress was a lot of fun, the staff was extremely friendly, and having a whiskey list with 50+ choices really sets this place apart. Free valet parking for diners helps too!Old style hotel. Maybe, doesn't have all the features the new build have,  but what's matter have, people who care. Excellent customer care. One small gesture, I was reading in the lobby when employee approached me and asked: ""Would you like a glass of water"". That doesn't happen often.What a wonderful getaway! The food was amazing and the room was incredible. The staff was very responsive and every request was done quickly with a smile.Beautifully restored hotel! My date wanted to try the original Kentucky Hot Brown and Kentucky Derby Pie. Since we shared, they split our plate without prompting; always a nice thing! Both items were delicious, but my favorite was the pie.With the caveat that I did not stay here, I did spend a bunch of time here for a conference.This is a nice historic hotel and the staff are very friendly.  The venue was very good for a conference.  I would have stayed here, but the rooms were full when I booked.Definitely and interesting place.This is an update to a previous review...spent several nights at the Brown in December and have to say the service staff was outstanding and my room(s) were extremely comfortable and of course the food, whether at the bar or room service was just excellent.  If you've got to be stuck somewhere over Christmas...the Browns not a bad place to be.Drove down to try the Hot BrownFor Valentines Day with my sweetie. He made reservations for our special occasion. We decided to split a hot brown and their special of the day which was supposed to be a pulled pork sandwich with Cajun onion rings.The hot brown was so delicious, smooth and creamy sauce that smothered the crustless lightly toasted bread with a generous cut of tender juicy turkey. We wished we didn't have to share the portion. It was perfect.","The most important aspects of a stay at any hotel is bed comfort, cleanliness, quiet.The beds are made with a flat sheet on the bottom, so before you even get in bed, turning down the top un-makes the bed. Sleep in it for an hour and it looks someone dumped a pile of laundry on a mattress. The bedding is of low quality, polyester feel. The room is clean, 550$ gets you that. The lobby and street level area ( lobby is on the second floor) not so clean. Classic, beautiful public areas, but dirty carpet, worn furniture, big messes of wires very visible. Full trash cans downstairs, loose handles on main entry doors.Staff is noisy in the halls. Engineering can be heard doing maintenance. Doors are allowed to slam shut by housekeeping (a supervisor with a clipboard)Service was great. Plumbing is definitely OLD.  Shower was a bit dark because of the shower curtain, but none of these factors would deter us from returning. I only mention this for the more discerning customers.The room was gigantic with a couch. We went with  2 other couples, and the large room size lended itself to socialization with our other friends.  The gift shop in the basement is nice and includes a large selection of Bourbon Barrell Foods, and other large-brand bourbon products (candy, sauces, etc).  We ate at the more expensive restaurant in the hotel and it was excellent.  I got the Hot Brown, because it's legendary.  It was good, but I recommend getting a salad and sharing the Hot Brown with someone else.  It was heavy and high in fat, and you really can't eat all of it.   Our friends got a Hot Brown at other restaurants in town, and it did not compare to the one at The Brown Hotel.  This is definitely the best looking/tasting one we saw and found. :)Great place! Love everything about this hotel it's such a charmer! I've stayed here 3 times and every time was spectacular! Can't wait to go back!We absolutely loved this hotel. Great old world charm, loved the bar in the hotel lobby for an old fashion or manhattan and truffle fries. It was as good as it gets. Then we walked everywhere else to do our bourbon tasting. Great location to restaurants and bars in downtown.Okay so I just returned from Louisville and while I was there the wife and I tried the famous Hot Brown sandwich. I may have given a 4th star under different circumstances. Well I must say the flavor profile was delicious as you can imagine. The only problem I had was the excessive and I mean excessive amount of pure oil in the dish. This oil is a by product of bacon, cheese and over buttered toast points. Way to much residual oil on the plate. I actually watched another patron ask for paper napkins to dab off the collection of grease on her plate. I wish I would have had the courage to ask for paper napkins in a linen napkin type lobby bar. There is little texture profile in this dish, I expected a crunch of the toast points but was met with soggy over buttered crouton like toast.  I was disappointed by the service, it was lacking indeed. We arrived at the lobby literally 3 minutes before opening and were told they were opening shortly. well after it turned 3 o'clock I again asked if they were open, I was given a slightly snarky answer and proceeded to sit with my wife. It was quite awhile before the single bartender (Forest) took our order, The place was filling up fast and no help was given to Forest, the only guy making drinks, taking food orders, delivering food, filling water glasses basically doing the work of 3 to 4 staff members by himself. All the while a well dressed young manager type walked around asking how we were doing. Ultimately this fella  needed to help Forest with the grunt work and  after A while he finally had no choice but to do work. I understand southern charm and a slow relaxed approach to a meal but this was excessive. I am very happy I had the experience of the famous Brown Hotel and its classic dish but if this were any other place I may not have been so kind with my review. You cant rest on tradition and reputation alone you must always remember the customer experience is number one!I have to include this bit of information to my review. My wife and I went to J. Graham's Cafe earlier in the day around 9 or 10 am in search of a  bloody Mary. I must say this experience was absolutely FANTASTIC. The bartender, manager and other staff members were GREAT! The Friday morning (4-24-2015) manager and his staff should teach the others a lesson in hospitality, thank you guys! I returned later in the day with the expectation of the same treatment, this didn't work out so good. All in all it was a really fun time experiencing a piece of Kentucky history in a fabulous city.Beautiful room! We would stay here again if we and the chance. Check in was a little hectic, valet guys were friendly nice guys and you gotta grab that hot brown!Stayed here this past weekend for 2 nights. Lovely hotel, nicely decorated and very clean. Unfortunately, our room was right by the elevator (1025) and it was so loud with people waiting for the elevator that I barely slept either night. I should have requested another room, but didn't. This room is also directly above the valet stand, which can get loud. Request a room not by the elevator and you should have a better experience! If we were in town again, we would definitely consider this hotel.I heard about this place when I was googling about Louisville. I heard about how beautiful the inside was with all of its history. Those reviews were all right. This place is amazing inside, the attention to detail, the ceilings, the wood carving, the history, it was all so beautiful. We didn't stay here, but it was definitely worth walking to and checking out the inside.My boyfriend and I sat down at the Lobby bar and had a few Bourbon drinks and the bartender Forrest was so nice and extremely informative. He helped us plan what Bourbon Distilleries we were going to go to the next day. He also gave us some good insights on things we have to do while in town.This is my favorite place to stay downtown. It's like taking a step back in preserved time. The staff was incredible and the place is always immaculate.First time ever being here.  Service was a bit slow and more than just in the nice place slow meal kind of way.  Probably backed up a bit because they had only one bartender.  I of course got the Hot Brown.  It was very good, but I've had one or two others that I prefer a bit more.  Mostly the sauce was a bit lacking in flavour.  The bacon and turkey were both higher quality than most places, however.A very nice place to visit because of the history and the great food. I would definitely go back. The Ali Smash is a great drink &amp; I really enjoyed the truffle fries. We ate in the lobby bar and that was great to people watch and have a casual lunch. The Hot Brown is incredible and not overly heavy with the sauce which I thought it would be.I love historic hotels -- especially those with southern charm, and this definitely fit the bill.  Stayed here on government rate, and at check-in, they asked to see my government ID.  Local government IDs accepted -- just an FYI.  If you plan to stay here on government rate, you will have to call or email regarding the rate.Parking here is kind of pricey - it's either $16 or $20, depending on if you want in &amp; out privileges.  For me, I was only going to stay in Louisville overnight with no ins and outs, so I paid $16 for overnight parking versus $20 (in and out privileges).  The hotel is conveniently located in downtown Louisville with lots of restaurants and night life in the nearby vicinity.  Because the hotel is located in a downtown area, a late night walk can feel a bit sketch.  However, nothing happened during my walk around downtown -- even at 10-11pm.My room was quite roomy, well appointed, and historic feeling -- just the way I liked it.  The only issue I had was that the window in my room was slightly ajar and I couldn't close it.  It was kind of late by the time I figured out why there was a draft in my room, so I didn't bother calling maintenance to fixing the issue.  So as a recommendation to anyone coming to stay here, check your window and make sure it's closed (or you can close it!).Other great perks about this place is free internet and very friendly staff.   Oh... I also really love the architecture of the hotel lobby.  When you step inside, you feel like you've stepped back in time -- back to the early 1900's -- a feeling that you don't get with many modern hotels these days.  Just hanging out in the lobby really makes you appreciate the beauty of the art &amp; architecture from yesteryear.Hands down it's THE HOT BROWN! Add in a Woodford Reserve bourbon and now you are living babycakes ! Add to that the 90 year old surroundings and a polite polished staff and you've got something you can ONLY do in Louisville Kentucky in this one sweet spot. A city to behold beauties too! What's in the water because ... WOW!we had a fair experience here.-1 for starters, their website never sent a confirmation email after having made the reservation+1 for professional, courteous, and on-the-ball staff.  the level of service we received throughout our stay was far above average.  not just front desk, but also valet staff, cleaning crew, etc.+1 for a beautiful lobby.  clearly, the hotel is using the lobby as its focal point.-1 for dated decor, even in the lobby.  the furniture could use some steam-cleaning.  various improvements could be made that would make a big difference.-1 for a smaller-than-expected king room.+1 for a larger-than-expected bathroom, by area.  however, the space wasn't all usable.-1 for a TV remote that didn't work.+1 for drapes that actually keep the room dark.+0 for average quality linens.  not what we were expecting from a hotel like this.-1 for being stingy with towels.  2 sets of towels, with no extras whatsoever.-1 for no refrigerator in the room.-1 for completely average workout room.  a couple treadmills, a couple ellipticals, and one stationary machine.  pretty small.+1 for great drinks at the lobby bar.  specifically, my wife loved the mint julep.  my bourbon flight was pretty good.-1 for not a great part of town.tip:  avoid parking in the hotel garage.  there is a $3/day lot caddy-corner from the brown, and a $2/day lot southwest of the hotel off of 5th street.for what we paid, i had higher expectations.  recommended for the historical experience, but other than that, you can find better elsewhere.The lobby is awe-inspiring. I think I'll need a neck massage due to my perpetual staring at the ceiling. Truly, this hotel is beautiful. I only stayed one night, but The Brown earned high marks from me. The rooms themselves aren't too much to write home about. Yes, the beds are comfortable. You'll find the typical amenities like a flat screen TV, desk, free WiFi (not the most consistent signal) and decent sized bathroom. Frankly, if it were just based on the room, I'd dole out just three stars. But there's more...The staff at this hotel are nothing short of fantastic. They are friendly and helpful without being intrusive. They remember your name even if you've only been there a few hours. That, my friends, is impressive. Special high five to the bellmen and Nicole in the lobby bar. The neighborhood is pretty cool and many of the surrounding areas are being rehabbed and developed. I'd stay at The Brown again and certainly make my way back to the lobby bar for another cocktail.Be sure to stop in at the Brown Hotel, second floor lobby bar when you're in Louisville. Try an Old Fashioned and the crispy pork belly sliders. Let the knowledgeable bar tender select the bourbon for the drink but ""slap the hands"" of anyone who tries to sample your sliders... the jam served on the side is outstanding! Just an enjoyable time.Can't get enough of those Hot Browns!  Very flavorful and rich, but not overly-filling in the way that makes you feel regret after eating.I had a couple Hot Browns from the lobby bar while I was staying at the Brown Hotel for the weekend.  I'll really miss them as they don't serve them in my part of the country.The only thing that could improve is the cocktails (mine was so sweet it was almost undrinkable) and the service was a bit slow for how few people were there.Came for the hot brown, got maimed by the womens bathroom toilet paper holder!This 'sandwich"" is really a hot bubbly yum fest. Watch out, you will tip the scales afterwards.  Its heavy cream, butter and flour which tastes divine.  Then, some yummie texas toast and real turkey breast topped with bacon.  We ordered one and they split it for us, how nice!  We each had our our little griddle plate. Then I used the rest room and BAM!  Ouch! That toilet paper dispenser is a killer...seriously, thought my arm was broken, beware ladies!$16 for the sammie and not price tag high enough for the way my elbow spazes when the weather changes now....lolI stayed at The Brown Hotel on a recent work trip to Louisville. The historic hotel (built in the 1920's) is long on charm. The art deco  style has been well preserved throughout the hotel and 1920's jazz is played softly in the hotel lobby. The staff were extremely friendly. My room was very spacious and very nicely appointed with portraits of horses and equestrians (the hotel is located near the Kentucky Derby afterall). The only thing I wasn't completely enamored with was the bathroom, the shower drain was clogged and the water pressure was very low. But kudos for the free WiFi throughout the entire hotel! The location was also good, only 3 blocks from the downtown Louisville nightlife. Overall, The Brown is a fabulous historic hotel in a great location for exploring Louisville.I may have developed a delicate drawl, just by staying here for one night. Amazing!It's hard not to feel transformed for a moment while surrounded by the historic, elegant and grand decor. And even though ""Southern Belle"" in me really didn't appear, as I sat in the regal lobby full of antique furniture and leather sofas, I kind of felt like I should have a Mint Julep in my hand. The rooms were nice, albeit a little old-fashioned and it kind of annoyed me that the TV has to be awkwardly pulled out and angled towards the bed. The bathroom is simple and the closet space is huge (although not sure who would need that much space unless they planned an extended visit.)I even had a chance to visit the restaurant and try the infamous, Hot Brown sandwich!Overall, I had a pretty good experience here although I'm not sure that I would recommend it for anyone looking for a hip, fun place to stay. However, for the historic value alone I think it's worth the stay!","I frequently stay at The Brown for work. I have a few things I genuinely like and others I don't particularly care for.Positives:When you first walk you're greeted by a very polite staff and walk above to one of the nicest lobbies I have stood in. The honeycomb-style ceiling is the main feature because it is so detailed and in pristine condition. The same can be said for the old timey decor and registration desk. It's a beautiful place to get married.The food and drinks are excellent. The birthplace of the Hot Brown. Can't go wrong.It's a great location. Blocks away from Fourth Street Live.Negatives:Not the most ideal for extended stays unless you're a ghost. There are rumors of unexplained happenings in the hotel. Adds to the hotels fun and intrigue for some.The old timey feel follows you throughout the hotel. The halls are creepily decorated with side tables stacked with books and one chair. Retro restraint would be greatly appreciated in the common areas.The same can be said for the rooms. It a crap shoot if you'll have a great room or a eerie room. My last room was very nice. All the bathrooms are nicely updated. However, the rooms haven't been as nice due to the layout and decor. I think I'm more accustomed to a more modern ambiance.Overall:I like the hotel. Incredible for a boutique stay or big wedding. The food is excellent. I would like to feel more comfortable in my rented room. I would walk from another hotel to enjoy their bar and restaurant.Not bad at all. Good location. Great decor. Room was spacious and very clean. Could use some modernization like more updated gym equipment, better plumbing and tv. The best part of my stay was the housekeeping...they get 5 out of 5 for me but overall the hotel is 4 stars. I'd definitely come back.How can you come to Louisville and not get a Hot Brown from the Brown Hotel?! You may want to skip a meal or 3 before ordering this mass of deliciousness as it contains your daily suggested calories in a single meal. Don't believe me? Google it. I won't list the entire list of ingredients but let's just say that 14 oz of turkey, 2 oz of whole butter and 16oz of heavy cream are just the beginning!Looking back at the list of ingredients, I think it contains more than a day's worth of calories. And since we were on a fat kid binge, why not top off such a great meal with a slice of derby pie?! This place is not to be missed and whatever you order, make sure to get at least one hot brown to share at your table. It is a Louisville icon and worth every once of heavy cream it contains! My mouth waters just thinking about it.Hotel may be okay, but their people are unaccountable for their actions ( like not leaving enough light in a very dark hallway leading to the bathrooms.  My elderly father didn't see 4 or 5 steps that lead down to the bathrooms and fell, landed on his head.  He had to be rushed to the hospital and when we asked The Brown Hotel what they were going to do about this, we were told that my father should have been more careful - although they admitted it was ""a little hard to see."" ... They don't accept responsibility and I have nothing good to say about the arrogant people who work there.I stayed here for Kentucky Derby 2014. The Brown Hotel is beautifully preserved, with attractive historical decor and architecture, modern bathrooms, perfectly comfy beds and linens, and wonderfully professional and friendly service.I'm usually cautious of old hotels because sometimes they rest on their laurels and end up being creepy, creaky and spooky. This is NOT the case of The Brown Hotel. It is the best combination of modern and traditional.My Mother learned to make Hot Browns back in the early 30's and the recipe was passed on to me and I have been making them the same way for 50 years. What you get at the Brown Hotel bears little resemblance to the original. They seem to be using 3/4"" thick breast slices off of some type of turkey roll that they no doubt purchase from a food vendor such as Sysco.  I suppose it is not unenjoyable for the novice and the Mornay sauce is passable but the whole thing is only about 20% as good as what it could and should be.What can i say about the ""hot brown"". Sounds kinda awkward, but its actually an open faced turkey sandwich with a mornay cheese sauce, roasted tomato, and bacon. I think a part of me died when i took my first bite, because i swear i saw heaven. Food was really delicious and the service was quick and polite. Definitely would go back to kentucky to eat here againStaying at this hotel was a wonderful experience.  I stayed for two nights as part of a wedding party.  The decor in this place is awesome.  I was expecting it to be tacky and weird, but it looks amazing.  It is certainly over the top but it definitely works!  It is expensive considering it's in downtown Louisville but I was able to book at a lower rate due to being military ($107/night).  My room was awesome.  The best part was the view.  I was on the 8th floor and my bathroom had an entire wall that was just windows.  I could see downtown Louisville while taking a pee!  Amazing.  The bed was very comfortable and the room was immaculate.  The one thing that kinda but a damper on the charm was the ugly tub.  It was your average tub you can find at a cheap motel, but whatever.  Also, the pillow top on the bed is incredibly hot.  I woke up in the middle of the night sweating my ass off even though the temperature in the room was quite cool.  One thing that was slightly annoying was the fact that there are no signs pointing to the parking lot.  I had to drive around for a while to find it.  But it's just next to the hotel.  As soon as you pass the valet drop off, take an immediate right.  Parking is $20 a day FYI.  But it's safe and it has a bridge that connects it to the hotel lobby.  I had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend it.  I would stay again if I can find a low rate again!We didn't stay at the Brown Hotel.  We only stopped in briefly for a hot brown.  We felt kind of scuzzy after driving 12 hours and definitely would not have fit in at their fancy restaurant.  Luckily the lobby bar served the same food and at a cheaper price.  The food was good, but overpriced and the cocktail that I had was watered down and didn't seem to have a drop of alcohol in it, but I got to scratch another regional food off my list and the hotel was beautiful (at least the parts we saw).  My boyfriend said that it reminded him of The Shining.  I give it four stars only because I think we were delirious and that hot brown was definitely worth the hype.This hotel is absolutely gorgeous! The front desk staff was professional and very efficient. The elevators were amazingly quick! It was often a comment made by others while in the elevator with them. Rooms were clean and decorated nicely. Bathrooms were large as well! Beautiful decorations throughout the hotel. I am more than eager to return.I feel like this place needs to be reviewed from 2 different perspectives. The building side of things and the actual operation as a hotel side of it. I'll start with the building, which is immaculate. The lobby is fantastic, the intricate detail in all of the architecture is gorgeous, and if you have a chance to take a peek into the ballroom you will be thoroughly impressed. It really is a magnificent building, and they did a great job of keeping it on top of its game for being 90 years old. The outside isn't much to look at, but it is in a great location that is easily walkable to a lot of places. It even has an attached parking garage that is complimentary parking if you stay at the hotel, or it has an hourly rate if you just wanted to park somewhere off the street. Inside the building you will find many accommodations beyond hotel rooms, including an old fashioned bar in the lobby, a restaurant, and plenty of space to sit or walk around and marvel at what's around you. I think this would be an awesome place to have an event.Now, onto the hotel side of things. The staff at the front was extremely nice and very professional. They got us all checked in very quickly and made sure we had everything we need. Then, it was off to the rooms. This is where things went south. As nice as the old architecture and charm is that this building has to offer in its lobby, ballroom, and restaurant; it is lost on the hotel rooms. The rooms themselves just don't have the old charm, and really don't offer a lot more than just a standard upper-scale hotel anywhere, new or old. It actually feels a little old fashioned without the uniqueness that sometimes that can provide. Where it really lags behind is the feeling that the walls are made of paper. You can hear every single word of an averaged noise level conversation coming both from the hallway and from the rooms next to you. It was really awkward to be able to hear other people talking that clearly from their own rooms. The amenities in the room were all nice, the rooms were very clean, and the beds were comfortable, although the giant piece of furniture used to hide the TV was kind of odd and required you to pull out the TV and turn it if you wanted to see it. Again, the majority of the actual room itself was pretty much average for what I would expect based on the price of this place anywhere else.Due to a deal that was running at the time which included 2 free breakfast buffets if you purchased with a Visa card, we had the opportunity to hit that in the morning. I would have been very disappointed if I had purchased what we got for the full price. It was much better food than any free continental breakfast you will find, but it was your standard fruit, breakfast meats, eggs, breads, biscuits and gravy (that was empty when we were there), potatoes, and so on. Not even remotely close to the $16 price tag that was on it. I feel like we missed out by not getting the famous hot brown here, but it just wasn't in the cards during this visit. In conclusions, I was awed by the building, but disappointed by the room. The service we got from all the employees we met was top notch. The location is great, but I think I will still probably look at other hotels around the area if I decide to come back and visit 4th St. again. The amount it costs you if you just need a place to stay and are not planning on taking in the whole Brown experience with their public spaces and dining options just feels like it can be better spent elsewhere. Based on my experience, I'm probably at more of a 3.5 stars, but I'm giving it 3 because I'm just not impressed enough for the 4th. If I was having an event here and wanted to wow some people or was spending a bunch of time in the hotel, I think I'd probably be much more generous with the rating.Good base for weekend trip.  this was a good location driving from the airport, just a couple blocks before the 4th street scene. easy access to hotel from Broadway and then leaving out for our day excursions. they provided come and go garage access for $20 per day. 2nd floor lobby bridge to parking garage. all of the hotel employees were super nice and friendly. this is  an old historic hotel with a little wear and tear. the mattress was nice which is actually the most important feature to me. our bathroom was large and had two windows. we will definitely return to the Brown if we get a good rate. It was interesting to try something different than a new hotel. Thanks Brown. Oh and the best part, there were no sightings of drunk bachelorette parties (perhaps a sign of the civilized customers?) but you can see plenty of bachelorette girls on the streets closer to the river.This hotel was the perfect place for a mini getaway for my husband and I. We had a little trouble finding parking and wish the parking garage was marked a little better. The valet was incredibly nice and pointed us in the right direction. The check in process was great. The staff were very nice and helpful. We stayed in a queen room and it was perfect for us. The bathroom was huge and comfortable. The bath and shower were large and clean. The room was spacious and well appointed. We did not order room service but I'm sure it would have been easy to do. We will be staying here again.Best hotel in Louisville!My family and I stay here every year for Thanksgiving and it's a great experience, year in, and year out.I've never met a staff member here who wasn't over the top friendly, polite, and helpful. Truly a high caliber of service- they make you feel like you're their most important guest, every time you visit! The lobby is breath taking. Historic, and beautiful. Ornate, and cozy at the same time. Enjoy drinks on the sofas with friends, or maybe some derby pie, and you can listen to the piano play. We do a cocktail hour down here with friends the night before thanksgiving every year, and it feels like you're in another world- so much fun, and so relaxing. The drinks are a bit pricey, but well worth it. When it's cold, they make a great Irish coffee, and we love their lemon drops. The little dishes of bar snacks are also super tasty.If you stay here, you HAVE to get the famous sandwich...the hot brown! If you want to be totally lazy, and totally happy- do what we do, and order it from room service in your pajamas for breakfast. They'll bring up a whole table, drinks, coffee, creamer, sugar, milk- the works. The hot browns are huge, and they'll pre-split them for you if you'd like to share. I can't even being to describe the actual sandwich, because I wouldn't do it justice. Just know that it's a cheesy, bacony, turkey dream. The shop downstairs has awesome finds- wonderful for gifts, and treats for yourself. Everything from jewelry to perfume, to cooking supplies and books. If it's open, you can wander into the art gallery up front. Great location if you want to check out the downtown area! But nothing in Louisville is too far of a drive anyways. Definitely stay here!We were guest at a wedding reception Saturday. The dinner was in the Crystal Ballroom. It is a beautiful room. The food was good and the service was great. Make sure and go see the gingerbread house the pastry chef made on display in the lobby!If you travel to Louisville, you must stay at the Brown.  There is no other way to go.  During the cold months, they have hot chocolate and apple cider in the lobby to warm you up.  I look forward to their hot apple cider every winter!  The hotel is very old, but it is updated with clean, rich furnishings.  The beds are incredibly comfortable.  If you're hungry, march yourself down to the bar and order a Hot Brown or a burger.  I don't know what it is, but their burger is to die for.  The selection of bourbon is outstanding as well.The Brown is quintessential Louisville in the 1920's, with the decor and service to match. Step in the lobby, and feel the history. Walk into your room, decorated in horses, and appreciate the feeling of yesteryear. The flatscreen hanging on the wall feels out of place.I had the luxury of staying on the Club Level, which gives you access to a private lounge with a full breakfast and cocktails during the evening. While this concept is so uppity and exclusive it makes me cringe, I can tell you that I greatly appreciated it. Granted, I may have gotten strange looks from the standard 50-something business men that all filled the breakfast room, but totally worth it. The rooms are nice-sized, clean, and comfortable. Bathrooms are quite large. Beds were a tad hard for me, but I'm a bit picky there. They do have a fitness room with 2 treadmills and 3 ellipticals. Nothing fancy, but gets the job done if you need it.The true highlight is definitely the lobby. Have a drink and relax awhile. Oh, and try a Hot Brown.Top notch! Me and my wife enjoyed our recent stay here. We are Louisville natives and stayed here on our honeymoon before we flew out to Miami. From the moment we were dropped off we were pampered. We arrived on a Saturday and were dropped off by our driver. The bellhop was friendly and fast. From there we climbed up stairs into the lobby. The lobby has and old world charm with lots of old school details. Our room was great. Huge king size bed with awesome bedding. The views were amazing. I usually love the more modern hotels but fell in love with the brown. Felt like we stepped back in time. On complaint I have was we had a room facing broadway and it was very noisy at night. Also the down mattress pad was too hot for us. I would highly recommend this for anyone looking to get the full Louisville experience. This is for sure a Louisville gem. Don't forget to get a hot brown too!This is a ""must stop"" destination whenever I'm in Louisville. Without question, they have one of my favorite lobbies to relax and refresh. The service has always been superior...whether as a guest of the hotel, or simply enjoying one (or more) of the bourbons offered on this stop along the Urban Bourbon Trail. Three other members of my family that have stayed here would offer the same review. Keep up the great work.Lovely, just lovely.Having spent a lot of time in New Orleans, I tend to be skeptical of the boutique/historic hotel scene.  They can be run-down and a little gurvy with limited amenities and very small rooms.  That is not case with the Brown.  The decor is gorgeous and well-maintained.  You feel like you're walking back to the 1930's, it's just that beautiful.  The rooms are clean and have plenty of space.  The bed was uber comfortable.As part of your room fee you get free valet parking and a free continental breakfast that was pretty luxe.  Everyone was super nice and it's walking distance to most of the best restaurants and bars in Louisville.  I would definitely stay here again!","I had lunch in the Brown and had to walk around. It was so nice, so much history. I would be great if the walls could talk at this place. I did not stay, but did look around the place. I might stay her on another trip. You have to stop in if your in Louisville.If you are a frequent traveller you typically have a chain you stay loyal to so as to collect perks for a free vacation somewhere exotic.  I subscribe to the notion 95% of the time.  The Brown hotel is a must stay for my when I visit Louisville.  It is old, ornate and full of history.  The lobby is a stunner...I could just sit there and drink a bourbon all afternoon (that may interfere with business though).  As many reviews note they are purported to be the creators of the Hot Brown sandwich.  This decadent open faced sandwich is something you need to enjoy at least once.  I would have photographed it, but my wife already scorned me earlier this year for taking a photo of a Horseshoe sandwich in Springfield IL...something about Lipitor not being as cool as I make it sound.The bar makes a mean mint julip and the bourbon selection is top notch, as to be expected.  The area around the hotel has some nice dining options and night life, so if looking to entertain clients young or old you can find something for everyone.Rooms are a good size and the service is above and beyond what you get at most boutique / historic North American hotels.I took a chance with Hotwire and lucked out by scoring this hotel!  The things that were outstanding were the service from all of the front end staff as well as the amazing immacuately detailed lobby.  If you stay here, definitely take some time and check it out.  Our room was clean, spacious and adorned with adequate outlets.  (and excellent soap, shampoo and conditioner)I stayed here for 1 night in July, 2014.The valet and front desk staff were very personable and friendly.My room and bathroom were clean and the bed was comfortable.  Housekeeping staff were also attentive.The hotel is gorgeous and in a great location.So I didn't try the famous Hot Brown sandwich... but I hear it's great and I'll have to return to try it next visit.  I also didn't experience any ""haunted"" at this hotel but I didn't look for it either; I was preoccupied with a busy and fun first visit to Louisville!After staying two nights at this charming historic hotel, I can tell you that I'm a fan!  There is a free shuttle that they provide to and from the airport, which is a nice touch... and justifies the slightly elevated price point in my eyes!All of the staff I came into contact with (from the bell men, shuttle drivers, front desk, and maid) were extremely friendly, and my room was spacious and comfortable.  They provided me a refrigerator upon request, and I actually made it to the fitness room on one of the mornings for a quick workout.  I lucked out and was given access to the thirteenth floor lounge where they provided complimentary continental breakfast and refreshments... loved that!The ice machine was broken on my floor during my visit which wasn't a huge deal, but worth mentioning.  The bathroom wasn't spic and span clean either but everything mentioned above makes up for that.  The Brown provided a comfortable place to hang my hat (since my luggage was delayed in arriving) and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again next visit to Louisville.Famous for the original Hot Brown, every one in Kentucky makes it.. Just not as well .. It's worth the trip.. Their take on a Cobb salad is different and very goodCame here for a business dinner in the English Grill.  Our experience may be different as it was Derby weekend.Food was delicious, service was impeccable.  Prices were ridiculous, did I mention work paid?  Markup on drinks were 100% over our dinner the next night at Morton's.If you want a fancy dinner with a level of old world snootiness, this is your place.When in Louisville the Brown is the place to stay. Elegant and efficient.  Always just right.Wonderful historic hotel.  Rooms are beautiful and good size for an old hotel.  We upgraded our reservation and stayed on the club level.  Enjoyed a late lunch in the lobby bar--bourbon and a steaming hot Hot Brown.I love this hotel. It's classic old school charming.The bar is cool, and they have this MOST delicious sandwich named after the hotel that is decadent and too good. Only try it once, it has that many calories and is rich beyond belief...but try it once.The bartenders are cool. The staff is of the utmost professionalism.It is in a prime downtown location, walking distance to pretty much everything.A great venue for an event as well.Top class.Two thumbs up.ps I have heard the stories about being haunted. I have never experienced that. It's just an old building.Booked on Hotwire.Almost glad that the Galt House - where we normally stay was booked b/c this will be my new go to hotel in Louisville.Service was excellent and decor was very old world with the plush overstuffed coaches and grand piano in the corner.  My room was nice and the bed very comfortable.  Free wifi, lots of cable TV and located within walking distance of many restaurants and bars.  The walls to the hallway are a tad thin - so I could never tell if someone was trying to break into my room or open the door across the hall.$20 per night for parking / $24 if it's valet.  Park on the 2nd floor and take the walkway straight into the lobby.  Checkout a breeze.The service is impeccable.  From bell, to front desk to the awesome bar in lobby.  ok, the bar in lobby is so cool.  loved the high ceilings and the ""old school"" feeling in there.  The rooms are surprisingly large, and had no issues with water, drainage, or AC. The beds are comfy and overall good quality. I would def stay here again.I stayed at this hotel for a conference on the property. The building itself is amazing with its tall ceilings, marble floors, particular details, and extravagant lighting. The staff is polite and accommodating. I was there two days and every interaction I had was positive.The room is unusually spacious and unique. There is nothing plain about the place!The leather chair in my room was so comfortable and the beds were equally as nice. The food is unbelievable. I can't describe how unique the food was. I had a chicken, asparagus, and mashed potatoes entree that was unbelievable. The food is also presented well. The people that prepare or at least lead the kitchen are culinary experts.Overall, if I'm ever in Louisville, there is only one place I'll stay.What an awesome hotel! I typically don't like ""old world"" hotels (i'm more of a sleek-and-modern kind of guy), but this place is awesome.The service is amazing... from the hotel shuttle to check-in, everyone was beyond friendly and helpful as they could be. My room (although it was a bit of a hike, and registration is on the second -- not ground -- floor) is really well-appointed. It's nothing huge, but it's got a so-comfy king-sized bed, some A/C that kicks ass and free wifi that actually works!The bathrooms are *huge* -- half again as big as the room! Shower is awesome with great temps and pressure. And although the view isn't spectacular, there are windows not only in the bedroom, but also huge windows in the bathroom, flooding the room with light.I didn't try the hot brown, so I can't testify to that, but the hotel stay has been excellent. I'll be back!Gorgeous place... got a great deal on Hotwired... (or we would not have been there...) My son and I stayed in a huge room that was nicely furnished... The lobby bar was one of our favorite places to eat on our roadtrip. The Hot Brown is not to be missed-- also, if you like an Old Fashioned make sure to order one there. I sat in the lobby bar and had two of them and enjoyed reading while listening to the jazz playing in the background. They make a nice OF, by the way..Lots of crushed ice and bourbon. (they accidentally gave me Makers for my first one, but their well is Jim Beam... Not too shabby) ... The staff was young and very helpful. This place is a classic Hotel. Will stay there when I am in Louisville again.It was pretty late by the time we rolled into Louisville but we were starving and a friend had suggested stopping by this hotel, home of the original ""Hot Brown"".I loved the southern charm in the decor, service, and even the other guests sitting around drinking and chatting in the lobby.  The restaurant was closed for the evening but they served food in the lobby bar.The Hot Brown hit the spot!  Texas toast, roast turkey, bacon, and romano cheese makes the list as one of my top comfort food cravings.  When in Louisville, you must try this iconic dish!This review is about the lobby bar/restaurant. Originally, my coworker and I were thinking of going to the English Grill for dinner, but then we saw the brown hotel lobby bar/restaurant and liked how it had similarly great food for reasonable prices in a classy, but still casual atmosphere. I got lobster mac and cheese and was extremely happy to have big chunks of lobster in it. My coworker got the smoked salmon, which looked like some sort of salmon pate with bread. She enjoyed it, but it was not my cup of tea. We had a great dinner and would definitely recommend it!Home to the legendary Kentucky Hot Brown, The Brown Hotel is a historic Louisville landmark and eatery. Erected in 1923, the hotel has withstood the Great Depression and the 1937 flood where the first floor was filled with water. The 16- story hotel encompasses an entire block and includes a restaurant where you can indulge in the delicious Hot Brown.My friends and I came here just for that. We each ordered a Kentucky Hot Brown: an open-faced sandwich served on toast with turkey breast, Mornay sauce, tomatoes and bacon. The meal arrived in a bubbling skillet, ""browned"" to perfection. Aside from ""Mmmmm!"" sounds, we all ate in silence.If you're in Louisville, you need to stop at The Brown Hotel to try this sandwich in its original home!Price per person: $13.00This is a truly magical place! From the art on the wall to the way you are greeted when you pull up. I have stayed here on several occasions and always been throughly pleased. While the price is a little high for people on a budget there is no ground to compare it to many of the cheap hotels around Louisville. The rooms are comfortable with beds that make you feel like a king. Staff is friendly and will go out of their way to assist you. Food at both restaurants is suburb and gives you a true taste for Kentucky cooking. The architecture in the lobby goes great with a drink in hand. If you have an opportunity to stay here I encourage you to take advantage of it!This place was awesome! We had a fantastic bartender and server, and I had an awesome and rare bourbon on the bartender's recommendation (the Old Forester Birthday edition...yum!). Definitely a place to go back to.","['excellent', 'hotel', 'everyone', 'bell', 'boys', 'front', 'desk', 'room', 'service', 'housekeeping', 'superb', 'extremely', 'friendly', 'extremely',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/galt-house-hotel-louisville-2,Galt House Hotel,3.0,$$$,205,"The only reason we stayed at Galt House was because of tremendous corporate discount we were eligible for. We got a deluxe suite with a riverview on the 7th floor (?)  Yes the room is outdated and yes the sofa had a rip on the cushion. My son slept on the pullout sofa we had to call room service to request sheets and blankets.  Our daughter slept on one queen and us on the other in the bedroom section.  At night we actually was able to hear the guests in the next room we just turned our tv louder to drown out the sound of their party.The beds were very comfortable, having a hospitality background my nature is to see little details that could have used extra attention.  Garbage cans needed plastic liners, replace or repair furniture, (ripped sofa cushion, scratched armoire, dresser and on  office desk)Parking was either $25 for valet or $15 for self parking. Save your $10 self parking was not so bad. The location is very convenient and within walking distance to eating establishments.Yes we would go back only if using a discount.Really wish I would have saw these reviews before I stayed here. The front desk was great and super nice. Stayed at the Galt house for a week during a work trip in Louisville. The biggest complaint from the group was how uncomfortable the beds were. I personally woke up every hour. Another issue was, I ended up getting lice from the bed sheets. I knew the sheets looked a little dirty, but had no idea those were hiding in there. Lastly, was with the laundry service. They lost one of my shirts, and washed my Southern Tide shirt with a black pen. The front desk told me they would have management call me, but I haven't heard anything and it's been a week now. The worst hotel experience ever.I stayed in a very large suite with a river view for a couple of weeks - it's an older hotel, but not bad. The furniture is very dated, and there were disassembled beds in a couple of the extra rooms, but hey, it was so much bigger than I needed I could just shut some doors and not worry about it. It was very nice to have so much space in the parts of the suite I was using.The gym is very good, and has an excellent view. It's also underused (although most of the hotel's guests would certainly benefit from spending some time there . . . see below), and a great value. Unlike the rooms, the gym is very clean.It's a very large hotel, and as such has some problems that come with that kind of size.To wit:1) There are lots of great employees there, but it can take a long time to get connected to the person who can actually help you. I had to deal with housekeeping, maintenance, front desk staff, and security during my stay, but all calls are routed through the front desk, and that position seems always to be staffed with someone who has been coached to tell you that s/he can't help you with your problem. If you're persistent, you will get the head of housekeeping, or security, or whatever, and those staffers are generally much better.2) The sheer number of rooms is enormous, and many of them are suites, so cleaning takes a long time. Perhaps because the task is so daunting, the cleaning is not at all thorough. I just buckled down and did some things myself, but was really surprised when returning after the room had been ""cleaned"" to see that the kitchen floor had not been mopped, that there was long hair in the tub (I'm a guy with short hair), that the range hadn't been cleaned, etc.3) A number of amenities just don't work. In my suite, it was: the can opener; the bathroom light, which had to continually be reset by flipping the breaker switch in the front of the apartment (until I just unplugged the damn hair dryer); one of the burners on the electric range; the garbage disposer. No doubt these rooms receive a lot of wear and tear (I heard one being trashed below me during a very loud party, which is how I got to know security), but still . . . these suites are equipped for long-term stays for a reason, so it's best to keep everything working.A few more notes:There are a bunch of eateries in the hotel; I tried three of them and they were all average or worse. The location is very convenient, but it's not like an upscale place where you can be very happy without leaving the property . . . you will definitely want to get out.Which brings me to my final observation: this hotel, because of its size, plays host to a never-ending parade of conventions. This means that when you take the elevator or pass through the lobby or one of the other common spaces, you are awash in a sea of loud, overweight, slow-moving people with colorful regional accents. You will certainly know you're in the heart of America. If this is your thing, you'll enjoy all the waits for the elevators, as well as the ear-splitting conversations in them between semi-plastered conventioneers. If it's not, use that hot coastal/big city bod to take the stairs.Probably the most disorganized hotel I have ever been to.It's worth noting that the Galt House is the largest hotel in the United States outside of Las Vegas, which is just interesting to think about since I don't associate Louisville as a tourist hotbed outside of the Kentucky Derby.  On the single day I spent in Louisville, we went to a church service and the first thing I saw was a pamphlet to pray for an end to abortion, then heard a homily on how gay marriage is wrong and finally heard a plea from the priest to give as much money as possible to the church.  My initial impression is that this city wasn't entirely welcoming, especially to this gay loving straight jew.The hotel takes up 2 buildings and it is about as efficient as the Knicks triangle offense.  The parking deck is huge, dimly lit and difficult to navigate.  We arrived at the hotel late on Saturday and unless I had an angry cook like Steven Seagal by my side, I'd consider the lot prime for a mugging or attack.  Finding the room in such a large hotel was also a disaster.We checked into the hotel and found out we were on the 18th floor.  Then we find out that since the elevators are down they are just stopping at every floor.  Imagine stopping at every floor between the 3rd floor and 18th floor with no cell phone reception.  First world problems my friends.The rooms were fair and better than what some of the other reviewers are saying.  The next touchy subject for me was checking out of our room.  I wish you could do it from the room or have some type of quick checkout option, but you have to wait on the line at the front lobby with only 2-3 staff max at the front desk.  Hundreds, if not thousands of guests are checking out at the same time and it took almost a half an hour from us standing on the line to reaching the scary as s**t parking lot.  So we have a terrible parking lot, questionable upkeep with spotty elevators, and manual processes like checking out against reasonable prices and rooms in the heart of Louisville.  Don't say you haven't been warned, book at your own risk.Even after an email from someone at the galt house. I responded to the questions they had and of course two weeks later no response. What a scam, just apologize for the bad room and refund our money. Just got a call from my credit card company Apparently the card I used ONLY at the hotel had its number stolen. This was a brand new card that had never been used anywhere else. So it was probably the checkin clerk that stole my number. Will my nightmare with this hotel ever end. Still have yet to ever hear from hotel. So apparently no one caresuThe line to check in was out of control. I'm a patient person but this was awful. Haven't even been to my room yet and this place leaves a terrible taste in my mouth.****DISCLAIMER: Yelp HQ removed my review, because they claim it made personal attacks. {Shaking my head in confusion}. I adamantly disagree with their bogus claim, because I didn't mention a name, only a description (e.g. male, female, white, African American, etc.) So, I guess yelp, being so obnoxiously ""PC"" we have to now describe people as ""Person A, or Person B."" Well, here's my carefully crafted second review, that does fully comply with yelp tos:Apparently, if you play the Priceline / Hotwire lottery, The Galt House is your winner. For $70 bucks (name my own price), who the hell am I to complain. This massive hotel has its pros and cons. Allow me:PROS:-Great location, within walking distance to all of the nicer bars / restaurants.-Huge, top floor gym, with the most equipment of just about any hotel fitness area that I've seen. Top notch!-A variety of restaurants, and bars, on-site.-This hotel is massive, and has guest shops, a hair salon, liquor store (yes, a liquor store),and a bourbon bar!-Reasonably priced.CONS:-Dated room, with dated furniture (ripped chair)-Bathroom was disgusting, and it appears that there were shit stains on the wall. Seriously, shit stains. -The top sheet on the bed had blood stains. Seriously, discard of these. I threw the sheet on the floor; it needs to be burned.-An indolent, or possibly lethargic (because yelp didn't like the first adjective I used in my review that was removed) employee in the bridge bar. The young employee (since yelp won't allow me to identify him, or possibly her by gender, or race) who kept saying, almost verbatim, ""I donts get paidz enuf fo this shit!"" No lie, this is how the employee spoke. I'm sure yelp has a problem with me describing the employees language skills, but hey, I'm being honest.*Then, young employee (who yelp won't allow me to identify be gender, or race) proceeds to leave the lone, young bartender (who yelp won't allow me to identify by gender, or race) to take care of all of the customers. And, the bar was packed. Side note: Simple economics proves that if the bar is packed, and you at least work somewhat hard, the hard work, along with a good personality will generate more revenue. More patrons=more money. Simple math. But hey, why would anyone want to work for anything these days*-Kind of scary parking garage, that doesn't have a ""secure"" feel to it, at all.The Galt House. Not perfect, but I'd definitely shell out $70 for a hotel room in Downtown Louisville again. But, please- do a better job of cleaning the rooms.3 starsWe booked the Romance on the River package for a special event in our life.....I called the customer service number twice to ask questions and both times spoke with rude people.  Long line to check in....100+ people waiting with 3 employees working the desk.  The room was fine, but you can hear a toilet flush from another room.  Our package came with champagne, we received bubbly wine.  We also had the buffet w/ our package at Cafe Magnolia and the food was mediocre. All said.........very disappointing!  Don't waste your money!Convenient but very dated.  The rooms are much nicer in the first tower, where the main lobby is located.  The pool side tower have a distinct creepy feeling.  I call the hotel the shinning, referring to the movie.  The rooms in the first tower are spacious but dated suites.  Vending &amp; ice machines are located on both ends of the floor.  Not impressed but it serves the purpose.The staff was very friendly when we pulled up and the checkin went smoothly. They even gave us a river view room even though we got a Priceline deal where they assign us whatever kind of room they felt. The rooms are clean. I cannot imagine what their suites are like. Right on the river and pretty close to everything else. Only negatives were: our room did not have a mini fridge and the hallways had a smell which I can't quite define. For the most part a decent, yet iconic hotel.My company booked me a room here and was excited that this hotel was in downtown, on the river, and had a lot of history. The rooms are very outdated and smells a little rusty. Ordered room service and the food was awful. Ordered a side salad and the salad was old, brown, and wilted. The linguini Chicken Alfredo was the worst Alfredo I've ever had. The chicken tasted microwaved and very dry. It wasn't even linguini noodles it was fine angel hair pasta. The Alfredo sauce I can't even describe to you what it tasted like. The room was spacious and had a great view but the mattress was very old and I could feel the springs poking up at me as I tried to get a good nights sleep. Staff who picked up my room service tray outside of my door at 6:30am was singing and woke me up. Oh and to top it off I had no hot water and had to wait awhile to see if it could be fixed. If I were ever to come back to Louisville I would not choose to stay in this hotel.Very nice place to stay if you're in Louisville.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. The accomodations are spectacular.  Hotel is clean inside and out.  Great fitness center, access to the Skywalk and free WiFi are all perks. Great views of the Ohio River as well. If you can afford it stay here. You get what you pay for.The worst hotel i have been in my 18 years of traveling to attend conventions and company meetings Broken head boards, room telephone without buttons, reading chair with no lights..Yes i have pictures  Should avoid if you want to impress clients or friendsDiscounted convention room rate was $130 before fee and taxesOther than the 4,100 (yes that is NOT an exaggeration) children staying the in the complex it's pretty decent.  A ""full service"" hotelier complex not seen much anymore these days. Lots of concierge &amp; personal/grooming services available (all for a nice price). Room was standard fair - but certainly nice. TV was maybe a 36"" and with decent channels. The real reason to stay here is the downtown scene, historical things to see on-site and the shrines to Kentucky horse racing. Walking distance from many downtown destinations (like some Bourbon bars, steak houses, etc.). Right on the river, next to the KFC (Louisville Cardinals) Arena and beautiful when the sun is out. Slightly aged/dingy when wet.Price: really wasn't bad - and if not for the (I kid you NOT) 25 minute wait for an elevator (thanks to 4,100 kids &amp; their chaperons packing into every car) I'd have liked it more.I was so sad by this experience. My best friend threw it out to my other friends when planning my bachelorette party and raved about it from past visits... as soon as we walked into our room, he immediately seemed shocked and appalled that he had lead us here. There was a USED DIRTY UNDERSHIRT on the bed when we walked into the room, which at first made us all ask each other, is this yours etc.... then we realized and quickly affirmed it belonged to no one in the room. I called down to the desk, the assured me they would have someone up right away to remove it, but,  not even an apology... 35 minutes later, no one had been sent up, my friend who reserved the rooms called down again... another 10 minutes goes by... housekeeping happened to be walking down the hall when I opened the door to greet more gals arriving for my party. So I stopped housekeeping and had them come in and change the bed... needless to say this was annoying. Next, there was a large sticky damp-ish spot on the floor near the window and one of the beds, that was grossing me out every time I forgot it was there and stepped on it. The mystery spot was the source of all sorts of hilarious half cocked theories... we decided to just have fun with it since the folks at Galt House seemed to not be bothered one bit by the state of our room. The bed nearest the window was on some sort of plywood box, that was clearly not part of the original bed, nor did it match it's twin at the  other side of the room. As a result of this jerry-rigged bed, the mattress kept flipping over... almost completely off the bed onto the floor! Again we chose to find humor in the situation....The best part is last...The Galt house is composed of two towers which are directly across the street from each other... We had the joy of a peeping Tom, staying the opposing tower, we called the desk to report the gentleman who was peering in and caused us to close up our curtains and block out the nice view of the river... We later ran into this creeper in the lobby, who admitted to have been watching us from across the street. . . again.. .no response from the folks at the front desk. Nothing like feeling like you and your closest friends are about to be Datelined at your hotel after a night out drinking for my bachelorette party... I was seriously waiting for Keith Morrison to show up in the lobby and begin his monologue It did however serve it's purpose, creeper stalker man and mystery stain in all.. which was, for us to pre-game, then walk down the street to 4th street live to celebrate my upcoming nuptials... however, it was a pretty large chunk of change for the festering trailer park it really was. I would look elsewhere in Louisville for a place to crash, unless you don't mind feeling like you're crashing in a friends dorm room again. Not the vibe I wanted for my last girls night before I become a Mrs.Very large hotel but kitchen and service staff did not appear to have the capacity for multiple large events the night we visited. Some rooms have phenominal views but some simply look into a parking garage. Suite sizes varry greatly. They have a deli that is open 24 hours a day which is a nice plus. If booking room or dinner recommend asking many questions or providing very specific requirements.I stayed at the Galt house for a few days and attended a conference there. It is an older building with older furnishings, but you do get a big suite with a wet bar and fridge! There are quite a few food options and bars connected to the building. One of the bars is on the Urban Bourbon trail.There are quirky elements to the hotel- when I was there, there were these giant birdcages (in glass) with birds in the lobby and the upper lounge/bar area, and a fishtank/bar!! Location is great for all downtown activity.As a conference participant, the rooms were nice and adequate for the large conference I attended. The continental breakfast and some of the lunch buffets were just okay, not great, but the evening hot hor d'ouvres provided were pretty tasty. The layout of the conference rooms were a little odd and confusing at first- some of the upper conference rooms are tucked away in a weird square/maze.I recently attended a convention at the Galt House, which is a very nice hotel for conventions in terms of size, accommodations, and location. The convention rate also helped. I'm not sure if I would stay here otherwise, as there are other hotels worth investigating nearby. The rooms - even the smaller rooms on the other side, were adequate, and the beds were quite comfortable. The rooms are not very soundproof, and if you have a room on the south side or facing 4th Street, you will hear the traffic outside. Sound from the hallways carries as well. The staff in general are very helpful and friendly, though I did not get maid service on one day, and there was no evidence that she was even around that day, nor was there backup. Room service took quite a while, and thanks to the lack of soundproofing, I could hear her on her cell phone while she was making up the room when I stood near my door. The free Wi-Fi the hotel supplied was adequate for my needs.  The 3rd floor walkway over 4th Street was definitely the place to hang with friends for conversation and drinks. I enjoyed poolside, and the bars in the hotel, but I can't really recommend the hotel food. I had the breakfast buffet one morning ($16), and it was adequate but not outstanding. The eggs were either dry or powdery (get an omelet instead) as were the biscuits, and the bacon was slightly greasy. But the oatmeal and grits bar had a variety of toppings, and there was a nice selection of fresh fruit.  The hotel also provided some lunches and dinners for us for our convention - there was quantity but not always quality for food, though beverages were plentiful.There's tons of hotel parking (something like 3600 spots?) and at $12 a day pretty reasonable IMO, with in and out privileges. Check-in and check-out were fast.Stayed as a part of a week long convention in town (AP Reading) and this is the first hotel we've been in for the Reading that hasn't been nice. I'm hugely disappointed, and I know at least a few people said that since we're in Louisville again next summer, they will decline their invitation because of this hotel. Outside is fine, lobbies and restaurants are pretty. Staff are pleasant. Hallways smell wet (?) and the rooms smell almost moldy. A shirt hung in the closet smelled by morning so I couldn't wear it. Had to live out of the suitcase for eight days, which wasn't super. The ironing board and iron had so much old starch built up (I assume it was this) that I couldn't iron my dark clothes. I did one, and it got a white slimy coating. There was no mini fridge, and the little coffee maker was scary looking so I didn't try it. No free coffee on site but you can go buy it on the third floir.  Also, there are far too few elevators -  one might wait an hour at peak time. Ask or pray for a lower floor, so you can walk down the fire escape stairs. There's also a strange, intermittent smell of sewage outside. Mostly, the stinky rooms and hallways, and the old, loud, 1970s room air conditioners, made the stay uncomfortable at best. I would never stay here by choice.i havent found anything endearing yet about Louisville or the Galt House.  I have found that1.  Rather than move your room they would rather totally change out your air conditioner unit at 1 am while you wait up for them.  Then when they replace the broken one with another broken one they will move you.2.  If your bed has bed bugs rather than move your room they will tell you to just sleep in the other bed.3.  If you get lonely at the bar, just drop a cheese cracker on the floor and Mickey Mouse will come and keep you company.","this place is huge and among the largest hotels in the US. Seriously, it's big. And like many other hotels in that case, it needs an upgrade because it is clearly from the 70's. I haven t seen all the rooms but from the reviews I have read and the ones I have seen, they are  a little over-worn. You see marks, stains, bumps in doors, carpets, beds frames, furniture, etc. Don't get me wrong, it was not dirty or anything, it is just a little outdated. This place has seen a LOT of CUSTOMERS. Plus are:  the location, the space (yes it is very big), the amenities (gym, pool), the views you can get from the city and the river.The location and view from our room were five stars. Just minutes away and within walking distance of Forth Street. Our room was 1284, it was a huge suite close to the elevator and I could see the river off to the right side, and the ice machine was right outside of the room. The things that I didn't like: the walls were thin, I could hear each time the neighbors would flush the toilet...you get the picture. Mildew in the bathroom shower and the outdated decor, just a few things that make this place not a five star hotel and not worth the rates that they charge.Parking and wifi are an extra charge too! As if they're not already making enough from the rooms!Smells old and dated. The Galt house offers a lot so you never need to leave the property. You will want to. Don't stay below the 6th floor on either tower.I had a five-day stay for a convention I was attending at the Galt House last week so am giving the perspective of someone who spent most of their time either in their room to sleep/shower or in the meeting/hospitality rooms. My room was on the Rivue side, the newer, and, I guess, nicer tower. I found the rooms clean and more than nice. And, having spent 13 years of my life traveling and living out of hotel rooms, I can be very picky. For what I paid through the convention block rate, the room was worth it.Staff was very helpful and polite. In the hospitality room (three banquet rooms rolled into one) it was almost impossible to find an empty plate or glass on the tables, they being picked up discreetly by one of the many eagle-eyed staff. The food provided by the banquet facility was usually above average (O.K., don't go to the south expecting an exceptional pizza) and the serving tables were always full of food. By the way, the facility spread out the serving tables such that there was NEVER a line for anything (well, maybe the beer/wine line in the evening got 6-8 deep at times).You are in the heart of downtown so you must pay to park, but your room key gives free in-and-out privilege. Several worth-while places to see are within walking distance. A third-floor walkway links the two towers.I like the downtown location of this hotel. It is right on the Ohio River and very close to all city attractions and restaurants. My suite was spacious and clean, and the fitness room has a great 360 view of the city and river.This property hosts a lot of group business, and there was a major event being held in some of the meeting space when I was there. Some may find this a negative thing, but I enjoyed talking to other guests from different areas and backgrounds.I didn't get a chance to try the food venues, but I will definitely give it a go in the future.We stayed at the Galt House during a winter weekend getaway.  After reading the reviews we were nervous that the property would be an old rode hard and put away wet kind of property that smelled like rotten eggs.  I can confirm that this was not the case.This is a large conference type of hotel. It is a dated property that is well located, clean, has a good number of bars/restaurants and enough kitsch going on to keep one interested in further exploring. The room passed my core two way test: its was clean and there was no discernible smell.  Yes, there were some burn holes in the carpet.  Yes, the furniture was dated.  Yes, the walls are thin.  However, the view (of the river/ rolling hills to the west) from our room was really memorable.  We were essentially snowed-in during our visit, so we had the opportunity to really explore the hotel. Treat yourself to an evening round of libations at the bar on the top floor.  The panoramic views are outstanding.  Finally, at some point also treat yourself to a another round in the bar on the 3rd floor.  Adding to the kitsch in this confused terrarium of an atrium are a bar that doubles as a goldfish tank, some funky birds in a huge centerpiece of a tweety cage and great views of the city and river. Keep in mind this is not a five star property. You pay for what you get.  If you purchased your room ""right"" then you most likely will be able to take advantage of a good value proposition.  Don't expect any crazy service, but do expect friendly and courteous staff.I agree with previous reviews regarding the lack of cleanliness, etc., so I will TRY not to rehash the same issues at length. My employer paid for my room for the week I was in Louisville.  I would *never* stay there again by choice.  I shared a room with a colleague. The room had two beds but the rest of it was set up for only one person. There was one 'lounge' chair (without a side table) which turned out to have snacks from a previous occupant in the cushions so that when it was used, crumbs went all over the disgusting carpet. The dresser had three small drawers; the top drawer had a previous occupant's crumpled pants in it. Dried coffee from the previous occupant was still in the coffee maker.  The floor had snacks on it from...you guessed it...the previous occupant. Unless the room cleaning staff forgot to clean up from their snack break?On the third day, when the room had still not been cleaned appropriately, we asked three times before staff were sent to the room to clean. During my stay, I know the room was not vacuumed aside from the night that staff were sent to the room at our request. Our room was in what is called the Rivue Tower. My understanding is that the other side has nicer (not cleaner) rooms. The room was also lacking a few basic necessities that would have made the nine day stay more comfortable: additional wall plugs, enough drawer space to store two guests' clothes, a room safe, a hook on the back of the bathroom door, and bathroom hooks or a towel bar so that towels can be reached from the shower. In addition, a mini fridge would have been most welcome. Hoping my employer does not book me there again...I had a fantastic experience with the Galt House this week! The staff was friendly, the room was large and immaculately clean, the location was perfect.Thelma's (the 24 hour deli) was very convenient with decent tasting pizza and Graeter's ice cream, but way overpriced.Most unprofessional service I have ever received. If you have to stay here then great but avoid it if you can.Pros: location is great, views, big bathroom-they use Bed, Bath and Body Works toiletries. Cons: unprofessional, unwelcoming, outdated (looks like a hotel from the 1990s). They charge you $5/day or $10/wk to use the gym. God forbid you have to make a late checkout--they'll charge you for it per hour. Checkout is 11:00am. And apparently they're in such demand you can't even have a late checkout on Sunday....They also charge for parking but that got waived for us since we were in a wedding block.Service in general was just very poor. The Motel 6 is more hospitable. They don't greet you, staff looks miserable and everyone from the font desk to the manager was rude and unapologetic. And this was even before we got to the hotel. They don't work with you if you have a change in plans. Not worth the money, if we didn't have a wedding to attend at the Galt House we wouldn't have stayed. Seriously not sure why this place thinks it's the Ritz. Nothing about it is glamorous or upscale. There's no complementary anything--even those waters dispensers that hotels usually have at the front. They have a very ""you need us more than we need you"" attitude. Filed a complaint to the GM, two days ago and have yet to hear back. Wish this was an isolated experience but everyone we spoke to that attended the wedding had a bad experience dealing with the staff.One Star.Yes.One. I would never tell a friend to stay here. And we're all friends here, right?Let me explain.For being such an iconic hotel, with solid reviews, I expected friendly service, a well maintained property, and a fun stay. Reality: not even close.If you plan on staying here, prepare yourself for the following, all of which we experienced in our 1-day stay.-35 minute wait to check in. There were only 3 staff checking people at peak hour on a Saturday, who looked less than thrilled to be at work, and were as friendly as Grumpy Cat looks.-Staying in the Rivue Tower? Guess what, you can't check in there. Instead you'll find a bored concierge-Prepare yourself for the smell. Yes, the smell. For some reason, all the guest floors have this odor that's a mix of an outdoor trashcan and old garlic. Somewhere, something is rotting, and it's seeping on to every floor of the hotel.-Waiting for elevators. (Not a complaint, just a tip. You can't speed up an elevator, even I know that.) The plus is, it's great people watching, and you can make a friend, even if it's just for a 18 floor ride.-Finding old trash waiting for you when you reach your hotel room. We're talking commercial sized trash bag, with old food and bathroom trash. On our doorstep. Thanks, but no thanks.-The rooms are old. I mean real old. Here's what we experienced in ours:         -Broken curtains         -Air conditioning that's loud and doesn't work well. Almost to the point you can't hear yourself think. (But don't turn it off, because your room is going to be HOT and stuffy when you arrive and will take all night to go from 80-76 degrees.)          -The smell of mildew that never quite goes away          -Water stains on the ceiling          -Mildew stains around the tub, caulking that's peeling.          -Peeling wallpaper          -No water pressure          -Faux leather furniture that is peeling from wear          -And the worst: the beds. They're so worn, that if you sit on the edge of the bed, you're in danger of just sliding off. Heed this advice when sleeping close to the edge of the bed, lest you fall off. Additionally, they don't use fitted sheets, or even tuck them in. Halfway through the night I woke up in a panic that I was sleeping on bare, stained mattress. (Gross!)-None of the workers are happy. NONE. As one of my newly-found elevator friends said; ""The Yelp reviews were so wrong about this place.""The location is the only positive of this hotel. The fact that this hotel charges to use the business center and to print is unacceptable. The rooms needed to be updated. Our room specifically faced -- wait for it -- a hallway. Had to request a crib three times from housekeeping. The information desk employee was rude.  Very underwhelming experience. I would never consider paying list rate for this hotel (paid $64/night via Priceline name-your-own price vs list rate of $165/night). Self-parking was $15/night, which is reasonable enough, I guess.My review of the Galt House hasn't really, changed- I've noticed no improvements in the comparisons of the west side to the east, the east still being better and more up to date.There's one crucial detail, though, that I thought was worth mentioning: free Wi-Fi*!*The Galt's free Wi-Fi is throttled to a slower speed than their paid Wi-Fi service. Their Wi-Fi login page requires a first and last name, as well as an email address, and includes a disclaimer regarding the throttled speed mentioning that those seeking to stream video or download large files should consider paid service.Just between you and me, though, I've found the free Wi-Fi stellar for watching lengthy YouTube videos, so long as you're alright with watching in Standard Definition, as 720p HD buffers frequently.The rooms are fine, even though not necessary modern or luxurious for the price, but our biggest issue were the few interactions with staff.First, on check-in I was informed that the type of room I reserved (and paid ahead of time) with a king bed wasn't available. They only had rooms with two queen beds. I was not amused, especially since this was my anniversary trip and I would have liked to sleep in one bed with my wife without feeling cramped.What upset me more is that they weren't particularly apologetic and the only offer we got was to choose another room - at our expense. Not ok.They also tried to charge us for valet parking when we used self-parking, a $10/a day difference. It's bad enough that you have to pay $15/day to park your car at a hotel, but don't try to overcharge me on top of it. They did fix the bill when we complained, but again no real apology and we didn't need the aggravation.The only real positive about the hotel was that it housed the Jockey Silk bourbon bar, with a great selection and an awesome bartender who knows his stuff. If you don't exactly know what you want, ask him for advice and after a few questions that clue him in to your taste, he'll pick something for you. For my wife and I he never chose wrong!Worst Beds ever! Honestly when is the last time you went to a hotel and the bed was uncomfortable? Well they were awful, I still can't believe how uncomfortable they were. Aside from all that, the rooms were huge, plenty of space, staff was friendly.I was a little skeptical of the hotel after reading a few reviews. My three day stay was great, except that the elevators broke down a few times, but people were there to assist you up-and-down on each floor. Every worker was very friendly and courteous.  Check in was very quick.  The hotel is older but has a good vibe and lot of amenities on site.  It has the best gym I've ever seen in a hotel, a complete Nautilis set of equipment for all types of workouts.  There are several food and drink choices on site with a variety of different price ranges.  I would stay at this hotel again.Very mixed bag. Staff were great. Location is perfect for downtown access. Rooms were good size. Gym was amazing in terms of the 18th floor 360 degree view and the equipment they had. But the place is beat up from the feet up. All the carpets need a full steam clean as they smell in various parts of the building. Wifi is a bit weak and unsecured. If you like a real hot shower good luck and the ac, which is loud, struggles to keep the room cool, especially during the day. Would not recommend for business travel.I had a fantastic experience at the Galt House this week! The staff was friendly, the room was large and immaculately clean, the location was perfect.Thelma's (the 24 hour deli) was very convenient with decent food and Graeter's ice cream which was to die for, but overall the food was way overpriced.  The only negative was the parking, be prepared to walk the first day, but my wife and I found a way around that on our second day, simply pull in the garage and then make a quick right hand turn as if you were exiting the garage just past the elevators (you will see a sign that reads exit only) ignore the sign and there sat about 30 empty spaces before exiting the garage!!  Enjoy your stay we did!!So I stayed at the Galt House and the room was fine.  However, I attended a large event there and was very disappointed in the food and the service.  My wife and I ordered food and didn't receive the food we ordered.  Additionally the table next to us had received and eaten their desert before we got our main course.  When I asked for a manager and asked about what I ordered she came out and said it was all they had left.  They had run out of the food we had ordered.  They didn't offer any compensation for receiving food we didn't order.  We were just told it's all we have.  The response I got was one of a company that takes its customers for granted.I've got no real complaints, but nothing that I'd rave about either.  I had my room booked for me by a colleague, and to be honest, I would have chosen a Marriott.That said, the front desk check in process was painless, and I was directed across the bridge to the other side, so I traversed the bridge and found my room.  My room was quite large and the bedding and pillows were very comfortable.  Both sides of the hotel have an attendant, so even if you aren't on the side with the check-in desk, there is someone to help with inquiries.  In my case, it was usually for directions.It would be interesting to see the place during Derby week, as I imagine it seems much more impressive when it is bustling with guests and the help.Extremely disappointed in how far this hotel has fallen since the last time I attended an event here. This weekend I attended a 2 day conference and couldn't believe that the staff didn't bother to iron the table cloths. The creases were more that noticeable as if the unfolded them and simply threw them on the table. I could read table storage instructions written on the tables through the table cloth. Perhaps worst of all I drank two sips of water out of my glass before noticing there was what looked like black mold around the inside edge of the bottom of the glass. EW! I would think twice before booking your conference here.","The Galt House is a tale of two towers. The tower to the east, the Suite Tower, is clearly newer and more updated, with more spacious bathrooms with glass doors on the showers. The Rivue Tower on the west side is nice enough but less polished. Still, overall this is a nice, big historic hotel in a convenient downtown location right on the river. The bar on the 3rd floor has a big cage with live birds and a bar that doubles as a fish aquarium. The bourbon bar, Jockey Silks, isn't the greatest bourbon bar by any means, but hey, it's a nicely stocked bar in the hotel. The pool, while not expansive, also has a fully operational bar, so thumbs up on that. I have always traveled there on business, so I can't comment on the rate, but it's a good, but not terribly luxurious hotel. A nice touch was the towel origami in the form of swans by Gulya, the maid (see picture). I'm giving them 4 stars, but it could be 31/2... 33/4?Spent a great night at this place!Soon as I got off the taxi, the hotel staff gave us a very warm welcome. Check in went smoothly. Only complaint was that our rooms were in the other tower, so had to hustle up to the third floor, walk across the bridge and then take the elevators.Room was spacious and clean. No complaints at all. Convenient location and great view of the river.Even when I was making my reservation, the hotel staffer (Andrew I think?) was a sweetheart, double checked everything for me and gave me a detailed overview of the hotel, its services, and the types of places that were nearby.Def recommend if you need a place to stay in Louisville!P.S. They have a glass cage full of BABY CHICKS. check it out!This was my first visit to this historic hotel. Very disappointed.  We were moved 3 times because of problems with the rooms. In need of repairs. Handle was falling off the shower door. Water was so cold I couldn't stand it. Have a crick in my neck from the terrible nights sleep. Drinks at the bar are $10. Don't waste your money.This place was just ghetto. Came here for a business trip and I was so happy when it was over and I was headed out!!! We stayed on the wrong side (the older side) and after being moved twice due to smells, wet carpet, filthy bathroom (pubic hair all over the toilet and floor), they moved us across the street to the newer part.It's still kitschy, but the other room wasn't so bad. The hotel staff was terribly rude about having to move me but I was not going to stay another minute in that awful room with the rotten smells and water all over the carpet around the bathroom door.Don't bother eating at any of the establishments in the  hotel itself, walk a few blocks north where there are much better places to eat. We got a glimpse inside one of the kitchens as the doors near the convention center rooms opened, and oh my.I have been here 2 weekends this month for a seminar. The rooms are clean, the staff are friendly and helpful and the restaurant is DELICIOUS!!!! I am usually very reluctant to eat at hotel restaurant but this one is amazing.. The Magnolia Salad with grilled Salmon Mmmmm!!! And the white chocolate bread pudding is too good. Very great experience here.Very good place in a great location. Has nice restaurants inside as well as nearby. Only concern was that the rooms were pretty old and needs some update although the suites were some of the largest in terms of relative size. But still the location wins!Having spent many of my younger years working in hotels that are chains, I have come to appreciate establishments that are not cookie cutter. The Galt House possesses an old world charm and grace that resembles the great hotels of yesteryear! Some reviews on here call it old, and while it does display the past in its dark wood panels, carved suite doors, recessed chandeliers that are surrounded by carved moulding, and other small details that catch the eye, it has been well maintained. I felt as if my husband and I had checked in to a grand southern mansion! From the moment we checked in, when we crossed the glass conservatory bridge, and were whisked by the fast Otis  elevator to 21st of the Rivue Tower I knew our stay would be comfortable. I have also read reviews of poor staff attitudes. I'm here to say I never encountered a single poor mannered staff member! The housekeepers smiled and bid good morning, the bellman were eagerly attentive and helpful, the staff of the Magnolia Cafe were excellent! Chastity, who served us this past, late Monday night was friendly and helpful. Even though the restaurant was near closing, we never felt rushed. We were able to enjoy the onion soup and our cocktails at our leisure. I must also congratulate Thelmas, the cafe on the bridge, for also providing excellent hospitality! The breakfast buffet and the chef creating the omelets from scratch made a wonderful start to each day. The two, thin, young ladies who were new additions to the wait staff are off to a wonderful start with their cheery dispositions! Even though we booked on Priceline, the desk staff lady was very helpful in placing us in a room with a gorgeous view of the river and ferry boat dock. Again, she displayed excellent hospitality! I wish I could rate this grand dame of a hotel higher! The Grand Galt House will be our hotel of choice anytime we vacation in Louisville again!Stayed there for a convention. The staff was friendly, polite, and helpful. The room was a good size. There are two towers on the opposite side of the street. I was on one and the convention activities were in the other. There is a sky walk between them which made it a bit awkward to go back to the room, but not too bad. The hotel provided food for our event. Do not expect fine dining. The variety of entrees was limiting and pizza etc. not well suited to steam table serving. However they did replenish frequently and were cooperative. We did not go hungry.Had a great time staying two nights at the Galt House. The staff was very courteous, the breakfast Omelettes were awesome, clean comfortable rooms, Louisville's best, Love The Galt House, what a classy place.Excellent view of the river, but that's about it. I've called on the house phone twice to ask simple questions such as to confirm my room number when my keys got demagnetized on the way from the front desk to my room. It was a hike across the street and up to the tower where my room was but it took them 15 minutes to answer the house phone. My next call was another 15 minutes to inquire about the location of the business center. It's silly but it was faster for me to go down 16 floors and hike back across the street to ask my simple questions-a telegraph would be more effective. Most hotels that I stay and have a guest services line where they pick up immediately and even the cheaper hotels have an override into the front desk when no one is available at the operator. I'm in a ""deluxe room"" but the furniture is ripped and the phone looks like it was dropped many times over. The furniture is outdatedand tired but don't picture charming antiques. There must be a better hotels is in Louisville.The Galt House is a great choice if you plan to stay overnight in Louisville.  I wish we would have stayed longer than one night so we could have enjoyed the hotel longer.  There are two towers across the street from each other.  You check in and park on the side that is nicer of the two, I think it has the suites and fancier rooms.  The other side has the regular rooms where we stayed but was also amazingly nice.  The rooms are large and very comfortable and the hallways and public areas well maintained with an upscale feel.  Our room had a lovely view of the river and and the bridge to Indiana.  The hotel has bars and other amenities and is close to all sorts of fun bars and 4th Street Live.  If I am ever in Louisville again I will be staying here again for sure.The room was lovely, but the concierge had no idea whether or not any of the restaurants INSIDE the hotel were able to serve gluten free food.  Considering that 1 in 7 people is either celiac or gluten intolerant, this is an epic fail.I've stayed in better hotels but I've definitely stayed in worse. This is a very ""old school"" hotel. I'm sure in its hay day - probably the 1980's - it was a great place. But now? It's a little weathered looking. Definitely outdated. My room had a sign telling me that my windows had been permanently sealed, but there was a leak at one of the corners and cardboard had been stuffed in the crack to try to keep wind out. It didn't work. There was a loud whistling sound all day and night. Didn't make for a very restful business trip. Neither did the uber thin walls. I think the man in the room next to me needs to go get a prostate exam. He made quite a few trips to the restroom every night.The main hotel bar was...interesting? Not sure why they had a huge cage with quail in the middle and a bar made out of plexiglass and filled with real, life fish. PETA has never been to this hotel, I think. My main beef with the hotel were the extra fees. I had some packages delivered and they were held next door at the UPS Store...and I had to pay a fee to get them. Then I had to pay to use the hotel gym. This hotel wasn't cheap to begin with so I expected better customer service. Not extra fees for everything. On my last trip to Louisville, I stayed in a much nicer Hilton Garden Inn. If I'd had the choice I would have stayed there again, but this place was ok. It is close to the downtown ""night life"" if you're into that sort of thing. But I'm not.Hotel is beautiful! Elegant. Visited the Alt J bar which is on the bridge between the two towers. A fun bar which showcases a fish tank bar top. Ordered Black cherry bourbon lemonade drink which proved to be a delicious night cap. Nice views of the Ohio river from the lounge nicely ended the night. The Jockey Silks Bar and Lounge was a treat and on the Urban Bourbon Trail.Very, very average and dated. Service was poor. Ordered room service that never showed up. Stay at the Galt only if your expectations are low and other hotels in the downtown area are booked.DON'T STAY AT THE GALT HOUSE! THEY RUINED MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING! Where do I even begin? First, the Galt House made a HUGE mistake when my friend booked the block of rooms for her wedding guests, but she looked past it and still gave them her business. Then, we spent hours making welcome baskets for her out of town guests with special instructions, maps and goodies. Those were NEVER handed out to her guests. Some missed the shuttle to the wedding because of this. No apology.She then booked a VERY expensive bridal suite for TWO nights one night for her bridesmaids to sleep and then get ready, and the second for she and her new husband. (And remember all of her out of town guests stayed there too)The night of the wedding she and her betrothed invited some of the bridal party and a few out of town friends to visit and celebrate for a bit before they enjoyed their first night of marriage. Someone turned music on and we got a call asking to turn it down, and we did. The next thing we knew, there was a red-faced security guard with two cops by his side BANGING on the door. We let him in and he began SCREAMING at the top of his lungs. ""YOU'RE EVICTED FROM THIS ROOM! GET OUT NOW"" ""NOOOOOW!""  All of us who were there just stared at him, we were in shock. We were standing around the room visiting. ""YOU'RE EVICTED FROM THIS ROOM""  the yelling continued. We began asking questions. Things got heated. There was no discussion, just a lot of screaming. I calmly told the man that we would be glad to leave but we would like for the bride and groom to stay. He made it very clear that EVERYONE was to leave including the BRIDE AND GROOM! He said ""I don't care who they are"" several times.We asked to speak to a manager. We heard him radio her, and we could hear her response. She said loud and clear ""I DON""T CARE. I'm not coming.  KICK THEM OUT"" I must admit, those who were with us did not leave quietly. We were angry and humiliated. The bride was traumatized. She cried (in her OWN HOME) for the rest of her freaking wedding night. And now, I just found out that her letters were answered rudely, the head of security practically hung up on them, the valet scratched her car, and that after she was charged for the room (THAT SHE DIDN'T STAY IN)  it was put on the wrong credit card. I didn't want to post anything about this incident because we wanted to give the Galt House a chance to somewhat redeem themselves. But they could care less about their guests or even their reputation. Don't give them your business. You will regret it.The Galt House is a good location if you are going to see a concert at the KFC Yum Center....you're within walking distance.  Check out the bar when you stay here..it has fish in it!  Very cool....This is a dirty hotel. I was booked in a dirty room, only to be moved to another dirty room. The front desk is completely unresponsive. Definitely not worth the money. Avoid at all costs-my experience has been utterly horrible.More than underwhelmed by just about everything:1) Price.  $250 is way to much for an outdated room [in Louisville!].2) Hotel condition.  Needed a renovation 20 years ago.  The last renovation was done using the least expensive and ugly materials possible.  Many parts of the hotel are pretty beat up and appear to be from the 70s.3) Room condition.  Same as (2).  The AC are in-wall units and hard to figure out how to work - almost impossible to regulate temperature.  Shower is underwhelming.  The bed was OK but clearly low quality.4) Hotel layout.  Prepare to have your mind blown by this Willy Wonkaesque monster:  a) Nearly impossible to find a place to park  b) No elevator in parking garage even though it is seven levels  c) Entry to hotel lobby via parking is extremely convoluted  d) They seemed to have cobbled together rooms in every spare inch of the property.  My room was next to the meeting rooms!  e) Weird twists and turns in every directionFood and beverage were not sampled but assumed to be average.  Service was prompt &amp; efficient.  No real complaints about cleanliness; the property is clearly well run.  The big take-away is the hotel survives on Derby weekend when it can pretty much charge what it wants regardless of its condition.  I would be happy if I paid $89 but I didn't...July, 2014Worst sleep in my life! The rooms are so loud. The toilets flush so loud that you can hear every flush happening around you. We joked they sounded like rockets taking off. Often you would hear one in the middle of the night and then another a few minutes later and another. Everyone was waking everyone else up. Also our air system did not work right. We called the front desk a few times but there was no real fix. I would not stay again. Not to mention paying so much money for no sleep!","I have fun just about everywhere I go BUT I must say that there were a bit too many things on the negative list when we stayed at the Galt House this weekend for a wedding. The plus side is that this hotel is beautiful and historic with a great view of the Ohio River, but that's about where it ended for me.First, when we went to check in, I encountered a front desk attendant who wasn't the most friendly person ever. She was okay. I informed her that we made a mistake with the reservation, and instead of booking 2 nights together I booked 2 separate consecutive nights. She seemed a bit annoyed by that but told me it shouldn't be a problem, although she wasn't very reassuring. Then she gave us our keys and did not give us directions on how to get to our room.Now, usually, it's obvious. But for a hotel the size of the Galt House with 2 towers and a connecting bridge on the 3rd floor, it wasn't immediately apparent. So we spent a good 15 minutes wandering around looking for how to get to our room. Pretty annoying since giving directions to the room should be part of her job.Then, after talking shit on her for those 15 minutes, we get off the elevator to our room and she was waiting there for us! She said engineering had moved us to a different room. Ugh, I was hoping to not have to see her again. The room was pretty good. Beds were comfy. But when I went in the closet, there was a pair of ladies sandals which at first I thought were hotel fuzzy slippers for me to wear. Not the case. Someone had left them and the cleaning crew missed it. I dunno about you, but that little detail, like the room hadn't been COMPLETELY cleaned, kinda left a bad taste in my mouth. Lastly, the morning after our first night we kept getting bothered by housekeeping knocking on the door even though we had the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the knob. Turns out, it was because of our booking mistake that we already warned the front desk about. I guess there's no communication between staff. Grr.Also, no free parking (which is understandable because it's downtown Louisville) and no free wifi. I really don't understand why you can buy a cup of coffee at Starbucks and get free wifi, but when it comes to staying at a 3 star hotel, they can't give it to you. All in all, I probably won't stay again. I like the 21c Museum Hotel much better!I'm surprised by all the bad comments. I had a great experience at this place, and I booked it on hotwire so it was SUPER cheap. When I got to the hotel, they upgraded me to a suite for free (I didn't even ask or insinuate either), which was gigantic and clean - I didn't notice any smell or mold or anything, it was a great room. Also, the location is really convenient to anything, AND, this place has a 24 hour pizza place in the hotel!!!! I came home at 4 am drunk and starving, and had a delicious pizza in 10 minutes. Not many other hotels can boast that amenity, trust me hahaha. I would def. come back and recommend to a friend.This place was awful. They don't want young money and are extremely caustic towards younger patrons (35) I thought wasn't young. Poor service, bad place bad management and overall terrible energy. Buyer beware it's a baby boomer place no young people allowed.Stayed here for a week.  It was awesome we were in a suite with two TVs, staff was friendly, BUT I woke up one morning towards the end of my trip and a little tiny bedbug was crawling around on my bed.  NOT cool to see!  Searched for the hotel on google and saw reviews on bed bugs.  :(Stayed here for a convention this past week. While I was there my colleague had bedbugs in their room, something on the floor I was on made the entire floor smell like a combination of mold and the scent like someone died. Turns out there was some major damage in two of the rooms on a floor and they shut the water off on the entire floor meaning no showers, no toilet, and no sink. While the maintenance man was polite, there was an extended period of time with no water and no warning that it would be shut off. Beyond that on my last night at the hotel at about 230 in the morning I heard a scratching sound over the loud and clearly malfunctioning air conditioning unit in my room and woke up to discover a mouse on the broken down chair in my room trying to nibble on something in the cushion. This place was an overpriced nightmare and I will not be returning again. It's dirty, disgusting and upon further investigation I also learned through a colleague that the maid service is explicitly told not to clean the rooms, just to refill what was taken and if sheets on a bed look like they're ok then they're left there without changing. Speaking of my colleague with the bed bugs in their room, their bed sheets were also loaded with evidence of a previous guests sexual adventure in the room for lack of a better term. It was dirty disgusting and completely unprofessional would not recommend ever.The Galt House is beautiful, but it is not the safest place to stay in Louisville.  While at a conference the front desk gave a room key out without checking ID or even asking the person name to one of our participants room.  It was not her that asked for the key!  Needless to say she had valuables stolen, including 2 electronic tablets and makeup.  Needless to say checked out and went home because her safety was compromised.  Just this morning someone went into another participants room and stole her jewelry.  We also had an issue with a bellhop who said that extra chairs for the hospitality suite would be $7.00 each (this was after he had already brought them up to the room), but wink wink if we took care of him, he would take care of us.  We told him to take the chairs back we didn't need them.  We are still not sure if the extra chairs really cost anything or if he was just trying to extort money from us.  It did show us though they he was willing to steal from his employer.  Before staying here or booking a conference, please think carefully.  Your safety and the safety of your possessions might be at risk.Rooms need to be upgraded. The lamp on the desk still has a spot for dial up internet .Rooms were not refreshed daily I had to go get bathroom tissue and clean towels .Restaurant service is poor at best one Omelet person for Memorial Day Monday really ??The old saying you get what you pay for is right . You would think that if you know how many  rooms are booked you would schedule  your employees accordingly restaurant service at Magnolia Cafe was the worst . I feel sorry for the employees not their fault .Ok I have one good point , it's close to everything downtown.  Giving it one star is a stretchI stayed at the Galt House for a convention, so my experience was definitely more convention-like than vacation like. My room was clean &amp; the staff was friendly &amp; helpful. A couple of things that knocked it out of being really nice: 1) There are two towers &amp; traveling between the two if you are meeting in one building or another is a constant pain, especially when the elevators are busy. 2) Everything just felt a little tired. 3) No safe in my room. At a hotel in this range, I expect some of the niceties, a safe, a little fridge, little things. Those things were just missing.The only thing wrong with this hotel is the room smelled like smoke.  Everything else is great.  Walking distance to all the downtown attractions.No real complaints.  In full disclosure, I stay here every year for a conference, so I never have to pay.  That being said, unless the price is 300 a night, I'd still give it five stars.  Great location, good staff, awesome rooms (especially the suites), and great restaurants.  The pool could use updating, but I'm not going to complain about that since I don't swim too much.We were in the west (Rivue) tower and the room was clean, but shabby. Shower worked and the bathroom had all the basics. The bed was not comfortable at all - I woke up with an achey back. I've stayed in the east tower and it was pretty nice, so I was shocked with the condition of this room. I guess the downtown location is the justification for the rate, but we will spend our money elsewhere next time.We were lucky to stay in a wedding block so we had a bit of a discount on the room.  If we had to pay full price I probably would have dropped a star.  The room was clean but we were moved away from the rest of the wedding party bc they didn't have a king sized bedroom clean.  We checked in a few hours after check in time.  Disappointed, but I was not downsizing my bed.  We made do on floor above the group.  The bed was comfortable enough.  Def had worse beds in hotels.  The sheets and pillows were clean and no bedbugs.  Yay!  Always happy to not find any bugs in room.  I tear apart bed sheets every where I go. The bathroom was clean also.  The entire room and hotel need an update though. Very 80s feel in some places.  The wood paneling covering the ac/heat unit was very unattractive.  Come on. People are ponying up $200 a night.  We ordered food from deli that is open 24/7 inside the hotel.  A pizza and a cold cut sandwich took over an hour to receive. That's a little long to wait in my opinion.  Tasted okay. Location is what is key with this hotel. In downtown Louisville!  Walking distance to many bars and restaurants.  No need I hurry a drink, they serve till 4 am!If they call this place the hotel of the Derby then I think the Derby hotel should stand up to its name.I have stayed twice in the Revue Tower and once in the suite Tower. The Revue tower is average. I had complained in the past that the bathroom has to hook to hang your bathrobe.  It does have a spectacular view if you are on an upper floor.The suite tower is much nicer and roomier. We have had experimented some problems here but the staff has been attentive to our needs.It does connect to an above ground walkway that takes you through other buildings into their entertainment complex.Chances are unless there is an event here, I would probably not stay here again.I think at one time this place was Beautiful it needs a little work but that didn't bother me what did was we had to wait until 7 pm to get our rooms and then the rooms were not cleaned. Hair in the shower, food left in the fridge and the next day my shower was still not cleaned. On a good not the bed was great and the staff are very nice and helpfulits an ok place, clean and large and the staff is friendly and helpful. A few things keep it from being a great hotel- number one, the prices of room, price of room service, parking, and amenities are more in line with a hotel with more stars. Another issue is that the hotel is huge, but it is confusing and there are not clear signs for where you need to go to actually find your room. The last and more irritating issue is the hours of the fitness center. Who has a fitness center only open from 7-7 on weekends? That killed it for me. With a few tweaks this hotel could be a go-to but as of now its just ok.We stayed here on our wedding night. I wish we would have stayed home. The room was just okay. It was on the small side and very plain. All through the night I was woken up by flushing toilets in nearby rooms and I could actually hear someone urinating in another room. It was so lo ud I thought at first someone had come into our room and was using our bathroom. If you're looking for a nice and relaxing getaway look elsewhere.I'm actually going to start this review with the bottom line. Is the experience at the Galt House worth paying full price for? Hell No! Would I stay there again if I can get a cheap rate on Hotwire? Absolutely. The Good: *Spacious, clean room, flat screen TV and large bathroom. *A snack shop that's open 24 hours a day. You might not think this is a big deal, but try checking in at 1:30 a.m. for a one day trip. Dead tired and hungry. The snack shop being open was a nice surprise. *Great location: Right down the street from the Ballpark, Louisville Slugger factory and Muhammad Ali museum. The Bad: *Like a lot of hotels, they nickel and dime you for everything. *$18.00 day to park. *$5.00 a day to use the fitness club*Charges for use of the hotel WiFi. *The decor is kind of tacky. It appears this hotel hasn't changed much since it was built in the early 70's. It looks like an episode of the Partridge Family threw up all over it.I absolutely adore this place. My boyfriend and I spent the night here when FandomFest was going on and it was spectacular. The pool is located on the third floor roof of the Rivue tower which gives you a lovely view of The Ohio river as you take a morning dip. The staff is wonderful and always so polite and helpful. Parking can be a bit of a hassle but once you see your beautiful suite the rage you felt with parking your car goes right away.Disappointed.  Upon arrival to my 5th floor room, found a two inch long cockroach greeting us in the mildew-funk smelling bathroom.  When I killed it and showed it to the bellhop, he said, ""Eh, that happens sometimes, I guess...""  When I went to take a shower the next morning, there was long brown hair covering all of the shower walls.  I asked front desk manager what she suggested we do since I was not happy with the quality of the room. She said, ""Sir, I really don't think this warrants changing rooms. Can I offer you a $50 credit instead?""It's not about money.  It's about the quality of the room, cleanliness, and service.  I have received none of these things.  I suggest the SpringHill Suites on East Jefferson just a few blocks down the road instead.I came here for a one night stay (in town for business).  The hotel is adequate, but there is a daily charge for the gym, internet, and no internet available in the business center without a charge.  The staff is helpful in general and the concierge desk went out of their way to be friendly.  However, based on the ""nickel and diming"" policies--I would not stay here again.","This is not a four star hotel. It is a two and a half star hotel. This is a very outdated and run down hotel in need of an update and possibly new management. The double queen bed room was actually two double beds. The beds were uncomfortable, floors stained, coffee maker filthy and the walls and furniture were scuffed. They have the room TVs set to high volume when you turn them on. I hope this isn't the best Louisville has to offer because it's sad.We stayed here recently and it was pretty decent.  The location is downtown which is fantastic!  You can walk to Fourth Street where there are bars and restaurants.  Or you can take the free trolley which stops between the hotel towers.  The trolley driver was very friendly and helpful as we asked her several questions about the area.  Our absolute hands down best feature was the view of the Ohio River.  It was amazing!  We could also see the courtyard where people were meandering around and there was actually a wedding there on Saturday. Some parts of the hotel were very dated, but our room was clean and very spacious!  The one thing I did not like was that the bathroom grout was brown, which gave the room a rather dingy appearance and you had to pay for wi-fi!  Who does that now!?!  Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay!This hotel is super nice!  Pretty and a such a great view!!!  Sure wish we could have stayed longer.  The parking garage was not so fun getting in and out of, but it was well worth it. No complaints here!!I think overall, the reviews for this hotel on Yelp are accurate. There are positives and negatives; whether those issues are a deal breaker for you depends on what you value. Pros: 1. The price we paid for our suite wasn't unreasonable. It was high, but not exorbitant. The suites at the Galt House were cheaper than the ones at the Brown.2. The suite we stayed in was clean and well decorated. No bad smells, well cared for. The reviews seem to indicate that there are good rooms and bad rooms and people seem to speak worse of the Rivue tower. We didn't stay in Rivue tower, we stayed in the ""good"" one, and it was acceptable in terms of cleanliness and being up to date. I can't speak to anything other than what we experienced, but our room was a good size and was comfortable.3. The linens, bed, and pillows were nice. There is nothing I hate more than going to a hotel and sleeping on flat pillows and scratchy sheets. No issues here.4. We stayed in the suites during a non-busy weekend, so I can't comment on the noise level all the time, but our room was really quiet. No complaints there.Cons:1. You have to pay for parking and internet, and it adds up quick. In this price range, those should be included.2. Service is somewhat lacking. I called the front desk twice to ask for things to be brought to the room. First, more linens for my kids. They never arrived, so we made due with what we had. The second I asked for extra toiletries in the morning. I waited for an hour and a half before I finally just had to check out without them. On our way out, we asked where we could get breakfast. The guy didn't act like he had any interest in answering our question and only gave us one suggestion: the most expensive breakfast they offer. The staff was friendly, but they don't go out of their way for the guests. 3. The rooms just didn't have a lot of things you'd expect in this price range. When we stayed at the Sheraton across the river, they had all kinds of toiletries in the bathrooms. The continental breakfast at the Sheraton was in the form of complimentary room service. There was no book of things to do in Louisville. I paid a lot for this room and the service was so much better at the Sheraton and the Brown. The Galt House is slightly less expensive than the Brown, but not much. But when you stay there, you really feel like you're staying at a high class hotel. Not so with the Galt House. Won't necessarily make or break your stay, but it was disappointing.4. The Galt House apparently offered room service, but there were no room service menus in the rooms. I had to look up the menu on my phone. It was expensive and there was not much selection. The TV channel list had no relation to the actual tv channels and there were only like 10 channels on the tv (and no kids TV channels). 5. I saw nothing in the way of bell boys or even those carts that you use yourself to bring in your luggage. It just sort of felt like we were on our own. 4. The curtains don't close all the way. No matter what we did, there was a gap of about an inch. Trying to sleep in after a night on the town and this stream of light was right in my eyes. The hotel needs to get some magnets sewn into the drapes. Bring some chip clips if you like to sleep in. 5. Breakfast at RIVUE was super expensive and not at all worth it. Most expensive breakfast I've ever eaten and it was just *okay* Overall: nice room, but at this price point I expect more. We were definitely not made to feel that we were treasured guests. I realize the things I'm picking on might seem like minor issues, and if it was any one of them alone, I would just let it go, but when you look at the experience as a whole, it left a lot to be desired.I REALLY wanted to give this place a 1 star review. But then I thought: hey, at least there weren't cockroaches all over my room.My main issue with this hotel is that they are HORRIBLE about nickel and diming you. $5.95/day for internet. $9.95 if you want internet that can handle streaming (netflix, hulu, etc) or downloading. Are you KIDDING me? Is the owner that out of touch with how society works? Even fleabag motels have free wifi, and you're going to charge me $10 in addition to my $120 room? The rooms are nothing to write home about. They're fine to sleep in, but no real accommodations beyond the basics.My future in-laws were staying in the suite tower of the complex, and were awoken every morning to a steamboat/ferry thing on the river blasting organ grinder music. Bahaha. You'd think the hotel would work something out with these guys.I'm so irate about not having internet (on principle of not wanting to pay for it) that I can't really think of many good things. The extra star, like I said, is because it was clean, had hot water, etc.Those are some big towers you got there, Galt House. See, the name itself, Galt House, implies a lodging that is cozy, yet in real life, not so much. My stay at Galt House was satisfactory, but there's certainly room for improvement. The Good:1) Considering it is such a large hotel, there are tons of amentities. Nice workout facility, plenty of restaurants and shops between the two towers, etc. 2) Sundollar shuttle runs to the airport every half hour until 2pm (weekday) and then on the hour. 3) Jimmy John's delivers. Hey, I consider that a big ole plus. 4) Comfy beds and a shower that has some decent water pressure.5) Affordable prices especially compared to other similarly appointed hotels.6) Great location just off of Main and 4th7) Gorgeous views of the city and/or the riverThe Meh:1) The rooms are certainly outdated. Yes, they have everything you need but are missing a certain sparkle that would make the hotel a stunner. 2) Because the hotel is so large, it can take you 5-10 extra minutes to move from tower to tower or simple up and down to your room. This is especially apparent in the morning hours when convention goers are heading out. 3) The 360 fitness facility in the Suite tower is really nice. It also costs $5 per day or $10 per week. That price isn't bad by any means, but, frankly, just include it in the room. I felt nickeled and dimed. 4) No mini fridge...so prepare yourself to get creative with the ice bucket if you do need to keep a snack or two cool. 5) Internet isn't gratis. Womp womp. Will I stay at The Galt House again? Probably...the price point alone will sell it against neighboring hotels!Highlights:1.  Pay parking or valet by the day (unlimited in/outs)2.  Huge rooms, very clean, comfy, and updated3.  Indoor swimming pool available and gym (but at a cost- you have to pay!)4   Free wi-fi in the lobby spaces, need to pay $5 a day if you want to use it in the roomStayed here for 4 days over a long weekend.  The place was HUGE, probably one of the biggest hotels I have ever stayed at to date.Plenty of parking, although they charge by the day and can add up.  At least you get unlimited in/out privileges.Huge lobby and plenty of conference rooms for those business types. Our trip was solely for vacationing and we stayed very comfortably.  We picked a regular 2-queen bed room and were upgraded to suites and they were AWESOME.The rooms are huge, plenty of space with your own little ""living room area"", kitchen area, separation between the bedroom and living room with bathrooms in between.  Perfect layout, rooms are updated, clean and had everything we needed. Room service was good too, I recommend the stone oven pizza.All in all a pleasant stay and centrally located in downtown Louisville.  If I visit again, I'll definitely be looking for a room at this place first.Location is everything and I love the short walk to 4th street live from this hotel!I felt like the decor and the hotel was slightly outdated but it did have a certain charm to it as well. We had a regular room high up in the tower overlooking the river and a view of the city. I really enjoyed the people watching from up there. Everything else about the room was average from the bedding to the bathroom. Nothing was awful but nothing was amazing either.The employees were very friendly and answered any questions we had about the area since we were from out of town. The parking was super expensive though! :( I think it was like 18 for the night to park the car. I would go back If I had a good rate on a room.First and foremost, the staff has been exceptional for each event I've attended here.The in-house catered food wasn't stellar at a company party, but the service was good.The snack/coffee bar and bar in the crosswalk between the two buildings were both quick and slightly above average priced. I paid $4 for a mocha that wasn't nearly as burned as some more well-known coffee chains.The cleaning staff service during Fandom Fest was outstanding. The large self-serve water (towers?) never went close to empty. The trash bins were frequently and regularly emptied. At no point in my stay for the convention did I notice any messes, or areas with any litter.Curbside service was exceptional, and the staff was knowleagable about local parking, restaurants, and the best way to get to various locations in the downtown area.The hotel itself could use some updating. I understand it's a classic, formal hotel. The formal, classic atmosphere isn't unpleasant however.When my mother and I planned a trip to Louisville together, we wanted to stay at a nice hotel, so we splurged on the Galt House. It seemed very nice and it was connected to the KFC Yum Center where we were attending an event.I flew in a couple hours earlier than she did and she had me added to the room. I was able to get in far earlier than standard check in, which was accommodating of them. Our room was on the 7th floor, but next to the service cupboard, so we heard a lot of thumping out in the hall. Our view was of the parking garage next door.I took a brief nap while I waited and was woken up by housekeeping checking to see if we had a rubber shower mat.I then decided to go down to the 3rd floor deli to grab a bite. I was in line long enough that my mom actually arrived and met me there. But the salad we split was pretty good.We next went to explore the hotel shops and restaurants before hitting the town. The shops in the building seem a little random. They sell odd assortments of tzochkes, souvenir items, expensive clothes and random Derby collectibles. The hotel has a liquor store, but selections were limited and overpriced. Several of the stores were closed, which seemed quite odd on a Saturday afternoon when the hotel was full. We never did figure out their schedules. I've reviewed the bar separately and Rivue, the fine dining restaurant.We did wander into the house bourbon bar, which boasts an impressive selection, but decided to try it after our exploration of Louisville.We never got back to it again while it was open. It's closed Sundays. Why???There was another restaurant within that we never found open. God knows when that one opened its doors.The pool looked nice, but it too was closed while we were there, despite 90 degree plus days. They boasted of a new terrace area, but it was opening the following week.The service desk did accommodate our request for a cork screw and assistance getting into the safe, which was locked when we got there. They were nice about it, but very, very slow. We had to call twice about the safe so we could leave the room. And the kicker? When we tried to take the path from the hotel, through the parking garage and into the Yum Center, all the doors were locked and there was no access for security reasons. As the official hotel of the event, some lobby signage telling people that in advance would have been quite nice.This isn't a bad hotel, but it's maybe time for an overhaul. Things seem a little dated, a little slow, a little lackadaisical.This hotel sucks! DIRTY. Poor staff attitudes. I'm currently here for a conference and usually the hotels that they pick are pretty good/nice. The outside of the Galt house is beautiful architecturally, but everything else leaves much to be desired. Got here and the check in process was really slow. Staff seemed to be indifferent to your existence. There wasn't a happy greeting. No explanation of services, restaurants and no map to tell you where anything is. I literally got my room key and that's it.Went to my first room (yep there's another). As soon as I opened the door the cigarette stench was overwhelming. I'm not picky, but knew I couldn't tolerate it. I went downstairs after being on hold for 10 minutes on the phone. I told them the situation and they asked if I wanted it febreezed. Ummmm no...would just smell like a floral ashtray. So I was not upgraded, though I didn't ask for it. Went back up to my ""old"" room and my key wouldn't work. There was a gentleman and he said, ""are you going in there? We were just in there and someone's luggage and diet coke were still in there"" (yes, that would be mine). So they had already rebooked the room without even checking to see if it was clean or waiting for my stuff to be moved. DISGUSTING--shows they weren't interested in clean rooms. This was in the east ""good"" tower. Had to go down again to get another room key. old towels were periodically left around. My friends room had a ceiling panel miss from her room.New room--mattresses suck. Everything is old. I'm falling asleep just taking so long to write this...Just take my advice...this place is horrible.Stayed here for a weekend after scoring an excellent on-line deal.The Galt House is pretty dated, but its still pretty nice.  Its a huge hotel and pretty rambling.  It actually consists of two buildings connected by a promenade.  There were a lot of in house bars, random retail stores, and some dining options.  It had the feel of a casino, but without the gambling.  Check in was a little weird.  We had to check in at one building although we were staying at the other.  Not a big deal, but an annoyance when its cold out and you're not expecting it. We ordered room service. Hamburger, fries, and a salad.  It was pretty mediocre to bad.  The location was great, the staff was friendly, and the rooms were nice and well kept.  I would definitely stay there again, but not at full price.The hotel is great! Clean beds, huge room with a nice view of the ohio river, and friendly staff. The reason I am giving the hotel a 4 star review is because they told us that our wifi was complementary but when we called the reception when we got to our room they told us we had to pay. But that was all cleared and didn't have to pay. Overall great hotel in the center of Louisville on the ohio river!Beware - the floor of the tub is about 3-4 inches higher than the floor - when stepping out your foot will need to drop further than your foot in the tub. And there is nothing to hold on to if your mat slips when you fall. I know because I now have a cracked fibula. They did let me borrow a wheelchair during my stay.This definitely affected my review!My wife and some friends spent the weekend in Lousville and booked through priceline, so the price was crazy good. For what we paid (right around $100) the rooms were great. The hotel is huge, and has some cool dining/drinking options, and is right in the heart of Louisville. The rooms were very large with a sitting room, and the bedroom separate. Lots of restaurants nearby, and a short walk to 4th street live.The 70's called. They want their decor back. The Galt House. my company has put us up in this place every year for a show we attend. While the service is fantastic and the main lobby is somewhat impressive. This place needs updating. We have one of the ""apartments"" every year. walking down the hallway is like a scene out of the movie ""the shining"" sure, it's well lit but with the dark decor. . it's a little creepy. you've been warned. i'm sure the whole hotel isn't like that but the part we stay at. . is. other than that, they have a terrific gym and a nice little bar area which is a nice place to gather and has a great view looking down 4th street and also at the river. overall not a bad place to stay. a lot of fun things to do nearby.After 10 nights here, i feel im qualified to give an honest review.  The hotel staff was not friendly at all.  The older  man working the counter in the guest tower can't even bother to smile, so after day 2 i simply  stopped saying hello too.  No one seems to care, or apologize, when things go wrong either.I had to have my keys remade my 2nd to last night here.  I had trekked all the way up to the 22nd floor, carted all my bags only to find keys not working, i go back down and the aforementioned guy did remake them but didnt offer any obligatory 'sorry for the inconveniences'.  Fine, whatev.As previously mentioned, this hotel is LOUD.  It sits right in top of a major highway.  Doesnt matter if you are the 8th floor or the 22nd, you will hear traffic.  Also the heat was jacked up to 80 my whole visit but the room temp never went above 74.  Hmmn.  Add the traffic noise to a random mechanical humm audible in my room and kiss a good nights sleep goodbye.Came back to my room twice in ten days to find it not cleaned.  When i called housekeeping they said they would send someone up - but who the hell wants to watch someone clean their room? Finally the second time i simply requested new towels and soaps.  Housekeeping explained that they had 900 checkouts that day and couldnt meet the need.  *sigh*....priorities....again no apologies or whatnot.  Its just sorta like 'we effed up but you have to deal with it'Finally the good:   The spinning restaurant (Rivue)has good food.  You have officially been warned that it spins - cuz i didnt know and lost my table returning from the bathroom.pricey.The bourbon bar was decent, but the bartender seemed bored and kept talking about what he would do to run the place.  Finally the front desk kept putting large groups of partiers next to me all week.   Seems like i am just about the only one in my floor, but teice they put a room of four in the 'connecting' room to me. Yeah, great, thanks for that.  Anyway i had to stay here but you dont....The only reason I'm giving this a hotel more than one star is because the sheets were clean and there was no evidence of bedbugs.  This is a very basic hotel.  Doors lock, shampoo in shower, etc.  If you have any allergies, beware:  They use enough room freshener and carpet deodorant on the rooms to put out a horse.The hotel is a bit outdated in decor but the service is amazing. Stayed her for a wedding and the suite was nice sized, valet was amazing, concierge excellent, and they were wonderful about getting dresses for the bride and wedding party into cars carefully. I would stay here again for a special occasion.This place has been an overall disaster. Granted it's in a great section of town, but the service is awful. I had not had hot water for 2 days, I kept complaining. On the third complaint I finally had maintence come and fix it. There was an apology, but imagine having to take freezing cold showers for 2 days! The clock was dusty, and the couch had stains on it. The AC makes wierd noises also, like its gurgling mouthwash. The bed is akward, that is the only way to describe it, not comfortable, not because it was too firm or too hard, just didn't feel right. My view in an executive suite, was over looking into a neighborhood parking garage.I would probably not stay at this hotel again, nor would reccomend anyone to do so.","['reason', 'house',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/21c-museum-hotel-louisville-louisville,21c Museum Hotel Louisville,4.5,$$$,169,"Probably the best holistic hotel experience I've had. Every single person on the staff was incredibly friendly. The art is top notch (there was an Al Farrow ""Wrath and Reverance"" exhibit which was new to me and totally fascinating). The drinks at Proof were delicious. The beds were comfortable and even the interior courtyard view from our room was cool. It's pricey, but absolutely worth it if you're in town for a special occasion. Will definitely stay here whenever I can.One side note: if there is anyway to identify the two gentlemen that were cleaning up puke after the Bruce Springsteen show (2/21/2016), I'd love to give them some praise. Some incredibly rude patrons were berating these men about why there was only one elevator operating after a show, WHILE THEY WERE CLEANING UP PUKE IN THE OTHER ELEVATOR. They truly could not wrap their heads around why they had to wait five whole minutes for the elevator to come back down while these men were in the middle of one of the worst cleaning jobs out there. These people don't deserve to stay in such a wonderful establishment, but unfortunately there's not a whole lot I can do to prevent them from staying there again. I cannot believe how little perspective some of the entitled, baby boomer snobs have. Bravo to the two men for handling the situation with grace and keeping their cool.My husband is the best guy in the world, hands down. For my birthday, he splurged on a trip to Millionaires Row at Churchill Downs with an overnight stay here at the 21c. It was quite the experience.21c is a very small chain of hotels that combine contemporary art and lodging in one. It makes for a very unique, boutique experience. The building itself is a contemporary art museum with changing exhibits. This is also combined with one of the top restaurants in Louisville, Proof on Main, which, I suppose, is art also itself. The museum, as like the hotel, is open 24/7, so to access the hotel, the elevators are run by keycards to provide for privacy for the hotel guests. The rooms are slightly smaller than other hotel chains, but the hotel has unique quirks that other hotels do not offer. There is also the option to book for ""art"" rooms, in which the rooms are actually the palette for the artwork and you get to ""sleep"" in the art. Pretty neat. The good:*The service. The front desk is amazing. We had lots of questions, and they answered each one. We also had some problems with the hotel room, but they were all smoothly and quickly solved by the staff. For one, they had to rebook us into a king room, which was easily done. When we also first entered the room, I flipped the light switch down and managed to either blow a fuse or the light bulb (not sure which, but it might have been both because i killed the phone too), but maintenance fixed it for us within 10 minutes. They couldn't deliver on a fork request though (or they forgot, not sure which).*Wi-fi is free. Um, how many boutique hotels do you know that offer free wi-fi??*Valet parking is $27. However, park in the same garage and walk 1/2 a block for $7 a day. The meters on the street are also free at night and before 7 AM. Where in the world in a metropolitan area can you park in a garage for $7/day?? *24 hour work out room. 24 hour sauna. 24 hour steam room. Would even be better if they provided disposable flip flops or robes. Also, the tvs in the exercise room are behind the machines. Which is extremely weird.*They provide complimentary water in the rooms.*Bathroom includes bathrobes. *Bathroom toiletries are MALIN+GOETZ, and they are nicely sized. The bathroom also comes with a rubber ducky, but no tub...so rubber ducky sat on the sink quite lonely.*Nepresso machine.*Comfortable, clean, nice roomsThe interesting:*The art. I like some contemporary art, and in some cases, it goes over my head. All the exhibits during this visit went over my head. They were a bit freaky, actually: like a chicken juxtaposed over a rabbit. Really not my kind of art. However, they do have a glass waterfall that is also the men's urinal on the first floor. That is pretty fun. And we had a penguin in our room! *They have a tricked out red bling-bling limo that you can rent. It is quite possibly the tackiest and the most astounding thing I have ever seen...at the same time.The Bad:*Minifridge was pressure-sensitized for the wet bar so we didn't want to use it and accidentally incur charges for it.*While the bathroom is sleek and modern, the shower glass does not completely keep the water in the shower. I found myself with a soaked bath rug after my shower. *The business center consists of two Apple computers. Which goes with the art theme, but for someone who does not use a Mac, it was really hard to me to figure out how to get my work done. *The windows are blinds and then a sheer curtain. Neither kept out the sun very well.*Room door was extremely hard to open - had to sharply pull down quickly to open the door.*Since it is in an industrial sort of building with cement walls, noise cushioning is horrible. There wasn't much street noise, but you could hear bathroom noises from next door. Worse was the woman who decided to go in the hall at 7 AM and proceed to lay it into some employee of hers over the phone. Your sleeping partner may have appreciated it, but we sure didn't.ART ART ART. If you are at all interested in contemporary art, definitely check out the 21c Museum. If you aren't? You should probably still check it out. I mean, it's free, it's open 24/7, and it may make you realize that there is a lot of contemporary art out there that is just, well . . . fun. Out-of-towners should visit, and locals should stop by with their out-of-towners and show them some of the culture Louisville has to offer.I have also had the pleasure of staying in the hotel--and not just in any room. No, my boyfriend treated us to a night in Asleep in the Cyclone. As others have mentioned, this is a supremely cool room. Although all of the 21c's rooms feature art, this room doesn't feature art, it IS art. It's an installation piece by  Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe that YOU CAN SLEEP IN. The inspiration is '60s utopian communities. It's weird and fun and fabulous and in no other place would I recommend a hotel room in a basement, but there you have it.And, as others have mentioned, dudes should be sure to use the first floor bathroom. The ladies' has art, too, but it's not nearly as fun.Awesome concept. Came here for nice dinner with my brother and was incredibly surprised and pleased!Great service- we ordered the cheese platter and a nice Malback and loved the southern spin and were completely stuffed. Afterwords we took our left over wine and walked around the gallery! Great option if you are looking for something different to do!21c is a go-to spot for me. I work downtown, and I frequent this place. The museum is wonderful, because it gives you a place to walk around, experience beautiful and interesting art, visit with friends, or just spend your lunch hour. The art exhibits change frequently, so you'll never get bored. Plus, they have a cute little gift shop in the front, so it's a nice place to pick up interesting gifts. I've stayed in the hotel once. I live in Louisville, so a couple of friends and I got a room here just for the experience. Our room was nice, but it really wasn't everything I would have expected for the price we paid for just one night. Of course, you can always expand your budget and get a really cool art installation room. I'm sure those are awesome! Now, on to the food. There's a restaurant inside 21c Museum Hotel called Proof on Main. It is amazing. Levon Wallace is the executive chef, and this man is a genius with food. Do yourself a favor and go check out something he's created. You'll be happy you did! You don't have to go to the museum or be a guest of the hotel to dine here, so check it out for dinner if you're ever in the downtown area. They also have amazing breakfast/brunch that I highly recommend. Of course, if you are a guest of the hotel you can dine here at almost any hour and you can even order a package that includes fresh cookies and milk to be delivered to your room. Heaven. I'll leave you with one last bit of delicious information. During the summer months Proof on Main brings a gelato cart out onto the sidewalk in front of its doors on Main Street every Thursday. It's called, of course, ""Gelato Cart Thursday."" They have the most to die for flavors (Like smoked vanilla and toasted marshmallow, spiced chocolate peanut brittle, and blackberry lime sorbet. Yum!) and you can step right up and enjoy a small sample spoon of each. Once you decide what you'd like you get a hefty scoop for $3.00. (But remember, cash only!) They put up information and a menu on their twitter page: @proofgelato. If you're hankering for some gelato now, or on any day other than a summer Thursday, they also offer it inside the restaurant. Enjoy!A must see. Must go. Must experience. What an interesting concept. A museum that is a hotel. And this place doesn't hold back. They bring the art full blast. Every where you look you will find something interesting and unusual. They rotate the art work every 6 months and try to keep local artist as their high lights and majority of what they exhibit. The art work that has displayed during my stay was unique and wonderfully refreshing. The hotel staff were incredibly nice. And honest. My buddy left a bag that had a couple expensive watches and they called us to let us know it was left behind. Really awesome. That would of ruined our trip for sure. Proof on main (attached restaurant) is also a great addition. Wonderful food menu and an extensive bourbon and whiskey menu as well. Try at least 2 different flights, when in Rome. Next time I come here I will have to stay in their suite. Beautiful and unique in its self. Definitely  spend the time and visit this museum and if you get the chance, stay in the hotel. You will be most delighted. Ps. Penguins rock.This was my third stay at this 21c and I was a bit disappointed this time around. For dinner, I ordered room service from Proof On Main and I found a dark hair in my pasta dish, which put me off from dinner entirely. Staying on a second floor room facing the front of the hotel meant that I had the pleasure of hearing everyone's conversation at the hotel's entrance through the exterior windows. It's unfortunate that I could also clearly hear regular level conversations in the adjacent room and in the hallways throughout the night. Very disappointing and definitely not worth the $500+ I paid for the night. Other than the hair in my dinner and the noise, I will say the staff is very friendly; although, the young lady who checked me out of the hotel did not bother to ask if I enjoyed my stay.Wow! Proof. I didn't eat in the restaurant, but I was hanging out at the bar. It definitely has a  Super modern, sleek, big city feel that made me feel just a little bit hipper. I was meeting a couple of crazy chicks there and they were already drunk by the time I got there. They were talking to these square corporate suits who turned out to be totally cool and ended up picking up the expensive bar tab. $300 for 6 people for 2 hours. At a swanky place like this you're paying for the atmosphere and these prices keep out the rif-raf. The trip to the restroom takes you through the museum which is actually a gallery which is a pretty weak attempt with no real art to speak of. The best art is actually outside in a space between buildings where the artist set up these devices that blow gigantic smoke rings but there is no sign telling you about the piece.Museum only review:Excellent contemporary art museum. I loved the artwork, especially some of the interactive stuff. Great way to spend 30-45 minutes in downtown.As a local, I have explored more of 21c art's exhibits rather than the hotel itself.  The art is thought provoking and modern.  It really pushes the boundaries of art, and the possibilities available.  The latest exhibit, hybridity is really interesting.  I love a reason to come visit, and 21c always seems to find one for me to visit.What a great place to stay. Three nights of bliss in a comfy, contemporary room with a posh atmosphere and luscious bed.My bathroom came with plenty of space, a tall drinking, robe and was perfectly accented with a rubber ducky!The staff always smiled and acknowledged while offering assistance. Not once did I find anything out of place. They really hold to high standards here.Around the property are red plastic molded penguins that are pieces of art themselves. They are the real residents on site, and add to the unique character of the property. You'll find them in pairs, or solo, looking out windows, waiting outside your door, or riding up and down the elevator.Proof, the in house restaurant, served a yummy spread for our crew while we stayed. (Breakfast only)The oddest thing? Pigeons. Yes. Pigeons.They're inside. They're party of an art display. The irony of pigeons inside this hotel really comes to light after the first night. Stunning rooms, impeccable decor and tidiness- never could you convince me without my seeing them, that pigeons would be anywhere near this hotel!The doorman in the morning was so nice, and personable. There's always one person that goes above and beyond, he's the guy. Very outgoing and friendly, always smiling and prompting good conversation. While I'm not sure how often I'll find myself in Louisville, if I come back, I won't stay anywhere else!!Luxury hipster hotel.  I give them credit for fabulously rehabbing an old brick building leaving no detail out.  I would love to give five stars for this alone; it's a really great use for an old industrial building with a great location.  However, our room faced an interior courtyard where there was some kind of wedding or party on a Saturday night.  The music was so loud our windows shook late into the night.  The overnight valet parking is also overpriced at $27.  Self park and save the cash.  I might even go as low as 2 stars but bump them to 3 because they are a small outfit and not a national mega hotel chain.  I like to support local business and they clearly put a lot of thought into their concept.We got this on Hotwire. One of the best places we've stayed.  So much fun. Lots of great restaurants close by. Fun touches like the rubber ducky and the Penguins everywhere ... Go. You won't be sorry.Stayed here on the 31st with the NYE package and it was absolutely worth it.Great location, great lobby and galleries, and fantastic room.  The staff at the desk were all great!One of my favorite spots in Louisville. I love stopping in here. Free to look around; no charge. They get some really interesting exhibits too.When you walk in there's a gift stop to the right and check-in for hotel to the left. And blue meerkat statues. And red penguins, of course. There are a few big exhibit spaces upstairs and then several more exhibit spaces downstairs. The whole place has lots of interesting kitschy things to look at. Whether it's a smoke ring maker outside or a screen with letters that fall onto your projected head in the hall, there's lots to enjoy.The last exhibit I saw had pieces touching on animal extinction; it hit me so hard I almost cried. I know this place gets some buzz, but not nearly enough in my opinion. You want deep art without steep cost? Look no further.Really great hotel to stay at, or a museum to visit. The customer service here is outstanding. Kyle is the man! Definitely will come back here next time I'm in KY.Thanks guys!I love this unique boutique hotel, where every wall is filled with captivating modern art. There are extensive galleries off the lobby and downstairs, and many different media are represented. There is also an excellent restaurant, Proof on Main. Many of the city's most interesting attractions are within two blocks. This is definitely the place to stay when passing through Louisville.Only stayed one night on a pass through trip.....Great room and loved the art!  The design carried into the room and made for a great experience.Amenities (toiletries, steam room, bathrobes etc) were well enjoyed.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.We had dinner outside the hotel but after dinner cocktail in the bar....nice selection and priced like most downtown spots.Wish I had more time to spend there to enjoy the art and all it had to offer.As someone who was born and raised in Louisville, I know it's easy to forget some of the gems in your own backyard.  21c is one of those gems.  I knew it was there, I had wanted to visit, but just hadn't made it out until recently.  Boy have I been missing out!  I'm so glad I was able to make it there recently and see the place -- it's pretty impressive.  Rotating art exhibits give visitors a reason to come back and see what may be new.  The theme while I was there was Cuba, and the museum featured works by many Cuban artists. The works had a purpose, often juxtaposing something familiar (eg: high-end name brands) with something less familiar (eg: the high-end name brand printed on an image from Cuba's past). One of my favorites from the exhibit, was a candle with a light cord and plug attached, but exhibited far away from an outlet.  This was intentional, as the artist married past and future technology with no way to use either of them (no match, no outlet -- the light can't work). The hotel is connected to Proof on Main, so if you get an appetite while you're there, you can pop next door for a little something to munch on. I had a slider and some fries, both of which hit the spot for a traditional burger and fries. Still, the garlic/parsley flavor and perfect texture on the fries, along with the seasoning on the slider patty (oh, plus the bacon!) made it something special instead of just a ""meh"" meal. I'll keep my eye out for the next exhibit at 21c and you can be sure I'll head down there to check it out!How have I not reviewed this place before?  I've been a few times now, but I think I must've just reviewed Proof.  I love 21C.  I dear friend introduced me to it first and we went back again to entertain some out of towners and then went back one more time on my own.  I love the art work and it changes frequently.  This is a must place to check out if you're in Louisville.  Residents and visitors.","Wow, what an incredible hotel! 21c is a real experience. From check-in, this boutique art hotel delivers superior customer service. It was a seamless process arriving to our hip and funky room which had lots of space and an absolutely luxurious shower. The two-floor exhibit in the lobby was super cool with lots of interactive components. It not only inspired an evening of insightful and invigorating conversation, it also had us running around like small children with smiles on our faces. In addition, the hotel's restaurant and bar were exceptional, arguably the best food we had during our visit, and there was a lot of competition. Whether on business or vacation, I highly recommend this unique hotel; it's a gem of the city.This place is amazing.We stayed here while experiencing the bourbon trails and this hotel was everything and then some.The restaurant that is attached to the hotel was a nice perk. I went down the next day after sitting at the bar the night before and they already knew my drink and by name.The museum is a really nice touch to the whole experience as well. It's really nice to have access at all hours to avoid the crowds and revisit favorite pieces.The hotel is located downtown which made getting around convenient. Out of all the traveling I done, this has been the most unique hotels I've stayed at.Thank you for a wonderful experience, 21c!For a super high end expensive hotel They are very much lacking in the basics Like a lite bulb in your room over 40 watts Only 20 year olds could navigate this There is no 24 hour room service so no early coffee if you have an early flight The house keeping will throw out a perfectly full cocktail if you leave your room and don't tag it The air blows like you're in Alaska so impossible to get comfortable and the left over food some other guest threw on the deck is another plus .... Which you paid more for ... The deck My suggestion is pick another hotel...Not worth half of what I paid Very sad and disappointed Just booked an earlier flight home because I can't take more of this stayLouisville has so many great places, and 21c Museum Hotel is definitely on that list. I have not stayed at the museum as a guest, but I've perused the art galleries on several occasions. The staff is always very friendly, and really encourage you to check out all of the art. It's a great place for downtown workers to visit on their lunch break, or to even have a walking meeting. The exhibits are changed quite frequently, so there is almost always something new to see. I'd definitely recommend stopping in for a look!I have never stayed at the hotel, but I have visited the museum many times. And I absolutely adore it!It is free to walk around and take in all the exhibits. They change their exhibits, I think, about 3 times per year. And there is *always* something interesting to see. The staff has always been friendly and helpful.If you are looking for something to do as a local, with a visitor, or you're bored and downtown....stop by! It's worth the time!Very awesome rooms and decor, really chill vibes and young. Loves the place, staff and rooms. Only thing I didn't like was the random Knocks on the door for room service! 9 pm, 1am just random times. At 1 point I was sleeping and a woman entered my room. She quickly apologized and quickly exited. I just laughed I really don't get upset. But really awesome stay, and I would love to stay again.My wife took me here and it was amazing. The art itself was just breathtaking. The interactive art was just as appealing. There's art at every step and turn and when you enter the lower level it's like stepping into another world of art. We didn't have lunch or dinner that time.  However, when we go back we'll have to try it out.OMG, this is probably one of the coolest hotels I've stayed at. It's a hotel and museum, what can be better!? there is also a restaurant and bar attached! When I visited downtown Louisville during the weekend it was pretty dead so it's GREAT to have a place like this where everything is at one place. When we went, we got an upgraded to a bigger room. YAY. It was spacious, clean and we were greeted with chocolate on the bed.  Their bathroom goodies are fabulous! It's actually smaller versions of the shampoo and etc. sold at their store, so if you love it enough you can purchase larger versions.I guess one thing that was a little annoying was finding parking but all in all, great place to stay/drop by!I have stayed here 4 times-the first 3 times were very good experiences but fro the time I tried to check in this time I noticed a decline in customer service and general confusion of the staff.  However, I cannot recommend that anyone stay here-nor will I ever again due to the fact that this hotel knowingly placed unauthorized charges on my folio bill.  They charged me for the room next door to mine and despite admitting an error had been made in charging my card  (calling it a ""training error"") they have refused to remove the charges until the other guest pays for the room.  Rude, disorganized and unfamiliar with the concept of guest service.All kinds of awesome.  Be sure to take time to search out the random penguins throughout the hotel and to visit the exhibits on every floor.  It's expensive but definitely worth the experience.We came here for a wedding (didn't stay here) so I can only review 21c as a venue and art gallery.There is a ton of modern art, from the moment you walk in the front door. Some exhibits I liked more than others, but all of it was interesting.As for the wedding space, you go downstairs from the lobby into another part of the museum. Yes, there was art there too on the walls of the 3 rooms we had to ourselves during the wedding. There were 2 bars set up, which was plenty. After the initial rush during cocktail hour, we never waited more than a couple minutes in line.The space itself is very pretty. Clean, white walls that really showcase the art. The red penguins really are cute too.Friends stayed at the hotel and they said they really liked it. I'm glad I got to check this place out while in town.Nice hotel in downtown Louisville that has the added bonus of being a small art museum.  The art is literally all over the hotel and it's definitely worth checking out...you don't need to be a guest to see a large portion of the art work.Our room was spacious and clean and the front desk staff was very friendly and efficient. The hotel was originally a warehouse and they've kept some of the original support beams visible, which is interesting when compared to the overall modern feel of the the hotel. We weren't in our room for long, but it was very comfortable and I would definitely stay here again.The restaurant at the 21c is a hot spot and we enjoyed our dinner there.  Don't overlook this hotel if you are planning a stay in Louisville.I finally had a chance to stay here and I can say, the experience lived up to my first taste of the museum, hotel and restaurant.  It had been some time since my last visit, so I was happy to see brand new exhibits as well as the familiar quirks and oddities that were present the first time. When I first arrived, I decided to catch some of the playoff game in the hotel's bar while doing a little work. It was the perfect atmosphere for what I was looking for - a little energy but still low-key. As the game went on, I was pulled further and further away from work by interesting conversations with other business travelers, a television celebrity as well as the super cool bartender. The night ended with us having a mini dance party in the falling letters by the elevator. I was also happy to find a room larger than I expected that was clean, comfortable and with very subtle (but still quirky accents.) Everyone can use a rubber ducky in their shower and there was a Mint Julep book and cocktail shakers, just in case you wanted to get jiggy with the mini bar.Breakfast was also much better than I expected and very reasonably priced. My scrambled egg whites were perfectly pre-salted, my bacon was thick and flavorful and my coffee was served with cream and a few lumps of brown and white sugar.  But the topper is when I checked out. I randomly forgot to bring a brush, but since I was wearing my hair back, it was not in full panic. When I went to check out, I asked if there was a nearby drugstore to pick one up and to my surprise, they gave me a complimentary brush in a cute little bag like magic. (First hotel to ever give me a bristled brush!)So yea, basically my stay here only solidified my love for the place. Best hotel in Louisville and one of my favorite, ever.A free museum in the bottom of a cool hotel?!?!?! Yes, please! What a great find to explore with my daughter for an hour or so. I'd go back as the exhibits change as well.Very cool museum/hotel concept!I stayed here three nights and the room was spacious, comfy and generally on the upper-echelon of hotel experiences. While I only had breakfast once in their attached restaurant, it was done well. The staff was fantastic and deserve nothing but the highest kudos.Would certainly check out 21c when in Louisville again. Just watch out for the constantly migrating red penguins!Great visit! Enjoyed the unique setting and hospitable service! Rooms were spacious and artwork was displayed everywhere.Oh, this is a hotel?  I hadn't noticed.  I was driven here by a local and got only as far as the swank bar.Don't let the coolness intimidate you, though:  the clientele here seems like a pretty cosmopolitan mix of people.  Besides young urban clubgoers, heavily bearded and flanneled hipsters, and square middle-aged business travellers, there were at least a few normal people like me.And our server was super sweet.  Do you know what was not super sweet, but rather just the right amount of sweet?  My drink.  They have an outstanding cocktail here called Late Harvest, with rye, allspice liqueur, and a couple of bitters.  It's a perfect wintertime libation.  If you like straight whisk(e)y, they have a wide selection that goes beyond bourbon into rye and scotch territory.  I got to sample only a couple before it was time to stumble home.  But it was a memorable Saturday evening.Amazing space.... been to the one in Louisville also... blown away everytime by the vision that goes into these. Can wait to see others.After a long business meeting, i was referred to 21c by a local (since I am not from Louisville) and I was very happy with the selection. My sister and I ordered the Cauliflower 'steak' sandwich and the brussel sprout salad. Both items were really great. Being from NYC, I am slightly biased that we have the best food in the world but this place definitely meet, if not exceed my expectations. The modern museum inside is definitely a plus and makes the whole decor very impressive. The doorman in front was so awesome, along with the bartender (bc we sat at the bar for lunch.) Cheers to Louisville, good people and good food!!Since I have now had the immense pleasure of staying at the hotel, I wanted to update my review to reflect that. We had a wonderful staycation in downtown Louisville that was simply 21C and dinner at St Charles Exchange. It was classy, relaxing, and such a great way to spend a night out/in. The room was plenty big, cozy, cool art (varies from room to room), and a solid mini bar. The bed was like sleeping in the clouds and we ended up spending half the night watching movies and drinking wine not wanting to get back up from the heavenly comfort. The staff was beyond incredible. Friendly, helpful, and seemed genuinely happy. Not a shred of judgment when I managed to check out and leave before realizing I intelligently left my phone in the room. And the door was politely held for me with a smile each trip in and out. And a couple weeks ago I got to check out the new suite downstairs designed by an awesome pair of artists from top to bottom. Literally. Even the ceiling was incredible. I never knew carpet could be so badass. Or so all encompassing. Pretty sweet. Nicely done 21C.","definitely one of the most overrated restaurants in Louisville mostly because The people and atmosphere are pretentious. However, The food is superior to most places.I'm going to just list the highs and lows.  Love the artwork!  Bartenders are extremely friendly and very good at their jobs.  Loved that the iron has an extra long cord.  Love the rubber ducky in the shower.  Wish there was a tub though.  (The tub comment was the worst thing I could come up with.  Well that and the price of the room.)  If you can afford $300 a night then it's the place to come.I am a fan of boutique and unusual hotels.  Sure, it's nice to accumulate points that really don't get me anywhere as far as hotel stays go, but there's always something wonderful about staying in a hotel that has something unique around every corner.  If you have the opportunity to explore every corner, which I did not.When I got a job offer in Chicago and started the process of packing up my life (and my cats), I mapped out a somewhat unusual road trip to take from DC to Chicago.  Instead of going through states I had already been through on my first cross-country move (this now makes #4 very large life change move), I decided to go through two states which I had not yet visited (i'm on a mission to hit all 50- I'm at 33) by traveling through WV and KY.  When deciding where to stop, I looked at either Louisville or Lexington, which were roughly an hour apart.  I settled on Louisville solely because of this hotel, picked because it is pet-friendly.  After a long morning of watching movers pack up my belongings, I stuffed my Mini Cooper with the rest of my life (and the cats) and headed west.  And kept driving.  And kept driving.  And kept driving.  Let me tell you, West Virginia and Kentucky are DARK states.  There is nothing out there in the middle of the night.  I felt like I was in a horror movie.  One of the cats was not too thrilled either as he peed on a bag full of blankets.  When I finally roll up to 21c at 11 p.m. at night, I was greeted by an adorable man in his early 20s, who was quite understanding that a) I was moving, b) I was carting two cats in a large carrier and c) that my car smelled like pee and would he be so kind as to valet it.  Upon entering, I was welcomed by cheery staff undeterred that I looked like hell and that I had far too much crap for one person for one night.  They all said hello to the kitties and we were up in our room.  And what a room it was.  Much more spacious than some chain room and of course the art made it that much cooler.  Frankly, the room was HUGE.  The cats and I settled in for the night (I slept like a corpse) and after the best eggs benedict I've ever had (they have some unique, delicious options for room service) as well as a shower with delicious smelling products we were up to continue on our journey to our new home.  At least we were after I dragged my tuxedo cat out from under the bed.  The gentleman who brought my car was also understanding about the clusterfeck of me and pets, and we were on our way. Bottom line- I want to go back to Louisville just to stay at this hotel again.  It's THAT good.The museum inside of the hotel is a great destination in the Ville. The curator has great taste in my opinion. The art is fresh and edgy without being too over the top so it appeals to the wide audience. It isn't a huge collection so it only takes about an hour or two. So it isn't overwhelming for people who don't like museum. PLUS ITS FREE!I came to see the gallery and stayed for a cocktail (or two!).  This is a place you have to stop in on your way through town if you are a visitor or it is the place you should take your next date if you are a local.  The art gallery is open 24 hours and it is a great gallery that is a manageable size.  The bar Proof makes great drinks and you can bring them with you while you look at the art.  Be sure to look around for art everywhere.  The red penguins outside, the bathroom, the elevator. There is art everywhere.  Enjoy!Great art gallery/museum.  Lots of fun works that pushed the envelope creatively without being too far out there.Be sure to visit the bathroom.Unique but comfortable, the staff is friendly and the artwork is incredible. The rooms themselves are comfortable and clean. I can't wait to go back!I could not think of anything else to ask for in a hotel! From the chocolates on the pillow to the cookies and milk we ordered to the room, the comfortable beds and the awesome art, to the friendly staff, everything was great. Money well spent!WALK THROUGH REVIEW ONLYI have never stayed at the 21c hotel, but have attended many events here. The exhibits are always great conversation starters and thought provoking. There is a lot of open space with modern cut and shading to give you that artsy vibe.There are two main gallery floors then you have to take elevators to the roof top or hotel rooms. The main gallery floor entrance area is connected to the Proof on Main bar and restaurant. Most events take place on the basement level that has an open central area with four smaller spaced rooms connected.The Customer service is astounding. I have never roamed the halls without some staff asking me if I needed help or to order a drink from the Proof on Main bar. During events there is always plenty of staff to help with questions, creating cocktails, cleaning up, or serving appetizers so that the event feels effortless.I insist that you always check out the restrooms and downstairs black lit felt room.Are u kidding me.  1. Event staff took everyones 1/2 to 2/3 FULL cocktail drinks away all night long when we weren't looking.  This was absurdly ripping off the person paying for their event tab BY THE DRINK.  2. The catered food was OK.  Nothing special.  The food at the beginning was undercooked and cold.  3. We turned down the AC in our room from 68 to the lowest it would go 64 and the temp never went below 71.4. We were told a roll away bed would be charged $ and told their wasn't one available all in the same nonsensical conversation by the night manager who was extremely rude on the phone.  5. We were told the bar and room service both had food until 1am and then we're told by the bar they didn't have food at 12:30.  Room service never answered at 12:30.6. We waited at least 30min to get a taxi.Walk Through Only....We walked through and checked out the artwork.  There were some really nice exhibits on display.  We enjoyed the time we were there and really liked the ring smoke exhibit.  Nice plays and looks like a nice hotel.  Would recommend.Decent cocktails, great art, and a cool vibe adds up to even more than the sum of its parts. One of the most fun nights I've had!I would stay here in the future, but if you're in town, a visit to the bar/museum is a minimum.In all of my travels from Beantown to Barcelona, 21C in Louisville is by far one of the coolest places I've ever stayed. Stylish interior, gourmet food (including the room service), free wifi and the friendliest, hippest staff. I was lucky enough to check in on Halloween and see the employees' creative and ghoulish costumes. This place is awesome.Sleek, modern architecture with a unique, inspiring, thought provoking, and diverse modern art collection. The men's bathroom is not to be missed.We weren't staying at the hotel but buzzed in to check out the art. It was well worth the time. I can't believe that it's free. Slightly pretentious, but people were generally nice. Cool gift shop.I'm going to make this a stop every time I'm in Louisville.i really enjoyed this relatively small meuseum.   and it's free!  recommended.Very creative concept botique hotel.  We looked around the galleries and had a drink at the bar/ restaurant called Proof.  Had a very relaxing and fun time.Incredible place. Words can't describe it. Better than the W. Spacious. Unique. Definitely a boutique-hotel feel without the pretentious posh. No skinny jeans required.I would be far take the trip to Louisville to visit this place again. Whimsical and allows you to bring cocktails inside the museum to stroll with at your leisure. Also doesn't hurt that its attached to a great bar/restaurant called Proof. Very unique and worth the visit!Fun, fabulous and quirky boutique hotel!  The staff is super friendly and courteous.  What is not to love about fun modern art! (Ok, so their recent display behind the check in counter is a bit bizarre)  I loved my luxurious room with soft robes, bed and espresso maker.  If I am fortunate enough to return to Louisville one day, I would certainly stay there again.Methinks the lady doth protest too much! We just wrapped up another perfect stay at the 21C, which was our fourth since they opened. We've never had a single problem. It is great, and I feel well justified with that assessment since they just won the 2009 Conde Nast Reader's Choice Award as Top Hotel in the US. It kind of reminds me of a combination of the W and the MoMA. Rooms are sleek and modern. They are spacious and include a desk and lounge chair. Bathrooms are modern and include great smelling Malin + Goetz products. They have huge plasmas and preloaded iPods and radios so you can rock out. Modern spa with sauna and steamroom and gym with free weights, treadmills and elipticals for your use in the basement. I also love the art and the little touches like the rubber ducky in the tub and the Red Penguins everywhere. You enter the lobby into their modern art museum. The art is trippy and the black light room makes me feel like I'm back in school and up to no good. The hip Proof restaurant and lounge is just off to the right. That looks to be the best scene in town, and you can get White Dog with your bourbon flights. Even the bathrooms in the lobby are really cool with a waterfall two way glass wall. We met a couple that was having their wedding reception in the lower lobby that must be an excellent setting. I've stayed at a bunch of high end hotels and the 21C is right up there as one of my favorites. I look forward to it every time we get down to Louisville, and I just love the penguins.","This was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a long time.  I couldn't believe my luck stumbling across this gem.  There is something just extraordinary about being able to wander around an exceptional museum in your hotel lobby at 1am.  Seriously, how cool is that?The room was nice -- not fireworks, exactly, just a great room, bed, amenities.  I suppose I could evaluate it in more depth, but the museum is the star of the show.We did have a nice meal (with an exceptionally dismissive and irritating server) at the restaurant.  Yum to fried kale!Although I have never slept here. I have been several times. I have been in the rooms as well. Well, a King Atrium View. Beautiful. Love it. Love the style of the floor and how it seemed rustic yet modern. The Art in this place is just phenomenal.I love this hotel.  I just wish that I could get back to it more often.This hotel could only be better if winning Derby horses were available for carriage rides.With the economy the way it is, my husband and I now usually opt for short weekend jaunts as opposed to big vacations. Since we live in Lexington, that makes Louisville and 21c PERFECT for us, so we go here for special occasions:-We spent our wedding night in one of the beautiful balcony rooms.-We spent the last night before one of my husband's month-long European tours in one of the regular rooms.-We spent my birthday in the ""Asleep in the Cyclone"" room, and since that was last night, that's the room I'm jazzed to review right now.Move over, Ace Hotel Portland (which I also love), because WOW.""Asleep in the Cyclone"" is nothing short of amazing. It is an art exhibit that moonlights as a totally functional and comfortable hotel room. Everywhere you look there is interesting psychedelic-style artwork carefully chosen by the artists who designed the room, including a ""cabinet of curiosities"" featuring totally made-up book titles, authors, and bizarre pieces. There is a theme here, and if you are paying attention it is as artistically rewarding as a Joyce novel or Basinski record.There are big, comfy pillows tossed about on different little nooks throughout the room. You can perch on one level and watch TV if that's your thing or perch on another or another with a glass of wine to get a better view of this amazing room. And while you're enjoying your wine and the cabinet of curiosities, you can also listen to records on an old-school cabinet phonograph--there's an artist-curated collection that compliments the room's Drop City vibes quite nicely. I in fact highly recommend the Alice Coltrane and the Pearls Before Swine for your magical evening.I took pictures, but I'm not posting them. Because you need to see this room for yourself.Don't book this room if you're in town to shop or be out on the town, but book it if you want to enjoy a night in--an atmospheric, psychedelic hang and a totally immersive art experience.And please--don't turn on the TV.Didn't stay at the hotel &amp; didn't eat at their restaurant (Proof), but was intrigued by the huge gold David statue, red penguins &amp; red rhinestone-covered limousine out front.Loved the artwork inside - very unique - gift shop was also cool - love the fact that you can view the art at all hours.Restaurant seemed very pricey &amp; staff (both at restaurant &amp; hotel) seemed a little snooty in that annoying hipster way but I didn't let it bother me.Would definitely go back to check out what art they feature next if/when I return to Louisville.I stayed at the 21c in Louisville over a year ago and was thoroughly impressed! The staff was super friendly and helpful. The hotel design was fantastic--from the rooms, down the lobby areas, exhibits, and even the elevator area with the live camera projection. I loved that the fitness area was open 24/7, including the sauna. Couldn't wait to come back so I had to book a room for my upcoming weekend trip. Last time I had an amazing dinner at Proof with bourbon flights and platter of cured meats. This time I may just check out the bar. Hoping the 21c doesn't disappoint the second time around!I visited Louisville with a work conference this weekend really appreciated this place. Love the idea and while I didn't stay here I would be interested in doing so. Restaurant was amazing. Art was cool.This was a unique hotel for sure. The hallway on the floors had very modern and cool pictures of female faces with big red lips. One wall in my room was a brick wall. Definitely different.With all that said it didn't really make it special. It was novel but didn't do much for me. My internet didn't work. When I called the operator they said they reset the server or something and could have someone call me. I just wanted to send two important emails quickly to clients and go to bed. I had been up since 4 am. I work in technology and didn't want to spend 30 mins. on the phone with some tech support person. Wasn't worth it. Then in the morning the water was cold...fortunately I was only driving that day and could take a proper shower at the next hotel.The cool stuff is fun but for the business traveler in particular you need the basics taken care of first. Next time will stay at the Marriott.They have a House car that is a limousine with about 70,000 red glass beads glued to it. They have red penguins throughout the hotel, even threatening to jump off the roof. In fact, one of those red penguins is sitting on the desk as I write this review. Don't believe me? Check out the pic. I had to turn off the monitor because the light was freaking out the camera and putting the poor penguin in a shadow.Let's see...awesome car to ride around in and red penguins surprising you around every turn. Anything else I need to cover? Oh yeah, the rooms. They're swell, too. Seriously, this just might be my favorite hotel in the Midwest. I've stayed all over the region; Chicago, Indy, Cincy, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Omaha, and this is one of the most fun and unique joints I've found anywhere. I was also entering an elevator here once at the same time Chris Robinson was exiting. I wanted to tell him I was staying at the hotel but I figured that would just make him ""jealous again.""The place is unique, well thought out and the staff well trained. The corner suite we booked as part of a package was fair value, with lots of space, a very comfortable bed and not too much room clutter. The only disappointment was the bathroom as the shower heads were rather basic and the bath an insult to tubs! In a top of the range room with a separate tub, I expected a tub you could soak in, but all we really had was an over sized shower tray. This I might expect in a SPG or Hilton...but here it was a real letdown.Another minor point...which really did not effect our stay...but we were looking forward to after reading the website...original artwork on our suite room walls. What we got....paint and bugger all artwork...not a picture in sight.....no pictures at all! If you declare you are offering something then do.The other issue we had was the noise from the street. When the place was constructed I would have hoped that good insulating glass could have been provided for the windows. One is in the city staying at a cutting edge place. You book a top of the range room and are woken enough to use the ear plugs that I provided. Plainly noise has been commented on before so why not put complimentary ear plugs in the room???? If airport hotels can insulate...why wasn't it designed here?I should state that I own and run an award winning small inn and do have a high level of expectation and can be critical as well as offering genuine praise, but I provide ear plugs as some of our room locations are noisy. It shows an attempt at offering a solution that does not cost the earth.Overall the staff as has been mentioned before are very good, efficient and not up them selves. The red penguins that move around the hotel are amusing and cannot help but make one smile.Would I stay again...sure, but I would seek a room away from the street, which i believe the suites cannot offer?Oh the ground floor toilets....in particular the mens are worth a visit. Here the architect had a sense of humour and it works!My significant otter and I planned a weekend getaway to Louisville and decided to stay at 21C primarily to enjoy meals at Proof on Main. Also, guard penguins. Safety.The otter had the car valet parked and service was speedy and friendly. We checked in and headed up to our room. Art is just about everywhere. In the elevators, in the halls, covering the tissue boxes.Furniture in the room was comfortable, and there is plenty of lighting. There is a nightly turn-down service and they restock the ice.The bathroom is a good size, with shower only. The toiletries have yummy scents like peppermint, rum and cilantro.Our room included a mini-fridge with sodas, booze, Pringles (what? you don't keep your chips in the fridge?), and an intimacy kit (don't get snarky about the latter on FB if you're linked to the venue. lesson learned).21C's location is near many museums, restaurants (but, ya gotta go to Proof) and  the ""Yum! Center"" (the sheep get dressed up like one another and flock here).The otter and I enjoyed our stay and are discussing a trip to Cincinnati to check out the new 21C and Metropole.As others have said, a delightful and unusual boutique hotel. Great art - of course, but also stylish design, comfortable rooms, excellent customer service. A pleasure to stay here!If you'd like to adopt a giant plastic red penguin named Chad he usually hangs out at the bar in the hotel of 21c.  Really, the place is one of a kind.  I stayed at 21c several years ago and came back again last week and the magic was still there.  21c is definitely a bright spot in the Louisville social scene and a more sophisticated one, which is a nice contrast from the sophomoric shenanigans that happen on 4th Street.No doubt the 24 hour museum attracts crowds as much as the lively bar scene at the hotel.  But the hotel staff and the hotel itself are equally memorable.  Every component of the hotel is surrounded by some type of art, whether it is the view from the amazing men's restroom (ladies, do make it a point to check it out) to the elevator to the art that's posted in your room.  The staff is incredibly helpful and on point with the best restaurants in town as well.Whether you're fortunate enough to stay at the hotel or just sipping some bourbon at the bar, 21c is definitely a place to spend some quality time.Scored a room for a decent price at 21C at the last minute, when I decided to stop in Louisville on my recent road trip. I kind of wished I had not been so tired and harried from traveling, it would've been easier to enjoy the place. Everything is super modern and gorgeous, my boyfriend and I kept commenting that we weren't sure we were cool enough to be there. The layout of the gallery is inviting and the space flows very well. Took some time to walk around all of it even though I was tired, and I'm glad I did.The room was nice - exposed brick wall, cool chairs and lighting. Only minor complaints were the below average water pressure and the bed was kind of hard, didn't feel as high quality as everything else did. Our iPhones (on Verizon) had barely any signal up in the third floor room. Had to rely on the wifi but I kind of expected that considering the type of building it's in. It was better in the lobby/gallery and near windows.Overall it's an interesting concept that's executed very well. Very impressive, Louisville.This hotel rocks!!The artwork is so cool, I feel cooler just by being in this place.The rooms - sweet! Mine had gorgeous brick walls, and the bed was really comfortable. Plus, the bathroom had a little rubber duckie in it. Awww.The Gallery event rooms downstairs were fantastic, as was the event staff, the event manager, Lori (who I tried really hard to make life difficult for), the food, the doormen, the front desk staff. Seriously! Everyone in this place embodies customer service at it's very best.The restaurant attached to 21c has great food (try the bison burger - yum!) and a really extensive and fun drink list.Overall, one of the nicest hotel experiences I've ever had (and this was a work trip, I wasn't even there to enjoy myself)!We recently got married. Because we are not beach people and we love contemporary art, we booked our honeymoon for the cyclone room in 21c. My first tip: if the cyclone room is open, book it. You will never look at a hotel room the same.Our experience was nothing short of complete magic. I wish I could list all of the details they completely nailed. The staff were the perfect mix of professional and chill. None of that fake ""at your service"" veneer, but they were seriously at our service 24 hours a day. Then there's the art. Oh my. Their chief curator--whom I had the pleasure of meeting--has done an exceptional job with acquisitions. She also has an amazing way with words. The descriptive placards are probably the best I have ever read--accessible, intelligent, careful, tight.I can't say enough about how much I love the mission, the model, the mode of execution. I have told nearly every person who will listen that they should immediately fly or drive to Louisville and spend a weekend at 21c. This is definitely at the top of my what-to-do-with-my-tax-refund list.A wonderful experience. The hotel is contemporary in the best way, yet it incorporates the most intrinsic, old-school attributes of successful hospitality. While I did not have time to fully explore the art installations, I sincerely enjoyed those I came across. Why not fill a hotel with quirky art that makes you think? I really enjoyed the chocolates on my pillow, the luxurious robe in my bathroom, the genuinely friendly and accomodating concierge, the Nespresso machine, the complimentary WiFi and NY Times, and the constant, rich integration of modern art. I WILL stay at 21C again. Just fantastic!Stayed at this lovely property for a La Spinneta Wine Dinner.  First good impression was when the Manager of the restaurant in the hotel (Proof on Main) called us up to make sure we knew there was a special rate at the hotel for anyone attending the dinner.  Since we had already made a reservation at the normal room rate, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we would save money!Second good impression:  pulling up at out front and meeting Manny the doorman/porter/valet/all around nice person.  He helped with the bags and offered to take them up to our room while we made our way to a local restaurant so that we would make the 2 pm cut off time for lunch.Third good impression:  being greeted by name by the Managers/Sommeliers at Proof and then having one of them bring over the winemaker (from Piedmont, Italy) and introduced us.The good impressions never really stopped: from the restaurant server who didn't just give us directions to Gallery Four for the reception, but insisted on walking us there;  to the desk staff and restaurant servers at breakfast who bent over backwards to insure that everything, simply everything, was to our satisfaction.All in all, have never been in a hotel where the staff at every level was more attentive, friendly and helpful!   In addition, the room was absolutely lovely and the wine dinner spectacular!   Manny was also on duty when we left and he brought us two cold bottles of water for the road - outstanding service!The fact that there is also a magnificent art gallery in the hotel and beautiful art pieces on every floor just adds to the attraction.The 21c Hotel and Museum is a serious American gem.  The concept of a contemporary art gallery combined (that is free to the public, no less) and a posh hotel is genius.  I have only visited the museum portion and adjoining bar/restaurant, but I was impressed by the quality and variety of art in the gallery, as well as the caliber of drink and food.  Wow. So many cool interactive exhibits, too, like the eye balls that watch you in the bathroom as you wash your hands to the raining alphabet near the elevators.  I can't even imagine how awesome the rooms are... I am going to save some money to stay there in the near future.  Totally worth it.","This place was the venue for a New2Lou event on a Sunday evening this month (December).  The main lobby was designed in a typical modern fashion and the sign-in table was posted at the top of a staircase where you could get a great view of the party beneath.Two galleries were connected to the venue room and were open for viewing which made for great entertainment.Appetizers were provided: I tried all of it needless to say.  Sliders, fries, cream cheese with a beet mixture and bruscetta, and bratwurst.  An all American assortment I'd say.New2Lou was celebrating their 3rd anniversary and the party was hopping!  The only downside had to be the acoustics.  Just too loud for a conversation unless you took to the galleries.  The sliders were DRY, but they had great potential.I'll have to give this place another try though, I've heard good things- but minus two stars for the burgs and the sound.This hotel is awesome!  I heard about this museum hotel before I went to Louisville, but unfortunately it was packed (maybe because of the Truck Show, or maybe it's is always packed).  So I only visited the place.  But it's awesome!  Loved the red penguin, and the water drop sculpture!  (the one with a projector and water-dripping sound)I thought the store can be more interesting.  I hope they sell some red penguin key rings or other small animal sculptures, because I really wanted some.  They only had a big (candle stick size) penguin sculpture made of china, which was too big for me since I was travelling.This was an amazing hotel.A wonderfully modern hotel with a contemporary decor. Well trained, amiable and knowledgable staff. The art museum downstairs is a wonderful place to walk through with a glass of wine or pass time while waiting for dinner.We didn't stay, but we wandered through the art gallery. Every nook and cranny is stuffed with an awesome collection, some by local artists. I loved the tornado sculpture, perforated paper images, smoke ring machine, and the haunted dollhouse charcoal print. Definitely worth visiting.Beautiful hotel! The artwork is captivating and the cocktails enhance the effect. I greatly enjoyed the gin and house tonic, the Italian 76, and the Helium Fizz.Named the #1 Hotel in the world, 21C is actually not just a hotel but an interactive art museum.I've never actually stayed in the rooms, but the lobby of 21C is open to anyone who wants to wander in and check out the exhibits. By exhibits I don't mean some paintings on the wall. When we first walked in there was a video playing on the floor and it showed a man and woman sleeping in a bed. Stepping over that you are greeted very warmly and encouraged to take your time. Favorite things to see were the letters that flowed down a wall that you could ""catch"" on your arms. It's hard to describe. You just have to go there. Also, the mens bathroom. Ladies, wait til it's empty and go up to the urinal wall where water is flowing and you can see out to the hallways where people are walking by! The ladies bathroom has a bunch of eyes that follow you and that are actual eyes of blind dart throwers. Okay, i'm not going to give it all away. So, if you're in Louisville you should definitely stay here or at least just walk in and check it all out. It's pretty impressive. I enjoyed how kind the staff were and was amused the entire time. Check out my photos- it really is pretty cool.21C is a fantastic hotel! The art exhibits are always interesting and the rooms are clean, luxurious and very comfortable. I recently rented out a corner suite for my wedding- bridal party getting ready and wedding night. It was wonderful! The staff is accommodating and friendly. We had a very unfortunate incident, where the limo we had hired to take the bridal party around town for photos, never showed up. Lucky for us, 21C let us rent their red bedazzled limo on the fly and didn't even charge us for the full time that we used it. They really saved the day! Love 21C, can't wait to stay there again!Stayed here for one night and wished it could have been longer. The art is such a great treat and we found whimsical little surprises everywhere. The rooms are large and comfortable. Bathrooms are also spacious with fun touches like a rubber duckie in the tub. The staff is super friendly and not stuffy at all. They went above and beyond for is more than once on our short stay. I hope to visit again soon!My husband and I were able to secure an awesome price at 21C for our wedding night.  I have been to the hotel many times to see the art exhibits but this was the first time I've actually stayed.  What a beautiful place.  The rooms are more than comfortable and uniquely decorated.  If you are a fan of art, you will love staying here.  The bed was so comfortable and it was very hard to leave the next morning.  The customer service is always wonderful and you have to love the red penguins!  If I ever have the chance, I will definitely be staying here again!This is a free museum - and it has some great digital media pieces. Just stop in if you're visiting this tourist area of Louisville - staff was incredibly friendly. I am definitely going to stop here again when I'm in the area. Don't forget to check out the restaurant - they had some incredible work in there as well.We shared the octopus! Yum. We also shared the clams which were undercooked. The staff was amazing and quickly fixed the problem. The reason we went there was someone had sold my husband on their vegetarian options. There was 1? Maybe 2. The museum is amazing! So is their mint julep. Go for the art and cocktails.This might be my favorite boutique hotel in America (North &amp; South). Incredible toiletries (Malin+Goetz). A knowledgeable and accommodating staff. Great art on display throughout the museum. This hotel never misses a beat.The rooms were big and comfortable. CHANNEL 2 has art videos on all the time! That is a commendable touch. Fully stocked mini-bar - watch out it's one of those mini-bars that senses when you remove something. So check your bill upon check-out in case you put your leftovers in the fridge! King size bed room is as big as the rooms with two double beds.Food is great at Proof, the hotel restaurant. The bar in Proof stays open till about 1:45-2A on the weekend when we were there.  Great hang for big groups. The hotel lobby couch is also a delicious place to relax with or without a drink.The red penguins that travel around the hotel are fun to move around. It's worth the nightly rate. This hotel is top notch!I came here my first visit to Louisville, and now I take all my friends and family on theirs. I've never stayed in a room, go figure since it is a hotel, no I go for the art, the bar, and the interactive bathroom. Proof on Main, the bar is super swanky and fun for day drinking if you need a pit stop after showing off the river on your way to the Giant Slugger on the downtown section of your L'ville tour. But lets get to the meat of 21C. Their bathroom. It's a sick pleasure of mine watching my friends visit the back gallery just beyond the bathrooms for the first time. I chuckle to myself as they eye themselves in the floor to ceiling mirror making slight adjustments, or even better, fully stopping and stooping in close to fix some makeup or straighten the eyebrows. Why is this funny? Bc on the other side of that one way mirror a man is watching you while he pees. That's right, the urinal IS that mirror, and it's an instillation piece of art. The point is to expose yourself in a certain way, and trust me from experience, you get stage fright trying to pee while people are seemingly looking directly at you hahah.My husband, his parents, and myself visited the museum one weekend afternoon after my husband and I had heard a lot about it. They had some really interesting exhibits, but a lot of the art work they had hanging up wasn't that great. It was mostly photography, all taken by the same person, and all had just been Photoshopped to have the person multiplied in each photo. I really hope they get some new works soon, we would love to go back.Nice hotel. I enjoyed my stay here. Didn't know what to expect at this place but all turned out good. Room was nice, bed was comfy and parking was right next door and was under 10 bucks for the night. This place is definitely different than most hotels, wasn't really my style but I can't knock it for that, it was still nice. It is much more contemporary and I'm more the traditional style. Museum in it was pretty cool. Very close to the Louisville slugger museum only minutes away. Many food choices within walking distance also. Overall very nice hotel worth the money and deserves 5 stars.One word, Awesome. Got a chance too stay the night here and there are endless things I could say about it.Although I did not get to try Proof everything else about this place was pretty rad.Alternating installations and attention to detail, everyone was super nice and helpful I was pretty stoked too have the option of having cookies and milk brought to my room at night.*Beware of the red penguin*I gave them a second chance.  The stay was completely flawless.  What I would've expected in the first place.  GREAT job on the clean-up guys!Awesome.  I almost wonder if it's pointless to review this place in light of all the positive reviews.  Stayed in the artist-designed kaleidoscope room (cyclone room?) in the basement.  Nicest room I've ever stayed in.  Hysterically funny fake book titles inside a sealed glass case.  Artist-curated vinyl selection with antique phonograph for your listening pleasure. Room done in reclaimed barn wood.  Psychedelic themes throughout.  So cool.  Nice staff.  If this hotel were in NYC these people would probably be assholes.  Some controversial art on the walls, which you might not expect in the South, and frankly they don't give a damn, and neither do I.  Go to the bar - killer bourbon flights.  First rate all around.Stop everything. Make a random plan/excuse to stay here just because it could be the coolest hotel conception EVER. Where else are you going to stay that has a red penguin that is going to greet you in your room? Okay i get that isn't a reason to stay at a hotel but that is just the beginning...Where else are you going to stay that has Malin+Goetz bath products? Ummm okay that would be enough to grab my attention but you also might NOT want to leave the lobby because when you walk through the doors your adventure starts. The lobby is jam packed with art installations, even the elevator area is an experience. Oh that's right the hotel is situated on TOP of a modern art museum! Great show during my stay. My pops was with me and we had dinner at the Proof on Main. Super local, super good food. Except my dad's soup was cold and that's enough to make him dislike a joint, the man likes his soup freaking hot- alls I'm sayin. The cotton candy ender didn't improve his mood. I'm yearning to return here and I'm really thinking I need to take a spin in the hotels bedazzled limo...yes it's true!!! You don't make things up like this.Love this hotel/ art museum! The men's restroom has the coolest wall! It has a glass waterfall wall that you pee on and can look out and it's mirrored on the other side so people can see out but people cant see you! Women's restroom just has a mirror that you can look out. Not as cool.","['probably', 'best', 'holistic', 'hotel', 'experience', 'every', 'single', 'person', 'staff', 'incredibly', 'friendly', 'art', 'top', 'notch', 'farrow', 'wrath', 'exhibit', 'new',
