http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-oklahoma-city-3,Hilton Garden Inn,3.5,$$$,13,"Looks new. Great location downtown. About 5 blocks away is an amazing city park with a planetarium.  Hotel: If you get a room on the upper floors on the back side of the hotel, you overlook a AAA ballpark and can watch the games if in town. Very cool!  Rooms clean and up-to-date. Pleasant staff. Parking is $11 if you park yourself. Have to walk a block+ to park in the garage using your room key for access. Also connected to Hilton Garden is a Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn.  Walking/running path about 2 blocks away by Bass Pro.Spend the $20 and valet, or risk your life trying to use the horrible parking garage that's down the block.    By the way the receptionist failed to activate our room keys, so we had no access to the garage and had to do the check in process two times. I stayed here for 4 nights and housekeeping forgot to stop by twice.   Housekeeping also  dumped a pile of toiletries on the counter each time rather than set them out, &amp; they  forgot to take out trash.     Oh, and the tiny indoor pool has windows to the sidewalk for creepers to stand and watch you swim. Lots of winos getting their share of the free wine at the evening reception so watch out if you don't want your small children to over hear vulgar conversations during.  Instead walk over to the garden side and pay for dinner.One star for an extremely  rude staff person named Stephanie. I was there I'm federal business and received a call that the federal rate wouldn't be honored... never had that problem and when I checked in at a different Hilton Hotel, they had no knowledge of any regulation changes other than an increase in lodging rates.I stayed here for two nights in a single King room. Not bad. I frequent Hilton properties 2-3 weeks a month so I have come to know what to expect. I don't want to give any of them any more or less than three stars unless they are deserving when I do remember to review them. This one was just fine. It was clean, the staff was friendly, and the room was fine. Nothing blew me away and nothing made it a bad experience. It is a little pricy, but you have to pay to stay in the nicer areas. I will say that the breakfast was quite good. I enjoyed an omelet each morning and they were perfect as far as I am concerned. I don't know how people screw up a simple omelet, but this staff didn't. Anyways, I will be traveling through OKC a few more times over the next couple of months. I would stay here again, but I tend to stay at different properties when given the chance in an effort to mix it up. I wouldn't have a problem staying here again at all though.Very nice room, reasonable price. Great valet parking. Hotel is in idea walking spot, close to everything.While traveling to OKC for the AVCA convention and NCAA Division 1 volleyball finals I was informed my room at a rival hotel was canceled. I began calling other hotels in the downtown area, which were all booked. I called the Hilton Garden Inn and Deborah found me a room for 2 of the three nights so I took it and figured I'd work out the final night when I got in. Not even 10 minutes later Deborah called me back and told me she had me booked for my third and final night. I was stoked! She saved me a ton of worry and made my convention so much more convenient. My king room was comfortable, roomy and quite. I sept extremely well! The Keurig coffee maker in my room was a nice touch. The location of the hotel is excellent. I was within walking distance of everything I needed. If I return to OKC this will be my hotel of choice.Wonderful stay! The room was neat and clean! The bath had a bit of a weird smell but nothing that was alarming. The staff was wonderful! The bar stools at the bar were the most comfortable seats! Would definitely recommend!This was a very clean, very friendly hotel. Beds were comfortable, bathroom very clean. Very nice for the price!So I get here @ the garden to try and eat &amp; people that come In after me are helped before I was! Seriously! It was 13 degrees outside &amp; I just left the thunder game...ughhh. This was so not a good impression.  I am a corporate professional &amp; clearly was profiled differently because I was bundled up???  I had a thunder skully hat on bc its cold. Not to be overlooked &amp; prejudge by my appearance. You should never judge a book by its cover. My 1st impression of the garden restaurant was trashed by poor service, however the manager tried to accommodate me, but when he came back to me he had nothing to say. Uhmm excuse the hell out of me! The night clerk did give me a credit to try breakfast.  So I'll try the garden on a different day &amp; time! The decor in the lobby is exquisite though.Just checked into this brand new hotel. :-)Valet is available for the garage parking @$12.00 per day. The valet was excellent and brought in my bags without hesitation. The front desk is very friendly and accommodating. My room still smells ""new"" and the design is soothing. Very nice flat screen television with an extensive channel selection. The bathroom offers neutrogena amenities and there is a walk-in shower sans a bathtub. Very nice. The towels are big and fluffy...not worn out from thousands of washings.The bed is w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l :-). I give this place 5 stars for the price of the room, great location in bricktown, and the exceptional staff.The hotel is really nice and clean. All the staff is helpful and friendly. But don't eat here! I had pasta the first night and it was so salty I couldn't finish it. The second night the food had no flavor at all. I only ate it because I was starving.The staff here must have attended the best training school in the world because they are all so friendly, professional, and cool. And helpful. The rooms are clean the carpets don't smell like old musty hotels. The mattresses are ok. The omelet was delicious. The staff make this place awesome. I will stay here again.I loved this hotel!! We had a great view of the ballpark that is across the street from the hotel. I only at breakfast at the hotel on our last day. It was ok. The price was nice! Only ten dollars and some change for myself and my 9 year old. The front desk staff was very nice, especially Debra. She was extremely helpful. I would definitely stay here again!!!",,,,,"['looks', 'new', 'great', 'location', 'downtown', 'blocks', 'away', 'amazing', 'city', 'park', 'planetarium', 'hotel', 'room', 'upper', 'floors', 'back',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-oklahoma-city-northwest-oklahoma-city,Hyatt Place Oklahoma City-Northwest,4.0,$$,16,"Ooooops.  I posted this review when I thought it was for genghis grill.  Don't know how to delete .  Sorry yelpersPerfect for a quick business trip to Oklahoma.  The rooms are quite spacious and clean - basically what you'd expect in business travel.  The lobby is small but efficient.  There's a small bar next to the front desk and they serve wine and other drinks.  I will be back when in Oklahoma!Where should I start.  I stay at Hyatt Place hotels all across the United States.  They make sure the customer is always happy and gives a great place to stay when traveling.  I have stayed at this Hyatt Place on several occasions, but never again.  I made a reservation several months ago, they placed me on a floor (4th) that's being remodeled.  When I was leaving the next morning, I couldn't even get to the elevator because it was taped off due to a crew painting.  It was 9:45 am.  The guys working were very nice, but fumes were terrible.  If checkout is at noon, why start renovations when people are trying to checkout and use the elevator?  My heater didn't work in my room.  A kid was on his phone sitting in the hall outside my door for about 2 hours, no privacy.  The water pressure was non-existent from 8-9.  The garbage truck woke me up at 3am outside banging the dumpsters.  The big issue was my bill.  I used free points and my bill had $45 worth of charges when I found it under my door.  The desk person, I hope took care of it, but I'm not sure until I get my statement.  She was too busy answering the phone to take care of my need.  I waisted 5,000 points for a terrible experience.  I will never stay at the NW OKC Hyatt Place again.  How about thinking about your customers?  Also leaving the parking lot they were working on power lines, you couldn't even get out of the lot after the terrible experience.Upscale feel with a budget friendly price hotel with a lot of included amenities. The free full breakfast was wonderful. My favorite was the REAL egg served on a croissant with spinach, mushroom and swiss cheese - delish. The room was large, clean and nicely furnished with a very comfy bed. The staff was friendly and attentive.I stayed here when I was driving from Chicago to Scottsdale. My room was reasonably priced, clean and had plenty of square footage. It was a comfortable room and very quiet where I got plenty of rest to continue my trip. There was a desk and a comfy couch in the room as well. I didn't eat here so I can't comment on that as I got in pretty late and left about 5 in the morning. I would definitely stay here again the next time I'm visiting OKC.What friendly staff! Clean, updated and spacious rooms.  Very nice complimentary breakfast. Walls are bit thin - you might hear your noisier neighbors. Location is kind of odd - behind another set of hotels but very near stores if you need them which I found to be a very good option. I was in town for business. I would return.I've stayed at better.  I've stayed at worse.  When traveling on business, there are a few ""must haves"", and then there are the ""nice to haves.""MUST HAVES:1. High-speed, reliable internet: The internet was free and easy to use, but the speeds were terribly slow in the evenings. Grade: C2. Comfortable beds: The beds were comfortable, and the linens clean--but the HVAC next to the bed was incredibly loud. Grade: B3. Decent breakfast: whether it's complimentary or for-fee, decent breakfast options are a must for business travel.  The breakfast at this Hyatt fell flat.  The variety was mediocre (but passable), but the quality of some of the foods was just not there: Grade: DNICE TO HAVES:1. Easy check-in/out: It was a piece of cake checking in, but checking out at 4:00am was a surreal and bizarre experience.  Grade: B2. Friendly/helpful staff: The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating: Grade: A3. Room layout: The rooms have very nice layouts, with a desk, couch, wet bar w/ mini-fridge. Grade: AThe hotel is not walkable to anything but an IHOP and a Mexican Cantina, but you can get to a lot with a quick drive.Overall, this place offers a perfectly reasonable stay.  However, there are other nearby OKC hotels that offer a better experience/value.  I did fill out a guest survey after my stay, and I was contacted very promptly afterwards indicating that they will do their best to address the shortcomings--which is a good sign.I was driving from Chicago to Arizona and after dealing with snowstorms and being stuck in the car for 12 hours I was probably not the best to talk with, but the entire staff was absolutely fantastic. They could not have been nicer or more helpful. I can't comment on the amenities of the hotel as I got in late and left early. But the room was fantastic. Larger then I expected and it was very clean. I thought it was strange to have the sink outside of the bathroom but as I was alone it didn't matter. Thinking about it, I can see how handy that would be if I had the wife with me.The staff was helpful and friendly. There was a cricket in our room, which gave me a start until I put my glasses on to see what it was, but we were on the first floor so I think it is understandable. Crickets are OK with me. The room was tidy and comfortable, and I really enjoyed their breakfast room, which reminded me a bit of the breakfasts we had in hotels in Germany.The hotel was a wee bit hard to find, but it was also hard to get around in the general area.Place was noisy (they had lots of kids and families staying there). I was under the impression it was more of a business hotel. Walls are paper thin so stay away from rooms near the elevator. AC sounds like a semi truck idling beside your bed. I only made it 1 night before checking into a better hotel. Place was clean and seemed updated. The staff was sincerely apologetic for the issues I had.I traveled to OKC for business and chose to stay here because I am familiar with the chain. This place did not disappoint! Upon entering the hotel I was greeted by the very familiar and welcoming fragrance. The desk clerk was very knowledgable and courteous. The room that I was assigned was next to the elevator so I was worried that I would be bothered by the noise, but it was very quiet. The free continental breakfast is also a great plus!! The only negative is that I found it very hard to find the place. It sits back in a lot behind McDonalds and Courtyard Marriott, and it was not visible from the interstate.Sketchy location...but hotel and rooms were nice and clean.  The beds were pretty comfortable and staff was friendly.  Free breakfast until 10am and indoor pool.  Rooms are good sized.Avoid room 422! (and 208) The staff here is hit an miss. The ones who hit... hit solidly on the right things to do. Those who miss... miss the mark widely. While the rooms SEEM nice and updated, the overall quality of the work was shoddy. (shelves not attached, doors not closing, etc). The design of the room is pretty neat - until you realize that more than one business man has... fully enjoyed what he was watching on the big screen TV. We have been in at least 4 rooms and every single one had... discernible...stains on them. Yes, the kinds of stains that made Monica keep the blue dress. Room 422 has a great view of the highway off-ramp. You can hear every single truck coming off... the A/C does nothing to drown it out.. but it does add to the cacophony of sounds designed to keep you awake. Room 208 has the distinction of being EXACTLY where the spotlights hit the building. Even with the blinds drawn, you cannot tell if it is midnight or noon outside. It is seriously annoying. All-in-all, it could have been a great place.. but just isn't.Wow. I was simply blown away by the staff at this hotel. Kareline and Katty and the rest took such incredible care of myself and my crew, bending over backward to make sure we had a great stay. I arrived 2 hours after totaling my jeep and they turned a bad day around for me. I absolutely recommend this place and if I am ever back in Oklahoma City I will stay here. Thank you so much for makin me feel at home!Not completely horrible, but not quite great either. The hotel is located right next to the expressway overpass, so try to get a room away from that side if you have trouble sleeping. My room was fine, with the white noise of the AC unit drowning out anything else, so I slept very well. The room is large and very well furnished in what I would call an IKEA modern look, in warm tans and browns. The bathroom is small, with the door opening into the bathroom, making it difficult to manuver once in the room, especially since the bottom of the door, in my room, is not clearing the floor, and is scrapping the floor as it opens, so it cannot be opened all the way to the opposing wall. I will report this upon checkout. A poor design. It would have been better if it opened out. There were also two large silverfish in the tub this morning. Although silverfish are no big deal, suffice it to say, no one wants to see bugs of any kind in their room. A nice big 42"" flat screen TV sits in the middle of the room, allowing it to be viewed from either the living room or the bedroom side, but not when sitting at the desk which is around the corner and behind the TV. No big deal, but I sometimes like to watch the TV while I'm surfing the net. There is free WIFI throughout the hotel, but the best signal I could get in my room was 11mbps! Pretty bad. There is a small bar area with a small fridge, but no microwave. On the desk, there are two small plackards with pictures of food, that say ""freshly prepared"". I went down to breakfast this morning expecting to find some of this ""freshly prepared"" food, but am sad to say, I was a bit dissappointed. The breakfast buffet was a complimentary cold continental buffett, which included breads, cereals, fruits, pastries, yogurt, juice and coffee. The hot items had to be ordered via a touch screen not unlike those at a WAWA. This was not unpleasing to me, but the end product was! I ordered a ham &amp; cheddar omlette with breakfast potatoes for $7.04. The omlette and potatoes were obviously ""freshly prepared"" via MICROWAVE! HORRIBLE!  I had a few bites of the omlette, tried one potato, and then it went into the garbage. How they have the nerve to say ""freshly prepared"" and charge $7.04 for microwaved food is beyond me! Don't order the food! Save your money. Enjoy the cold buffet items or walk over to the McDonalds! All in all, not the worst place I've ever stayed, but certain aspects need work.Compared to the other Hyatt Place in OKC, this one is far better.  The staff at this location is friendlier and less intrusive. Unfortunately, the internet still sucks but knowing that there isn't someone out there stalking me makes it all more the better to stay in this location.  Unlike the airport, there is not a lot to do (e.g bars and restaurants) within walking distance.  I would rather have to drive that than to feel like I need to stay in my room to avoid someone.",,,,,"['posted', 'review', 'thought', 'grill', 'know', 'delete', 'sorry', 'quick', 'business', 'trip',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/country-inn-and-suites-oklahoma-city,Country Inn & Suites,3.0,$$,14,"Stayed at this Country Inn &amp; Suites when work required me to be in OKC early the following morning. The location on Northwest Expressway is close to shopping, a variety of well known chain restaurants &amp; some local gems. My room faced the busy street, which did allow for quite a bit of noise from the street. During the heart of the night, the street does slow down significantly &amp; wasn't all that bad. This hotel was very, but did show some signs of wear. The only staff I saw during my stay was the person working behind the checkin desk, but that staff member was very friendly &amp; helpful each time I saw them. The beds were surprisingly comfortable &amp; I slept very well.Our room was prepaid.  The price seemed very reasonable.  Upon entering our room, the chemical smell was overwhelming and musty.  We were sent to a handicapped room that was sparsely furnished, even though we are not handicapped.  I never like to complain, but this room triggered allergies.  I called the front desk to inquire about the smell.  Nicky came to our room and immediately noticed the odor.  She came bearing an air freshener.  I told her that we didn't want any other chemicals in our roomNicky upgraded us to a suite on a higher floor and the chemical smell is still overwhelming.  At least the room is a thousand times better and the odor is purely chemical and not musty.  I know now to never to buy a prepaid room.  The first room was TERRIBLE for just a few dollars less than the large suite.  Scam.The suite is quite nice, but the smell is giving me a headache and making me feel terrible.  Thanks to sweet Nicky, we have a nicer room, but that damned chemical smell is making me really sick.  I definitely do not recommend this hotel if you have allergies.Just looking did a clean room, comfortable bed, and hot shower for the night as I was traveling across the country for work. I was worried at first when I saw buckets in the lobby collecting water that was pouring from the ceiling. And the front desk clerk was efficient but not particularly friendly. But my room was very clean and quiet and after a long, hot shower I got a good night's sleep in a very comfy bed. My car that was packed full was safe in the well lit lot. And this morning as I went for the free breakfast, there were Contractors there working on the water/ceiling. The cleaning and kitchen staff were very pleasant. I would stay here again without hesitation.Stayed two nights with my husband and child, and we were pleased with the room. The room was nice, clean (as was the rest of the hotel), and the beds were comfortable. The breakfast buffet was just what we expected for the amount paid, but nothing special. The only thing we could complain about was that our room never saw housekeeping during our stay. We were gone most of the day, and upon return noticed that not even the garbage was taken out. The front desk staff was helpful and efficient, but not the friendliest. We had a nice, quiet stay, just what we wanted.It's clean. The staff was friendly. The breakfast was better then normal for a hotel. The hallway is small and odd. Located near shopping, like petco, home depot, best buy, and many chain restaurants. The drive way is a hard to spot.I started this review early in the week. Now it's Saturday. My original reservation was till Sunday. Saturday my card died. I got to the desk. He tells me I was to checkout today. He's already got my 2 rooms booked for tonight. Tell him this is wrong I know what I ordered. So he gets me 2 other rooms. Turns out they are singles. I need double for at least one room. In the end they are not big on compromise. I end up paying for 3 rooms do to them screwing up the reservations. With NO offer of compensation.This is my 2nd time staying in a Country Inn &amp; Suites and I have to say that it was very pleasant as was my first time staying at one in Atlanta. This hotel has a great location in Northen Oklahoma City close to I44 &amp; I40 and is situated on North West Expressway. There are lots of restaurants near by and there is Penn Square Mall right down the road as well so good for shopping. The service has been great with helpful front desk workers. The hotel is really clean has a clean gym, small pool and is really quiet. They have fresh baked cookies at the front desk all day and the breakfast is great. Eggs, bacon, french toast, waffles, yogurt, fresh fruit, bagels, toast, cereal and is cooked fresh and is great, not just because it is free with your stay but it tastes good. Did I meantion free wifi as well.So if you want to stay in a great hotel try this one...old school charm and feel and it isnt very expensive either. I have been here for 3 days and I didnt spend too much money.My fiance and I booked this hotel the night before an early-morning convention right down the street. We saw the pictures on Expedia and noticed that for $20 more (total of $102 with tax instead of $80 with tax) we could get a room with a big free-standing jacuzzi tub in the corner. Heck yes! So we sprung for that room, called and reserved it the night before, and were all excited to have a relaxing night after a hectic week. Well we get to the hotel around 9pm, get checked in, and lo and behold the jacuzzi tub is a shower/tub combo in the bathroom rather than a free-standing jacuzzi tub in the corner of the room. We are sure we were given the wrong room (because other, cheaper rooms had advertised a shower/jacuzzi tub combo.) We called the front desk to tell them and all the guy would tell us was that the picture we had seen was not their property. We kept telling him that the photos and title of the hotel that we had seen on Expedia certainly had been advertised as the same place. He just kept arguing that it wasn't their fault and that it wasn't the right property. So we asked him if there was anything he could do to 'help us out' since we had not gotten the room/location that had been advertised. He just kept telling us the same unhelpful things. We finally convinced him to give us the time of day if we went down and showed him the website we had seen. He agreed. We found the website [crossing our fingers that we somehow weren't the ones mistaken]...sure enough, hotel name and exact picture of the room we had expected....went down and showed him, and immediately he said ""Yeah, that's not our property."" Yes! We know that now!! But regardless we were misled and falsely advertised to. We paid extra money to get the room pictured under that hotel name. It might not be their fault but it certainly wasn't ours either. We kept trying to tell him that and he just kept saying that it wasn't their fault. He said something about ""they"" aren't allowed to rent out that property so they are slow to fix errors in the listings. Whatever that meant. FINALLY he offered to give us the room for $70 + tax, which we agreed to and thanked him for graciously. About 3 other customers had been lined up at the desk waiting on him while he argued with us over this. As we left I heard him say loudly to the next customer, ""It was miserably slow here for a while...but there's always something..."" I felt it was rude to talk to the other customers as if we had been guests from hell, when all we were trying to do was work out a compromise. I went out to the car to get some things and when I came back in I told him ""Have a good night and sorry for the trouble. Thank you for working with us."" To which he responded, ""Well, it's not our fault. "" GAHHH!!!!! The man is actually really nice but he needs to learn how and when to back down! I told him ""Yes, we know that, but I hope it gets taken care of soon so no one else runs into this problem."" To which he goes on another spiel about how they have no rights to rent the property and blah blah blah. I still don't understand what he even meant by all that but I guess it has to do with Expedia's advertisement contract with them. Anyways he kept chatting it up for about 5 minutes, possibly trying to make amends so I wouldn't write a nasty review like this one. Well after all that we had a pleasant evening/night. The jacuzzi tub, while not as romantic and special as a free-standing one would have been in the room, was still relaxing and nice. Although I did spend probably 10 minutes trying to wash out some crap in the bottom of the tub that looked like black pepper. The king bed was comfortable, they had a nice TV and a concealed mini fridge. Everything was quite modern and in good condition. Our view was pretty cool of Oklahoma City. In the morning they had a variety breakfast of waffles, omelets, sausage, and potato patties, and fresh fruit salad along with the usual cereals, breads, and yogurts. Unfortunately we don't eat pork so the omelets and sausages were out. The waffles were typical hotel waffles...just ok. The potato patties were dreadfully dry. And I stopped eating my fruit salad when I found two short black hairs in it, most likely from the woman overseeing the breakfast nook (because I'm blonde so there's no way it was mine). However this is more selection than I've seen most other places so for that I give it a pretty good rating. If you make your own waffle and eat pre-packaged food you'll be safe. Overall I guess we could go back to the hotel again since we know now what we're getting, but honestly I've had better experiences for cheaper and less hassle.Sooo irritated!  Everything was great until I decided to take a hot bath to hopefully relieve back pain &amp; wind down for the night.  10 pm &amp; instead of a nice smooth tub to sit in they have one of those nasty bath mats with the suction cups on the bottom which I HATE.  Pull it up, you say.  Tried that but wasn't going to sit in the nasty gunk that would have been left behind.  So I get in with the mat &amp; start waiting for the hot water.  I LITERALLY wait 10 min before engaging the drain stopper, thinking its making its trip from hot water heater to the 7th floor.  Oh, no, that IS the hot water.  Lukewarm at best!  To me, the water is not hot until I can't hold my hand under the water for more than a second.  That never got close to happening.  Either their hot water heaters can't keep up or more lileky, they have the temp set WAY too low.  I'm an adult &amp; I want a clean smooth tub &amp; HOT water.  If you, CI &amp; S, want to cater to kids, that's fine, cause I won't EVER be back again! (Worst part:  I have to do it again before surgery tomorrow morning.  Was hoping to be zen but pretty sure I'll just be pissed!). Grrr!To me there are few differences between most Country Inn and Suites, Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Comfort Inn, and Best Western type hotels. For around $90-110 per night, what I expect to see in hotels like these are fairly roomy rooms, comfortable beds, clean, fairly modern decor, decent pool, breakfast options and a parking lot that I feel good about leaving my car in.This hotel meets all of those requirements and is located in a part of the city that is near a hospital, several restaurant options, shopping and freeway access.The main issue we had was the jets in our jacuzzi tub kept turning off and on when trying to use the tub. My wife and I liked this hotel and would consider staying here in future trips in Oklahoma City. There is a Country Inn and Suites located off the turnpike not far from where this one is located. But as far as things surrounding the locations, this one on the expressway probably offers more.This place was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at. Nothing in the room worked-including our keys. We had to go down to the front desk at least twice because they kept giving us faulty keys. We even kept them away from our phones and they still would not work. The iron was broken, there weren't enough outlets, and they put us in the room next to the generator that was loud and made it extremely difficult to sleep, even though we had booked our room far in advance. When we asked the front desk what they could do about this, they offered us the room directly next door to our room. How is that going to help the noise? They made no other offer to help. It was our first time in OKC and will probably be the last. When we first walked into the hotel the person working at the front desk was reading something and didn't even acknowledge us until we said something. We asked the people working at the front desk for advice on how to get around and they suggested taxi's instead of renting a car. Taxi's? Have you been to OKC? The place is huge. After wasting a ton of money on taxi's the first 2 days we finally asked someone not affiliated with the hotel who actually gave us helpful advice. The front desk woman also told us the boat ride at Brick Town cost 10 cents. More like $9.00. None of the information they gave us was helpful in the least. They get 1 star for a decent complimentary breakfast, although old eggs are gross and disgusting. Skip this establishment and try the Marriott right next door. It may be pricier but probably well worth it.Front desk help unfriendly and not helpful. Would not honor OKC Marathon agreement for late checkout. Told me it depends on how many guests who check in AFTER me, who request a late check out. Refused to extend our check out by even 30 minutes since it was ""against the rules."" Not guest oriented. Rude staff member. Shameful. Do not believe he reflects corporate customer service goal.Great experience!  Our room was on the second floor.  It was clean, nicely furnished, and comfortable. We got a really great deal on the room, and for the location and price, you aren't going to be able to beat it!!  Most of the times, they have huge discounts if you book far in advance, so check your sources!Our only minor complaint was that the front desk people were a bit weird;however, we only had to talk to them to check in/out, thank goodness!!!We would stay here again anytime if the prices stay low.I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and it is located close to I-44 NW Expressway which is a couple minutes away from Penn Square Mall and Nichols Hills. I couldn't find a hotel in the area for a descent price and most of the hotels in downtown were full because of the NBA Finals. I rated this hotel on 3 criterias: Location, Service and Rooms.Location 2 / 5: Let's put it that way, you're stuck in your hotel if you don't have a car. There isn't any sidewalk and it is dangerous even to cross the street. So make sure to rent a car first of all if you plan to stay couple days in OKC. The hotel is located close to Penn Square Mall which is the most happening place in OKC for doing shoppings. Beside that, you have a nice steak house 10 minutes away 5-6 miles from the restaurant.Service 3 / 5: You get what you pay for and so I couldn't expect a lot about this hotel but they were nice and they accomodated me for the check-out time. But then again, don't expect full treatments cause it ain't gonna happen.Room 2 / 5: It's a country Inn so let's be real, there's most definitely better hotels than this even in OKC. It seemed that the carpet of the room was dirty but the bed was really comfortable. Beside that, it has everything that a room needs to have. Breakfast is really service minimum with couple toasts, bagels and crackers... Don't count on the breakfast to have a full meal. They didn't have eggs as well. The good thing should I say is the free parking. Definitely a plus.I wouldn't come back to this hotel unless I am in the obligation to go because other hotels are fully booked. I guess it is maybe similar to a Holiday Inn in the quality even I haven't been to a Holiday Inn for 15-18 years now. It all depends what's the budget you want to spend for your holiday.Stayed here one night.  The staff were all very courteous and friendly.  The room was comfortable and they have great amenities.  A 24 hour fitness room, buffet breakfast,  a pool, laundry area and business center.  They have free wireless too.  The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. I booked the room through hotwire dot com so I got a great price.  There are many  nice restaurants in the area.  A Hooters within walking distance, a Starbucks up the street (I'm not a coffee drinker but I know that's important for a lot of people).   Easy access to highways.  I would stay here again.",,,,,"['country', 'inn', 'amp', 'suites', 'work', 'required', 'early', 'following', 'morning', 'location', 'northwest', 'expressway', 'close', 'shopping', 'variety', 'well',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-okc-north-quail-springs-oklahoma-city,La Quinta Inn & Suites OKC North - Quail Springs,2.5,$$,14,"Staff was nice &amp; the entry/breakfast area looks impressive, but the rooms are pretty dated. Love the dog friendly aspect but the carpets had a lot of visible stains &amp; there wasn't a lot of available areas to walk your dogs. I know the room was cleaned &amp; refreshed during our 3 night stay, but the staining on the carpet just made you feel dirty. I've stayed at a newly remodeled La Quinta in Midwest City that was much more aesthetically pleasing &amp; didn't leave me feeling icky. The faucet had a burnt hair/salon smell when we used the hot water. Great location to the turnpike &amp; dining.This place has degraded.Recent ice storms causing  Power outages forced us to find shelter. They price gouged us for 144.00... Usually 75 bucks. Tv only plays the porn channels. what used to be a nice place is now deemed a "" shithole""Beware! Bedbugs!My husband and I stayed and woke up riddled with bed-bug bites. We contacted the hotel and got a very lackluster and non-committal response, so also contacted the Oklahoma Board of Health. Luckily it doesn't seem like any of the bugs came home with us, but a terrible and gross experience, none-the-less.Nice hotel. Clean room. Helpful staff. I was a little worried at checkin because there was a woman holding a newborn behind the desk. Yep that was the front desk clerk. I think she was expecting another too. Apparently this was a distraction for her because the first room she gave me was dirty and had not had housekeeping after the previous guest. 5 minutes later I was in a new room and it was very clean. She was very nice and apologetic. The staff the next day was very nice too. You just don't expect to see a baby as part of the checkin process. Ha!The room was a king size and a weird floor plan. There were 3 closets. I didn't use any of them. Breakfast was ok. A sign said no eggs due to a recall so I'm guessing they make packaged egg product instead of real eggs. Still there were plenty choices and I was happy. There were also sodas and waters next to the front desk in a glass frig in the hallway. They called it the market but it was really a frig against the wall. Nice enough and it was there. I took a sneaky photo of my checkin team. It was fine just caught me off guard. I'm guessing her sitter was late and made it happen. I checked In at 11pm on the nose do I guess it was the start of her shift or the end perhaps. Anyway, sorry to drift off on that minor issue. Great hotel and a great value. Convenient location too.Never again run for the hills. Disgusting.Comfortable and clean but not up to par to give you that ""at home"" feeling. Internet is absolutely horrible. Off and on and off and on all day. Finally decided to call the desk and they said ""I'll reset it"". Came back on and then off and then on and off and on and so on and so forth. Normally not a big deal at all but if I'm spending $100 + a night to get that ""at home"" level of comfort than I expect that everything should be up and running as such.This place is terrible. I was forced to stay here due to availability. The room was not cleaned very well. I was also treated to a midnight surprise as a pipe burst on my floor and I did not get any sleep. I was not given much of an apology. There are a lot of other options in the area. I suggest using almost anyone else for your stay.Wow. This is the BEST La Quinta I've ever stayed in!They remodeled the rooms - very modern.New carpeting all over.Breakfast area is busy, for a reason! lol They have a hot breakfast: sausage, biscuits, gravy. Healthier options - boiled eggs, yogurt, oatmeal, etc. BIG coffee cups with lids. But... We're from Vegas and there is a Rudy's down the street. So I'm just enjoying the room!I stayed here one night on the way from Nebraska to California.  The staff was helpful and responsive when I couldn't get my TV to work. I was able to get a ground floor room which was helpful as I had my older dog who has trouble with stairs.  The rooms were clean and pleasant.  I would recommend staying here.Stayed two nights at the La Quinta Inn in Oklahoma City. The hotel is a nice mid range budget hotel perfect for business travelers with plenty of restaurants within walking distance. They also offer some themed ""fantasy"" suites that include a hot tub in the room. The names kind of remind me of the Madonna Inn and San Luis Obispo. Upon my arrival and walking in the place was nice. The decor here is a bit pretentious for my taste reminding me of something I would see in an old upscale manor in New Orleans. I checked in and had no problems with reservations. The room I got was clean and a good size. It had two queen beds along with a desk, microwave, and small frig. The toilet, sink, and shower were all in the same room. Again everything was clean and nice in the room. They do have a decent size TV here along with probably about 40 stations including HBO. For business purposes, they also offer free WiFi which was great for checking in on emails. Breakfast here is quite a treat. They not only offer your standard Continental with all the donuts, muffins, bagels, toast, and apples and oranges for breakfast, they also have scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and a waffle maker. You can make yourself a nice little breakfast here. The cost was about $109 a night. Not too bad and the staff here was friendly. Overall, very good hotel experience and would consider staying here again on my next visit to Oklahoma City. Overall 3 star rating.Bad experience. Lobby ok but the room are shabby. Phone not plugged and Internet doesn't work. I mean doesn't work at all.We were on a road trip from TN to CA, then north up to Canada. I made an online reservation at the Biltmore but left after a few hours because it was so disgusting. I looked around for another dog friendly hotel and chose this one. We were very happily surprised that for $20 more we went from a 1 star hotel to what felt like a 4 star. It was definitely worth the 10 min drive north from I-40. Very pet friendly and lots of amenities close by.Thank God for La Quinta's in general because my partner and I are driving cross-country from LA to Boston. We did this trip in the opposite direction 2.5 years ago but we did not have our dog then.It can be a challenge to find lodging for us with our dog because he's a 60-pound pit bull. As far as I know, all La Quintas are sans breed and size restrictions, which is really, really helpful for us. So, no matter what this place has going for it or doesn't,  I'm just so appreciative that it allows dogs.I pretty much only have pros about this place. The room was pretty big, it was clean, had the basic accommodations and more. Hotels these days barely give you a mini bottle of shampoo, let alone anything else, like coffee. This place had coffee in the room, which was really helpful as we were so sleep-deprived.  The room also had basic but worked well microwave and refrigerator. Since we're traveling across the U.S. we do have some food we're bringing with us in the car and hoping to refrigerate it in the rooms we're staying in each night, so this was really helpful. Breakfast was included and it was actually pretty good (i.e. eggs and sausage). Customer service was good. I really appreciated that since we had a dog, we were on the first floor and right near a side entrance. It includes Wi-Fi, which was really important for us, although most places do that these days. The lobby area was nice and clean.The cons: The area around this location wasn't great for walking our dog. I mean, technically, it was a quiet area with sidewalks, so I shouldn't complain, but we did the majority or our walking in an office park. It would've been nice to be in a more attractive area to walk but at least it was safe (not a lot of cars) and quiet.All in all, this was a great place to stay. Definitely the best La Quinta we stayed in along the way. In fact, better than the other hotel chains we stayed in, too. I highly recommend it.It's so funny how one hotel chain can have such different properties. Literally one night after staying at the shockingly beautiful and modern (while very inexpensive!) La Quinta in Memphis (Primacy Pkwy), I arrived at this spot. And true to form, it met my expectations - I just wished I'd stayed at this one first so that I could go out on a ""wow"" note.Bottom line: nothing great, nothing bad. The lobby actually leads you to believe the rooms will be nicer than they are - just kinda old school, floral bedding and the such. But it's clean and will allow you to comfortably rest your head, which is what really matters in this class of hotels.",,,,,"['staff', 'nice', 'amp', 'entry', 'breakfast', 'area', 'looks',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/holiday-inn-express-and-suites-oklahoma-city-arpt-meridian-av-oklahoma-city,Holiday Inn Express & Suites Oklahoma City-Arpt-Meridian Av,3.5,$$,11,"Stayed one night and was very impressed from start to finish. Pleasant check in with front desk staffer Dakota. Hubby said best bed he has slept on in a long time. Room clean and quiet. Breakfast was really good. Loved the egg omelette with cheese. Only wish they would vacuum lobby after breakfast time was over....definitely will stay again when in Oklahoma.The bed was good and the room was decent/average size.  The property appears clean and not dated and the staff was pleasant.The walls are paper thin!  I could hear the guy above me walk across the floor, urinate, flush, and walk back.  I could hear the elevator ding and the cables of the elevator stretch.  If anyone spoke anywhere nearby, I could hear that too as well as loud television sets.  If you are staying for the FAA, your classes probably start at 7AM.  Well, breakfast at the hotel is not until 6:30AM, so you miss it.  I hung out with two other classmates and saw their rooms.  They paid less and one was a much better room, the other similar.  Mine was easily the most expensive.  Shop around, you can do better.I'm perplexed by the bad reviews of this place.  The front desk staff (last night's and this morning's) were awesome.  Room was clean and roomy.  We walked to shop at Shepler's (sp?) and then to dinner.  Cleaning ladies were super sweet.  We didn't have breakfast, but the coffee was yum.  Just an all-around pleasant stay!This place is horrible.  Upon check in I was informed that I was getting a smoking room.  I said absolutely not, I did not book a smoking room.  I was then forced into an accessible room...which I hate and reeked of fragrance covering a smokey smell.  Really enjoyed my wake up call that I did not request.  In a handicap accessible room it is kind of like a warning for a bombing run from WWII. I called the front desk to let them know that I did not request a wake up call and the girl actually said ""yeah, that happens.""  Really? That happens... Your a hotel...people come here to sleep...FIX IT. All and all some of the worst customer service I have seen in a while, smelly and musty rooms, and just not a place people should stay at.  Hyatt Place down the road is MUCH nicer, better staff and pleasant stays.  I would of stayed there but it was full.Do not stay here! Room Service steals!!First this hotel is old and lots of stuff is broken in the room and at vending. The soda machine took a dollar (which the front desk replaced after I had to fill out paperwork) Then on the second day I returned to my room to find that someone (room service) had stolen my pain medicine!  When I reported it to the manager she was very rude and told me in a threatening tone that if I wanted to do something then call the police. I did have to call the police and report the medicine stolen and now I have to take time off work to go get it refilled. Thanks for violating my confidence in room service and I will let as many people know as possible.This place is great! The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean.Breakfast is also very good.I would definitely stay here again. It's a great price for a great hotel.Worst Holiday Inn I have ever stayed in. The staff obviously does not care about the customer. It started when we got to the hotel. The front desk clerk was not friendly at all. Then, we get to our room and what do you know, someone is already in there. Of course, it wasn't the fault of the staff. They actually blame the person in the room. Who gave them the key then? Another annoyance was when our keys were shut off and we could not get into our room. The clerk seemed irritated at me because the keys didn't work. Update: The clerk that was working when we checked out was the only friendly person I encountered at this hotel.Nice hotel and friendly staff.    One negative, no pool or hot tub.    The rooms are large and lean.     I have stayed here a few times and they have a better than average breakfast and the staff is very friendly.I had no intention of reviewing either this or the Holiday Inn I stayed at in Santa Fe, NM because I figured they were all of the same quality. Both this and the Santa Fe locations were excellent hotels. It's good to see that the chain has done a lot to make their reputation a good one with upgrading their facilities and the customer service they provide, or so I thought.But after staying at the Holiday Inn Express in Springfield, MO, I had to express my appreciation and throw props their way for their hospitality and professionalism with respect to making one feel important and comfortable when they lodge.They have a mini fridge and micro wave in every room and complimentary breakfast. Real breakfast, not continental! Always a complimentary bottle of water upon request. The manager even came to the dining area and said good morning.If I'm ever in Santa Fe or OKC again, you can bet I'm staying at Holiday Inn! It's the best value for the price!The room was very nice, clean, and had a comfy bed. The front desk was incredibly helpful and very friendly as well. Your stay comes with a hot breakfast and there is a small fitness room upstairs. If you are in the area for business, it is a nice place to stay with easy interstate access, free Internet, many restaurants nearby, and just down the road from the airport.Stayed here on business. Seemed to be a very new hotel. I had previously sated at the Holiday Inn down the road on meridian. Have to say i like this one a lot more. A definite for the business traveler, but for families i would recommend the Holiday Inn on meridian.",,,,,"['night', 'impressed', 'start', 'finish', 'pleasant', 'check', 'front', 'desk', 'staffer',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/fairfield-inn-and-suites-oklahoma-city-2,Fairfield Inn & Suites,3.5,$$,11,"I travel every week for work and I'm a 'platinum' member with Marriott, so I've stayed at my fair share of Marriott locations. For the last 7 months I have been flying to Oklahoma, and this has become my staple hotel.There is nothing 'fancy' about this place, but it is a clean, affordable, and welcoming place to stay. The staff is *always* available. Any time I call their number I get right through to the front desk (versus being sent to some call center). There have been numerous occasions where I've gone downstairs at 3am; there is always someone *right there* at the counter.The rooms are always consistently clean and functional. The breakfast is free, and not too shabby; the usual eggs, sausage, waffles and cereal. They even have fruit and granola bars out that you can take on the go (useful for my fellow road warriors out there). The hotel is also surrounded by a plethora of restaurants, so there is always something yummy nearby.If you're looking for a reliable, clean, and affordable hotel near Oklahoma City, look no further. This is the place.Great bed, service, plenty of parking and clean. Lots of shops nearby, places to eat, a Starbucks and next to the airport. I knocked off a star because I'm an elite member and they put me next to the stairs (kind of loud) and the breakfast - would be nice to have better eggs, real fruit and bacon - but that's if I had to criticize something! Otherwise, solid stay.Hotel is nice and I enjoyed my upgraded room... but be aware of a really bad situation that happened - I've already posted this on my Facebook account and different travel group sites: ***ALERT***This just happened to me this morning at my Marriott stay here in Oklahoma.  Someone hacked into the phone lines claiming to be the front desk asking for personal check-in information including the credit card used for check-in. He was a very professional sounding smooth talking man.  Thinking about it now it totally sounds like a scam - but how he was talking and sounding (and since I was still partially asleep) - for some reason it really sounded legit. He got me to give him my name and address on file.  Thankfully when he asked for my credit card information I finally woke up more to the situation and said I would get dressed and come downstairs and was not willing to give that information over the phone.  He was still very professional and made me feel like it would be ok if I just gave it to him. When I went downstairs - I found out I was the 3 person that had reported this situation to the front desk.  Unfortunately the other two DID give their info and were filing a police report and calling their credit card companies to alert them. Be careful out there road warriors!!!First impression, the front desk service was outstanding - friendly and helpful. The room was clean and we'll maintained.  You could hear people in the hall when the air wasn't running, but that didn't bother us very much. The hot breakfast was delicious. Everyone in my family has different tastes and they have something for everyone!  The pool is small, but fun. All in all, we would stay here again!Not bad, but nothing special.It was nice, it was clean, the staff were good.  Only complaint I had was the breakfast ""sausage"" had a rather unpleasant affect on me.  The place is convenient to several eateries, Sonic, Taco Smell and a Golden Corral and close to grocery shopping.  They also weren't particularly harsh with the pool hours and we appreciated that with 20 soccer players and all associated family / siblings.Just Enjoyed a wonderful catered event for the teleflora school evening out. The staff was so nice. The food amazing!!!  I would recommend this hotel for any intimate event.Extremely friendly and welcoming staff. Clean beyond ypur imagination. Great attention to detail. Rooms are very quiet and extremely comfortable!  Location is in the heart of restaurants and shopping!Hotel is newer, and a bargain ($99/nght)....but breakfast buffet is gross and one of my 3 ""white"" towels was yellowed. House staff completely uncaring and of no help. I came in and tried to sign into the internet for a business meeting. I was presented a choice of ""free internet"" or ""high-speed"" access for $5. I chose free only to find I couldnt sign in to my company's VPN...I mean 1990's slow. Now wont let me get back to the page that allows me to choose ""high-speed"". I called front desk and was told to call their internet provider myself. After waiting on hold 40 minutes and another 30 minutes with the internet tech....I had to give up and go down the road to Starbucks. I called the front desk and was told ""Youre the only person in the hotel with this problem"", No...Im sorry, no...let me move you to a new room...just a rude reply. I will visit my OKC office 6 times this year and hoped I found a new place to stay....NO WAY! This Marriott/Fairfield's unscrupulous manner of forcing guests to buy internet service ...and then when it doesnt work to do nothing to fix.....unacceptable....BUSINESS TRAVELERS-----STAY AWAY!I stay at lots of Fairfields and other Marriotts, and this one is a little subpar.  Customer service is very casual and slow to help.  The room was okay, but towels looked a little suspicious (not folded right), tub had a few hairs, and the iron was just tossed into the closet.  While not deal-killers, some of these things say something about the culture and the staff.  Also, the first room they gave me had a horrible stench in it.  To change rooms to a King, they wanted to up charge me since by original room type was not available.  I don't want to do that, so I ended up on a smaller, cheaper room (with no refund of the original rate, of course).  Bed was fine, pillows a bit overstuffed and firm, and breakfast was ok if you like meat and eggs.  Only packet oatmeal available.  There are better choices in the area.Great location for where I needed/wanted to be but not very sound-proof which is my biggest complaint.  Could clearly hear guests in the hall and people above.  Rooms themselves are pretty clean but overall a little dingy from use -  the room I had could use a paint job.  Only decaf coffee was left by housekeeping (but they do offer better stuff in the breakfast area) and bathroom amenities seem lacking (although I think all hotels have cut back on that to save money). Bed &amp; pillows very comfortable.  Breakfast buffet was impressive.  Totally smoke free and they had a nice patio.   Overall decent, but I'm not sure if I'd stay here again only because of the noise.",,,,,"['travel', 'every', 'week', 'work', 'platinum', 'member', 'fair', 'share', 'locations', 'last', 'months',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-by-marriott-moore,Springhill Suites by Marriott,4.5,$$,12,"We checked in late at night and the front desk girl was amazing. She even ran out to help me as I shuffled my kids and our luggage inside in some strong winds. Our room was immaculate and the beds were insanely comfortable! The breakfast in the morning was free and perfect. Eggs, waffles, fresh fruit, cereal, breads....and COFFEE. And the morning staff was extremely friendly and quite chipper at 7am! We stayed here with our two younger kids and would definitely stay here again.Very nice hotel, especially for the price.  We decided to skip our original choice of lodgings and try Springhill instead due to the price of the room and I'm very glad we did.  They are currently renovating, but the construction was not an inconvenience to us at all.  The workers were quiet and polite, as were the hotel staff.  The power did go off a couple of times, but only briefly.  The lobby, our room, and the breakfast area were immaculately clean.  My only concern is that the (very attractive) sliding doors in the bathroom are quite heavy and have tiny little handles that would be impossible for anyone with arthritis (or hand lotion) to get a grip on without accidentally flipping the lock.  We were in one of the handicap accessible rooms and it seems an oversight to me.  I know several small, older ladies who could have been trapped in there.I have stayed at several Springhill Suites properties but it is my first time at this location. Upon my arrival, no one was at the front desk. I knocked and called out but no one was there! I surmise that there might be only one person working and he/she must take care of personal business in the restroom. After 7-8 minutes of waiting the front desk person showed up and apologized to me for the wait because he had to help a guest. He was friendly and courteous. He check me in very quickly.The room was spacious enough with usual amenities. The bed was clean and firm. Aside from a little wait, there wasn't anything for me to complain about. Wifi is free and parking is free.Just a note that there are several fast food joints within walking distance. But if you want a restaurant, you have to make a short drive.This is the second time my youth group has stayed here on a mission trip! The staff is absolutely amazing, along with the hotel accommodations. There is plenty of space to gather, and the rooms are soooo nice! We stayed there for 6 days, and hated leaving. The staff is very cooperative. They have free breakfast, which is pretty good. The maid service is great giving us fresh towels every day since we were so dirty from manual labor. Definitely stay here is you are in Moore or OKC, love this place. (Did I mention there is a Braums across the street?!?!)I think this is a nice moderate hotel. It was really clean, and smelled fresh.  Everyone was very friendly.  The only thing was a huge crack in the sink in room 300.  It would just be better to replace it rather than trying to do a cheap repair, and no one was at the desk for check out.  Other than that it was good.I love this hotel. This staff is always polite and the rooms are always clean. I like this style of room. It great for business travelers and families because of the size of the rooms. The only downside is the pool. They should have put in a hot tub.Stayed here in order to take our kids to Frontier City. Nice hotel! Clean rooms. Family friendly. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful! The neighborhood looked a little rough around the edges but we felt very safe at the hotel! Lots of good places to eat nearby which was nice. Pool was a little small but overall was very happy with our stay!We stayed here twice, one week apart, and have decided this is one of our favorite hotels. The room is big enough for five (two adults, two teen boys, and a girl) and all of the beds were comfortable. The room was clean and quiet, towels were clean and fluffy. We didn't have a chance to swim but the pool is on the large end for comparable hotels. The fitness room is next to the pool so you can watch the kids while they swim. The front desk staff was friendly. Breakfast was good - standard offerings. On the first stay we had biscuits and gravy plus eggs. Today it was bacon and eggs. Also available: waffles, fruit, three kinds of cereal, bagels, muffins, and toast. Only cons: the tv is small and oddly placed, and on both visits we only had four towels, despite listing five guests on our reservation. Overall, great experience; everyone was happy (not always easy) with this hotel and we will stay again.My Sister and her husband were recently in a bad motorcycle accident.  To add insult to injury, a pipe burst in their home the day they were released from the hospital.  This is where Springhill Suites in Moore comes in.Since they were unable to stay at home, I got them a room at the Springhill Suites in Moore.  I explained the situation and Marriott even gave me a discounted rate.  My Sister tells me the hotel is very nice and the service is great.  I've been using Marriott for business travel for years, and wherever I go they are consistently better than any other chain I've tried.  Their help in accommodating my family gets them a big thumbs up.We had the worst stay here when we came out in July last year! The staff were so rude to us! We were on a road trip cross country and had our dog with us. We dropped off the dog at my husband's brother's home in Moore before staying at this hotel. But during our stay, the housekeeper yelled at me because she had seen one of the dog's food bowl with our luggage and made an assumption we had brought the dog in the room. Then we got calls from the staff wanting to come do immediate inspections while my 3 year old daughter was napping. I told them to also check the video cameras throughout the hotel to believe us but apparently they didn't want to go through the trouble.We also left my laptop charger there and called several times to see if they would scan the room for us and call us back. They never called us back no matter how many times we called them. I think it's because they never believed us about the dog and felt like they had the right to totally disregard our request.No complaints whatsoever.  Staff was very friendly and the military discount was great especially considering I was just passing through.  Breakfast was good too.  If I ever find myself needing a place to stay in Moore, Oklahoma again, I know where to stop.Hotel is located right off of I-35 in Moore, OK.  Contemporary design and colors are evident within the entire hotel and room.  The rooms are large and can accommodate up to five guests since the rooms come with a seperate living room area that contains a sleeper sofa.  The shower is also seperate from the toilet which is extremely convenient if there are three or more guests in each room.  For those of you on a fast-food budget, there are four fast food restaurants (Taco Bell, KFC, A&amp;W, and Long John Silvers) within walking distance of this hotel.  I also enjoyed the free continental breakfast because they had many hot food selections including, bacon, sausage, and eggs.  They also provided free cookies for a late afternoon snack and 24-hr free coffee and ice water in their lobby.  Currently the entrance to the hotel is undergoing road construction, but I would definitely return to this Springhill Suites hotel even during their triple digit temperatures in the heat of the summer.",,,,,"['checked', 'late', 'night', 'front', 'desk', 'girl', 'amazing', 'ran', 'help', 'shuffled', 'kids', 'luggage', 'inside', 'strong', 'winds', 'room', 'immaculate', 'beds', 'insanely',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-oklahoma-city-4,Hampton Inn,3.5,$$,14,"The customer service was great, the room is very clean. I would go back again.Rooms are small and old style.  Desk squeezed into corner with back to TV. Shower had last residents bandage on rail.  Toilet overflowed in first flush.  Needs Maintenace and attention to detail when cleaning.  Would probably choose alternative hotel on return visit.  Smokers chased from front door. GOOD.   Smokers sent to pool. DISGUSTING.  So now no children or non smokers can use the pool.  Poor planning!!!!!This it a better Hampton I've stayed at. Staff: The staff is friendly and helpful. I didn't have any rude encounters but a coworker of mine did. Coffee: Horrible. So far every Hampton I've stayed at has had horrible coffee. The water for the tea was also luke warm at best. They need a timer system or something to change the coffee pots/water pot.Decor: The lobby is a little confused decor wise. There is a mix of old and modern that isn't quite working but it's clean and that's what counts most. The hallways are poorly lit. They have lights don't  misinterpret that but they have a yellowish glow to them, at least on the third floor they did. Room decor was like any other Hampton. I did have an awkwardly placed Jacuzzi tub though. It was literally right next to my bed. I can't comment on the tub because I never use tubs in hotels. I don't trust that they have been cleaned considerably between patrons. Fitness Center: Clean and the equipment is newer. I was surprised they had a stretching machine in there. I haven't seen one of those in a Hampton before. Door Key Card: This cold be better. I've stayed at Hamptons with the newer technology ( the ones where you don't have to insert the card you just press it against the receiver pad and it unlocks) but this hotel has the old fashioned - is it still considered old fashioned? - key locks where you insert the card and pull it out. I had trouble up and down and all around with this. I had to get two new cards and neither were working. It was ridiculous.Bed: Pillows and mattress were great. The comforter on the other hand was garbage. It was lumpy and not at all plushy and soft. It wasn't warm anymore and needed to be retired. I asked for a new one and they said they didn't have one they could supply me with. View: Considering this is right off an expressway don't expect a view? Noise isn't too bad though from the expressway. Usually I have a hard time sleeping with expressway noise but I didn't have a problem here.So, was a bit disappointed in my recent stay here in OKC. Location was nice with access to the mall, movies, Starbucks etc close by.  Got in and lady at front desk was busy reading a book and walked up and she was really engorged and did the thing were you are still reading and putting it down and walking toward a customer but not moving to fast and still reading. Yeah, a bit annoying. I am not asking you to just drop a phone call or stop typing if you are working, but, if you are reading or whatever, c'mon, put the book down as there is a customer waiting and acknowledge them.  She was pleasant enough, but did not acknowledge that I was a Gold Member(they are supposed to) did not offer me complimentary water/snack or points, and they had a bunch of cookies out and she gave me a look when I dared to take two.  She was working next morning as well when I left and did not say good-bye, thanks for staying etc, just reading her book...sigh.Am usually very positive about my Hilton visits, please see my next one for HGI in OKC which was super, but this was a miss.  Room fine, etc, but the initial service left allot to be desired.Not sure how this hotel is ranked #10 in OKC hotels on one particular site. There is no view from the room other than a parking lot in most of the rooms. The front desk is not all that friendly or accommodating but then again it is not exactly a Hilton location. The coffee is the worst I have had in a hotel of any kind. They keep it at the front and you would think it would at least taste good?!? I had do not disturb on the door and they were banging on my door at 10am trying to kick me out... Maybe if they did a few things such as duvets on the beds and better coffee it would make the stay better. Great location in NW OKC but a less than basic hotel.Clean and efficient. Very moderately priced and provides the essentials for a short stay. Nothing fancy, just a clean comfortable room and maybe the best free breakfast I have had in a place. Great for families.My first night at this hotel I noticed the AC wasn't quite cool enough.  I asked them the next morning to please check my AC because it wasn't cool.  I came back to a brand new unit, perfectly quiet and cold.That's service!The hallways could use some updating (think jade green carpet) but the rooms are fairly standard fair for Hampton Inns.  Plenty around the hotel as far as eating options go but not too much for fun things to do.  Front desk staff was extremely nice checking in and called to make sure everything was good in the room.Nice soft and hard pillows, good staff, not rude, clean rooms, quiet, and it's very clean..Recently renovated, and still doing some. Friendly staff and easy to find.Nice hotel, great price, very nice friendly staff, sports bar connected to it, clean rooms, awesome place to stay. Will definitely go back. Only thing is no continental breakfast...but that was ok, I wanted to explore the surrounding areas.My favorite place to stay when I come home.Rooms are clean, rates are good. Needs better toiletries but I love Hampton Inn and this one does not disappoint. Ashley the desk clerk was so very nice and helpful.The Hampton Inn is a reliable choice for overnight hotel stays.  This one is located in a business district and not too far of a drive to the Asian district.  The room contains two queen beds, fairly clean, and reasonably priced.  There are plenty of restaurants located nearby and a Target located less than a mile away.  The Hampton also provides a free continental breakfast which begins at 6:00am.  I am always satisfied whenever I stay at the Hampton Inn.",,,,,"['customer', 'service', 'great', 'room', 'clean', 'back', 'rooms', 'small', 'old', 'style', 'desk', 'squeezed', 'corner', 'back',

It's a bit hard to find, but the hotel once you get here doesn't disappoint. For the price you get a clean room with fridge and microwave, cable tv, and good water pressure. Breakfast was good, nothing to write home about, the staff at breakfast is another story, they were rude and dismissive when my husband went to ask for a high chair for our baby. The lady waved him off and said, ""yeah yeah I'll get it""...seriously lady? I'm sorry did we interrupt your busy day of SERVING CUSTOMERS?!Really clean room and bathroom. You can tell the staff takes a lot of pride in their cleanliness. The breakfast was good. I really enjoyed my stay. The bed was very comfy. My only concern is that my smoke detector was covered with a plastic bag (maybe the people who were in there before covered it to smoke) .. That weirded me out. But overall I had a good stay for a good price on Priceline. Would stay again.It was okay. The whole experience was decent, nothing particularly great but it wasn't bad. Rooms were alright, comfortable enough.. Breakfast was fine, about as good as you can expect from a 2 star. It was affordable and pet friendly, but probably wont be my first choice next time I'm in town.We got such cheap price for a Saturday night. Room was nice and clean and receptionist was friendly. We had cocktails in the agency bar, at the hotel. Being a mad men fan i loved the bar, as it had mad men quotes all over the walls. We got chatting to a blonde bar lady all night there. She was lovely and made us good strong drinks all night. Breakfast wasn't wow.. But it never is at these 'free' breakfast buffets, but there's always fruit you can grab or some cereal :)Rooms were decent but staff needs help on customer service- basketball teams/ groups  aren't well accommodated.Breakfast nazis is also a problem- with waiting every morning for a breakfast tkt- suggestion:  give a code at check in to use or something (waiting behind people checking out is ridiculous just to get breakfast!)We were almost scared off by the poor reviews but after checking out the exterior and the lobby and finding it well maintained and festive, we decided to stay. (See pictures ) At the AARP discounted price of $68. We got a wonderful room with a free upgrade that included free wifi and a free hot breakfast. The breakfast included fluffy scrambled eggs, sausage, do it yourself Belgian waffles and a lot more. Even the apples were sweet, fresh and crunchy.   Glad we stayed.Hotel should be better rated... service good, room nice and clean, FREE breakfast better than many.  Call hotel direct and get best rate.  I stay at a lot of mid level (cheaper) places and I would come back here.  On the North Central Side but still easy for all access.Room key stopped working after one use. Our dogs were inside the room and barking and we couldn't get to them to calm them. After front desk clerk sent me back three different times to re-try with new keys, she finally sent a maintenance person. 45 minutes later, he finagled the lock with a coat hanger looking thing. I felt awful for annoying the other guests because the dogs were barking like crazy. We bought frozen dinners from the lobby for the kids as they were starving after being in the road all day. Worst 18.00 I've ever spent! The microwave dinners were thawed out by the time we were finally able to get into our room. A sincere apology would have smoothed things over, but instead I felt like I was a bother to the staff.For the price the hotel was great. Rooms were nice, service was great and extremely helpful. Pool was perfect temperature, outdoor probably not heated. Breakfast was pretty good. Only thing the restaurant is not open on the weekends.If you are staying at this motel because you're having surgery make certain to book by phone and ask for the ""Hospital Rate""; much cheaper than any online deals. Overall this was a good stay. The only reason I marked cleanliness low is because of the incredibly strong scent of cleaning product in our room. Everything was, however, very clean. The front desk service was excellent. I would stay again just because we were treated so well by the front desk clerk. This is a good stay for the cost, and surprisingly still had smoking rooms. I was really surprised by the bad reviews of this place; we had a pretty good experience.The quality of my room was that of a cheap motel. The pull out couch in the ""suite"" we stayed in legitimately looked like it was picked up off a curb somewhere. The material was ripping off the corners and the filth was visible. We arrived two hours before the in-hotel diner was supposed to close and the employees appeared to have turned the lights off in the dining area to discourage patrons from entering. We entered, looked around confused, and were not greeted by the bartender. They also do not have normal length pillows on the beds! They are the size of couch cushions. Lights are dim, paint on the walls has touch-ups all over the place. I mean I can care less what color my hotel walls are, but this speaks to the product this hotel believes is acceptable. All around an awful hotel, DO NOT STAY!Three key words: INFESTED WITH COCKROACHES!And no, I don't mean ""we saw a cockroach;"" rather, we captured and killed a multitude of roaches within a few minutes of seeing the first little one running down the edge of the tub in a well-lit bathroom. I then saw significantly larger one (both are displayed in the posted photo) on the rug next to the work area and another by the radiator, which marked the beginning of a extensive cockroach hunt/investigation, where we discovered more live roaches of varying sizes at the base of the walls, behind and in the sleeper sofa, two more next to the workstation (this one crawled down the wall no more than three feet from where I was sitting), one running up the wall directly next to the bed, and through out HVAC unit. Cockroaches began, literally, coming out of the window pane in droves after we caught and killed the larger ones in the HVAC unit, (it was directly beneath the window). Now this was just outrageous, as roaches are known spreaders of disease (the worker at Best Western denied this was ""even that unhealthy"" at all, and openly confessed, on recording, to the fact that he didn't consider our situation (re: the right to healthy and sanitary  living/sleeping conditions/a.k.a. THE ONLY THING A MOTEL OR HOTEL IS TRULY FOR!) was "" even a serious matter"" or ""worth calling management for."" In sum, while it was deeply obviously this warranted immediate and serious action, the staff were HORRID. In fact, only slightly worse than the quantity of roaches was the attitude and uselessness of the front desk staff. When roach #1 was spotted and killed, I called the front desk, only to be told (verbatim), ""You don't even know what a roach looks like,"" and nothing further was done. I was irritated, but since both my partner and I have lived in New York City and have dealt with our share of cockroaches and assholes, we did not want to get into a massive altercation; we'd been in the car all day and had wanted nothing more than to eat some dinner and relax. That never happened at The Best Western. Instead, I was told by the first clerk that I was ""wrong,"" but by 11pm, when the real roach show began, the second night clerk agreed to come to our room to ""deal with the problem."" He agreed that what we'd collected was indeed ""a lot of roaches, all right,"" and even had the privilege of watching as I snapped photos of even more of the smaller ones running up the walls. Yes, you read that correctly. ROACHES RAN DOWN THE WALLS AS A WORKER @ BEST WESTERN STOOD IDLY IN OUR ROOM, ULTIMATELY SUGGESTING HE REFUND OUR MONEY IF AND ONLY IF WE AGREED TO LEAVE THE MOTEL IMMEDIATELY (seriously: my partner and I were/are FURIOUS and SHOCKED). In essence, The Best Western punished their customers, who had driven over 10 hours at day, at midnight, in a city we do not know by giving us a room infested with cockroaches, loads of attitude, the complete absence of customer care, and A THREAT TO CALL THE POLICE. In fact, an ARMED GUARD (with his hand on his GUN) watched as I checked out, as my partner put our belongings back into the car, and even as we pulled away.  Would you really want that ""complimentary"" hot breakfast buffet the next morning after all? Ugh. The atmosphere was not one that made us exceedingly hungry, to put it mildly. Ultimately, we checked in at the Motel 6 down the road (it was almost 1am by this point), where the night manager, which The Best Western claimed ""not to have,"" gave us a King Suite for $56 (including taxes!) because he felt so bad for the hassle we had The Best Western. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! I'd honestly feel guilty withholding this information from potential customers: it truly is THAT bad. So so yourself a massive favor and take your precious time, money, and peace of mind to a better place. No one deserves this.the room stunk horrifically of smoke.  i could have asked to change rooms but i was only there a short time.  the other smell was too much cleaning chemicals.  the place seemed really depressing.  the continental breakfast was mostly hi-glycemic index foods and not very appealing.  staff were not very friendly.  given how much i paid i thought it would have been more decent, but was below average for a ""budget motel.""",,,,,"['front', 'desk', 'service', 'great', 'bit', 'hard', 'find', 'hotel', 'disappoint', 'price', 'clean', 'room', 'fridge', 'microwave', 'cable',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/homewood-suites-by-hilton-oklahoma-city,Homewood Suites By Hilton,3.5,$$,20,"I traveled from Central Florida heading to the Bay area in CA.  I stopped at this hotel and felt like I hit the jackpot.  I was able to freeze the cold packs completely as I continued my journey because it had a good size refrigerator/freezer. The bed was very comfortable after such a long drive. It was everything I hoped it would be.  The rooms were incredibly clean and spacious. The young man at the front desk was helpful and welcoming.  The breakfast the next day had everything I could want including fresh blueberries for the oatmeal.  I would make it a point to stay here again if I am ever in the area. For this price point I think this hotel should be the model for all the others.Wouldn't let us check in because we only had a visa debit card on us. Apparently they require a credit card for a deposit. This is NOT posted anywhere, I have used visa debit for all my hotels in the past, it has never been a problem!It's almost 1:00am, we drove 10 hours, had a reservation, have two small children, and the entire area is booked for the night. We have no where to go.. Thanks ChrisThis is a great hotel for business travel or for those looking for a long term hotel stay. Rooms are arranged as apartments, where they have a kitchen, small living room and then bedroom. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast and dinners for their guests as well as many other amenities in communal areas which is nice if you're tired of being cooped up in a hotel room.If you get sick of the free food, there are also multiple chain restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. Front desk was friendly on check in and out and my brief stay was an all around positive one. The free beer in the lobby during my stay, was no longer available. That's not worth dropping a star but a bummer nonetheless to point out.Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Decor &amp; Style: 4/5I love the free dinners they give you. Not only that, but Shiner Bock is on tap and it is self serve! Can't beat that. Food is pretty good compared to most other extended stays and they change it every day. Food selection is large compared to others. The place is big, clean, and has a very homey feeling to it. Definitely recommend this place for an extended stay. I didn't give it a 5 star because it is very hard for me to rate any hotel 5 stars unless its $$$$!Zero stars.  Unbelievable.  We just arrived after a 10 hour drive and the lobby is full of people because the front desk clerk apparently decided to leave for the day with no forewarning.  We have reservations but cant check in to our rooms.  The maintenance guy just spoke to someone ""who will be in, in about 30 minutes"".  There are people here who have been waiting 45 minutes.  What a clown show.  Never again.Our family love this hotel. The rooms are spacious and the food is delicious. If you need a night or a week this in the hotel for you.10x better than the last Hilton I was in!! This room is bigger than my last apartment and is great! Everything works the TV actually has reception I wish I would have stayed here the entire 2 weeks I was in OKC here.Stayed here on super bowl weekend for a ""girls weekend.""  The hotel was clean and spacious. The pool area was relaxing and fun. Loved that there were pool noodles and a large beachball available for all to use! Loved the blue ray disk players in all rooms and movies available at the front desk.   The two best things in my book were the staff and breakfast! Every interaction was friendly and helpful! From the parking attendants to front desk to cooks to the maids and even the maintenance guy. When we were having trouble with a whistling noise constantly going on Caleb came to help us out. When he could see it was a larger problem than he could help out with he and the front desk guy moved us to a larger room with no whistling!  My girlfriends and I don't drink coffee the front desk guy made sure there was plenty of hot water and hot chocolate at the complimentary beverage service . And finally breakfast was really good every morning. It had the usual staples in a hot breakfast service (make your own waffle, pastries, yogurt, cereal and eggs and breakfast meat.) what was so different with this service they changed up the eggs and other main meal items. One morning was your regular hash browns, scrambled eggs, and sausage with fresh blueberry muffins next day it was blintzes, steak and egg scramble, latkes  and Canadian bacon. YUM! Will definitely stay here again!Very nice and helpful staff. Clean and welcoming. Rooms are large and very nice. The bed is amazing!!! The complimentary breakfast was out of this world!Very nice and clean ! Helpful staff and the free Shiner on Tap  was nice . The food is just ok but it was nice to have the option if I didn't feel like going out . The location was far from Bricktown where I was working but I liked it better . It was near shopping and the Disney Store outlet ;) but not crowded like Bricktown . I like the ice they had in the hall it was like sonicBy Oklahoma standards, Homewood Suites may be considered expensive (depending on the person you ask); it is somewhat pricy when compared to other extended stay hotels. I know of places here in the city (and surrounding areas) where you can stay an entire week for $160-180. At Homewood, you're looking at approximately $100 just for one night. But I can't remember any extended stay hotel I have stayed at that had all of the added amenities and benefits that Homewood Suites offers. Sure, you're paying extra for the Hilton brand, but the place itself is definitely a step up from say, Extended Stay America (not to suggest that ESA is terrible or something). With the added expense comes a certain level of comfort that you won't really find at other extended stay hotels (especially the ones that aim for the bare minimum). The patrons are hit-or-miss though. Some are great. Some are normal. Some are... Well, for some, staying at the Homewood Suites is probably the highlight of their trashy lives. Some of the amenities/benefits include: breakfast and dinner (most nights), an exercise facility, swimming pool/jacuzzi, etc. The rooms are nicer than any apartment that I've had the pleasure of living in thus far in my short existence. That might not mean much though because I've lived in some hovels.One of my favorite hotels to stay at while in OKC. #1 - Comfy, Hilton-standard beds.#2 - Clean, spacious rooms. A/C works great. (It gets hot and humid here.)#3 - They feed me breakfast and dinner. (It's a not-so-safe area, especially for a single traveler like myself, why go out at night?)#4 - Near OKC airport and FAA MMC, about 10-15 minutes drive.#5 - Friendly front desk and cooking staff, even in the morning, even in the face of grumpy, insomniacs like me.Dinner (happy hour) meals are served 5 to 7PM, Monday to Thursday, and recently, were pretty decent, considering what they had to cook with. I liked the chicken tortellini alfredo with buttered peas and corn. Entrees changed every day, but one could usually find a basic salad bar and pour-your-own red and white wine and Bud on tap.Not too shabby for under $100, if you can get that price. Reserve a room early.Free internet is not something you get everywhere anymore. This property also has a lovely heated outdoor pool and a delicious Jacuzzi. Homewood Suites in general always impress me with ridiculously large rooms, full kitchens, decent breakfasts and a sort of happy hour with free wine and beer, and last night was taco night with all the fixins. Another reviewer commented on the cheerfulness of the happy hour staff and they are right -- you get a cheerful greeting whether you just grunt at her or reply back. If they could bottle that gal's cheerfulness, I'd buy it at the little convenience shop by the front desk.I love me some Homewood Suites. Best deal around if you like a massive, comfy room, free food and booze, a decent pool and fitness center and a staff that actually enjoys what they do.Love it!Where to begin?  When you arrive at a property one should NOT have to ask to NOT have a handicapped room.  We checked in with a small child who is a 'bather' imagine our surprise to find that the 'suite' we'd booked wasn't that sweet.  In fact, there was a stand up handicapped shower and an overly tall (presumably for handicap access as well) toilet making 'weeing' difficult for said child.   We paid a dear rate (being HH members and memebers of the Hilton family (one of our daughters works with Hilton in ATX) for this suite - as we decided to stop here on our way home from Joplin's Homewood Suites (which ROCKS BTW).  The people who work here are quite nice, lovely in fact, but the reality is this is not a good value.The next thing that really ground up my tired gears was climbing into a bed that FELT LIKE MATTRESS quilting.  With pillows that seriously were made of something scrunchy and not at all soft or firm.  And they smelled weird.  The mattress, however, insured we would NOT get a good sleep.  Since when do you NOT use a proper Hilton style mattress cover when you have MULTIPLE patrons a week, year whatever - I am seriously so grossed out right now, it was a thin nothing of a cover that had come up at every corner exposing naked mattress.  Taking photos - nasty sauce right there.  Combined with the handicapped restroom and the proximity to ""Ding"" the elevators (across from) this just was the last straw.   I do not want to forget that fact that we had to RUN THE AIR CON all night long. It's 35 degrees outside and we needed the air on because the heat is broken and runs you up to 90 when set to 68.  Honestly people. I booked directly through Hilton's site WITH my HH - so they knew we were coming, we did not use some discount site thus seemingly deserving the cast off room.  And when I enquired about moving... all they had 'left' was smoking rooms or Handicap. Forking riceholes.  I'd skip this property and go on over to the Embassy Suites - the price is about the same but you really do get more for your money, even from discount sites!  Plus the food is way better at ES.  The breakfast was fine here, but I really won't eat eggs someone else peeled or bread others have pawed through.  They do not offer many vegetarian options nor do they seem 'kid' friendly but rather I had to ask them to change the channel from inappropriate sexual content on Dr. Phil to something more friendly... or off altogether (we aren't big tele peeps!) This is just icing mind you of why I wouldn't recommend this to others.  The mattress is the big deal and I am seriously bummed we spent the money and a whole night here.  Damn you sleep.  I wish I no longer needed you.Very disappointed. Stayed at Homewood in Kansas &amp; Iowa last month &amp; were very pleased. Decided to switch from Hampton. This is NOT a suite!! It's just a bigger room with a kitchenette. Vanity sink in front of bed so washing hands during night wakes up husband. Not happy! Won't book a room like this again. May go back to strictly Hampton or Embassy. Feeling ripped off!I am a Hilton Honors member and have stayed at many Hilton's including Homewood Suites.  I do like the breakfasts better at Embassy suites, but this location is not bad.  Desk staff very nice. Room, very clean and nice pillows/bed.  I like the studio style suite layout.  Nice, big lcd HD TV.  I really wanted to comment on the breakfast, the ladies that run it in the morning are really friendly and try and jazz up the standard ""continental fare"".   Not the greatest food, but well done with what they had.  Plus they are super friendly.Next time I have to visit, I would stay again for sure.Staff is friendly and they provide free breakfast and dinner on weekdays.The lady that provided us breakfast every morning was a true joy.  She always greeted us with a smile and politely told us what was being served that morning.  Her joy and enthusiasm was most appreciated!!I have never had a bad stay at Homewood Suites, and this location didn't disappoint. We arrived about 10 pm after 13 hours of driving. Robert was at the front desk, I had spoken to him about 4 hours earlier to make our reservation. He was friendly, helpful and quick to get us into our room. We got into our room, ready to fall in to bed. The room was super clean, looked newly remodeled or the property is new, but it was perfect. We all slept great, quiet location, and very easy to get to off of I-40. There is a Buffalo Wings restaurant within walking distance, a Shell gas station to refuel across the street and for all the Harley Davidson riders, a large Harley store directly across the street.Thank you Homewood Suites and Robert for making our stay so nice, we may see you on the return trip.I'm a Hilton Honors member and like to stay at Hilton properties when possible.  This hotel came up with a fantastic rate and good location.  I discovered that the Homewood property provides Hot breakfast and dinner, included in the price.  The rooms are nice fitted with  kitchenette, small living room and bedroom.  this is great for people staying on longer trips, or people who like to spread out.Not bad overall.    This is not a ""new"" hotel but what is in Oklahoma City?   It looks to me that it was built in the 70's or '80 but has been well updated.I was a little bubbly to find that the air conditioning was by one of those large window units below the main window.     It was little humid in there but that dropped it down and I used up enough electricity keeping my room cool as anyone.....   Sigh....    I would have to say that this is one of the best hotels in Oklahoma City.I just wish they would use central air for a more constant overall comfort level and less energy waste.",,,,,"['traveled',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/residence-inn-by-marriott-oklahoma-city,Residence Inn By Marriott,4.0,$$,20,"You know what? I absolutely adored this hotel. So, stop looking, and book a room. We stayed in a king bed suite over Valentine's weekend, and it was perfect. The layout of the room was impeccable. We walked in to a small raised countertop area to our left with a key caddy for phones and small items, with the kitchen right there as well, hooks to our right for jackets, a desk and chair in front of us with the living room set up nicely behind it. The kitchen was fully equipped and left nothing to be desired for us. The bonus of a two person eat-in dining area with table and chairs was also great. Beyond the living room, was the bedroom to the left, and off of it a nice counter area and closet, with the toilet and shower in a separate room. Everything was super clean, bright, and welcoming. Oh, and tons of storage everywhere. In the morning the breakfast buffet included hot breakfast items such as eggs, potatoes, sausage, and oatmeal. There was also a great selection of fresh fruit, yogurt, breads, bagels, and muffins, and a full waffle station. Items changed daily which was a nice surprise for variety, especially if you stay there for awhile. The layout and impeccable use of space in our suite, as well as location and amenities offered makes this the only place I'd ever want to stay in OKC. You will feel completely at home, in the heart of a bustling area. Couldn't ask for more!Very nice place to stay when in the OKC area. It's close to everything fun in BrickTown.The next time we're in town I'm sure this will be on top of the list of places to stay.It's so pretty and super functional! The hallway is a little tacky, but what do you expect? I've seen worse halls in Vegas.The staff are really nice and you get free continental breakfast. The hotel is walking distance from some nice eateries, (although their prices are a little jacked up), and about 1 block from the movies.It bothered me that of all the reviews, there wasn't one pic of a room. I added mine and now I feel way better.The manager here is horrible. Latta Miller blatantly hit on my wife to the point where it was borderline harassment. The other manager, Matthew something was nice and very helpful. For the most part the rest of the front desk staff was OK. But I can't believe Marriott would hire a creep like that. Will not stay here again until he's gone.Excellent service! The hospitality was great, morning breakfast was very good and the management could not have been friendlier. I would definitely recommend this location again! They went above and beyond to accommodate the large group I was with which made a long journey a little easier. Thank you! I will be back if I return to OKC.It is ok if you are not in the back of buildings 1,2 &amp;3. There is a night club back there that had very loud music on Wednesdays, Fridays &amp; Saturdays. It does not shut down til 2:00 am .Complimentary breakfast in the morning!  Residence Inns are very nice to stay at.  Rooms are always spacious and have a kitchenette attached.  At this location, make sure that the front desk gives you a parking pass, because you may get towed.The location is in walking distance of many restaurants.  The staff is very friendly.  They also have this touch screen kiosk, where you can look for things around the city.  You can print the directions from there too, very convenient.Guess what? I'm in the United States Navy and I got to pay to take a cold shower tonight! Forget bootcamp hot showers. I'd love to pay for a nice cold shower in the winter! Hooyah!Liking this place.  Great rooms, great location, very reasonable parking. At $6 a night its by far the best around the downtown area. The rooms are very well maintained and very spacious, and the kitchen is better stocked than other residence inns as far as cooking goes.  As a frequent business traveler I have to say the gym is pretty lacking though. Elliptical is poorly maintained and nothing more than a set of free weights and one bench.  Could do much better especially in an area with so many long term consultants visiting for Devon and other downtown firms.I use Mid-American gym on Broadway in case you're curious.  Very reasonable daily, weekly, and monthly rates there.  A bit of a shame I have to run a couple of miles to lift weights, but in the end it only makes the workout more rounded right?This is the nicest Residence Inn I have experienced.  Very updated and extremely clean.  I brought my dog and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful pathways and water features behind the hotel.  The location was excellent close to restaurants, movies, etc.  Staff was fabulous and even gave me a complimentary deodorant when I forgot to pack mine.  Rooms were quiet.  Breakfast was good and all staff were working hard.  Could not have asked for a better experience.clean place, great location, and good for families. Brand new hotel, and great location with lots of places to eat, drink and be merry. I would encourage going to the minor league ball game as its across the street, and mickey mantles steak house (see review). Hotel staff is courteous, hotel is clean and very comfortable. The pool isnt great and needs to be cleaned more frequently but the hotel is great.The Residence Inn in Bricktown is a commendable hotel to choose if you're looking for a well-kept hotel in the downtown Oklahoma City area. The rooms are roomy and comfortable. The complimentary hot breakfast has some great items (ham slices, eggs, potatoes, yogurt, and your general continental breakfast items). Also, the evening reception that's available during most of the weekdays is a pretty sweet deal that comes along with your stay.I would give the hotel 5-stars, but I have two nuances from the times that I've stayed here:1. I stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions during the same month, only to find that the one elliptical machine in the hotel gym still had the same ""broken"" sign weeks later. For a hotel of this size and given the fact that there was only one elliptical machine, I expected it to be fixed during my second stay. Also, compared to other hotels of the same caliber around the area, the gym lacks in the amount and type of equipment. The room can feel a bit confining if there's more than 3-4 individuals trying to burn those darn calories.2. The walls appeared to be somewhat thin. I could sometimes hear the people next door, but luckily it was still tolerable during my stay.Overall, I still would stay at this Residence Inn for it's convenient location to restaurants in the downtown area, the friendly employees, the cleanliness of the rooms, and the complimentary hot breakfast. Hopefully I'll see improvements with the gym the next time I'm around the area.I really liked this hotel. Clean spacious rooms, staff very knowledgeable and friendly, and who can beat free breakfast and dinner!  It's amazing how good food can taste when it's free!!!  lolMy only recommendation would be to get a room away from the freeway, especially if you are a light sleeper!Love this hotel. The employees are so nice. Rooms are beautiful!A beautiful clean hotel, with pleasant staff and a plentiful breakfast. The room has a full sized kitchen, desk an sofabed in the living room, beds and bathroom in the other room. I'm not sure if this is a new hotel or not, but everything was well maintained. My favorite part of the staff was upon check-in was when they were asking discovery questions (I was moving and had a trailer with all my worldly goods in it) so they put me in a room with a window view of my truck and assured me about the security they have walking the premises at night. Big plus. I would love to stop here again and stay for an extended period instead of just one night. :)Overall it's a good hotel, front desk staff is friendly &amp; good location. My only issue was with the house keeping staff. I was there for several weeks and I don't think I saw one house-keeping person smile or be friendly...I would actually go so far as saying they just look downright pissed. Its understandable some people don't like their work, but a simple ""good morning"" goes a long way and expected. The highlight was when they were delivering my dry-cleaning but decided NOT to knock on the door as I stood in my underwear in the middle of the room.Again, the positives out-weighted the negative. I would return again..just wanted to vent..Stayed there 2 nights, family and dog.  Great hotel, management and staff.  Awesome location by Bricktown and the ballpark.Stayed for 8 nights and absolutely loved our stay!  Free hot buffet breakfast and Mon, Tues, and Wednesday hot dinners buffet couldn't be beat = 11 free meals!  Situated in the new Bricktown recreation/party area of Oklahoma City, you have everything fun at your backdoor...movies, 30+ restaurants/bars, minor league ballpark, right on the canal with wonderful walkways.  There is even a ""water taxi"" to deliver you to your desired location!Our 2-BR suite was very roomy - each BR had a master bath - full kitchen - 3 flat-screen TVs.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!Great place! Love the location (Bricktown). You can actually walk to a ton of different places (restaurants, minor league ballpark, pubs, etc). It is by their little river. Only downside is that you hear the freeway if you are facing the river. Didn't bother me at all since I am not someone who needs 100% silence to fall asleep. I was not looking forward to Oklahoma City at all, but the Bricktown area is actually pretty darn nice :-)Very helpful and friendly staff. Very comfortable beds. Also, if you are a smoker (guilty), they do have some rooms with balconies. There aren't many, but it never hurts to ask. I was in 306 my first week there and it had a balcony. My second week I was in 206, which didn't. If you are looking for a walkable laid back place with tons of draft beer choices, I recommend walking over to TapWerks.As Residence Inn goes, this place is perfect. They allow dogs, but are organized about it enough where you feel like other people's dogs who can't behave won't ruin your stay (of course my dog is perfect,so I love that he can be here with me lol). Our room is cheaper than the one in Memphis was, yet it's actually 2 rooms, not just a studio feeling. I wish I could move into this room, for real. Totally helpful staff. Walking distance to anything in Bricktown (right outside OK City). Canal out back, awesome for walking dog. Basketball court, big pool. Thrilled. Altho minus a star for us having to take our own luggage cart out to our car to haul all our sh*t in by ourselves.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-oklahoma-city-airport-oklahoma-city,SpringHill Suites Oklahoma City Airport,4.5,$$,17,"Overall the hotel has a pretty great location with places to eat and shop well within walking distance. The room rates were about average for the OKC area. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms seemed a bit odd with how they are layed out (which is just an asthetic thing and an opinion) but still functional and fairly spacious. The decor was typical of hotel room, nothing to fancy, just the typical cookie-cutter furniture. The room overall was nice, mini-fridge, wet-bar area, nice little writing desk with lamp, iHome clock radio and an Ethernet connection. The bed was not the best by any means (typical hotel bed), but the pillows were were absolutely awesome!! The bathroom was spacious, full sized shower only (no tub though) and the actual toilet and shower were separated with a door so they could be isolated from the vanity area and the rest of the room.The breakfast I had was absolutely delicious, some of the best in-hotel breakfast that I have ever had actually. The lobby was clean and definitly had more of a modern and contemporary feel to it than the rest of the hotel. The exercise room housed the typical spread of treadmills, elliptical machines and weight machines, but wasn't huge and seemed the appropriate size for hotel. The indoor pool was nice, clean and seemed well maintained (Although the pool was pretty shallow). The sitting area just off of the pool was nice and seemed inviting. Let's talk about the hot tub. The hot-tub is also located indoors by the pool. The water was hot yes, a very appropriate temperature likely around 102 (perfect hot-tub temp imo). The ""jets"" for the hot-tub were/are in need of some servicing. Half of them did not work at all and the ones that did were simply holes in the side with air bubbling out of them. There was no actual ""jet"" action at all which is disappointing. (After all, what's the point of soaking in a public bathtub if there are no jets!!)... Anywho, overall the hotel is great, the staff was very friendly and the actual accommodations are nice. The location is good, and you don't actually hear the noise from the interstate that is a couple hundred feet from the building. All in all a 9.5 out of 10 in my book!!Stayed here many times. Service is great.  Nightly managers receptions are a nice touch.The lobby was recently remodeled. The room I was in was getting a little rough though. Front desk attendant said they were in the process of remodeling the rooms as well.I was surprised to find out that this Marriott has been opened since 2008. All I can say is this place is, clean, clean, clean!! They do a great job in maintaining the property and grounds here.The staff here is not only wonderful, but AWESOME! I felt comfortable right from the get go. The rooms are clean and spacious. The beds are comfortable and I was able to relax and catch up on my work and watch some TV in the evening to wind down. I think I got a little too comfortable, some workout guru on TV almost convinced me to buy his DVD ""Brazilian Butt Lift"" so I can tone my rear end from the privacy of my own home, but I digress ::))Housekeeping does a great job in tidying up your room after you make a mess. In the morning the staff lays out a delicious assortment of breakfast options. They offer a nice selection for the health conscious guest, for that I salute you! They also brew some mighty tasty java.In this particular location they also run a happy hour on Mon-Thu from 5:30-7:00PM offering up alcoholic beverages of beer and wine, and serving varieties of simple comfort foods that changed daily and ranged from items like pulled pork, egg rolls, lasagna and pot roast. If you're a frugal guest, you just scored! but only on Mon-Thu :) The gym and pool is typical Marriott and like I said earlier, clean and well maintained. The parking lot is big and one of the big pluses in staying here are the many different restaurants right outside your hotel lobby and a few blocks away, not to mention you are close to Will Rogers airport and Interstate I-40 is only a block away.I almost forgot to mention, this place is pet friendly.  I found myself riding the elevator with a ""Maltese"" one day and a ""Labradoodle"" the next, cool!Definitely my New go to Marriott when I'm back in town next time!Incredible stay! The room we stayed in was huge! I'm pretty sure it was bigger than our first apartment! The staff is lovely! The continental breakfast was perfection! Eggs, potatoes, fruit, croissants, to-go cups for coffee and juice! Wow! I'm super impressed. Best part; they're dog friendly! Thank you Springhill for giving us the rest we needed as we traveled across country. We'll be back on our return trip!Very nicely appointed.  Happy hour in the afternoon with complimentary wine, beer and soft drinks.  Snacks.  Very nice complimentary breakfast in the morning.  Had a little issue with a pull out bed.  Help was there in 3 or 4 minutes.  Nice!  Clean and updated.  Workout room and indoor pool were nice.  Reasonable price.Great place, comfy bed. I had a problem with my room frig &amp; they simply swapped it out right away. Spacious suite. Great shower.  It's true that most dog owners don't seem to pick up after their dogs -- maybe mgmt could offer bags &amp; trash receptacles as encouragement.  When I made my reservation by phone, the man speaking with me kept calling me 'honey' or 'sweetheart' or other endearments. Maybe this is a Southern thing, but especially when I'm booking a hotel room, I don't want that sort of familiarity. It's a little creepy. Still, a fine night's stay. Much better than average breakfast, with veggie sausage &amp; spinach! And there's a Starbucks across the street.I stay here every few weeks when I come see my kids. I love it because the people are so nice and the rooms allow us to relax. The location and good services are just right.Stay there regularly for business.  Nice place for the price.  Good sized rooms, basic fitness room, surprisingly good happy hour w appetizers, breakfast ok, staff and manager always friendly and helpful.I'll be very honest. This hotel is satisfactory at best and I'm a Marriott rewards member who has stayed at every different type of chain Marriott offers.The only saving grace is that the staff is very friendly and don't hesitate to assist with any issues and also the fact that it's in a great area surrounded by basically EVERYTHING food and shopping wise. It's only 10 minutes from the OKC airport.The rooms are adequate but the hot water had a mind of its own. My first two nights were fine. Third night, the hot water proved to be very difficult. The breakfast is OK but the waffle maker is only available on the weekends which sucks. That was basically the highlight of the breakfast for me.Great staff and GM. They make you feel at home. Great rooms and convenient location near a lot to do and eat. The staff takes pride in the property and are always courteous. I will return as often as I can.Doug from Wichita KansasSolid 3 stars, I guess. Staff was very friendly and helpful. But I find the rooms and the lay out typical of SpringHill - poorly designed. The TV is NEVER positioned in the room so that you can see it from the bed. And the bathroom shower is such that you literally have to get in the shower to turn it on - so you are blasted with hot or cold water - either way, amateur hour. The bed was  little bowed - like it needed to be replaced. But overall the property was clean and inviting. We did not partake of the breakfast. We got a great deal, so all in all, it was okay but not my first choice next time.Stayed here last week to catch a plane the next morning and now we're back from our Maui trip. We landing early morning from flying since 3pm the previous day so needless to say we were Tiiirrred! We went in about 9am knowing it was way early to check in but they said to check back about 11:30.. so we grabbed some breakfast and went back. They are very friendly and eager to help. We were able to check in at 12:00 and catch up on some lost sleep. I will from now on stay here if ever Im in the okc area. Clean, comfortable, spacious and super nice staff.I moved over here from the Oklahoma City Marriott.  Man what a difference on so many levels!  Excellent hotel!  From the always good Marriott bed to the attentiveness of the staff as they go out of their way to assist you. The breakfast in the morning is very good with several choices and the Manager's Reception in the evening with the beer and wine is a nice added touch.  As a business traveler, I like to look for hotels just like this.  its all good.  I  have a couple of more weeks to spend in the OKC area and I already have my reservations for this hotel.Very clean hotel. Decent rates for a suite and full breakfast in the morning. Convenient to the Interstates too. Friendly staff.Excellent brand new hotel, with mini-suites complete with microwave and refrigerator. The customer service shines.  One of the few Springhill Suites that offers a free mini-dinner with free wine/beer, and the complimentary breakfast exceeds most Springhill Suite locations.  The location is convenient to shopping (Wal-mart, Best Buy, OfficeMax, etc) and a number of fast food restauants, but the surrounding atmosphere is ""parking lot"" without a hint of green. Convenient to downtown and the airport. I knocked it down one star, however, because they don't provide an airport shuttle until 6am. I was forced to take a cab ($14+tip).  I counted over 35 flights before 7AM - they have no business being an airport hotel without shuttle service early in the AM.Very awesome hotel! Very clean! Very nice staff! I would recommend this hotel to everybody!Had a group of 16 stay here for 14 days and the guest services were above and beyond what you would expect.  Although it wasn't five star accommodations we were all treated as though we were. They made us feel at home and were very personal. Spoke to us using our first names. Definitely would stay here again.",,,,,"['overall', 'hotel', 'pretty', 'great', 'location', 'places', 'eat', 'shop', 'well', 'within', 'walking', 'distance', 'room', 'rates', 'average', 'area',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/motel-6-oklahoma-city-3,Motel 6,2.0,$,13,"Definitely one of the nicest motel 6's we've stayed in. The rooms clean, the staffs friendly - what more could we ask for! Only gripe is a burn hole in the top blanket - but se la vie. Would stay again!Also they have a nifty room service option!We went to get a room and 1st of all their internet is down. Okay. So we decide to take the room anyway since we are exhausted. As I sign in, Patrick the front desk clerk says he needs my disabled husband's ID. Okay, back out to the truck in the rain. Hubby for some reason had put it in the suitcase which was under everything else. I tell clerk, I have a pic of it on my phone. NOPE. Wont work.So we just decided to leave and go somewhere else where there is internet. Unfortunately (or fortunately) the hotels/motels in the area was pretty much booked because of a big event in the area (and we have a pet with us so it limited our choices). By accident, we found STUDIO 6 (a division of the same corporation), almost same price with free internet) and only $10 for pet. Overall the cost was about $5 diff when you figure in the cost at Motel 6 for internet.  and they had 2 rooms left!!!! (so we got our King size bed on the bottom floor!)STUDIO 6 is nice, clean, updated furnishsings, kitchen, fridge etc. So over all thanks Patrick the front desk clerk at MOTEL 6 on S, Meridian for being so unbelievably rude and unhelpful! With out you, we would never have found STUDIO 6!This is the nicest motel 6 we ever checked into. The room is very clean, modern with a flat screen and have hard wood floor. Front desk lady was nice. We been driving for 400 miles so it's nice to get to relax in a nice room for once.Ok so mixed reviews about this motel 6. It looks very clean and actually smelled good. The rooms have laminate flooring instead of carpet, which is nice. Front office staff was friendly. Decent shower water pressure/ temperature. Heating/air conditioner worked well. Flat screen TV.  However, my husband was checking the room over and found a used syringe and some kind powdery substance residue tucked behind the television... If not for that, would have given 5 starsNope is all I have to say about this place. Shady area, shady people all around. Ro smelled of smoke, pinesol and pet urine, AC was touching the right side of the bed. On the plus side it was only $50 to have sheets that you could not tell if they were dirty or permanently stained. I have seen worse but not a great experience for my first night in OK.Checked in today. Pounding on walls til 5pm. Kids running along sidewalk yelling. Hooker walking the parking lot trying to get my attention. 1980s decor with one Queen bed. No ice bucket, plastic cups or coffee maker. Trash left out and blowing in front of room. Tv is snowy..We arrived around 11 pm, staff was nice, our car was full of things, they had security walking around (made us feel comfortable that no one was going to break into our car)... Room was good, clean and I look for the strength of water pressure coming out of the shower head to hit my body and wash away the sweat after 12 hrs of driving, was awesome water pressure !!! I've been to rich hotels were water flows like someone's pissing softly on you... The reason I give this place 3 stars; fucking jackass construction and painters began to work at 7 am !!!!!!!!!! Are u fucking kidding me !?!? The rep at the desk should not had placed us in a room knowing that work was going to be done in other rooms around us !!! Erica saw how ticked off and sleepy we (as a family were), and was able to help us out with a refund for the night ! Erica and I both agreed that noise in OKC is allowed from 9 am to 9 pm... These jackasses seemed not to care.Pros:*Old guy at front desk was friendly and helpful. When the first two keys for my room did not work, he gave me the room right next door.*Pets stay free*Cops were there handcuffing some negro, which is ALWAYS amusing Cons:*expensive for a motel 6. A dump like this should not cost $50.*The 1990s called and want their CRT television back*Channel lineup was worse than rabbit ears*No shampoo, toothbrush, or toothpaste available without paying $2.50*Creepy guy from room next door asked me if I had any drugs when I stepped out for my cooler. It seemed like he'd already had plenty of drugs in past decades. Apparently because my license plates are registered in the same state that he once lived in, we must be friends and I must be his new dealer.*Don't bother with a blacklight on the bed unless you feel like checking out early and filing a chargebackThis was the second motel six I stayed at on my 2,300 mile journey. It will also be my last, as I do not intend to travel with cats again(They hate it)BAD! BAD! BAD! At LEAST upgrade to super-eight.So bad, I didn't sleep all night. Nasty tiny room, with no water pressure; I could barely brush my teeth. People hanging out all over made me wonder whether my car would still be there in the morning. People screaming and yelling at all hours of the night. The shower would not drain! Ripped pillow cases and cigar smoke lingering. How many ways can I spell disturbing?! I should have slept in my car!Ick! Loud place, no water pressure, no wifi, concave bed, lawn made of thorns that plyers can't remove from shoes. Overall dirtyWish there was a zero star.  This place really needs to be updated.  I wish I would have looked at the room before hand.  The grounds of the property are disgusting once you get away from the office, especially the stairs.... disgusting.  I'm disappointed in the motel 6 brand at this location. Giving one star only because the guy that comes on at 11 in the office was very friendly.  The guy before that,  not so much. ... had an attitude.Clean room, clean pool, friendly staff, NO MILITARY DISCOUNT.Well, grubby sheets, two people getting arrested outside the door. To top it all off, a gerbil in the room, a gerbil! A feral gerbil at that which looked like something out of a animal vampire movie, otherwise, awesome.",,,,,"['definitely', 'nicest', 'motel', 'rooms', 'clean', 'staffs', 'friendly', 'ask', 'gripe',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-oklahoma-city-airport-oklahoma-city,La Quinta Inn Oklahoma City Airport,2.0,$$,34,"VERY run down &amp; filthy.  I only stayed here as I got stuck in the middle of a ice storm while traveling.  Most pet friendly hotels in a 25 mile radius were booked, I should have known when I was able to get a room here right away.The room's carpet was very dirty, the bathroom floor was filthy and the desk chair &amp; microwave had pieces of tape holding them together (seriously).  Rooms are exterior &amp; was loud as it bordered some type of outdoor amusement center (my room faced the batting cages) and they played top 40 music over a outdoor speaker system.  Bed was VERY comfortable.  I went down for breakfast but the food area was inundated with linemen that were staying there working on the ice storm issues in the area, I elected to skip the free breakfast.*12/10/2015 - I was contacted by La Quinta staff regarding my review left on a survey that was emailed to me regarding this stay. The tape that was on chair &amp; microwave had no functional purpose. It in fact was not holding either 'together', it was placed on each for no apparent reason &amp; staff was not aware it was there. Apologies were made &amp; I was informed that LQ location is scheduled for renovation.Was fortunate enough to have my company put our team in this ShitHole...First impressions are generally right.Worn out and thick with smell of heavy detergents to mask problems.OMG!!!!!!  If I could give negative stars to a hotel, this would be the first!!!!!  This hotel should be condemned.  I checked in and I was given a room with what I think was mold in the vents (Room 143)..  The second room appears to have the same (Room 209).Breakfast was cream beef served from a crock pot with no eggs.......I would give this zero stars if I could. This is probably the worst hotel I have stayed at. My two colleagues and myself stayed here on a week night because of a day long meeting in OKC.The hotel is incredibly run down from the outside. And as a female, exterior entrances don't feel the safest to me. However, my male colleague was in the room directly next to me which made me feel a little bit more comfortable.There's a large amount of exterior noise -- whether it's from the nearby highway or the mini golf park. As for the room -- I was incredibly frustrated with the quality of the room. I was allegedly booked in a smoke free room but it reeked of cigarette smoke. There were no mini fridges or complimentary toiletry items. The room did not appear very clean, I was concerned about walking around barefoot and wish I had brought flip flops to wear in the shower. My colleague reported that when she walked into her room there were no working lightbulbs in any of the lights. When she called the front desk, they only brought two replacements for her entire room. The bed was uncomfortable. The toilet plumbing ran every 60 - 90 minutes when regularly woke me up.The breakfast hardly qualified as basic. No protein options -- not even hardboiled eggs.We were supposed to stay for two more nights but checked out the next morning to find better arrangements.This hotel is DISGUSTING. The room reek of cigarette, floor is sticky, it's in the absolute ghetto.. No fridge, outdated furnishing, the whole building looks like a CHEAP brothel. On top of that, the pool my princess waited ALL day for is CLOSED!!  Never LEFT a hotel after checking in but we're going to this time. Ugh. *vomit* can't run away from this place fast enough!!Had a great stay for the evening I was there.  The hotel room came with a kingsize bed, desk, chair, microwave and fridge.   Vending machines were stocked and not overpriced.Bedding was clean as well as the bathroom.  The continental breakfast was enjoyable and the business desk let me print my boarding passes before my flight.Front desk staff upon check-in and checkout were very helpful.  Everyone seemed eager to help guests even with the smallest requests.Shuttle wasn't running on Saturday but the front desk called a taxi at no cost to the guest.I just walked it with my two kids and I'm Scared... This place is the shit of shits. STAY AWAY!!!I wish I could give zero stars! I found a French fry (old and moldy) in the tissue box, a cockroach near the computer chair, and we got cussed out by the night shift front desk when we filed a noise compliant. AVOID!!Roach Motel!!Don't stay here.  Aside from it taking a half an hour to check in in the middle of the night, there were black smudges on our sheets and garbage on our floors!  When we walked in, the room smelled like a bug bomb... And rightly so!  There were dead roaches on our floors!  After picking up the first three, I was grossed out and couldn't pick up the remaining six.  If it wasn't so late and we didn't have a dog with us, I would have stayed somewhere else.  Again, don't even bother with this place.  If I could have given a half a star, I would have.  When I called to complain, I couldn't get anyone to speak to.  I also took pictures of the roaches on the floor, but there is no one at La Quinta corporate willing to take my complaint.  Go somewhere else.Outside, you hear the freeway 24/7. The TV had a 2/4th burned out. The toilet was clogged. Otherwise, very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was nice selection. Staff friendly.No, this isn't a luxury hotel, but it's one of my favorite places to go with my dog Oreo. They have a large courtyard surrounded by hotel rooms that is perfect for walking your dog. Most dog-friendly hotels have very little grass for your dog. The internet is slow at night but it is free. My room had always been clean and smoke free. And the price is $76 for a king with desk. Free breakfast. Standard fare. It's also close to the outlet malls !!During a cross country road trip, my dad and I decided to stay here... BIG mistake! We had stayed at La Quintas for the whole trip, since they're pet friendly, but this was definitely the SKETCHIEST one!First of all, we had been driving for over 8 hours and were very tired. We were driving up to the hotel and all of the sudden a man jumped out of the center median in front of our car! It was the middle of the night and he was wearing all black clothes! My dad had to slam on the brakes to avoid hitting him. Not La Quinta's fault, but just the beginning of a creepy evening.So we check in and while the employee had initially seemed a little rude, she warmed up and was actually really friendly (it was late at night, so she was probably just tired). On the way up to the room, other visitors were hanging out on the balconies, smoking and talking across the hallway. I had to take my dog out a couple of times to relieve himself and on the way back to the room, I noticed that in the parking lot next to the hotel, a man was being arrested. The lights were flashing and you could hear, ""Put you hands on your head and walk backwards towards the vehicle."" Again, not La Quinta's fault, but an indication of the type of area it's in.The room was the most outdated room we had stayed in during our 5-night trip. We could hear every noise out side our door, which woke up our dog every hour of the night. They did have a security guard on patrol, which did make me feel a little bit better, but overall it was the worst La Quinta we had ever been to. Sorry!Honestly one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a hotel.  While the staff (especially Miss Sarah Jane) was very nice, the overall appearance and upkeep of the facility was beyond lacking.  The also accept pets with no additional charge which was a huge plus for us as we were traveling with our dog.Upon arrival the presence of an insect issue was very apparent.  Once in the room, the carpets were soaking wet (as a result of clean up after pest treatment) and about 20+ dead crickets, roaches and other undetermined bugs were strewn about the room.  Never mind the fact that the window on the facility appear to have been installed sometime in the early 50's.  Single paned and not very secure.  There was an older gentleman patrolling the property, but he really didn't make me feel like he would be a deterrent if something were to go down.I contacted the front desk to share my frustration with the room.  I told Miss Sarah Jane that I was far too tired to switch rooms, but felt she should know of the lack of attention to cleanliness in the room.  She seemed to be aware of an existing issue and offered to comp the room and have the staff relocate our belongings to another, interior, room.  Thanks to her quick attention to my concerns I was able to get a few short hours of rest in before having to hit the road the following day.I have not yet received the credit against my account for the comp'd room... but called and the staff that was there today acknowledged the comp on my account.  I am confident it will come through.Lesson learned here: USE YELP WHEN BOOKING ROOMS!!!Wish we had read reviews ..we were tired after long drive. This was the filthiest room we have ever encountered. Not only filthy, but outlets not working, internet spotty and therefore not usable, TV needed new remote.  Rug icky, no way I would walk bear footed on it...gives La Quinta a bad name. AVOID At all costs!I had never been to Oklahoma before and booked a room here during my cross country drive. As soon as I saw the hotel I was scared to death. They gave us a key and we headed over and realized it was outdoors like a motel! We immediately went to ask for a room inside the hotel. They changed us to a second floor room which was no better. There was no elevator and the hotel was totally run down. I knew there would be no way I could sleep there so we asked to switch to a different la quinta. The woman working at the desk was rude and unwelcoming as well. Do not stay here!!This place is a joke. I dealt with 2 people trying to check in. I booked the trip in advance and gave them a credit card which they wouldn't accept because it was new and didn't have a name on it since it had been stolen.  The woman I dealt with was pleasant but the guy was rude.Worst ever.  Affordable but wow.... if both beds sink in the middle they need to changed... Obviously these beds have many, many, many miles on them.....Damn... must have been a hell of a time.No thank you!  Went down the street to another hotel.La Quinta I believe is Spanish for smoke infused bedsheets. This place sucks as bad as any hotel I have ever been in.Stayed here one night on Sept. 2. Room entrance opened to the outside. When I approached it for the first time there were people sitting in chairs drinking beer just down the way, lending an unsavory feeling to it.Room clean but very basic. Attached there is a saloon which serves lunch and dinner. If you're not familiar with Oklahoma, smoking in establishments like this is still allowed, and this place ranked about the highest in terms of smoke.I ordered a hamburger and it was very good.The room I was in allowed some noise to come in. The hotel is on a busy avenue near US Rt 40 and there is a good deal of steady rumbling.Shower was okay.Breakfast was a very sparse affair. Just basic cereal, coffee and coice of apple or banana. Parking was easy. I was able to park right outside my room.We tried this hotel because we had never stayed at one before. Surprisingly good for the monies.  The room was clean, with wi fi.  The breakfast was tremenduous - waffle, hot dog, bagels, cup cakes, eggs, coffee, tea, juices, etc.  We did get our monies worth. Definitely will try to stay at this chain for our travel.","Poor customer service and dead bugs in the room. Really gross we ended up ditching the place.So, I have never stayed at a La Quinta but I wanted to give it a try. Didn't know anything about the chain, but I was impressed with most of it. The front desk staff was VERY friendly and helpful. The room was clean, with a nice tv and free wifi. The continental breakfast was ok...not the best, but not the worst. It's better than a Days Inn, but not as good as a Holiday Inn. The only downfall is when they first gave us room keys, it was to a room where the beds were completely stripped, and not made, so they had to put us in another room.The worst La Quinta we stayed in yet. We have stayed in 20 La Quinta's in the last 60 days and the worst one to date. Roach in the shower, toilet seat was dirty, shower didn't drain, hot water ran out, and the ""non smoking room"" want non smoking. Stay at any other La Quinta's but not here.We checked in late due to a late flight arrival, we were greeted by friendly staff, our room was upgraded. The breakfast was very good. The free shuttle service was great, the drivers friendly, they take you to several places around the hotel. For the price we were very pleased with our stay and will definitely return if ever in OKC again.I have stayed in this hotel many times due to work.The staff here is very friendly and all of the rooms are very nice and clean. i have also read the reviews about roaches in the tubs and etc. however I have not experienced this. Also there is a quaint little bar with a country home feeling to it where everyone is friendly. All in all this is a great place to stay and I highly recommend this hotel to everyone.Not up to the standards of other LaQuintas. Room was clean but really needs major remodel.This place is disgusting. My husband and I had pulled a long day driving in from Amarillo and were eager to get to our room and relax. We got to La Quinta around 7pm and checked into our room. I was waiting in the car with our kids and dogs when my husband went into the room, only to find that it was still dirty. He went back to the front desk and complained and we were downgraded from a king to a double full and they offered to take $15 off our bill. No thanks, we'd made these reservations almost a month in advance. We cancelled our reservations and stayed at another La Quinta in the area that got us into a room without issue and was probably the nicest we have stayed in. After talking to locals in the area, they said this is a pretty sketchy location anyway. Glad we didn't stay!!4/19/2012 Just for the record, I never did receive the twice-promised free night coupon. Everything about this property speaks poorly of the La Quinta brand.The room was disgusting. If my wife and I didn't arrive at midnight after 17 hours of driving, I would have demanded a refund. Dead cockroaches everywhere, and the bathroom hadn't been cleaned from the last guest. You have been warned.We are totally loyal to La Quintas! They are clean, the service is friendly and offer more perks than other reasonably priced hotels.dirty dirtyStayed here for 10 days while working the fair. They forgot towels..we told them...next day no.pillow cases...we told them...next day found hair.all.over the floor...we told them. Last day our keys didn't work and the room wasn't cleaned at all. Worst hotel have stayed in. Oh and the day before last security gaurd was talking so loud outside the room we woke up at 4 in the morning. I'd rather have mentally disabled people work bc they would do a better job. Thanks la quinta. DONT EVER COME HERE!!!!!!We stayed in this La Quinta last night in Oklahoma City. Our son found an empty Coke bottle, a tennis ball, and a poker chip under the beds. The bathroom floor and shower curtain were dirty, there was no hot water in the morning at 6:30 am, and there were cockroaches in the bathroom. We also needed help opening the door because the door handle needed to be adjusted. It required slamming it down quickly in order for the door to  open. I told the desk clerk about it and she said that yes, they were having boiler issues, followed with a smile. I tried sending La Quinta my concerns but couldn't get past their online form.The hotel was fine - we weren't looking for anything fancy.  We stayed one night, were planning to stay the following night downtown to catch a concert, and then return to this hotel for our last night.  When we checked out, we wanted to walk down the street to get some lunch before heading downtown.  Having been traveling for the holidays, we had quite a bit of luggage to carry all around to find a spot to eat so we asked the woman at the front desk if she could hold our bags for about an hour while we got lunch.  It seemed like her favorite phrase of the moment was ""I can't do that"" or ""We don't do that"" because she said it to us and to the next two people coming over with questions.  I've traveled around the world and have never been told by any hotel/hostel/bungalow/campsite staff ""We can't do that"" without being offered a secondary option.  To me, that is terrible service and it makes me want to cancel our second night's reservations.  In short, the staff (except for the shuttle drivers) is exceptionally unfriendly and I wouldn't stay here again.",,,,"['run', 'amp', 'filthy', 'stuck', 'middle', 'ice', 'storm', 'traveling', 'pet',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/springhill-suites-oklahoma-city-quail-springs-oklahoma-city-2,SpringHill Suites Oklahoma City Quail Springs,3.0,$$,15,"Off the main interstate (40) and it was a lot less expensive !Staff was very friendly and casual, gave me the AAA discountVery nice place, great room very clean and comfy, trendy !. Breakfast in the morning, it was great.We love Spring Hill Suites...Terrible experience!!! The first room had a broken shower. The second room has wallpaper falling off. The front lobby has huge box fans everywhere because the AC is broken. I haven't seen a repair man all weekend. The front desk is rude. I've never experienced such a terrible hotel. @Marriott this is a major brand detractor!!!As a follow up, I worked with corporate @Marriott and I was told they would stand by their hotel and the management. I partnered with upper management at the hotel and they did nothing to satisfy us - they didn't even offer a solution. As consumers, we vote with our dollar. I will never stay nor recommend this property to anyone!!!Complaint to let you know about the service given today at the Marriott located at 3201 W. Memorial Road, Oklahoma City, OK. 1.  My daughter XXXXX XXXXXXX  reserved a room for two nights at this location.  When she arrived she was told her room was cancelled.  She advised the staff she had not cancelled the room.  After long deliberation the staff person stated no Underwood had called and cancelled the room.  This lends me to believe someone on the staff made an error.  They would not fix the issue and even went as far as to be rude and condescending to her.  This was in my presence.  I will go on to mention my daughter is in the latter stages of pregnancy and had driven 10 hours to get to this location.  2.  When I made an attempt to obtain the email address of someone I could complain to the staff member, male, not manager became confrontational/ rude with me and did not handle the situation in a professional manner.  Once again this is unacceptable.  This happened just moments ago.First off their a/c was down or something in the lobby making it uncomfortably hot! Second, when I tried to check in I was told that the room I booked (double 2 room suite) was unavailable so we (2 adults 3 kids) were booked into 2 separate king rooms on each side of the elevators. I'll admit it wasn't as noisy as I thought it would be but still we were separated.Third, once we got to our rooms I noticed that the door handle in our room made it difficult to open the door. Idk how to explain it other than you had to force the handle down hard. Also our toilet kept running and that was kind of annoying. Oh and wifi, slow!Fourth, their breakfast kind of sucked. I'm a person whose kind of ok with boxed food but come on, no one likes watery scrambled eggs. Also don't forget, their a/c wasn't on/working in the lobby making the breakfast area pretty warm.Good reviews of the hotel. Parking wasn't bad and the pool area also not bad.I've stayed at the Springhill Suited at the Moore location. We enjoyed our stay at that location and and was really looking forward to another stay at Springhill. Sadly our stay at the Springhill memorial location was not that great!Nice clean hotel but.  If they give you a room by the elevators , ask for another room further away, will keep you up all night.  They must do better on their breakfast, absolutely horrible. Almost went next door to the Holiday Inn to eat instead. On my last day  they only had scrambled eggs and nothing else hot.  Room windows need to be able to block out the lights at night, the shear  curtains just don't do the trick.  this will be my last stay at that particular hotelThis is a nice hotel. I was very impressed. The rooms are nice and very clean. The service is good. The breakfast was okay. The wifi is free. We were really impressed with one aspect of the service. They have a discount for people who are there because family is at a nearby hospital. They asked why we were in town and when I told them for my mother at the hospital, they gave a big discount even though we did know about it or ask for it.Aww - sad that this is the first review for this hotel.  Without too much further delay:Location: 3 out of 5This place isn't ultra convenient if you're flying into OKC, but if you have friends and family that live to the north, it's in a pretty convenient location.  Be aware that Memorial is not a toll road, but instead it runs parallel to it.  Depending on where you're coming from, you may have to cross the toll road, and take a left, as either side of Memorial are 1 way at this point.  Honestly though, it isn't that tough to figure out.Amenities: 4 out of 5Nothing to complain about here.  The suite we had contained everything that we needed and then some.  The added bonuses I guess are the microwave and the mini fridge.  It's not complete ""suite-esque"" as there was no full kitchenette and no dividing walls or doors in the living area, but no real complaints.  There is a ""living room"" feel with a couch and one wing chair in the suite.Please do check out the daily hot breakfast, though.  By no means is it gourmet, but along with the traditional continental breakfast items there are breakfast patties, eggs with cheese in them, oatmeal, and waffles.  Of course, there is also yogurt, milk, cereal, etc.  There is outdoor parking on premises at no charge.Service: 4 out of 5No complaints here - everyone was friendly and kind, and the breakfast staff was quick to refill items that had dwindled down in numbers.  Pricing: 5 out of 5I PL'ed the price, so I can't really complain.  Not sure what full retail rates are, but for ~50 bucks a night, I was very satisfied with the experience.Overall: 4 out of 5Very satisfied with my stay: rooms were spacious, hotel was clean, people were friendly, there was free parking, the breakfast bar was good, etc. etc.  I would definitely stay here again if I was in the area.I stayed here last week for a business trip, and I found my stay to be very comfortable.  Upon check in, I immediately found the staff to be extremely courteous and helpful.  I can honesty say I received some of the best customer service I've received in quite awhile, including the manager personally taking me to the local mall when the hotel shuttle was already out on a run. The room (#612) was large and well appointed, including a microwave, small fridge, and coffee maker (though I never used it since they offer fresh coffee in the lobby all day). The sheets were nice, and they changed my towels everyday. Breakfast was delicious, consisting of scrambled eggs, a meat dish (changed every day I was there - sausage and potato dish, sausage links, and bacon), oatmeal with standard accompaniments, a variety of bread options, fresh fruit (apples, bananas, cut fruit, strawberries), hard boiled eggs, cheese and deli meat, yogurt, a variety of juices, and coffee/tea. I loved the spread. A co-worker said she saw a waffle iron, but I didn't see it myself since I'm not much of a waffle person. In sum, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Springhill Suites in Quail Springs. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the rooms could use some updating. I would definitely stay here again if my travels bring me back to OKC.The next day we had the breakfast. It was absolutely disgusting. The eggs were instant but chewy!!! Only items were eggs, sausage, cereal and bread! Worse breakfast ever! I will not plan on visiting after the smells and breakfast!Needed a place to stay for a couple of nights and thought this place would do the trick. Checked in quickly, then up to the room. Once we entered, the smell of mold over took us and noticed mold growing on one wall. The front desk quickly gave use another room, upon entering room it just didnt feel very clean and again noticed more mold in the bathroom. We went back to the front desk and just asked to not be charged for the room, because we were leaving. The place looks nice but its a dumpClean rooms, friendly staff and one of the best breakfast in town. They also have a social happy hour every Wednesday with free drinks and snacks. If you are staying at this hotel, you have free access to Golds Gym down, a few blocks down.Marriott, I just left your Arkansas location to check in to this OKC location. I left a horrible review for the AR one and had lost some faith in Marriott BUT the OKC location definitely restored my love for Marriott once again. First of all, this one is immaculately clean. I loved my room - you added small special touches that made it really feel homely. I loved the Wednesday social hour - that was definitely a plus. It was nice to come back at the end of the day for some food and wine/beer compliment of Marriott. The breakfast is warm and yummy. The staff here is awesome but I would like to especially mention the lady that attends to the food area. I spoke with her every morning and realize now that I never asked for her name. Anyways, she was so warm and so nice and it was my pleasure to have a small conversation with her to start the day. She would always ask how I'm doing and to make sure I have a wonderful day - she'll say don't try! One morning, I overheard a guest that was so excited and happy to run into her again that I was amazed to hear a guest feel about staff that way. Nonetheless, she is an asset at this Marriott - Marriott, you need to pay special attention to this lady!!Springhill suites is a very pleasant place to stay.  Rooms are clean, modern, and comfortable, typical of a Marriott property.  The springhill edition has small kitchenettes, minus a stove top.  If you can microwave everything you eat, you'll be just fine.Place is clean, the staff is friendly.  Breakfast is standard hotel fare, nothing outstanding, but a good variety.  Rooms are decent and accommodating to the business traveler.We stayed here for two nights for Easter 2010.  It was a QUIET clean hotel and the service was great in all areas.  It is in a nice location (growing suburban region) close to our destination but finding your way back to the hotel when traveling eastbound took some work (not the hotels fault....just wanted to alert a potential visitor!).  Also, depending on the road you take to the hotel, there may be small toll to pay.....don't depend on the change machines at the toll booth to provide change either!  It only takes $1 &amp; $5 and certainely doesn't always work.",,,,,"['main', 'interstate', 'lot', 'less', 'expensive', 'staff', 'friendly', 'casual', 'gave', 'nice', 'place', 'great', 'room', 'clean',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/red-roof-inn-oklahoma-city,Red Roof Inn,3.5,$$,15,"This place is a very good value. I thought this was a very nice room. There's lots of space with an alcove for a desk, table and chairs, refrigerator and microwave. There's also a seating area with a sofa and coffee table and a nice armchair in front of the TV. The king size bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was was nice.The Wi-Fi is a little slow by contemporary standards. The location is quite noisy. The door shut out a lot of the noise, but if you're a light sleeper you'll want to get a room in the back. Housekeeping and maintenance are not top notch, but perfectly adequate.There is a nearby On the Border restaurant, at McDonalds, Denny's, Circle K. You are very handy to the airportWell back in the area again! Just for the day this time, thankfully they let us check in very very early. Still the same pleasant staff. I believe all the rooms are now all renovated, we got a room we stayed in before and wow the change is very nice! Bed is comfortable and firm, large roomy bathroom, room is clean.5 stars for value. On a cross-country road trip with my fiance and our two dogs, we stayed in mostly Red Roof Inns. Traveling with pets, they were *hands down* the best option for us. Although Red Roofs cost a bit more than other budget motel chains, we found the comfort adequate and the locations very convenient.  This particular location in Oklahoma was the best Red Roof we stayed in. We paid around $55 for a Superior King Room and the value was excellent. The room itself was roomy and the bed very comfortable.If we're crazy enough to do the drive again, we'll definitely return here.Have stayed here the last few yrs that we travel to OKC, very pet friendly, love the premium room, very roomy. My pets love stay there also.This hotel was horrible. Stay away from this area. Police everywhere because is a really dangerous area. The guy in the front desk was extremely rude, and then start asking me personal question, gave me a room in the back that faced a small street where you could hear people passing by. I left 5 minutes after even that the hotel was already payed.Not the best Red Roof we've been to... We only had one towel, the room smelled weird and it didn't seem to be in the safest area. It was, however, staffed by friendly people and had a huge comfortable bed.Hotel equals bed, bathroom and roof, period. A no hassle, no thrills type of establishment. We stayed two nights and at least the a/c worked great. The rooms were dingy and humid. The sheets actually felt damp the first night we got in.  I was surprised to find a microwave and fridge in the room which was a plus. Not a bad place to stay for the price, $53/night.Quick update: After calling <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> and complaining to their customer service, the situation has been handled.  The woman I spoke to assured me that the hotel always has the ability to cancel a reservation made with a third party site, and to refund charges.  The <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> rep emailed two other managers, explaining the situation, and got me the refund I deserved.  So, thank you to <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> for handling the situation quickly and professionally, and to the manager of Red Roof Inn who finally gave in and decided to refund my money.Room was clean, but it's all down hill from here. Got woken up very early by construction right out side the room, and the room above (it sounded like a battle going on upstairs). Also by 9:30 in the morning, we are already being rushed to check out.I stayed here last week during the freezing cold with my toddler, they gave us an upstairs room..had to climb up the stairs with a toddler and lots of bags so that was kind of annoying. I was relieved that its next to a dennys which is nice. The bed was not comfortable but I tolerated it, I did not like how the bathroom had glass door..definitely not safe with a running toddler. The toilet made a loud squealing noise when flushed, very annoying when you're trying to not wake a child.  The TV worked well and got a few channels.  The chairs in the room were a nice addition except one of them was broken. Other than that it was clean and was near the freeway. I wouldn't stay there again though.The room was just plain dirty -- the carpets had debris on them, the desk was smeared with yellow sticky stuff. The bedding had a cigarette burn,and  the curtains had holes. Not enough working electrical outlets. If we hadn't been so road-weary, we would have checked out. To the motel's credit, they gave us a discount on our one night, noting that they were attempting a rehab. A much needed rehab. Avoid this place until it is improved.Clean, roomy. Cheerfully honored a coupon, so a very good value. ($44 inc tax). Would stay there again.stayed here during our drive from cali~virginia...w/2 dogs.. not a bad place at all..very impressed w/the cleanliness &amp; courtesy of the desk clerks..also, they give a military discount on top of their already cheap prices!! &amp; there's a yummy chinese place that delivers to ya (the menu is in the room).. they have a fridge in the room w/freezer (for your snacks/drinks), a fan in the bathroom-always a plus ;)   hot coffee in the lobby (they have coffee maker in your hotel rm, but it's not too tasty!)  overall, if you have pets, &amp; need a clean, comfy room in a pinch~stay here. would stay again for sure, but i don't foresee another trip like that in my future... but good job RED ROOF  :)    oh, and they sell bottled water in the lobby for i think $2 and was a pretty good size too.. cheaper than the gas stations!! wooo hooooooI stay at Red Roof all the time because they are pet friendly without a deposit, and you earn points for your stays. The room was clean, with all the required amenities. I stayed in a business king which was very spacious for me and my dog. The room had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. The bed was o.k. and the t.v. was big and received many of the local cable channels. You are within walking distance to Denny's McDonald's and Shorty Smalls is right next door. The staff was friendly and helpful. They had coupons for Shorty Smalls. You also get free wi-fi. Be sure to ask for the log-in  info at the front desk. I say for the $55 I paid (with my AAA discount) the room was a  good deal.",,,,,"['place', 'good', 'value', 'thought', 'nice', 'room', 'lots', 'space', 'alcove', 'desk', 'table', 'chairs',

Whoops, but the lady at the front (and I'm sorry I forgot your name) offered to give me a ride to the correct hotel. I was somewhat disappointed because the hotel was beautiful, and I really wanted to stay there:) Thank you!!! Your dedicated to customer service shows, and it made my day.This is a very beautiful hotel on the inside and my room for two was HUGE. Separate bathroom/bedroom/living room. It could of comfortably slept 6. Everything was super clean and the beds were unbelievably soft. Like sleeping on a cloud. The only thing that I didn't like was the wifi never worked on my phone and the location wasn't as close as I thought but still pretty close! PLUS they have complimentary drinks from 5:30-7:30! I got 2 sangrias and 2 vodka cranberries before it closed down. TALK ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE. DEFINITELY recommend coming here if you're in the okc area!  (If wifi isn't for you it'd be an easy 5 star)Excellent staff and beautiful property about 15-20 min from airport and 3 min from university. They have lots of conference space. I was impressed with the hotel suite/room, as it included a fridge, microwave, countertop, mini sink, a beautiful big dining table, two flat screen televisions (1 in family room and 1 in bedroom), and a pull out sofa. The decor was modern retro and looked clean. They offer complimentary made-to-order breakfast (which I wish was available for room service much earlier than 11am) and a complementary happy hour each evening. I'd definitely stay here again.Fantastic hotel!  Free breakfast has everything you could want including made to order items!  Rooms are spacious  and clean, very modern decor. Lobby is beautiful.  I'm assuming it must be a newer hotel. A king size room with hhonors runs about $120. If you work for a large company ask if they have a discounted rate for that company.  We paid $105. And it's dog friendly! !!Well color me happy, there's an amazing new hotel, with easy access to all best parts of OKC, a perfect place for me to put my friends and family when they come to town! Seriously, it's gorgeous. Modern and sleek, with wonderful, wide corridors and beautiful details all around. I haven't stayed in a guest room yet, though I plan to sometime soon. I was here for a meeting in one of the spacious and well-appointed board-style meeting rooms. It was perfect for our meeting, and while we were there we also ordered a wonderful lunch. We had a great server who took really good care of us, and I would absolutely host a meeting here again sometime. I am so glad there's such a nice place to stay. Especially for families in town for medical concerns, it's nice to think that at least they would have such a nice place to relax so close to the medical center.What a surprise. This place exceeded expectations in every way. The staff were all beyond friendly-from the cleaning staff to cooks to front desk staff. Found myself happily having conversations with all them. When I told the bell hop about what a great stay we had, he said something like ""I'm glad you liked it as much as I do. They are great people to work for."" How awesome is that?! Places that treat their employees we'll always impress me so much. Also there was an Unbelievable and unexpected free (!) evening cocktail and snack hour, which was so awesome. I needed a margarita after a long afternoon in the minivan. And they have the best free hotel breakfast I've ever had. Omelettes and flap jacks to order. Fresh fruit. And about a hundred other things. There is also a Super nice pool and fitness room (no hot tub though).All that and I haven't even gotten to the room yet, which was new, clean, and spacious. We have two kids under 5 so we took advantage of the frig and microwave in the room. Honestly we will be looking for excuses to get back to okc to stay here again. Just so nice to see a business putting so much attention into guest experience and customer service. We felted like staying there was a real treat. Plus it's in a great location. Took us just ten minutes to get to the zoo and horseraces. And when we left we zipped right back on the highway in less than five. We travel a lot. A lot. And this was by far the best hotel experience I can remember. Wish I could give them a few more stars.Excellent hotel! For such a reasonable price, I was amazed at the rooms and amenities. The beds are great, the rooms are modern and spotless, the complimentary breakfast is awesome, and the staff is very helpful! Will def be back:)One of the best hotels with a full breakfast menu &amp; made to order omelets.  Worth the cost &amp; value.  Oh, &amp; this place is new, just built.Great spot near entertainment and restaurants. Very modern, awesome breakfast and cocktail hour, and great service. Wouldn't choose anything else.Beautiful modern hotel, shuttle service to and from brick town, staff friendly and helpful, room service quick and great coconut cream pie!! Thank YouAmazing and new hotel. Evening reception is great. Thank you for having warm water in the pool. In the past we had inside hotel pools with cold water. Couldn't even swim in it. Will definitely stay here again. We didn't want to go home.Hotel is nice and very new.  I am leaving a poor review due to leaving a phone charger in the room that was missing after the room was cleaned.  Inquired with the front desk twice about the missing charger and received no help.Stayed here for a business trip. The hotel was clean and the service was fantastic. Everyone really went above and beyond to make our trip enjoyable. Highly recommend!New hotel with a great location close to town.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Two in particular: Mike (maintenance engineer) and Ellis (waiter) were helpful and very personable.  The free breakfast buffet was amazing and bountiful, sometimes forcing us to skip lunch.  Room was spacious and quite comfortable.",,,,,"['review', 'written', 'thank', 'lady', 'front', 'desk', 'gave', 'ride', 'hotel', 'supposed', 'dropped', 'worker', 'happened', 'drop', 'wrong', 'hotel',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/wyndham-garden-oklahoma-city-oklahoma-city,Wyndham Garden Oklahoma City,3.0,$$,19,"The room...no complaints. The staff....well....disappointing.  I got stuck there during the latest snow storm over Christmas break. I paid for 3 nights because I anticipated that the hotel would get overbooked due to the impending storm.  I was right. Well, that didn't stop the front desk team from in activating my room keys EVERY SINGLE DAY ""just in case"" I had left without telling them. I mean, I prepaid...?Also, buffet breakfast is only offered during sat and sun. However they have a bar! And are right across from a decent restaurant.We ended up here as part of a wedding block.  The proximity to the airport was great, but overall, the area was worn down, as was the hotel.At first I was very happy with this hotel.   Then came breakfast.  The sales manager was taking ""breakfast tickets"" which they gave us at check in the night before.   My husband and sons were there about 15 minutes ahead of us and when we have her our tickets she looked at the sign in sheet and said you should only have 4 breakfasts.  I told her they gave us 5 when we checked in.   Honestly we didn't even have to ask the desk clerk just handed me one for each of us.   She said well I'll let you have the extra breakfast today, which didn't go well for me because we're staying for multiple days.   After breakfast I went to the front desk to clarify and it turns out she's the sales manager.   During the conversation her story changed from your room (a suite by the way) usually gets 4 tickets to your room usually gets 2 tickets.   Why would a room advertised as accommodating 5 people come with 4 much less 2 breakfasts?   We found out from the desk clerk that additional breakfasts are only $5.  Why would a sales manager make such a big deal about that.  Her demeanor was bad the whole time she never smiled even when we first approached her, and honestly should have been able to fix such a small issue with minimal effort.  The breakfast was very standard nothing you don't get at any other hotel.I booked this room through hotwire for a one night stay.  As I was pulling into the parking lot, I noticed that there were ALOT of cars, and I do mean ALOT.  I walked inside the hotel and immediately noticed that there were a TON of kids, which made me a little annoyed to be honest.  I was greeted by a nice lady in which she took me through the check in process.  While I was checking in, I asked the lady why there were so many kids at the hotel in which she replied that there was a cheerleading competition going on.  I then asked the lady if I could be as far away as possible from the kids due to the fact that I did not wanna hear kids running and screaming in the hallway all night.  She agreed to put me in a room far away in which I was grateful.NOTE:  Please be advised that this particular hotel is near the airport and surrounded by other hotels, HOWEVER, the area appears to be a little sketchy, so please be a little alert if arriving in the evening or late night.  NOW ON TO THE ROOM:The room was......a little disappointing to be honest.  I booked a 3.5 star hotel and would think that hotel would have been a lot better than I expected.  Now when I stay at hotels, I become super paranoid, due to the fact that I'm so afraid that I'm gonna get eaten alive by bed bugs, come across bodily fluids, etc., so as SOON as I opened the door, I sat my suitcase on the luggage rack and IMMEDATELY stripped the sheets off of the bed to check for bed bugs.  I found no bed bugs which was a huge relief for me.  Next, I checked the bathroom.  The bathroom was tiny and dark which made me a little uneasy.  It kinda reminded me of a bathroom out of a horror movie.  Also, the bathroom door was starting to dry rot.As I'm looking around the room I notice that there was a gap between the carpet and the baseboards; you can see the concrete beneath.  Looks like the room had a bad carpet job.  So at the end of the day, the room was okay, nothing special.  Would I PERSONALLY stay at this hotel again? No, but again, this is my own personal opinion.I stayed at this hotel on December 21st, I picked this place because it had a deal on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a> . We were greeted by a nice man whenever we walked in. I continued to give him my first &amp; last name since I booked the hotel online before we arrived. He gave us our room key and on we went. We get to our room to see that it was connected to another hotel room! We could hear them perfectly and I would have been more annoyed but we left to go have a bite at Chilis by the hotel. Whenever we got back I called the front desk and asked about the time breakfast was served in the morning &amp; he responded 6-10. The next morning we woke up &amp; went downstairs for breakfast &amp; they asked for our 'breakfast ticket' what!? I talked to a employee not once but twice and was never told about this &amp; whenever I asked the front desk it was because I didn't spend enough on my hotel room. Wow! I spent $75 on my hotel room you would think that would be included. I left extremely annoyed and I will never be back!Check in was terrible. I waited for several minutes while two people helped one group. Finally, I was asked what they could help me with, only to be interrupted by another guest wanting to move his car to a more ""well lit"" area due to a run in with someone earlier. The manager denied his request, stating that it would not be an issue for him. We are in the middle of some terrible weather in Oklahoma, so I was going to give a bit of benefit of the doubt. After reading the other reviews, I see this is not isolated. The hotel layout is terrible, and the room numbering is not intuitive. This is very frustrating when you are lugging a heavy luggage cart in the evening. Which you will be doing alone as none of the front desk people can help you. Lovely. This is an airport area hotel, and the area is very sketchy. There is absolutely no way I would ever stay in this hotel again.The pits. Dirty depressing. Rude. Food like in the army.  This is a mid-century modern hotel from the 5-60's.  Would be amazing if restored.   Carpets filthy.  Room over-scented with air freshener.  I was 15 minutes late for breakfast - when I asked the waitress if my card was still goos she grabbed out of my hand.Signage for non-intuitive room numbering is nonexistent.  You think they'd tell you that '300' rooms are on 2 when you get a key, and that the elevator is hidden in a back hallway.We had 9 rooms, so you'd think they'd at least be gracious.  Even at $99.00 it's a bummer.Got the blind deal.Probably the best hotel on the strip.Area looked sketchy. There was some sort of car event happening so there were cops pulling over people EVERYWHERE - it looked like an episode of CopsStaff was wonderful.Room was nicer than the building/area made it seem it could be.Pillows were surprising small but surprisingly comfortable (bed was comfortable also).Nice bang for the buck.I tried to like it!When we drove up it is an ok looking hotel, nothing really eye-appealing or detouring. I went to check in, the two ladies behind desk stopped what they where doing to jump and help me. The lady was friendly and got me all checked. I confirmed a room with two queen beds, which she said yes. The hotel was clean and looked very nice. A nice surprise to what you think when you drive up. As stated in other reviews the layout is not your typical hotel, but pretty common with Wyngate. Just takes a second to get your bearings.  This is pretty much the end of the positive experience.We get to the room and see it is a king bed and sofa sleeper. Ok 5 ppl (2 adults/3 kids) we have slept in smaller. Not that big a deal even though it was confirmed two queens. Son plugs in iPad by sofa-sleeper and finds a dirty shirt. Again I'm staying positive, things happen. I start setting sofa sleeper and pull out extra pillow to find hair all over blanket and pillow case. Still some people think they being helpful and put stuff away before checking out...accidents happen. I take the shirt to the front desk and a lady asks if I need help. I hand her the shirt and explain the pillow/blanket issue. I get an ""ok what room"". I tell her my room and move on. When I see her hand the shirt to another lady who gives me a dirty look as she walks it into a room behind the desk. Ok I'm still trying to like the hotel but it's getting harder. Finally a lady shows up with a blanket and no pillow case. I ask her to bring me a pillow case too please. She does after a couple minutes. So from here I can still say , yea it's ok hotel.In morning I walk to front desk to ask about breakfast. An older bellman reading the paper barely looks up and suggests McDonalds. Caught off guard I said, well I'm not from around here, and not really looking fast food. How about a good breakfast for a family? Still not really looking up, he points out door and says ""waffle house""That did it. Nice hotel from the first impression. Staff, service and closer look killed this stay.Coming in the door we weren't sure what to expect from the smoke smell but upon entering the room it was inviting with a cute color scheme! The beds were incredibly comfortable and the mirror an awesome size. The curve shower curtain was the real dealBeen to OKC a couple of times for NAIA national championships.  Meridian offers a convenient location but some sub par accommodations. Wyndham Garden offers the best spot on the Meridian Strip.Had some issues upon check in but manager came through an made the changes.Not the Ritz but the best you'll find in this area.In an agri-industrial area of the city, this hotel stands out among its peers.  Mostly due to the wonderful service I receive here. I always book with the reservation coordinator , Cindy, and she goes well out of her way to make my stay enjoyable.  For example, the travel package I get here provides a rental car with the room.  On the one occasion the car was not immediately available, Cindy made certain to notify me when it was, and ensured I was aware of alternate transportation.  I really appreciate her helpfulness and choose this hotel when in Oklahoma City almost exclusively because of it. The building itself is old, but the rooms have been updated.  The facility sprawls, laid out with a few wings.  All the appliances are new, and I had a microwave and fridge in my room.  Clean as any comparable hotel.  Lots of available parking. And an onsite bar and restaurant.   The fitness center has two treadmills, both of which are in good working shape.  There's an indoor pool and billiards table.  Wi-Fi is a little slow, but complementary, so I can't complain. Oh, and a convenient airport shuttle. Again, so far as the hotel itself goes: it's pretty average, with no one negative aspect that I can think of.  But the service is excellent, and makes this the choice for me when I am in the area.Here for an FAA conferenceRegarding the room . . .It's your typical hotel. If motel 6/red roof inn were rated 1/5and double tree or hilton 5/5this would be 3/5PROS:Showers were hotrooms had a fridge and microwave CONS:Most people at the conference said they had difficulty sleeping, either the bed or the pillowsSome channels on TV did not workNo safe in the roomTook more than 55 minutes for lunch!! UNACCEPTABLE!!Special of the day: brisket sandwich for $12, sounds like a deal right? Not really, it was the same price on the menu, and you can order it any day LOLLecture ended at 1205, break for lunch until 1300It was raining outside some of us decided to eat at the hotel. We sat at the table, and the waitress was visually  overwhelmed because she had about 6 tables at once. (any where from 1-4 people per table). She went out of her way to let us know she was overwhelmed. Funny, because it seemed like she WENT SLOWER because there were more people there.We got our order in at about 1220, by 1255, the food was not yet out, so I told her to void the order and left to get back to lecture. Most of the other tables had to quickly box their lunchesThis place is supposed to be 3.5 star hotel. But it should rly be 1 star hotel. Room is very damp and smells bad and the building is very old. Their bed is good but smells bad. Avoid this place.I booked Wyndham Garden OKC by ""naming my own price"" on Priceline, which is essentially like hotel roulette. I got a fantastic deal on the room and, frankly, I got what I paid for.The room was a decent size, and looked nice, but there were a few issues:1) The bottom sheet barely fit on the bed. We actually had them bring us another sheet and tried putting it on ourselves to no avail. It constantly came off in the night and we weren't all that ""active"" ifyouknowwhatimean. This wasn't a huge deal, but a bit annoying. Also: Bring a pillow or 4 unless you like sleeping flat on your back.2) The bathroom is... weird. First off, it's tiny. To open and close the door, you actually had to stand behind the toilet. Secondly, the shower doesn't have a door... it just has half a pane of glass nearest the shower head and the rear is left open, meaning you will get water on the floor and get a bit chilly if you back up too far. The water pressure was nice and stout, but actually getting the temperature right required you to stand under the freezing spray. Again, not a huge deal, but annoying.3) The ""free"" breakfast buffet is only free if they give you a little ticket when you check in. Otherwise, it's $10+. While the quality is really good, it's very limited (waffle maker, cereal, eggs, biscuits, bacon, and oatmeal).The staff was really fantastic, from the front desk to the dining area and housekeeping. Really exemplary work. The room LOOKS very nice and not at all unseemly. I would book WG again at that price without hesitation.Great hotel, friendly staff and very comfortable beds, I got a great nights sleep.A nicely remodeled holiday inn.  Quiet, convenient, comfortable.  Nice pool, plenty of parking etc etc.  Found it economical as well.  Helpful staff.  Dinner there was good, breakfast no very good-but free. Lots of restaurants nearby, but a bit out of the way for evdrything else.  Would stay there again on a heartbeat.Sometimes I have to be in Oklahoma City for extended periods (weeks) of time.  I've been pretty loyal to the hotels I stay at, however this was last minute and I had to switch up places to stay.  The employees at the Wyndham Garden really came through for me.  I had been in there when a friend stayed before, but never stayed there myself.  The rooms are in great shape and have up to date furniture and TV's.  A 42"" plasma TV in this size room is way more than enough.  I can hook up my XBOX through HDMI and play away.  The wireless internet is open and is good enough for games both on PC and XBOX.  It is a little restrictive though so you might have trouble connecting to your buddies.For guests they have a managers reception (free food) every Tuesday.  They used to have fantastic buffalo wings, but I think that chef took his recipe with him when he left.  Now it's mostly baked potatoes and tacos.  But hey, it's free food.  The workout room has one good treadmill and one that will only let you run for 10 minutes.  I don't know what the deal with that is, but they have a bunch of other equipment too.  The beds are very comfortable and the whole place just seems professional and clean.  All the tops in my room are marble too.  I do miss having a bathtub, but the walk in shower is pretty classy.This is one of the best hotel experiences I've had.  I'll definitely come back here next time I'm in OKC.  The sales lady even bakes cookies for FAA employees and hand delivers them!Everything was great, except the TV in our room was really snowy.",,,,,"['room', 'complaints', 'staff', 'well',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-oklahoma-city,Hilton Garden Inn,4.0,$$,16,"Disclaimer: My 5 stars are for Nancy only and the customer service that she provided when I called into the hotel and when I actually arrived. I made a reservation for the 20th, but I was delayed and didn't arrive until the 21st (today). I was afraid that nothing would be done, so I tried to get another room and had a HORRIFIC experience (Read my other hotel review from today), one that I didn't share with Nancy. Even though Nancy knew nothing of my stressful situation that had just happened, she was very kind and empathetic. She went above and beyond for me and I say this because I know that she DIDN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME. She moved my reservation to today without penalty or extra cost. I was able to check in early....it was just nice. And it reminded me that ""At the end of the day people won't remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel."" Maya Angelou......It made me feel good that I didn't have to put forth any effort for her to help me....she just saw a human being and helped....I want to say this, performing the duties on your job description is doing the job that you're being paid to do, but doing something that is not expected of you OR required of you, but helps the ""customer"" and doesn't hurt the company....to me that's CUSTOMER SERVICE. AND it becomes the foundation for retaining repeat customers. Thank you from us!This place.... Where do I even begin!?The rooms are 90's chic, which means carpeted everything (I'll call it vintage, because it was clearly original). It was clean, but was not at all what I expected from a Hilton.The breakfast was sub par, with watery eggs, pre-cooked, questionable looking sausage, and room temperature yogurt (and cash price is $9, aka outrageous). The staff was nice, but always assumed you were paying in cash as opposed to the coupons you're given at check in.But I think the biggest issue I have is with the front desk staff- they were rude and I had several problems during my stay.Starting from check in- they didn't have me down for the right number of days (my confirmation said 3 nights, they had me down for 2). When I checked in they couldn't find my reservation, and proceeded to argue with me through the entire process.It was ultimately decided that I should speak to the manager in the morning about the additional day. When I did, I was told that they didn't have any rooms available, because they had a large group booked. After much more arguing, they decided they did find a room,but that I would have to move. The entire fiasco was blamed on a faulty computer system (which still doesn't account for the rude interactions).They offered to move my stuff for me, and give me extra points for the inconvenience (still to be received).I'm disappointed because I'm a frequent Hilton flyer, and have never been treated as such an inconvenience before.They won't be getting my business again, and I recommend you do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.This is a nice hotel located less than ten minutes from the airport. There is a restaurant and full bar inside that stays open till ten if you don't want to venture out beyond the front doors. Otherwise there's plenty of restaurants within walking distance. The rooms are spacious with plenty of room for two people. The double rooms have two queen size beds in them with a desk and small sitting area. The bathrooms are a bit small but not horribly tight. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. I would definitely stay here again if in the area.This HGI, is okay, not great. I wouldn't choose to stay for more than one night and even with that I think that there are better options not too far. It is clean and the staff is friendly, but you can tell that it's an older property with moderate updates. Thin walls, noisy AC unit.Great hotel, clean rooms and easy access to  dining options and the airport.  The staff is great And willing to help you with whatever you need.Not bad at all.  It was clean, and the front desk was friendly.  They do not offer free breakfast.If I can't get into the nearby Homewood Suites, my second choice would be this Hilton Garden Inn when staying in town. (I'm a Hilton Family chain user and usually stick to only Hilton hotels when traveling.)It's easy to find from the airport, located north of the airport, on the same street. Also, I like their comfy, Sleep Number beds and their buffet breakfast (free for HHonors Gold and Diamond members.) The staff have been welcoming and very accomodating these past few visits as well. Extra perk: they offer free rides to and from the airport.Room was clean and ready. Hotel overall is nice and I feel the price was really good for what I got. The front desk girl did the basics and nothing more. She seemed like all she would do is provide average customer service. The evening cookies were hard as rocks and tasted nasty. If the front desk reception would have been better I'd given them 4 stars.The hotel was the best I've stayed in, in ages! It was immaculately clean and the front desk staff was so kind. My room wasn't ready when I arrived a bit early, so they upgraded me free of charge to a suite. The suite was wonderful-spacious with a door on the bedroom, away from restroom &amp; living room. There are microwaves &amp; refrigerators in the rooms, which makes utilizing their 24 hr snack bar convenient. Upon leaving, the front desk let me keep an item there for another person to pick up the next day. The single downside was that on a weekend day, the pool was closed for reconditioning. I highly suggest staying here!!This hotel had the most amazingly accommodating staff EVER! They all went above and beyond to create a perfect weekend for a group of friends that all stayed there for a wedding. A+ service from beginning to end. I highly reccomend this   Hotel for anyone in the area looking to stay! Top notch Hilton Garden Inn crew!!Very quiet!  Nice accommodations, amenities are the best.  Great location, close to airport, I-40, and Oklahoma City.  Restaurants are near by, we has a great dinner last night.  Room was terrific.  Very friendly folks, helpful and quality service.Very comfortable and clean room. Great staff that were very helpful and a solid dinner. Laundry facilities were also spotless and the pool was well needed at this point on the book tour. Would come back here in an instant.Not impressed. The TV reception is junk, as it the channel navigation setup. My shower head is broken and won't stay in place. I'm charged the same rate for a handicap double as my coworkers who have kings. The breakfast is $10! We had rooms for 2 weeks but we're changing hotels after this week is overI'm currently sitting in the lobby as we speak. I have never met sweeter workers in my life. The dark haired young woman behind the front desk is so sweet. The younger lady working as the waitress is also one of the sweetest people. Its almost 11pm and I have not felt pressure once that I needed to leave. In fact she told me I can stay as long as I need. Originally had a room at the howard johnson down the street. After being terrified to even get out of my car over there I came and got a room here last minute. Well worth the extra money! STAY HERE!I stay at a lot of Garden Inns across the country, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to say anything about one. They are so consistent (and I stay at so many of them) it hardly bears writing a review in most cases.Except this one. I have to say, while overall the hotel is just like any other Garden Inn, the staff here has been without exception among the best of any I've stayed at (many). Despite being a bit overwhelmed with stranded travelers, the staff really did a great job keeping up, staying positive and, I think, keeping everyone happy. Kudos to the OK City staff.I am a big Hilton fan and stay with them most of the time on the road.  This Hilton Garden Inn is very nice.  They have recently upgraded the rooms with flat screens, new Sleep number ( Type) mattress.   Even while I was here they updated the Thermostat to a Digital unit.  The staff is top notch and I will stay here again.",,,,,"['disclaimer', 'stars', 'customer', 'service', 'provided', 'called', 'hotel', 'actually', 'arrived', 'made', 'reservation', '20th', 'delayed',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-quinta-inn-and-suites-oklahoma-city-nw-expwy-oklahoma-city,La Quinta Inn & Suites Oklahoma City - NW Expwy,2.5,$$,15,"Stayed here on a recent visit to OKC despite reading the reviews in prior to making the reservation.  Unfortunately the reviews were accurate as the interior was stoic reliving a look and feel from the 1990's.  My room was initially on the 6th floor but I switched after discovering my window lock was broken and the AC was slow to turn on.The front desk staff was hospitable during check-in, room switch, and check-out.  The continental breakfast was better than average as hot biscuits and gravy was served along with the typical offerings.  Overall I'd rate La Quinta 2.5 stars (1 star = interior, 3 star = customer service and food).One of the worst hotel breakfast I've ever had. If they can't afford decent quality, why even bother?I was most disappointed by the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were very stale and dry. They must have been around for at least several days. The room was updated and clean, but my favorite morning hotel ritual was a huge letdown.My name is Nic I stay with La Quinta about 300 nights a year. I always book a two room suit..  currently I'm staying at 4829 NW expressway.  I stay here only for the convenience of business.   This last year I have spent over $26,000 with La Quinta..  I have earned 32 nights free this last year!!      This Last month I have had Fraud twice..   I checked in for a five night stay on NW expressway.  When I checked in this last time I used points to check in for the first night.  When I checked in I told the front desk clerk about the problem.  He said that paying on Monday would not be a problem sense they know me, and my elite status!!  I was so thankful for the understanding!!  I assured him I would be down before noon on Monday to pay my stay in full!!    While waiting in line to check in!  I use the restroom in the lobby by the breakfast room!!  It had not been cleaned in a week or two as you can see in the picture!! There was piss and pubic hair caked on all the urinals and toilets!  I then Presided to my room to unload!!  When I got into the room it was NOT clean!  The toilet was nasty!!  The sheet rock above the tub was falling had holes in it!!        The second day into my stay!  Reann one of the managers of the hotel started calling asking for payment or they are going to call the police  of the managers of the hotel..   I let her know when I checked into the hotel I let the front desk clerk know what was going on and he said there would be no problem due to being elite members to let us finalize payment of our bill Monday morning before noon..  She proceeded to say if there was a payment made within the next 10 minutes they would be calling the police for trespassing!  Asking to speak to Amanda the general manager.  She was off for a few days for Thanksgiving she called us back and was even ruder then her employees.    She also said we must be out within 30 minutes...  So I called a Business partner of mine to come and put his credit card on file so we was not thrown out like dogs.  Later that evening our keys  was not working to the room.    I went down to the desk to get keys reprogrammed!!  That was a major deal the hotel clerk looked at the screen funny and then walked away.  A manager then walked up and read and said you were not paid we cannot reprint keys!  I proceeded to say yes we are paid for our stay!  Then they said oh I see it here now you are paid!  then ask for my ID and asked who I was!! They then re-keyed my room for me! Every time I stayed at this location I question the cleanliness, disorganization of the hotel!!  The only reason I stay at this location is because of location !!  They are always very hard to get on the phone for questions or to book a room!!  ""I like to book through the hotel directly so I am sure I get the two room suite I always get""  I do once in a while partake in the breakfast!  While eating breakfast you can see all the disorganization that goes on during breakfast and at the front desk!!  The few times I've ate breakfast the front desk manager and or clerk is running between breakfast room and the front desk trying to take care of both areas!!  Impossible to do efficiently!!  It causes either people waiting in line at the front desk to check out, The phone ringing off the hook, and breakfast to not be stocked/kept up.  They do serve a biscuit and gravy that a lot of LaQuinta's do not!  The gravies normally made fresh however the biscuits are left above the gravy on a open tray!  They are not pre heated and they are dried out which flights on them most of the time!!  A lot of the time the hallways stink of cigarette smoke or piss!!  ""Dog piss""  The sixth  floor at this hotel is supposed to be a smoking floor!!  However you can smell it on most floors and a lot of marijuana smells!  I am not sure if they have a lot of drug problems or prostitution problems at this location!!  However it does strongly seem like it the way they treat their guests as if they're used to dealing with that kind of people..  I have noticed in the back parking lot a lot of times there are people sitting in their cars looking very suspicious.I am not sure why it took so long for me to realize that I should not stay at this hotel!  I guess the main reason is I stay with La Quinta in every city that it's available and for Oklahoma City this is by far the best location!   I was trying to look past the end cleaning us and the condition of the hotel along with everything else because of location! This last stay is my Will be my last!  I do hope whoever owns this hotel does realize there is major issues and find new management to clean up the mess!  Being a businessman myself! General managers are always The result of how good or bad A pacific location of business is ran!  Amanda was more worried about talking to her family more than the guest she was on the phone with!  As she kept talking to other people while telling me to pay now, or get out! She has a disorganized hotel &amp; filthy !!!I stayed here for two night December 3rd &amp; 4th in room 416.   When I checked out I showed the front desk the bed bug bites I had on my arm.  I further told them to take the room out of service.  Send me proof of treatment and I would not write a negative review.   After a couple of days I sent an email to corporate.  I received basically the same response. That they had had the room inspected and there were no bed bugs.  Lol. I suggested maybe they get better inspectors and sent them pictures of the bites.  The response was they were sorry I had ""challenges"" during my stay.   Hopefully I will be able to attach pictures so you can be the judge.   Overall the hotel was clean.   Another guest could have brought them in.  All I wanted was for them to fix the problem. Their solution was to deny it existed and to not do anything to make it right.I stayed at a lot of la quinta hotels when I was traveling across the country. They allow pets which made the decision for me. This was one of the cleaner looking ones. The room was smaller than other rooms I had stayed in but it didn't bother me too much. I felt safe on the first floor. The lobby was okay looking and they provided free breakfast. The buffet was not the best though. Other hotels I stayed at stunk highly of cleaners but this one wasn't too bad.I give this property 4 stars based on other La Quinta Inns. This is one of the nicest I've stayed at and I've stayed at a lot while traveling across the country. It's in a convenient location and is very clean and safe. It is also nice if you are traveling with pets as they don't charge. If you are traveling through OKC, consider stopping here.Stayed here for 3 weeks and I was very impressed. The beds are comfy ! The room service is on the ball! The location is great because your by a lot of restaurants and stores and for me I was happy there was a petco and petsmart right down the street considering I had my 2 dogs. One of the main reasons why I like to stay at La Quinta is because of their pet policy. I was able to have my 2 dogs with me and did not have to pay a deposit . They keep it very clean here and there is lots of parking ! The staff is very helpful.  My only complaint is the breakfast though , they can broaden it more. Ive been to other locations of this hotel that serves sausage and cereal. After a while I got sick of the waffle machine and store bought muffins but other than that I was really happy ......after all I did stay a whole 3 weeks haha.Clean room, comfy bed and great service. Hotel is a little old, but maintained. For a nights stay it is a good deal!Staff was friendly but unfortunately not informed or informative about parking, location of room, check out time, breakfast hours, etc. Room was spacious but lacked attention to detail; shower curtain was inside out (they have words in them and having stayed at a nicer La Quinta I knew it was hung wrong, which also caused some flooding), tub was dirty/slippery, and a few other random things. Not bad, just a weird experience.Not one of the best :-/Because of my job I was able to stay at this hotel for an entire month. Please keep in mind that I did not pick the hotel, it was selected for me. The staff is friendly. The rooms are clean for the most part. I had to write a note for housekeeping to change my dirty duvet cover after taking it off and putting it in the floor didn't work. I will be the first to say that I like pet friendly hotels (I have two dogs that I sometimes travel with), but now after being kept awake by barking on two different nights it would be nice if a floor were reserved for no pets. Along those lines, if smoking rooms are offered please make sure your ventilation is appropriate. I'm supposed to be two floors down from smoking, but had to call for room deodorization at one point. The bed is very comfortable with a selection of pillows. Free WiFi. Good room temperature control. This is a clean and comfortable place to stay for a night if you don't have a barking dog next to you. I will not likely stay here again.Excellent and very clean.  Dog friendly hotels are hard to find.  After staying at the La Quinta Airport location for years this place is 100% better. It lacks a business center so bring your laptop.Your dog will like it !Okay, I didn't actually stay here. But I encountered really useless customer service that I think is a fair reflection of the place. Allow me to explain:I mistakenly showed up at this property instead of the La Quinta 6 miles down the road that I was actually booked at. It was about 7:30 in the evening. My husband and I had been driving for 500 miles on day four of a cross-country road trip, and we just wanted to rest.I walked up to the desk clerk and gave her my name to check in. She said, ""There's nothing here under that name."" She asked me to spell it (a 5-letter last name) about 10 times. When I shared my confirmation number with her, she was stone-faced. ""I don't have anything here."" I was so confused, so I just kept repeating the number. I mean, someone GAVE me this number - I obviously wasn't making it up. I repeated the address to confirm I was at the right hotel. Still, no help. Finally, I gave her the phone number I had. Saying nothing to me, she picked up the phone and called what I soon learned was another La Quinta hotel. It became apparent I was booked at that one.So I asked what you might expect - if we could just stay at her hotel since they are the same chain and we were already there. Without so much as a hesitation to consider whether or not that would be possible, she shot back, ""No, it's after 6:00. And I can't cancel you after 6:00. If you stayed here, you'd have to pay for both rooms."" Wow - way to problem-solve, lady. And thank you for that.I don't know how the mistake was made - if it was me or the booking agent - it doesn't even matter. But she clearly just didn't care to help me out at all. Again, I don't know what the rooms are like - the hotel overall looked nice enough - but shame on them for that service.The hotel itself is ok at best. The only upside is outdoor pool and great service.I write this review using the free wifi in my room at the La Quinta. :-) What is there to say? It's a nice room, clean. The beds were made. The furnishings are not exactly modern but they aren't bad, either. The room was warm and the thermostat said 72 so that's inaccurate. Still, when I cranked it down to 65 it came on the room is nice now. The shower is a bit low on the ol' flow but the water was hot and I am clean so no complaints. I have to say that the girl behind the counter was efficient at checking us in but not exactly helpful in finding us a good restaurant. She recommended a national pizza chain. Uh, no. She couldn't direct us to a cigar bar, either but offered to look it up for us. Again, not helpful as I could do that faster myself. But, she did offer. All in all, it's been an OK experience.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/ambassador-hotel-oklahoma-city-autograph-collection-oklahoma-city-2,"Ambassador Hotel Oklahoma City, Autograph Collection",4.0,$$$,25,"I feel like I'm staying at a showroom for Restoration Hardware. Not that I've seen these exact pieces there but it has that feel. Super cozy bed, amazingly comfortable and a great night rest. I stay in a lot of hotels, this place is really a step above. Great staff, beautiful rooms and amazingly quiet. I'll definitely stay here again.Yay! I'm a fan.This is a lovely little hotel.My room was awesome. Everything was chic, clean, and had really nice touches. I was here for work and I felt a little odd, like I should be here for a sexy weekend getaway with a boyfriend.Don't bother with valet, there is free street parking to the south of the building.The gym is disconnected in an office building, which was a little odd. Not many of the guests go to the gym (probably there for a sexy vacation getting in other forms of exercise ;) ), so I was almost always alone and there were people randomly walking by the window, occasionally looking in.Oh, and don't go to the restaurant nor bar in this hotel. They're both quite bad.The Ambassador is a great find in OKC.  In a trendy, up-and-coming part of town this hotel is trendy, funky and surely a cornerstone of the growth this section of town is experiencing.The building is relatively non-description, almost bland in external appearance.  Pull up in front on Walker and a bellman/valet will greet your arrival.  The lobby is cozy and comfortable, and check in is efficient.  Upgraded to a corner suite was a benefit of a recent visit! The rooms are well appointed, clean and functional.  It has all the things you'd expect at an Autograph Collection property.  Beds are comfortable and bathrooms are glass and granite and cool tile.I found only two issues.  One is that the bathroom door is a sliding barn-door style design that does not provide much privacy.  The other is that the street outside can be noisy, and sound deadening is not a strong point in the hotel's design.The Viceroy restaurant located off of the lobby is very good for dinner, specializing in creative, fresh dishes.  It is a bit pricey, though, for those of you on expense accounts.  It's also open for breakfast.The Ambassador's staff is pleasant and efficient.  I definitely recommend The Ambassador as a top shelf hotel pick in OKC.If you enjoy noisy hotels and are an early riser, this may be the spot for you.  I just spent three nights at this hotel and my favorite part of the experience was checking out.  The street noise at this hotel is rivaled only by the slamming door noise that is present any time a guest enters or leaves their room.  At first I thought we just had inconsiderate people staying on our floor but after trying to quietly close my own room door I realized that it is impossible.  The doors cannot be closed quietly.  Additionally, the elevator ""ding"" can be clearly heard.  We originally stayed in Room 606, but requested a room change around midnight on the second night of our stay.  The noise from a Harley motorcycle which kept riding past our hotel was unbearable.  Additionally, this hotel attracts quite a crowd to the ""O"" bar on Fridays and Saturdays and the festive (read: drunk) revelers who were streaming in could also be easily heard from our room.  The hotel staff didn't seem to care too much about our feedback and weren't super helpful in coordinating our room move.  When we asked for a quieter location, they asked us how we felt about elevator noise.  Apparently, no room is free from some sort of noise, though Room 606 seems to suffer from all kinds.  While the interior and exterior noise was annoying, my biggest issue was the phone call we received at 7:10 am on Saturday morning.  Someone rang and then hung up before I could reach the phone.  While this may have simply been a wrong number, I happen to think that it was the front desk calling to follow-up on our midnight call regarding the room change and that the person calling didn't notice the early hour.  Regardless, I didn't have to be awake at that time on Saturday and due to the previous nights noise, I was hoping to sleep late (or at least until 8am).  In summary, I'd suggest staying at a different hotel.  Aside from the noise, there weren't too many amenities at this hotel - the gym was tiny, dated and had little to no equipment and the pool was closed so we didn't use that.  There isn't too much to do near this hotel and our friends who stayed in hotels closer to Bricktown seemed to have more options to walk to.  One insider tip if you do stay at the Ambassador - the front desk has ear plugs available, even though they claim not to be aware of the noise issues we encountered.The Ambassador is very nicely done. The furnishings are tasteful, the beds are comfortable and it is a quiet place. The 7th floor bar offers great views of the city and the bartenders are attentive. They offer the standard cocktails and they do some originals with local ingredients. They do not carry any NA beers though they did offer to run out and buy some (nice touch, first class). The Viceroy Grille has a solid menu featuring locally sourced ingredients. The bathroom doors are the roll across type that look really cool but they do not seal. It has about the same effect as pulling a loose shower curtain across the bathroom door. Just know that anything going on in the bathroom is going to be heard loud and clear throughout the entire room. I don't get it, sacrificing privacy for coolness is not a desirable trait as it relates to bathrooms. The rooms have white plantation shutters that go well with the neutral walls however, the shutters do not seal out much light. If you're trying to sleep in, best bring something to cover your eyes. The valet is iffy. We left our car out front, locked it and wound up handing the keys to the valet as we entered the hotel at least twice. I don't know where they valet the cars but it is outdoors. It rained the night we were there and our car was dirty when they brought it around at checkout. All in all a nice hotel, great concept and pretty well executed.We stayed at the Ambassador this weekend and overall I was very impressed. The hotel was easy to find and located in a cool part of town near Downtown Oklahoma City. It reminded me a lot of the Power and Light District in Kansas City. The hotel was very clean, well maintained, and beautifully decorated. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.The price for a night was a little higher than the other hotels ($205 ish) in the area, but for a few extra dollars you are getting a huge upgrade in terms of finishings. Also, it either wasn't mentioned in our booking or it was somewhere in the fine print, but parking is not free unless you can find a spot on the street outside the hotel (we never did). Just to park your own car in the hotel lot was $16 per night, and to have Valet park for you, it was an extra $3 plus tip. I really think those kinds of prices for parking are a little ridiculous, especially considering we stayed on a Thursday night when the hotel was not very busy. The main problem that I had with the Ambassador, and the reason I am not giving the hotel a 5 Star rating, is the noise level. We went to a concert and did not get back to our room until 1:30 am. We crawled into bed ready to sleep in the next morning but we were unable to do so. I don't know if the windows are incredibly cheap or old, but I could literally hear everything going on outside on the street below. A bus or something big rumbled by a little after 6 am and it sounded like they were going to park inside our room. It never really got quiet again after that. All morning busses, garbage trucks, and other loud vehicles could be heard going down the street. Also, once people started to leave for the morning we could hear the word for word conversations they were having standing down on the street while waiting for the Valet. We were up on the fifth floor which just seems crazy that it could have been so loud. It was literally like there were no windows at all and every sound was amplified into our room. It was not a pleasant sleeping experience, especially after getting to bed so late. In our booking, we requested the quietest room they had knowing we were going to be sleeping in later the next day. I hate to think if that actually was the quietest room they had.Somehow I lucked up and my company discount was cheaper here than other standard hotels in the Marriott chain (Springhill, Courtyard, etc)...so I decided to try the rest of my week out here after 1 night at the Renaissance downtown.My expectations were exceeded from the building itself, to the interior decor, to the room, and service.Only negative is that I was told (by valet attendent) that valet was X amount, parking in their lot was X amount, and to self park on the street was free. Since it seemed light and I wanted quick access to my vehicle, I chose to self park. When my invoice was emailed to me, I noticed I was charge each night for parking in their lot.It was certainly the best hotel I've stayed at in OKC, hands down. Also has great restaurants across the street and within a quick skip down the street.Arrived at valet. Walked in the big doors and was greeted promptly by the front desk. They were quick about checking me in, friendly, and courteous and smiling. Their tone and energy we're inviting and welcoming. I came up to my room and smiled when I opened the door. The decor and detail to the little things made me immediately relaxed. The bed is very comfy. The bathroom and shower are great. Love the area the hotel is in and the bar on the rooftop is lovely. As a local who had a stay-cation here, I will absolutely recommend this hotel to colleagues and to friends and other locals. Love this place.Met friends at the restaurant in the hotel. We had the best dinner. My pork roast melted in my mouth. So tender, excellent taste. Calamari was excellent. Staff were professional and described the meal options so elegantly, I wanted to try all of them. Atmosphere was quiet, tables were at enough distance we could speak without being over heard. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!Upon arrival  (at check-in time) no one was at the valet so we just parked on the street. No big deal. We walk in to the door being opened, nice. I walk to the front desk and say hello and provide my last name. She says, ""give me a minute"". After a few minutes she asks me my name again. I tell her we parked in the street as no one was at valet and she says, ""I don't make him stand out there"". There's really not a place to park for valet so that's a bit confusing. Again, not a big deal but service was disappointing at check-in. A week prior I had use the automated form on the website to inquire about massage services in the room and no response. If I cared to much I would have called but a response would be nice. Room is very nice and awesome view of OKC skyline. Large space. Very comfortable bed.Restaurant was good. Breakfast was especially great! Bar was nice but small outdoor area.Stunning hotel. Very clean and the staff was amazing. Felt extremely modern and well done.Great hotel in midtown. The revival is happening and this hotel is in the perfect location. You have a ton of quality restaurants within walking distance, access to spoakie bike sharing, a dog park, a community garden and so much more! The Ambassador does everything right, they just need more of a presence at the front desk. And they should serve drinks and food poolside.The Ambassador is situated in a very busy hub! It's right in the heart of midtown within walking distance to some great local eateries. I took the grand tour last week with Jesse Krewall and am very excited to share the news.This building was originally used for medical offices, but you could hardly tell. The interior smells brand spanking new with beautifully painted walls, carpet and chic interior. It's considered a ""boutique"" hotel because it's petite with only 54 rooms and 7 floors. On the first floor you'll find their restaurant Viceroy Grill. Towards the back of the hotel  (still on the first floor) you'll find the mini pool. Believe me, it's quite small and more suited for dipping verses swimming.  The top level houses their rooftop bar O. The rooftop boasts gorgeous views of DT and is mainly indoors. They have a small balcony as well. Last but not least, they have two conference rooms. One maxes out at about 50 people and the smaller room probably could hold 15 people comfortably for a board room meeting. There are plenty of windows in both rooms and can be rented out with a minimum catering order of 20 people.Great little place for out of town guests! BONUS perk is that they have a complementary Escalade available for guests to take around the DT area. If you need to go any further, be Yelpy and use Uber. Check this place out :)Found myself in OKC for a work trip and ended up at the Ambassador.  Overall, it is a decent spot.  I liked the clean, updated inside of the hotel and rooms specifically.  Everyone at the hotel is very nice.  But some spots were lacking.  Gym is located outdoors in the building next door and is teeny tiny, one of the smallest I've seen in lots of travel.  Surrounding area has a few restaurants but overall this doesn't appear to be a lively part of town, not necessarily an area to walk around much.  Service is a bit slow.  I had to wait 10 minutes past when the downstairs restaurant was scheduled to be open for someone to open the restaurant and greet me.  Same for valet--multiple instances where it took quite awhile to get my car.  Okay spot, just set expectations appropriately.Now that I know where the other three hotels are, I'll not hesitate to book in other cities. This hotel is immaculate, trendy and comfortable. The staff is above average and extremely hospitable. It's also pet friendly and extremely quiet.The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable. Oversized shower and bathroom! Every nook and cranny are spotless. Will book again when in OKC.While in town for business, my co-workers and I stayed here several weeks this summer.  It quickly felt like a home away from home!  It is newly renovated and very swanky.  After several stays, here are my pros and cons:Pros: very nice, comfy beds, cozy robes, large rooms, amazing shower, in room Keurig machine, friendly staff that knew our names after our first week, rooftop bar with great view!Cons: thin walls - often I was awoken by the sound of people being loud outside, or the wind howling in the corridor, workout room is not connected and pretty sparse, no loyalty program, parking lot is a far walkOverall this was a great hotel! I felt very comfortable here and it makes other hotel chains feel like sleezy motels!Best hotel in OKC, better than the Skirvin, leaps and bounds better than everybody else.  The entire staff is excellent and actually cares and wants to make your stay the best possible. Karina, Gary, Janet at the front desk at the best. Michael and the bar staff are fun folks to chat with over a drink, and Steven, Nick, David, and Bill are awesome - I chat when them when I take the shuttle to spots around town and they are great folks. Solid crew, would never take my money elsewhere in OKC. And forgot to mention that the hotel is well decorated, spacious rooms, excellent bathroom amenities including Scope mouthwash and great shampoo/conditioner.  I could say more, just a great place and excellent staff. I stay here 4 nights/week on business.Great little hotel just outside of downtown.  Spacious room with giant shower, great for tall people such as myself.  Staff is super friendly and accommodating.  Upscale restaurant just off the lobby, the lamb special was ridiculously good.  The bar upstairs is fully stocked, and the bartenders know their shit.  Highly recommend.  Totally worth the price.I flew into OKC for a meeting with clients this past week and decided to stay through the weekend. I invited a few friends that I have in town, and their wives/girlfriends, out to dinner and a few drinks afterwards. After dinner we walked over to the hotel to check out their 'sky bar'. When we walked into the hotel we were greeted very nicely and were told what floor the bar was in. As soon as we walked up to the bar's door the 'door man' said ""it is way too crowded in there, you guys may be better off at another bar like Louie's or Fassler Hall"". Keep in mind, we were just coming from Dinner so we were dressed appropriately for this place. Door man said it would be a few minutes before we could walk in followed by him saying ""you can poke your head in there if you'd like to see the place"". As if he were ""granting"" us a view of what we were not going to be allowed to walk into. We waited a few minutes and we saw people come in and out of this place and still the door man said ""it is just too crowded, maybe another nearby place is better for you guys."". After waiting 15 minutes and people coming in and out we realized that we were not going to get in because we were NOT the ""right people"" for this place. Though we were all dressed business casual and the wives and girlfriends had on nice alfits/dresses, it was clearly obvious that we were being denied entry to this bar because of who were were and nothing else. (Except for one of my friends who was wearing a hat, because he is self conscious about going bald, we were all acceptable.). I hate to say it and I hate to play this card but there was really no other conclusion. (Racial Profiling). There, i feel terrible about having to use that, but it was obvious. As people were walking in and out and as we waited in that hallway we decided to leave after 15 mins with only the ""poke in the head"" view that some of us did as a reminder of where we would never be ""allowed"" in.  As we walked past the front desk in the lobby, one of the representatives said ""you guys are leaving already? To which we replied ""They did not let us in"". He grunted and had a look of disbelief. Not sure if the bar is managed by same staff as hotel is. I hope not. Because maybe I will not be able to stay at this hotel when I am in town again on business. Maybe they will allow me to ""poke my head in the room"" before allowing other people to go in.Beautiful Boutique hotel. All restaurants around it: excellent &amp; w/i walking distance, staff friendly &amp; welcoming! Love it!","I absolutely love the Ambassador Hotel in Midtown Oklahoma.fYI Oprah Winfrey stayed here in this hotel when she was here in Oklahoma for funeral a  friend of hers had died. but that's not the reason for my review ,my review is about this <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotel.It&amp;s=66eb519f6f1c30567f54467fcb42d79fc54d2451862a8fe07141bfb9ef7b1865"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotel.It</a>  is so  super #dope, chic.  The decor is fabulous I love this hotel. I decided to try brunch Sunday brunch because is super super busy on the weekend they are maxed to compacity.You will need a reservation. On  the 7th floor features a rooftop, that's ultra sexy.  Which is gonna be great for the summer time or  just for  hanging out. For Sunday brunch I was surprised they didn't have mimosa specials.The brunch menu was really  simple.  I  tried the shrimp and grits. They did a really good job with the seasoning the grits, the grits actually had a chicken stock.I had about 4 shrimp, but because they were a butterfly it took away from the quality of the shrimp I didn't like that.  They were grilled perfectly. It wasn't  ENOUGH shrimp  to complement the whole dish of grits. I do plan to go back with friends on another Sunday brunch to try something else on the <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmenu.my&amp;s=c75a39ba16942b68ed20cbe6aac3c53581e6015e821b0678ef3663b25e3e8f5b"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">menu.my</a> 2 highlights were meeting a couple that were  foodies just as I was &amp; travel all over the United States to eat.  We sat and talked for 2 hours pass brunch. The husband Shamir was Olympic track star for the United States of America from theJapan Olympics.  I ran into Steven Adams from Oklahoma City Thunder during brunch as well.Our office staff decided to go to Ambassador for 10 Year Anniversary for cocktails and dinner,we went to the bar and enjoyed the OKC skyline,proceeded to dinner where our waiter Everett was waiting ,He makes the best dirty martini ever!!Our dinner and the service was excellent,I will go back with my husband soon!!I'm reviewing the restaurant at this hotel.  Viceroy.  First off we had made reservations for Mother's Day on open table for 1:00.  They called and asked us to be there at 12:15 because the online booking ""overbooked"" them.  Well I told them we will try but let's make the reservation set to 12:30.  Well we got there at 12:15 and they didn't seat up until 12:30.  The host was a great man.  Very friendly and talkative.  Menu has a great variety.  3 of us had corned beef hash with sunny side up eggs Waldorf salad and eggs with asparagus. Only complaint was all three hash and eggs came with one sunny side up egg and one broken cooked egg.  Mimosas were the best I've ever had.  Service was great and quick especially for a packed restaurant.  Now here's why it ended up with three and not 4/5... We were waiting for out bill when the manager came up and said I hate to be the bearer of bad news but we have a booked restaurant and each table is allowed an hour... REALLY?! First off if we had the check and were sitting chatting that's one thing but we didn't even have the check! Not to mention there were 4 tables empty! Bad management in his part even if we had paid and were sitting its Mother's Day! Your kicking out my mother and grandmother to turn tables?! As he was saying this the waitress's arrived with the check and he still proceeded to tell us that they need the table instead of stopping and shutting up! So after we paid the waitress came and apologized so many times when it was not her fault! The food is great the restaurant is beautiful! Management needs to be changed!Perfect place to stay in Okc, Beautiful hotel, restaurants all around it, great rooftop bar, staff was great, room was perfect, bed was comfy, Perfect all around...5 stars!!!Loved this hotel in Oklahoma City! I called as we were driving in late to OC, the front desk clerk, Phillip, was so pleasant and accommodating! He explained the room rates and what was available and, yes, pet friendly too-thank you!!! I called back after chatting quickly with my husband and booked it within 30 minutes of arriving. Phillip was amazing, knew exactly who I was when I walked in saying-I think we may have arrived in under 30 min, he chuckled and after filling out just a little check in information he offered us advice on free parking and assured us that in 5 hours he would have some strong coffee for us ready for us when we left. Yes, we were only here for a short 5 hours but it was well worth it and, yes, he did have that hot strong coffee ready for us downstairs as we were checking out. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!! We will definitely be trying to stop here on our way back to Texas from North Dakota next week and are looking forward to it-hopefully we can at least stay for 8 hours this next time! I give it 5 stars for customer service, cleanliness, comfort of the bed and atmosphere. Really nicely upgraded finishes, loved the floors!! Also wasn't able to go out on the town in walking distance but it looked to be in a great location to quite a few bars and restaurants-would probably be a fun place to spend a weekend if I was from somewhere closer.",,,,"['feel', 'like', 'staying', 'showroom', 'restoration', 'hardware', 'seen', 'exact', 'pieces', 'feel', 'super', 'cozy', 'bed', 'amazingly', 'comfortable', 'great', 'night',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/tower-hotel-oklahoma-city-oklahoma-city,Tower Hotel Oklahoma City,2.5,$$,26,"Decent hotel (great for what was paid... $45 a night on hotwire for 2 nights in September) and it is about 17 minutes from the main airport. The room is spacious and clean. (And has your basic amenities.)  Complimentary tea and coffee in the room too.Didn't spend much time in the hotel so I don't even know what else it offers. The weekend I was in town there was a convention in the lobby/meeting center with locals; super cool/neat. Got me some local spices. And everyone was really nice that I encountered.The customer service (of the evening crew) was fantastic. Smiles, and great information---however, the amenities and the room were horrible. When we walked into our room, it felt like we had walked into a sauna. And the bathroom smelled like BO (I think it had to do with the heat, and all the smells coming out). We quickly adjusted the temperature believing it would make a difference. At 2:40am, we couldn't sleep, we were sweating like crazy though the thermostat read 60 degrees. We called the front desk and they sent someone up to fix it. It was either that, or we had to change rooms. We had a ton of bags and things so we didn't want to move rooms.At 3am someone came and took apart the AC by unscrewing and entire wall unit in our room. It took about 30 minutes. He really did fix it, and he was very nice, but it did take a while and it was kind of an inconvenience. Nobody apologized for our broken AC. Unfortunate! In the morning, the front desk lady was not as nice as the evening staff.The Tower Hotel looked like a glammed up ghetto Days Inn. It was probably somewhat nice 20 years ago; but now it's just falling apart and the amenities below mediocre. The service is what saves it, and gives my review the 2 stars. There is free parking but no free wifi in the rooms (only in the lobby). The elevators are dark and old. But the worst were the rooms. The strong scent of BO in the bathroom was persistent, like it had been cooking for days. We were on the 12th floor, which (I think) was supposed to have ""fancier"" rooms as they had little plaques on the doors. Our rooms were so ghetto that I don't even want to wonder what the ""less fancier"" rooms are like. If you can help it, stay somewhere else.This place is a dump. Rooms are shabby, the place looks like it was closed for a decade before someone reopened it and did nothing to improve it. While we got a great rate on Hotwire, they charge for the wifi that they say is free (only free in the lobby, what is this, 1999?) and they charge your credit card with a $50 fee per room for 10 days. Shady, I've never had a hotel do that. Don't stay here!Gross on top of gross. Hotwire is so warped when it comes to what a 3.5 star hotel that's like Hilton or Sheraton should be, it's insane. Uncovered, free parking, but it's terrifying because there are constantly people in the parking lot who definitely aren't staying at the hotel. The lobby is really nice...that is the only positive thing I will say about this hotel. It is like an older Motel 6 on the inside, the crap ones back in the day before they got revamped. Dingy, wet carpets with dark grey staining all the way through the walkways. I had to throw out my socks when I got home. The plumbing is jacked. Whenever somebody uses the toilet or shower, water gurgles and shoots up from the bathroom sink...yes, like a scene out of a horror movie...and I felt the same way when I saw it. Thank god my tooth brush hadn't made it out of my carrying case. I do not recommend staying here, if you can avoid it.It's not the greatest place to stay meaning no real main attractions- but it is good enough to refresh your mental capacity. There is no bar from what I could see nor did the attendant express any benefits that the hotel offers like breakfast, dinner or anything along those lines. So my experience thus far is like this place is a good pit stop. The view is great though!!  I'm on the 6th floor and can see clear across the state of Oklahoma. Great place with great people inside of the building! Robyn is the best!!This review is for their banquet room and dinner service.DO NOT host any events at this place!!!  Where do I begin....We had issues with this place from the beginning, but stuck with it thinking we were getting a good deal.  We even tolerated the fact that they double-booked our space and left us with only half the area.  Turns out....they are untrustworthy and did not stick to the contract and did not deliver so many things we agreed on.  It starts from the top.  Their sales manager has no integrity and no customer service skills.  He should get out of the hospitality business.  We showed up to our wedding reception to find out that there were no plated salad, there were 2 bars instead of 3 and they were in the wrong area.  The food was nothing like it was at the tasting and they did not bring out enough so guests had to stand their and wait.  They did not regulate traffic even though we directly asked them to a week prior.  So people from another party were coming over to take advantage of our open bar.  And that's just part of the problems.  When we talked to the manager afterwards, he tried to direct blame elsewhere and said that it was a large event and they worked their butts off.  Well it takes a lot of work to put on a reception and they do not have what it takes.  They were rude to us and our wedding planner before and after.  Again, they need to get the heck out of this business!!!This hotel has the potential to be very nice, however the rooms are very dirty, the linens on the bed where not clean and a blood spill by the pool unattended  will not bring us back.MAJOR SECURITY VIOLATIONI got a copy of my room key without they verifying me and my identification!!I won't go into the story so that no one else uses it but i was shocked!Also i requested a wake up call at 5am...................no call!Luckily i set my cell phone alarm clock.It was great experience.  Made full use of amenities.  Joseph was friendly, inviting and informative. I would definitely stay there againRoom and bathroom were clean.Nice balcony over looking the cityBooked using hotel tonight and price was great!Thanks for a wonderful timeI stayed at the Tower Hotel because it was recommended to me by a friend. They had stayed there when it was ran by Marriot. You can still see the Marriot sign on the side of the building, it looks like its just been covered up with brown paper bags. It looks pretty bad. I'm surprised Marriot hasn't taken it down. When I went to check into the room I was asked to come back in an hour or so. I couldn't check in because of an issue with the plumbing and water wasn't running in the rooms. I went back a second time and checked in without a problem. There is nothing really wrong with this hotel except for it being old and run down. You can easily see that at one time, it was a very nice place but that was awhile ago. I'd skip the  $10 breakfast buffet as it is nothing I'd pay ten bucks for ever again. Beverly's Pancake house is right across the street and that place was great. I will say the best part of the stay was the guy who made the omelets at the buffet. He was hilarious. He was very friendly and had a great personality and he stood out among fellow employees who provided a level of service that wasn't really bad... but wasn't all that great or memorable either. We were going to check out the hot tub but it wasn't working. The pool was super cold and overrun with kids so we skipped that too. If you want to use the internet, they charge by the day. It's only $5, which wouldn't have been bad if my internet stayed connected. All in all my experience at the Tower was meh. I had heard great things about it but my experience was disappointing.After a mix up at a hotel in Dallas, we were left without a room. We had a reservation for the next night at this hotel in Oklahoma city, so I called and told them our situation and asked if we could get an early check in if we went ahead and drove. And by early I meant 6 a.m. Joseph, the night clerk, was incredibly understanding and accommodating. He told me to drive safely and he would have a room ready for us when we got here. As soon as we walked in he handed us our key. We basically stayed 2 nights for the price of one. Not only that, it is a very nice hotel. Yes the lobby it is a little dated, but our room was updated and clean. The bed was Incredibly comfortable. And for the price of $69 you can't beat it. But honestly, the best part of this hotel was Joseph. He treated us with concern and care. If I come back to Oklahoma City I will stay here again without a doubt!I reserved this hotel through a Hotwire Deal and it was decent.  The room was nice enough, and the staff was helpful.  The wifi is only free for an hour, but I think it was free for me until I left the room and had to come back and reconnect...I was definitely connected for more than an hour.The hotel was close to a lot of necessary things and not very far from many of the tourist-y things that I wanted to do.  Parking is free and you can get a decent spot.The only issue for me was that the hotel smells slightly musty.  It wasn't just the room we had, the slight smell was all over the hotel.  I think they probably need to pull their carpets.Overall, I don't think I'd pay full price for this hotel, but it serves the purpose of a decent place to sleep if you get it via Hotwire or Priceline.p.s. Priceline lists this place as a 3 star, but Hotwire lists it as a 3.5 star.  I think it's more of a 2.75, thb. Better than Best Western, but not quite Marriott.Decent hotel for the price ($58/night booked the day of our stay through hotel tonight app).  Desk staff was not extremely during mix-up at check-in, which was slightly frustrating.  Comfy beds, nice lobby decor.  When the shower was running, water would bubble up into the sink, but I'm sure they can fix that.  I would stay again if I were passing through OKCThis is one the best hotels I ever stayed in. The customer service is extremely perfect! Everybody here made me feel really comfortable and felt like I knew them for years. This hotel should be ranked higher then it is. I am a contractor and I travel a lot and finding a decent priced hotel is extremely hard for me but they worked out a deal with me that really made my life easier. Every time I come back to Oklahoma I will definitely stay at this hotel. Joseph really helped me when I first arrived and he was really patient as well. Liam which is director of sales as incredibly polite and professional and treated me with respect. Cami is awesome! And many more of them. I have nothing other than good things to say about this hotel. This is the hotel you want to be in!!!Overall this was a decent hotel because I was in a pinch and needed a room at 10 o'clock at night. However, if I actually was going on vacation and was going to be staying in this hotel for the weekend I would definitely not recommend it. Although the rooms were decently clean they were definitely not clean. They had one little vent in the entire room to provide air-conditioning, which let me tell you, was not sufficient. They do not provide complementary breakfast in the morning which is fine but if you pay the original price than it is definitely not worth it. Additionally, Internet is not provided either and instead you have to pay for it each day which is billed to your room. The staff was very friendly and the hotel itself is very unique I believe it had a total of 15 floors which was kind of cool because you felt like you were in a old time hotel. Once again if I had to stay somewhere in a pinch this would definitely suffice however I would not stay in it for luxury or vacation.We booked this hotel through Hotwire while relocating cross country.  For the price we got (under $60 with taxes) it can't be beat.  However, that's pretty much where it ends with this place.The hotel is an old Marriott.  This is blatantly clear from the minute you drive up (the sign atop the building has been covered with a drop cloth, or something of that nature).  The lobby is clean, albeit dated.  It really is just screaming to be made over.  We had a room on the 3rd floor.  Thankfully the elevator ride was fine.  However, the minute we walked into the room, we were smacked in the face with a horrible, dank, damp smell.  It honestly smelled like the room hadn't been used in months.  We promptly ran the AC, which helped, but it lingered for the rest of the stay there (which was thankfully only one night).  The bathroom was dark-ish, dated, and the sink and vanity were completely separate from the toilet-shower (odd, and again, dated).  The room looked dark in comparison to the pictures shown here.  We had NO view at all of any part of the city; I feel like we were purposely put in some back room since we booked through hotwire.  I wish I had taken pictures of the gross dark film that was on the complementary bottles of shampoo, etc., but we were so disgusted that we immediately threw them in the trash.  The bed was comfortable, and after driving for 12 hours, I was grateful for that, but the room just kind of skeeved me out.  Again, after going out for dinner, we returned to the same damp smell the minute we entered the room.  In hindsight, we should've complained and asked to be moved, but again, we were exhausted, and honestly just wanted to sleep.We quickly left early the next morning, and to be honest, would not be returning, even if we did ever end up back in OKC.  Then again, unless they do a major overhaul, I really don't see this place being around for much longer.My wife and have stayed at this hotel for the past 15 years when visiting our grandkids in OKC. Our LAST 3 stays have been less than pleasant. Formally a Marriott property this place has really gone downhill. If you have a choice don't stay at this hotel. Management really sucks.Ahhhh, OKC you hold such surprises! One being this hotel, but more so, Price! Not the cost, which is very affordable but Price the bartender, give this guy a raise!! We found the hotel on priceline and got nice 12th floor king rooms for $70 a piece!! Nice staff, rip off breakfast prices but all in all a great experience. Thank you again Price for putting on the game, staying open for us and in general being an nice, fun guy. DOOO IIIIIITTTTT!!!!  GO DUCKS!!!Hotwire win. Super friendly staff and nice hotel, especially for the price. Bar had great lemon drop martinis.  Great location and free parking. Would stay again and be happy for another win via Hotwire hereRoom was good, could have been better but bed was comfortable and clean.  carpet seemed new.  this could be turned into a 4 or 5 star hotel very quickly, just get some bellhops and a concierge and valet parking.  room service delivered the best angus burger EVER.  staff was friendly and helpful.  at less than $100 a night its a bargain.  stayed in a corner king suite on the third floor.","We stayed here for the Oklahoma Dance Rush competition, so we received a reduced rate. Overall, it wasn't a bad stay, although it would have been nice if the restaurant was open later, rather than sending us into the lounge. The room was more spacious than I'd expect at the rate we paid, and I like that the sink was just outside of the bathroom/toilet, rather than crammed into the bathroom. A mini-fridge/microwave would have been nice for a longer stay, but for only two nights, I dint ask if they were available.I used a Groupon for an $88 (taxes included) two double bed room. The Tower Hotel is an old Marriott. I thought for sure that my Groupon room would be next to the elevator, but it was not. We were given a spacious corner room with a fantastic view of the city. My measure of a good room, clean bathrooms and bedding, earned the Tower Hotel five stars! On my way downstairs, for breakfast in the restaurant that was included in the price.Stayed here because they had very reasonable prices.  However, tub was dirty with stained streaks down the side- and a few of the towels smelled very musty.  Bed was very comfortable, sheets were nice and clean.This one star is only because the hotel employees seem excited that you are in the hotel.  Everyone we encountered was friendly.  When you walk into the rooms. there is an old, musty smell (I used rooms plural because we had to change rooms and both smelled the same way.  This hotel is in a state of disrepair.  I understand it was an old Marriot and it seems the owners are trying to revive it but it is just not working.  The walls and the rugs are dirty and spotted, the blanket on the bed was stained and the mattresses are so old and pressed down that the mattress covers sag on them.  We were most annoyed that the plumbing backs up and does not drain.  In our first room both the tub and the sink held the water form bathing and brushing our teeth for about an hour.  We asked to change rooms and when we showered the next night, this bathtub was worse.  I have been waiting two hours for my husband to shower and it has still not drained.  This in addition to the peeling wallpaper and marginal A/C system, we have had enough.  We would change rooms again but we are out of here tomorrow and will never come back - even if we are in OKC.Anything nice about this place is remaining from it's prior Marriott ownership. I stayed three nights.  The ONLY redeeming quality is that the service is nice... Not necessarily competent, or having a clue about service level, but yes - nice.  Red wine stains on room wall, the glass windows on my floor coming off the elevator were covered in grimy sticky hand prints and smears - for three days. TV was patchy service - weird internet ""disk full"" errors preventing watching. When I clicked on ""HBO"" I was routed to FOX news over and over again. Uh, no. No, no, and no. The restaurant is dark, old, mostly not even open, and depressing. Closest place to walk to for a drink is Hooters. And next door is 7-11 for 3% sh1ty watery ""beer"". The hotel did roving fire alarm testing one day with no warning to guests. When it rolled around to my room someone knocked and without enough time for me to get off the bed and answer the door, a man actually ENTERED MY ROOM. WTF?!?! Get the F OUT OF HERE! Asked me, ""is the fire alarm going off?"" Uh, are fkin deaf?? No apology for entering my room without warning or permission. Ignorant hick idiots.Hard to find since there isn't any proper signage (being converted from a Marriott). The rooms are nice and big.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-oklahoma-city-north-oklahoma-city,Hilton Garden Inn Oklahoma City North,4.0,$$,15,"We spent one night at this hotel. The hotel staff is very nice  friendly and the amenities are very nice - business center, fitness room, pool etc. The staff is very friendly and welcoming.The hotel is close to the I-40 Turnpike and within a short walking distance to many restaurants so after a long trip you can just park your car and walk to have a bite to eat.The rooms have microwaves and refrigerators and the a/c unit worked well.Am giving them 5 stars because of the great way they handled a maintenance issue that we did not complain about until we were leaving. They apologized profusely, told us we definitely should have mentioned it (we did not want plumbers in our room late at night) and then after we filled out the customer survey they gave us 5000 points as a thank you for letting them know and how we treated them - nicely done all around!We could have dinged them a star because of the maintenance issue but you know stuff breaks. It is how it is handled that matters. Would definitely return.Gotta say that I love this place. I'm in hotels about 50% of the time while I travel on business.  Was so pleased to find a fun and energetic crew at the front desk when I checked in. They made a long day in meetings and driving in the car feel like a distant memory.  These things matter...But the one item that won me over? It was the free wifi with legitimate speeds.  Tonight I'm watching Orange is the new Black on my iPad in HD.  I'm a happy camper.  The Internet is free and fast here (for a hotel).Confirmed download speeds over 5 MBPSWonderful stay here! Very clean and very nice staff!! Would definitely stay here again!Very clean and quiet rooms.  Great amenities, good rest.  Had to leave before breakfast, but early coffees and tea was available.  Breakfast is 06-1000 Mon-Sun.After our pleasant last stay here, we were happy to stay again. We love the hotel, the cleanliness, the great staff, and the price is the same as others. We usually stay at a nearby Hyatt, but they almost always have a soccer or softball team staying there and it is noisy all night. Noise has not been a problem at this Hilton GI. Once you figure out some of the street shortcuts in the neighborhood, it is a pleasant place to stay with good access to the City. Having said all of those nice things, I now find out they no longer have complimentary breakfast. Last time, we had cold cereal, coffee, etc that was comp, but now they want $9.95 per person for a breakfast. We don't eat much breakfast and will not spend that amount of money for a bowl of cereal. I guess we'll be looking for a different hotel for future stays.I love this hotel and the wonderful staff, especially the breakfast crew!  Rooms are nice size (I always get a junior suite) and parking is good.BUT, the swimming pool is absolutely wonderful and a good reason for staying her by itself!  Overall an excellent value for a good solid quality hotel.  FEE wifi also with a microwave and refrigerator in each suite!Our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn could have been better. The air conditioner did not keep our room very cool and it was difficult to get a good nights sleep. The pillows were not very comfortable. Breakfast was also just ok. I did like the waffles quite a bit. The staff was aces, all nice folks. The room was nice, we enjoyed the pool and the hot tub. I would stay here again, but I might bring my own pillow next time.This hotel was great. My hubby &amp; I were in town for a wedding and this was the hotel the couple had reserved for guests to stay at (a group rate of 89 plus tax-which included a breakfast buffet for two). We checked in Saturday at 4pm(although check in starts at 3pm) and we were given the room we requested, one kind bed. It was clean and quiet-just what we like. We didn't spend too much time at the hotel but it was nice while we were there. The beds are really comfy. They have a dial on either side of them to where you can adjust it to be softer or more firm(that was nice!) We both slept really great and before heading home we enjoyed our breakfast buffet for two. The buffet was included in our room rate but typically it's an additional 9.95 per person. I don't know if we would have purchased it if it wasn't included(we typically are not big breakfast eaters) but none the less, it was good. They will make you omelets(made to order, your way) &amp; they also have a waffle maker, biscuits &amp; gravy, oatmeal, fruit, bacon, sausage, eggs, cereal, coffee, orange juice, water, etc to choose from. It was quite the breakfast buffet spread. The only downside to this hotel is that they don't have an outdoor pool. Since the wedding was a 7:30pm start time, I wanted to lay out by the pool for a bit after we arrived. I got dressed and headed downstairs only to find a indoor pool. I imagine that's good for families in the winter time,  but it would have been nice to lay out/swim outside &amp; enjoy the warm summer weather. It wasn't a big deal and wouldn't detour me from staying here again but just a small inconvenience. Overall, a great hotel. I would definitely stay here again!Always love hilton. Fresh cookies and water at arrival. Great fitness area. Very clean!The service and accommodations were really great.  With as much as I travel, I want consistency and value.  I can count on another location to add to my list on where I will be staying.Excellent staff, friendly and helpful. Adequate rooms with comfortabel beds and desk chairs. Food is adequate!  Good accomodations for the price and locations.New, clean, inexpensive and good service. 5 stars for me.Love the evolution beds and their chairs.  This hotel never fails!  Everyone of these hotels I have been to have a hot tub, pool, and an exercise room that consists of more than just cardio, they have some weights.  They seem to have pretty decent prices, usually can get a room for less than 120/night.This place is bad.The staff is nice, but useless, they are apologetic for all the errors they can't do anything about.(Vending machines not filled, no change for the toll roads, no cleaners for the gym, you're not allowed to sit on this side of the lobby because they're going to vacuum in the next hour (???) etc.)I'm here on business and my team got back from a dinner late around 12:30, we went up to my room and were talking and we got multiple noise complaints.  This might indicate that we were really loud, but I was awoken the night before by an overly sneezy man.  Long story short, there is NO sound baffling.The exercise room has no exhaust so is utterly uncomfortable if there is more than one person in it.If you travel for a living do yourself a favor and avoid this place.Me and my family were staying for a week and on the last night we were sleeping, the lights in the bathroom turned off twice and somebody or something tapped my foot twice when we were sleeping. But other than that the hotel was great specially the jacuzzi.",,,,,"['spent', 'night', 'hotel', 'hotel', 'staff', 'nice', 'friendly', 'amenities', 'nice', 'business', 'center', 'fitness', 'room',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/bricktown-hotel-and-convention-center-oklahoma-city-2,Bricktown Hotel & Convention Center,2.5,$$,36,"Booked on hotwire.  When we rolled up, we were immediately apprehensive.  It's in a shady part of town... NOT Bricktown.  I think they must've mispelled Brixton.  It probably wasn't really all that unsafe.  We were mostly worried about our car getting broken into or stolen overnight.  The manager was VERY polite and generous in contacting hotwire and authorizing our cancellation and refund.I could give this place no stars I would. This hotel wasn't even rentable in my opinion. It was under construction and honestly looked like nobody was even working, let alone staying there. It was like a scene out of The Walking Dead. As I walked down the dark corridor of stained carpet, paint peeled doors, and exit signs hanging by their wires, I was thinking I should just cut my losses. When I finally got to the room, it wasn't horrible inside, but I definitely didn't have a good feeling about it. There was an old aluminum sliding glass door to the outside courtyard that looked more like a prison yard. The sliding the door didn't even lock. I called the front desk and they told me there was a bar I could put across it. I did that, but the bar didn't work either and it still left a 8 inch opening that anyone could slip through. To make it worse I cut my finger on aluminum bar. I went to the bathroom to wash my finger and I saw bedbugs on the ground by the door.At that point I just called the cab dropped me off and went straight back to the airport and booked the Quality Inn for $69. It was quiet and clean, very nice. They only charged me for one night stay even though I stayed for two because I told him the story about the previous hotel.I didn't even bother complaining to the Bricktown Hotel. It wouldn't of done me any good night and even pay for the room, a client paid for it, that's another epic story.It's a bad sign when your cab drops you off at your hotel and you think, ""So where is the hotel?"" and an even worse sign when you walk into the hotel and think ""So where is the check-in desk?"" So the adventure began...What initially drew me to the hotel was the shuttle service. The hotel offers a shuttle to take you to and from anywhere in the downtown OKC/Bricktown area. On the weekends, the shuttle runs 24 hours. I also read that the biscuits and gravy included in the complimentary breakfast was pretty tasty, which I found to be true. I give one star for the shuttle service and biscuits and gravy.  Now, the drawbacks:Like I mentioned earlier, the hotel layout is beyond strange. The vibe is weird and the convention center that the hotel is combined with seems like it hosts only low-end about-to-go-out-of-business businesses. Every time I walked to and from my hotel room and through the convention center, it felt eerily empty and a little unsettling. I actually video recorded the walk from the hotel entrance to my room to send to my husband because I couldn't really explain to him in words what the whole experience was like. When I opened the door to my hotel room, the room smelled like cigarette smoke, even though it was a non-smoking room. I asked the front desk to double-check that my room had not been smoked in. One of the supervisors walked with me to my room, smelled inside, and said ""Oh, that's the smell of the new carpet and furniture we just put in this room"". So, not wanting to be difficult, I accepted the smell and stayed in the room. Taking a shower was unpleasant. The shower was warm but not hot. I always thought hotels' hot water supply was abundant, but apparently not. At least I got a warm shower. My friend staying in another room took a shower a few hours later and said that his water was ice cold. The next day, I removed the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign from my door at 11am. When I came back to my room at 6pm, my room wasn't cleaned. In my opinion, that is plenty of time for a room to be cleaned. Another minor issue was that only one of my lamps worked. I could have called the front desk and considering that the staff was very friendly, I am sure they would have sent someone to change the bulbs. It's more principle than anything. It would have been nice if they checked to make sure all the bulbs worked before putting me in that room. I don't plan on ever staying here again nor recommending this place to any of my friends or family. My advice is to spend a little more money (my friends paid $10 more per night to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn) and stay at a nicer place that is ACTUALLY in Bricktown (not 2 miles from it).Needs to be shut down!!!!!!!!!!I left! Dont stay here!!!! Scary place!!!!!!!!Hallways were trashed, walls were dusty, carpets are nothing you would ever want to step on, bed had metal bars sticking out hidden under the bedspread which I hit my leg on. There are no maids  just men who look like druggies fixing toilets etc. The downstairs bathroom was broken and the lights didn't work and they were having a large show. This is a very very scary building in which no one cares about and should be shut down. Do not say here!!!! Man at the front desk was a saint and works under horrible circumstances.We were very displeased with our stay at Bricktown Hotel &amp; Convention center. Positives - The staff was friendly. They accommodated our large group well. The shuttle service was great and took us anywhere we wanted to go. They had no fitness center but the shuttle service could take you to a center and work out  for free. We were one of 5 families to stay Fourth of July weekend. Negatives - The location seemed less than safe. We drove up to see boarded up windows which were supposedly due to renovations. The carpet was gross. The bed was super uncomfortable. The pool wasn't open the first day we arrived. There were gnats everywhere. The shower had little pressure and I found it hard getting hot water for a shower, instead it was semi-hot. Breakfast was subpar, even though they had lots of options. Amenities were not good options. Even though they were doing renovations they haven't bothered to replace a window that looks like it had been shot. Bottom line is we would never suggest this hotel to any friend or family member.OMG I still can't believe I stayed here...All I can remember is that Musty smell! I guess looking at the price would tell you it's not going to be the best hotel. Stayed here for New Years with friends (all the other hotels were booked or overpriced) and right when I walked in I thought I was going to pass out. Our heater wasn't working but they came to fix that right away. The workers here were great, which is why this got 2 stars.Complimentary Breakfast: Meh, again you get what you pay for. Good amount of choices, don't expect anything fresh. Shuttles were convenient, especially if you want to have a good time at the bars!Overall I wouldn't stay here again but if you want a cheap hotel and don't mind the smell this could be what you want. It did have a good sized room and bathroom, but don't expect the best quality, this hotel has been here for a while and you can tell, old school!I try to save money for the non-profit I run but do have some standards: I've told my assistant to look places that have ""no roaches and no hookers."" I didn't see either at this place. The staff was friendly and helpful. The problem: the place is just creepy. Like really, really creepy. Like thinking an axe murderer is going to pop out. On a Thursday evening, there appeared to be fewer than ten guests in the place. Many windows were boarded up. There's lots of litter (cigarette buts and vapor canisters) around.  There were bikers too. Anyway, I guess it's cheap. Otherwise, I just wouldn't reccomend.When you near this place, you really should listen to the voice in your head that says: Just keep moving, no need to stop here.  Perhaps it once had a heyday, perhaps it once flourished with guests.  But now from its exterior, all one can see is a sad building with boarded up windows (I counted over a dozen!) and a shabby parking lot.  It does offer a shuttle service to downtown and its employees are pleasant, but it does not offer the visitor an appearance of safety.  For that reason alone we switched to another hotel in the heart of Oklahoma City.  Thankfully, they willingly cancelled our reservation.  A little paint, some plants, and fixed windows might restore some dignity to this establishment.Marginal at best. Literally being refurbished while guests still there. No guy should bring his woman there. Legitimately scary. Siding was being torn down while i stayed there. Remodeling is half way done. They are trying to squeeze more cash from it while it is a dump. Locals were surprised i would stay in such a dangerous area. Nice breakfast service and front desk staff.I really wish I could rate this zero stars. I don't ever say that either. This place is a dump. Going through renovation or not. Hairs on the sheets, yellow stains, nasty smells. Not cool. I booked 3 nights here and left 10 minutes after I arrived. I told the front desk about my issues and he didnt even seem to care. I even felt that he was used to hearing what i had to say and was prepared to hear it. Please, PLEASE avoid this place.This was a very nice stay for myself and my bf. The room was well appointed and the finishing touches were beautiful. They really did up the room with faux rose petals and had a lot of faux flowers in the room, which may seem tacky but it wasn't. It really was well thought up. There was a lovely jacuzzi tub in the living room area of the hotel suite we had and a nice love seat with a coffee table and tv. The bedroom had a huge California king bed and flat screen tv. We didn't have their free breakfast buffet so I can't comment on that. Noise level was average during the evening and somewhat loud in the afternoon.Downsides: The outside hot tub and pool were very dirty and in no way inviting.The lamp in the bedroom was broken (as in the actual glass) which could have posed a real hazard and it was pretty evident that they already were aware of this as there was tape on part of it and it was strategically placed so that you couldn't tell right away. That was tacky! Just replace the lamps people. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but still was nice. No fan though so that was a bit odd. I think with some minor upgrades this could be a easy 5 star updated review but for now 4 stars. I may return in the near future. It was a nice stay and the bed was really comfortable.Not very pleased with my stay at the Bricktown Hotel.  The staff was very friendly on check in.  But, when I arrived at my room, the wheels fell off.  First of all, there was no luggage rack in my room.  This is maybe a first for me, I can't recall being in a hotel before without a place for your luggage.  The shower was one of the worst I've had at a hotel.  The water was either freezing or scalding, I tried about every permutation of the hot/cold levels and couldn't get it to stay on warm.  So, what was intended to be a relaxing shower turned into a strategy session on trying to catch the water for the 5 seconds when it was a proper temperature before it returned to either skin blistering hot or incredibly cold.I will say the air conditioner worked very well, the room got cold, which I prefer.  Also, the bed was comfortable enough, it wasn't the best hotel bed I've slept on, but I've definitely had a lot worse.  The property as a whole isn't fancy, and it's a little dated, but I found it to be clean.  A lot of yelpers mention the 24/7 shuttle to Bricktown.  I didn't need it, but it's my understanding that's a great draw for this place.  I will say I saw the shuttles used quite a bit.I will not stay here again....ever.  rooms are about same but...city moved greyound bus stTion across the street.  Now degenerates and hookers seem to frequent the area.  My husband and I were in the lobby waiting on a pizza delivery when a skinny mostly undressed woman wandered in with her blue jean shorts unbuttoned , walked past the front desk and right to the bathroom in the hall. Not one person  said a word to her.  She was in the bathroom for a few minutes, came out and then walked back across the street to a truck stop.  No I don't know for sure she was a prostitute but if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, ..etc...A great value for the money. The shuttle service is every bit as good as it sounds. Friendly staff, clean rooms. Decor is dated, but you're not staying here for the decor. Continental breakfast was sparse -- could use at least some hard-boiled eggs to bump up the protein. But it's free!Bed was hard as a rock. That's the ONLY negative. It is dated but in a clean and charming way. The courtyard is beautiful. The pool area looks great (it was raining so we didn't get to go in) a little 1 foot deep pool for the little ones. The staff is stellar. The front desk directed me calmly and clearly when I got lost by my map app. The breakfast attendants were charming and made conversation with one of the long term guests. I overheard two families talking about their babies in the NICU. you know it has to be good for them to stay for weeks right?Nothing fancy but the beds were comfy, the showers were hot with great pressure. No bed bugs, very clean rooms. What more do you want for $70?. Plus they are pet friendly. The breakfast wasn't anything special but it worked.This was a great place to stay while my boyfriend and I were visiting from Hawaii.The rooms were simple and practical for our stay, and we never had any problems.  We had never been to Oklahoma before so the fact that they had free shuttle service which ran 24/7 was very helpful.  We caught a OKC Thunder game and parking would have been a nightmare, the shuttle service was a life saver!  The drivers were really friendly and gave us great suggestions of where to go and where to eat in the city.  Complimentary breakfast was minimal, but then again, it is simply that, complimentary!  The place also had a cute little bar, which is only open on the weekends.  Would be nice to get that thing running more days in the week, but luckily, we were there a Saturday night, so we were able to stop by for a quick drink.  Overall, was definitely please with my stay here and would recommend this place to others!do not stay here, bed bugs everywhere, really awful.  no one cares.  friend got really sick and had to go to er.  awful, awful.save your money, do not stay here.This was kind of a dump. The staff was friendly when checking in but the rest of this 'hotel' was kinda sketchy. It's essentially a motel with a convention center. Room was kinda dirty, there were some weird people sleeping in their car outside and we saw several animals in our room. Wasn't really a good night's rest and we'll never be back again.I've stayed here twice. The first time was terrible! I was on the first floor and it was during cricket season. There were dead crickets in the light fixtures, crickets in my room and when I got home, I discovered a dead cricket in my suit case. They just crawled right under my door. This year was different. I requested a room on the second floor and NO CRICKETS!!! The towels are very crunchy and there's a big stain on my mattress and sheets. However, the room has a great little kitchen and the staff is very friendly.","So I get FINALLY get a response a YEAR LATER saying that my review could not have possible be true to the treatment I received because of the reception's name! Ha. Well, that might not have been the person's name, but that's the name they gave me. Horrible customer service STILL! Who takes a year to remedy something customer service related anyhow?Ya know, I had many names for that front desk clerk, but I chose to use the one she gave me.My employer still avoids booking this place for any business stays.Terrible experience never ends!Staff was awesome.  Rooms are clean but not much to look at. Fairly priced considering the close proximity to bricktown.  Shuttle service gets 5 stars.  Front desk was awesome. Had a very expensive camera and the shuttle let us drop it off and they put it in my room for me! Hallways are super dark with very low lights. Looks sketchy on the sides of hotel but still a decent place. Will definitely return, love love the shuttle for safe return after party night!We stayed at Bricktown Hotel when I was moving across the country from Chicago to the Bay Area. We looked up hotels on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbringfido.com&amp;s=f257a9c9fd11a5408c515fecd64c0d1ad8672bae87cf4c3fb101def782ccef74"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bringfido.com</a> since I was moving with my dog and found this hotel. I spoke with Mary to make the reservation and she was extremely friendly both on the phone and in person. The hotel has a nice big courtyard for dogs to do their business and to sniff around. We ended up walking around the whole courtyard about 10 times for exercise. The room was big and clean, although the sliding glass door to the courtyard seemed like it could have been more secure, but maybe that's just me. Breakfast was good  and had a lot of options- there was a lady making waffles and they had oatmeal! which is not something every hotel breakfast offers. I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone not looking for a lot of frills, traveling through with a dog. Again, I have to mention how great Mary was.Great deal in ok. On our way to Austin. Close to freeway and free 24 hour shuttle to bricktown. Free breakfast.  Clean rooms   Had to deal with prom teenagers at 2amClean but VERY old! This is a huge place but I wonder how many people actually stay here?? Close to the downtown area with shuttle service [although I didn't use it]. Service was nice and friendly. Our room was decent- a chair had a broken leg and you couldn't sit in it without tipping. The room looks super old and with random pieces of furniture. It's like they try to update a piece but the overall look is not the best. It was clean and we felt safe overall.Nice pool area.Continental breakfast in the morning was ok.Pretty nice place to stay around the downtown Oklahoma City area. We were passing by the area and stayed the night here ($90 with tax and fees). Everything was nice and clean. Our room had a king bed, mini fridge, TV, desk, mirror and free wifi. Also it was nice that the AC was already on and working when we came in because it was hot outside. If you're looking to go downtown to Bricktown, they have a free shuttle service that takes you there and back. Good place for a decent price.Ths place is beyond good. Clean , friendly n surprisinfly cheap. It was 80 bucks! You will not find anything safer and better. They have regular shuttles to the bars.This hotel has everything I needed.  The free shuttle was great for my cou rsins wedding.  Yes, they are in the middle of a renovation.  The neighborhood is not as bad as the other reviewers have said.  There is a waffle house across the street and a diner/truck stop as well.  The rooms are clean and the staff was polite and always available.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  It's off the freeway, but that makes it easier to find your way around.  I would stay here again.My friends and I went to OKC for a friend's wedding, and we found Bricktown Hotel through <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhotels.com&amp;s=60cfdf5295efb33462de6ebea0116718a20aa78f43bff757c877c3db312aed4c"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">hotels.com</a>. We decided on Bricktown Hotel for their competitive pricing; it was just half the price of the hotels in the main downtown/bricktown area. Plus it was only a hop and a skip away from downtown, where the wedding took place. When we first saw the hotel from the street view, it looked ghetto and nothing like the pictures we saw online. Thankfully, ghetto it was not, and it only looked drab from the side street view. In fact, the interior is pleasant and I really liked Bricktown Hotel. All the hotel employees were really nice and helpful, and our room was clean. Our double queen room had all the amenities you'd expect (desk, coffee machine, microwave, mini fridge, TV, closet space with hangers, iron and ironing board, full-length mirror, hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner/soap/lotion, and towels). There was also free wifi and free bottled water. The beds were softer than I like, but generally pretty comfortable. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oqmGzTqBr_Xm_CvjLrRnzw?select=-Y9Qw4e5LQ-BkbvmYbWrTw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/oqmG...</a>One of the best features of Bricktown Hotel is their free shuttle service. It runs 24 hrs and did I mention it's free?! There's even a VIP hummer if you want to feel special. <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oqmGzTqBr_Xm_CvjLrRnzw?select=4uz_A9oynsPXhiz21HpJow"">yelp.com/biz_photos/oqmG...</a> Since the main downtown OKC area is about 2 miles from the hotel, we took advantage of the free shuttle service. It's especially convenient if you plan on partying downtown at night. The drivers that we encountered were all really friendly. It's not required but don't forget to tip the drivers! They also have shuttle service running to and from the airport every 3 hours for $15. My advice is to take the shuttle service to the airport unless you have at least 3 people to split a cab. If you have 3 or 4 people to split a cab, it'll be cheaper than $15/person. Another great thing about Bricktown Hotel is their complimentary continental breakfast. They have all the basics like cereal and milk, bagels, yogurt, instant oatmeal, juice, coffee and tea. They also make fresh waffles upon order, and they have fresh biscuits and gravy. The breakfast ends at 10AM so make sure you get there before then if you plan on eating breakfast at the hotel. But never fear! There's a Waffle House across the street if you don't make it to breakfast (or if you get the late night munchies).I was also impressed that the hotel had it's own fully stocked bar and a clean outdoor pool. We didn't have time to take advantage of either but both were unexpected and a great addition to the hotel. If I visit OKC again, I'll definitely be staying at Bricktown Hotel. It's really a great deal: friendly, convenient, and affordable.4 words..... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!! If you're asking for details then go ahead and waste your money.Went there during the St. Paddy's day weekend.  The place does not look that appealing from the outside but it's a lot nicer on the interior and the free shuttle is the best reason to stay there.  Even had the owner drive the shuttle once on Paddy's day, says something about him right there.  It did turn into a bit of a party hotel on Paddy's day night but that can either be a good, bad, or don't care thing.  The price wasn't too bad either plus they had a breakfast in the morning.  And they allow pets.  My only beef with the hotel is that the free wifi was completely useless.  The signal was so poor it wouldn't even connect.I recently stayed at this hotel this past weekend for a business convention and I can honestly say, by far this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in!!! I used my CLC Lodging card to get a discounted rate, only to find out that when they tried to process it the day before check out, it wouldn't process. Rather than calling me and letting me know there was a problem, our room keys were de-activated and we weren't allowed to get back into our room. Tom, the owner, was by far the rudest, most obnoxious person I've ever met!!! He treated my roommates and I like we were criminals! The transaction issue was just a simple credit card info update. The only thing that saves Tom and keeps his hotel running is his friendly staff. They were very nice and patient with us, however, I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and neither will my business team!!! Tom just lost a ton of customers!I was at a sporting event that had a deal on rooms with this hotel.  OK - appearance.  First, this is at least a mile from Bricktown - not sure how they got the name.  This is an OLD motel.  Cleanliness is so-so.  The beds looked saggy and the tile in the bathroom wasn't something you want to put your feet on - moldy tile in the bath / shower.  Topper...no hot shower.  We could get hot water from the tub spout but it was ICE cold in the shower.  Secondly, sleep.  Got none.  I had my kids with me and there were parties all around us and above us.  At 3:30am, my kids were scared to death when people were pounding on the walls from the party as well a woman screaming HEATHER done the hall for at least 10 minutes.  The party upstairs was obviously a large amount of people.  And, you could here them in the bathroom - I won't say anything more.  Called the desk at least three times about the parties and yes security guards came to find HEATHER but couldn't seem to figure out the huge party upstairs from us.  So we were awake much of the night.  So...to sum it up, this is the party headquarters.  Probably great for those that don't want sleep, don't need a clean room and need a ride to the party at Bricktown.  Otherwise, this is not a hotel for family or anyone needing a nights sleep.This hotel is very clean and the staff is very kind. The shuttle service was  excellent and was very convienent.This was a pretty nice hotel to stay at.  They're in the middle of renovating and we got one of their older rooms but they weren't too bad considering.  I can only imagine that the newer rooms must be pretty nice.  The biggest selling feature of this hotel is its proximity to downtown OKC.  They had a very convenient 24-hour shuttle that would bring you to and from downtown.  This alone makes the hotel worth staying at since you can drink when you get there and not worry about getting a DUI, or have to drive around endlessly for a parking spot and/or pay for parking.With that said, the shuttle drivers need a little work with being a little aggressive in their driving.  They should drive a little more defensively and not take corners so quickly.  It seemed like it was just a job for them.  Not that we're royalty but a little more cheeriness would work wonders.  As I said, the rooms themselves were pretty okay.  But the bed was a little too firm for our liking (some people like them firm and if so, you'll have no problems).We didn't utilize them but there's a continental breakfast from 6-10 am and an outdoor pool. They have free WiFi and two wired computers to use in the lobby as well as a fully stocked bar (we didn't go the bar but I think he closes shop if there's a long run of no customers at night).  Would recommend staying here.This hotel is a Diamond in the Rough! I've stayed here on a few occasions and have always had a good experience. When you first pull up to the hotel you might be a little bit apprehensive to stay. They aren't in a great area of Bricktown/Downtown (it's more industrial) but they do have security for their guests parking vehicles and added security on the weekends. They aren't in the heart of bricktown either.... they are located just a mile east off of the main road that goes into Bricktown (Reno). Because of this they have FREE 24 hr shuttle service to and from the heart of Bricktown AND to a lot of other attractions in Okc. You can use the shuttles as often as you like and not have to worry about paying for parking in Bricktown or getting lost if you're unfamiliar with the city. When I stayed here the shuttle drivers were pretty funny and friendly and seemed to be speedy. I tipped em a couple bucks and they kept me happy.   I didn't get to use it, but the hotel has a pool that looked crystal clear and actually has a deep end. There is also a small 1ft deep baby pool. The pools are in a very large grassy courtyard in the middle of the hotel property. It's a nice spot to sit and get fresh air without having to go ""outside"" of the hotel....and if you have kids there's enough room for them to throw a ball around and keep occupied.   The most important thing to note about this hotel is the room. It was very clean and nice. The hotel is in close proximity to I-40 so you would think the highway would be loud but it wasn't a problem. I think Reno separates the hotel from the highway, creating a small buffer for noise. I have slept well everytime. The beds are pretty comfy too! When you wake up there is a complimentary breakfast with Waffles, Biscuits and gravy, cereal, yogurt, juice, coffee etc. That alone made the price of the room worth it for me. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day! All in all...it's worth it to stay here and you will be satisfied. Orrr you can check prices for a hotel closer into Bricktown but they all were around 100 bucks more per night when I looked. I will definitely be back!",,,,"['booked', 'rolled', 'immediately', 'apprehensive', 'shady', 'part', 'town', 'think', 'must', 'probably', 'really', 'unsafe', 'mostly', 'worried', 'car', 'getting',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/best-western-saddleback-oklahoma-city,Best Western Saddleback,3.0,$$,20,"Why the bad reviews? Our experience was great. Large, clean, updated room. Friendly staff, dog friendly and only charges $25 pet fee for two dogs. Free breakfast, great location, great price.This place looks like an older hotel that they updated. The log cabin motif is cute. It's a three story place with room doors facing out towards the parking lots, which may turn off some. Located right off of I-40, it's not close to the downtown area. It's geared towards people like myself who are just passing through. Our room was decent, if a little musty. It was spacious and had it's own safe and mini-fridge. Beds were fairly firm, with plenty of thick, soft pillows.There's plenty of parking around the hotel, which was great since we had a big 27 foot rental truck we were driving. There's an outdoor pool that I didn't get to check out because we arrived late. Somewhere in the building there was a fitness room too. The hotel restaurant was closed on the Sunday we arrived. But there are several places within a quarter mile, mostly chain restaurants and fast food joints. There's also a strip club within walking distance. Giddyup.Plus Stars are given for the fact that they did have a room when we called ahead for late check in and the guy at the desk was nice. I personally think since this is advertised as a conference center that the desk clerk must've gone to some serious Nina training on how to stay positive in a dismal situation.The bed was comfortable which is great. I turned the fan on and it was really loud, but that ended up being a bonus to help drown out the sound from the big trucks rolling by on I-40.The pictures listed on others comments are accurate, but they can't convey the strong musty ""I've got to cover up something with fabreeze so no one knows"" type of odor. It is strong!!One reviewer described the square uncomfortable pillows. True. The parking lot of this ""six acre facility"" (which is how the desk clerk sold his spin) was  absolutely full. Had to park on the fringes of this ponderosa and darn if I didn't forget something in the car and had to go back!All in all I love staying in Best Western Hotels, but this one steer clear of if you Yelp before you book.""Meh.. there have to be better options nearby!""Customer Service: 0 starsI called ahead to notify the hotel we'd be arriving late and after being placed on a long hold I was simply told that they would hold the room and asked when I would be arriving. Being on a long road trip, we didn't know exactly WHEN we'd be arriving. Once we finally arrived in the wee hours of the morning - exhausted from our travels - the person at the front desk explained that he'd already run the audit so he couldn't check us in but he saved the room - as if he was doing us a favor?! I had already prepaid for the room and called ahead to confirm a late check-in so I did not appreciate the front desk person making it sound like I was inconveniencing him. Room: 1 starOne star given for what appeared to be at least a clean bed. Nothing special. The room did have a flat screen tv, microwave, and mini fridge but I didn't need any of these additional amenities. All I wanted was a nice, hot shower. Bathroom: 0 starsThe shower head was broken and pointed at the floor of the tub, unable to be directed upward without holding it. No points scored for customer service here either in that the front desk staff seemed unconcerned about the shower situation. Noise Level: 0 starsThe walls seem to be incredibly thin based on the fact we could hear the traffic buzzing by. So much for a quality night of rest!I will come stay at this hotel every time I come to OKC. The staff have been amazing. I ordered room service when I got back from work. Chocolate cake, burger whatever you get will be great from the restaurant. The front desk staff was very friendly and even helped me fix my glasses after they broke. Clean rooms, near highway but not noisy though I'm a hard sleeper. Check it out. It will defiantly be worth it. I'd give 5 stars but the doors aren't enclosed in the building, though I was able to get from my car to my room quick. Totally worth it. Oh!!! They have a good free breakfast too!Ignore all the old reviews! This hotel has recently had a complete brand new remodel! A conference hotel with tons of amenities, it has the coolest cowboy theme throughout complete with saddles for bar stools at the hotel bar! YeeHaw! Cowboy Cool! My hubby &amp; I recently relocated here to OKC. Before our arrival, we researched all the OKC hotels online, then, upon arrival, walked into a few we decided not to stay at and the only two we would stay at, was this place and the Skirvin downtown, which is double in price but has the same amenities. Except Saddleback has a sauna!!!This hotel is a gem! Like I said, I think it's one of the top two places to stay in OKC for many reasons.   First of all the rooms are giant &amp; the beds are super comfy. Its close to downtown, the airport, tons of restaurants, has free parking &amp; wifi. The staff is super friendly from the front desk to the housekeeping.  The outdoor pool is lovely, at night it changes colors which is cool if you got a room facing the pool or happen to be in the restaurant that overlooks it.  The restaurant is Cowboy romantic cool looking with all these twinkly lights &amp; has a breakfast bar in the mornings with better than average breakfast items. Eggs, bacon, biscuits &amp; gravy, hash browns, fresh cut up fruit, strawberries, all kinds of YUM!  Same thing with the lunch and dinner buffets.  The salad bar is great!  We got all moved into our new flat &amp; we are still goin back to the salad bar to have their super fresh salad fixings and homemade soups! It opens everyday for dinner at 5pm &amp; its $6.99! You better get there quick too bc the yummy homemade chicken noodle soup the ladies there make goes quick! I was there one day by 5:30pm and it was all gone! :((  the potato soup they make is killer as well! YUM! :)'Turns out we are not the only ones that thinks this place rocks! The bar/restaurant has a ton of local followers! I was hanging at the hotel bar, Rustlers, sitting on the saddle, waiting on hubby coming cross town talking to all the regulars, turns out b4 it was remodeled it used to be a karaoke bar every night of the week, now it's a karaoke bar just on the weekends.  They even open up a small dance floor just for us singing &amp; dancing queens! LOL They have trivia you can play at the bar &amp; they play a killer mix of classic country music!!! There is also a giant flat screen to watch the games ;) They make this drink called the lotus punch. Turns out it has 5 liquors in it! Take my advice, do not drink 3 of those while sitting on the saddle! The only time I ever fell off my horse! Gives ""Getty up"" a whole new meaning, more like, Getty up off the floor please! LOL  Happy hour starts everyday at 5:30pm to 7pm with $150 drafts and free Hors d'oeuvres! Every day there is something different. One day they had these little mini chili burritos OMG omygawd, OMG they were so YUMMY! I have been asking for them every time I go now! ""Please put these on the appetizer MENU Saddleback executive chef so I will stop driving your hotel staff crazy about them!!"" LOL Several regulars at the bar were also having the quesadillas, they were all raving about them even though I have not had one yet! ;) They even have room service! And they don't have a 20% upcharge for bringing the food to your room like other hotels! WOW! :))The hot tub area is badass! It is a really cool space with a Sauna!!!! The sauna rocks! You go in there after a full day on your feet hit the hot tub after! Talk about sleep like a baby! YeeHaw is right! Awesome! :)) The executive gym is small but it has everything you need to get a good workout. It's the cutest little room with two giant flat screens &amp; a fireplace!  For a giant room, killer breakfast, salad bar, themed country bar with fun locals and great music, killer bar food &amp; fun drinks, free room service, awesome pool, hot tub, sauna, gym, free parking &amp; wifi, friendly service with a smile around $100 bucks a night, you just can't beat it with a stick! lol I highly recommend this hotel for overall quality, value/price, location, service &amp; amenities.When my friends come to town this is where I am putting them! ""Thanks for having us, we truly enjoyed our couple days stay at the Saddleback. Wish I would have discovered you sooner!""We will be back in the near future (happy hour) so please don't forget to put those super delish mini chili burritos on the appetizer menu for us hungry singing &amp; dancing Saddleback cowboys &amp; cowgirls!"" YeeHaw! Happy trails to you until we meet again! ;)Pretty clean room but old. Some Beds have a cup to them. Changed their pillows to little squares &amp; they're awful. Need to update their breakfast bar - had same stuff on it for 5+ years! Good place to take dogs.The highlights of the hotel include an awesome breakfast buffet, clean beds, spacious vanity area, new tv, mini fridge and microwave. Rooms are accessed from the parking lot, and I usually prefer to stay in hotels that require you to enter through the lobby, but that's a personal preference. The hotel is a little dated from the outside and the parking lot was extremely full when we got in. We had to park rather far away from our door. Didn't get a chance to use the pool.Was perfect for small vacation with a bunch of teenagers.  Everyone liked their rooms.  Nice decor, newer decor.  Perfect location, highway didn't bother anyone.  Other guest sure enjoyed the pool.  Good price.This hotel does not have the free wifi they advertise. I was able to use it for 20 minutes before it quit working. I tried reconnecting and, turning my devices wifi on an off, and had no luck for over 20 minutes before calling the front desk. I was told their wifi at the front desk was working fine and if I just wait it should kick back on. My questioning was blocked and I was told ""it was the area"" and there was nothing they could do about it. When I finally was told the manager is the only one who could do something possibly, she said she'd tell the manager... When he comes back Monday morning, a day after my stay was going to end. If you can't provide wifi, don't advertise it and then treat me like an idiot for inquiring about it. It doesn't smell particularly pristine if you're sensitive to that and the outer perimeter room I have can hear all street noise as well as my neighbors.Travelling across the country with my pregnant wife, our dog and our cat.  This place was affordable, clean, roomy and perfect.  The complimentary breakfast buffet was nothing crazy, but was just what you want/need to fuel yourself up for a day filled with driving.I took a dip in the pool and relaxed in the spa/sauna at night.  Everything was well kept, neat and clean.  It's a good place for family and also great if you have pets.  Its probably one of the better places we've stayed with our pets, and the fact that it wasn't that expensive makes it even better.I noticed the Karaoke and I do remember walking past the bar thinking that it was pretty busy for a tuesday night, so the good things others here have posted about that seem to be accurate.Disgusting. Not worthy of even the BW name. Try ANYTHING else in town. Room Not updated. A dying cockroach on floor. Room smelled like it was smoked in for a decade.Lost a star for price......even though I loved this place it was still reeeally pricey.  I'll probably book elsewhere next year when I'm in town but this can be a backup because they have a great and really affordable restaurant, karaoke bar, nice pool, clean rooms....and queen beds! ..which even the Sheraton skimps out with fulls or doubles at best.  They also offer free shuttle to places within 3 miles so that was helpful for my quick trips to Walmart or the airport pick up/drop off.  If I weren't paying $120/night to he so far from downtown this would be top on my list!!  I'd rather just pay $150ish to be right downtown.Avoid at ALL costs!1) Beds - ours was almost as soft as a plywood pallet.2) Hot Breakfast - No, not really.  The scurrying roaches under the clean plates really sealed the deal.3) We did like the location - but this was (By Far) the WORST Best Western we ever stayed at.JimbolaLess than helpful front desk, beautiful landscape but spiders in our bed! Spiders in our bed!! And if the internet stops working don't expect their clueless ""tech support"" to be able to fix anything! That pretty much sums up our stay at this Motel! Yes, if you can drive up to your room it is not a hotel, which disappointed me as well! Will not be staying here again. There has to be better for the price!Good: Friendly staff, free warm breakfast, mini fridge and microwave in room, nice fitness center...... Bad: Motel style (all doors open to the outside which means you hear everything going on outside and get quite a draft in the winter), if you're room is right outside the bar doors everyone will stand right outside your room and smoke, room service food was disgusting, there were spiders in my room.....I woke up with bug bites all over my legs! Overall, there is a Holiday Inn down the road for only about $10 more a night and it's well worth it. I would rather give this place two stars, but the whole bug bite thing really creeped me out and wasted a lot of my time. I spent a whole day switching hotels and washing/steaming all my stuff just in case it was bed bugs.It is probably a fine place for a short stay or overnight stop, but if you're stuck there for a week or more I would recommend finding another place.We've stayed at a LOT of hotels, both great and not so great.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place.  Our room was nice and big, clean and comfy.  We didn't eat in the restaurant but ordered our dinner delivered to the lounge.  (Yes, it was a long day).  Dinner was pretty good.  The breakfast was better than the usual hotel breakfast fare.  (It's a breakfast bar with plenty of good and healthy choices.)  Service at the front desk was a-ok.  Friendly and efficient.  I can't really think of any negatives.  if you're looking for 5+ hotel you'll be disappointed.  But if you're looking for clean, friendly, reasonably priced .... you can't beat this place.  I recommend it.One of the best (Best western Hotel we have ever stead at)the first time we stead we had a suit it was very nice and the breakfast  buffet was nice and I am not a breakfast buffet fan but this one is good,we enjoyed our stay and have been back.it is a fun place for family and friends and they have a nice Bar with Karaoke night ,we set out by the pool and laughed at some of the singing going on. the hotle is close to I-40 and it is pretty eazy getting to the hotel, but it is a little harder getting out and back on I-40 and the area is ok, a little cheeze at night restaurants,Bars,shopping, a water park ..Nice clean rooms, pretty much what you would expect from a Best Western.  Added bonus of fridge and micro in each room.  I didn't have any problems with stains, men hammering, or dogs like a previous poster.  Although the thermostat for my AC was a bit wonky.What you wouldn't expect is the caliber of the b-fast.  Buffet style with pretty much whatever you want.  And it's actually a decent spread in regards to food quality.  You also wouldn't expect 3 free beers during happy hour just for booking a room mon-thurs.The front desk people were a bit out of it. We rented 2 rooms weeks in advance for the world show.  They lost one booking and totally messed up the other.  They did fix it however, and it ended up ok.  A couple of the front desk employees are not very friendly.I got a good laugh when I walked through the lobby and could hear some weird sounds coming from the bar.  Intrigued, I went in for a bevy.  What followed were the most drunken cowboys singing karaoke ever.  Quite a funny sight.  The best is when some dood tried to sing/talk that song that goes ""One Bourbon, One Scotch, and One Beeeer""  I never realized that the whole song is just plain talking besides the chorus.  I should have recorded it because no doubt it would be #1 on youtube today.The pros:Compliments abound from the delightful front desk staff.  ""You don't LOOOOK thirty!!!""  I thought this was hilarious but then thought that this young woman's mom is probably still in her thirties.  This is not a slam, I'm just thinkin' that things happen faster here.  Full breakfast included in hotel stay.  Mini fridge in each room.  Room was clean!AC unit blasting when we got into our room. Nice!Why is the carpet soaking wet?  The AC unit.Why is there a giant stain on the ceiling?  The upstairs AC unit?Woke up at 8:00am because the dog next door was barking it's fucking head off.It was barking it's fucking head off because of the man hammering on the roof.Why was the man hammering on the roof?The AC unit?",,,,,"['bad', 'reviews', 'experience', 'great', 'large', 'clean', 'updated', 'room', 'friendly', 'staff', 'dog', 'friendly', 'charges', 'pet', 'fee', 'dogs', 'free',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-midwest-city-hotel-at-the-reed-conference-center-midwest-city,Sheraton Midwest City Hotel at the Reed Conference Center,3.0,$$,17,"What a pleasant surprise this hotel turned out to be! We were taking a road trip to New Mexico from Chicago and after crunching the hours for the day, I saw that Oklahoma City would be a good resting point. Since we were bringing our dog along for the trip, we needed to stay somewhere where pets were allowed. Many of the hotels I found wanted to charge a non-refundable deposit: $100, $50, $25, on top of the hotel price. No thanks.I was becoming worried that I would either have to cough up the money, or stay at a sketchy Days Inn. Then I found the Sheraton, about 10 minutes from OKC. Perfectly fine with me. My goal was just to be in a well-populated area near the highway and not some random ghost town. They allow you to bring your pets FOR FREE! That's awesome! All you have to do is sign a pet waiver and you're good to go.The price was great. I booked through their website and checked out the special offers they were running (there's a tab for this on their page). They had a holiday special where you could get a room with a king sized bed for $69. Fantastic. I recently stayed in a craphole in Milwaukee for $119, so this was a steal. And it looked modern and updated from the pictures on the website. I hoped it would be the same when we arrived and it totally was.They have a parking garage next to the hotel as well as a huge lot. Check-in was easy. We stayed here twice: once on the way to NM and once on the way back. The second time we checked in, they were going to put us in a room with double beds, even though I had requested a king. I told the concierge this and he checked his computer and snagged us a king room. Phew. Both rooms on both nights looked relatively the same. Huge bed, nice bathroom, a desk area since this is mostly for conference/business people, flat screen TV on the wall, complementary coffee and water in the room, and free wifi. The first room we stayed in had a fridge, yet strangely enough, the second night, when we stayed on the ""preferred floor"" there was no fridge. Weird. We made do, though.The hotel has a restaurant on the main floor and a big conference center next door. Unfortunately, they do not have continental breakfast. If you want breakfast, it'll cost you $12. That was a bummer. We just ended up getting breakfast bars at the gas station. It would have been nice to be able to put something in my stomach before a long trip. However, they do have free Starbucks coffee, which is a nice perk. They have a bunch of syrups too, that you can add. They also have free cucumber water near the door.Overall, this was a great stay. I'm so glad I was able to get such a nice hotel at a reasonable price. Happy to have stayed here for two nights and that I didn't have to scramble to find a hotel the second stay if the first stay sucked. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll definitely be staying here.This hotel depresses me. It's just kind of sad and dreary inside. Not a terrible place to stay at though unless you already have a case of the blues. Parking is easy and free. The beds are comfortable. The staff was even nice enough to give me a room on the 1st floor and it was very quiet. There is a waffle house super close by...yum. But the melancholy mood of this place bothers me.You can hear the people in the next room so clearly, you might think they were in the same room as you. Don't stay here.The room was nice and clean. Free wifi and parking as well. I was just passing through but I would stay here again.Sadly this hotel does not meet up to Sheraton's standards. When I stay in a Sheraton I expect the room to be clean and to be up kept well. Our room however was not.  Bathroom doors and handles were dirty, bathroom tiles around the toilet area were dirty and broken, pillow cases had stains, carpets needed a good cleaning, as well as all tables in the room needed a good wipe down.  I expect this maybe from a 1 or 2 star hotel but never from a 3 star.  That is why I pay a little more for a hotel, you are supposed to get better.  I am very disappointed in Sheraton right now.Very disorganized. Ordered guest service and it never came. Cleaning staff was so so kind but other workers were not very friendly.I stayed at this hotel for the Oklahoma Association of Realtors convention. I stayed 2 nights.The room was adequate. The beds were comfortable.The only constructive criticism I would give is more closet space. The room was supplied with a wardrobe instead of a closet and the bar ran from front to back, instead of side to side. This made it difficult to hang multiple articles of clothing.Now that I got that out of the way, I must say that I have never experienced such amazing customer service as I did during this stay.Everyone from the front desk to the house keepers would take the time to ask me how my stay was going and if there was anything they could do for me.This definitely made a lasting impression on me.Thank you Sheraton!Let me start by saying this hotel could easily have been a 5 star experience. Very easily. The reason it wasn't is because it was filthy. The towels were gross, pretty much every surface in the room looked dirty and there were huge cobwebs covering the AC unit. If someone went through and cleaned it properly and maybe took care of the carpet tears and stains, this place would be fantastic.Nice folk.  Good rates.  Loved the pillows.  Way too many places only have those fluffy pillows that your head sinks into.  These guys have got firm pillows that support your head.  I assume they are foam.  The barkeep was friendly and gave me some night-life pointers that worked out well.  My only gripe ... the woman in the club floor lounge was rude.  I have my suspicions why but I'm not willing to put them in print.We were passing through Oklahoma City and stopped here for the night because it was too windy to continue a long drive. This was one of the few hotels right off the I-40 that allows pets. Krystal, at the front desk, was a little rude and uninformative. She did not seem like she wanted to be working here, not once did she smile. I had no reservations and she rolled her eyes when I mentioned that. She handed me some papers and said ""sign this"" and didn't tell me what it was. It was the pet waiver, 3 pages. She was annoyed that I was actually reading it before signing it. When I handed her the papers she handed me the room keys and told me the elevators were across the lobby. She didn't tell me how much the room was, where it was located, or the size. From previous experiences, front desk usually gives you this information before sending you away, whether or not you booked in advance. There is no pet fee, so that was a plus. The room was clean. It was a little awkward for the bathroom light to be outside the bathroom and right next to the front door. Room service was nice. We got the spicy chicken quesadilla and warm apple pie. Both tasted surprisingly good for hotel food. However, the quesadilla was not spicy at all. There was a key drop basket for easy check-out. I would stay here again if I had my dog. But if I was not traveling with my pet, I would find somewhere else with nicer people at the front desk.Terrible visit. Arrived at hotel at 3:50pm &amp; stood in line for 1+ hours just to check-in. Then we were told that there are no clean rooms. We had reserved 2 rooms. At 6:20 pm, we were finally assigned a room - but only after going to the desk over &amp; over and asking status. Never once were we updated. Complained to front desk twice that we had roaches in our room. Our room was never cleaned the entire stay. (stayed 3 nights). First day - I caught the girl in the hall &amp; asked for clean towels because it was past 5pm &amp; we needed to clean up - she had me sign that I received the towels.  The next day - we never saw anyone - no towels, no cleaning the room, etc.  Terrible stay - Will not stay here again - maybe never again at a Sheraton. Told front desk - they reduced the room rate by $30 - but never an apology - also, called down to restaurant for food delivery &amp; was told no one was there - call returned 40 minutes later. Teribble!!!!  The room was 205 - Check-in was 9/17 and left 9/20.We stayed here when we were traveling from Virginia to California. We had a Penske truck with a car carrier and we were easily able to find free parking as there was a huge parking lot next to the hotel.The service is great. We got there at midnight and the staff was very helpful. The room we got was nice and clean. The bathroom had french doors which was cute. There was a laundry room round the corner where they also kept the ice machine and the microwave. My husband used the gym in the morning before we left and we did get complimentary newspaper and coffee in the morning as well.My teenage son and I stayed here last week while he was attending a football Elite QB Camp in nearby Shawnee, OK.  It's a great location; close to freeway, outside the mayhem of a typical downtown hotel, but a short 10 minute drive to Bricktown, free parking, unexpected robust &amp; free wi-fi, etc., and a short 20 minute drive to our Shawnee destination.  The front desk staff was supportive and attentive, but that's the extent of the positive comments I can make about this place.The housekeeping staff singularly ruined our stay here.  I should have taken the hint when I found hairs on my bed upon arrival, but I was excited for my son, and wanted to stay upbeat.  Housekeeping left our wet towels where they hung after the first day, took them and didn't replace them after the second day, and left my room door wide open on the third day (while they were nowhere to be found - we returned home for the day to find our room door open!).  There were few to no towels in the pool area regularly, the pool and pool area felt filthy, and it took them far too long (~20 - 30 minutes) to bring us towels and a replacement iron after I called the front desk with my request(s).  Front desk staff seemed concerned when I mentioned these events, and that's the only reason that this review merits a second star.  Hope to attend the same QB camp next year, but will not likely stay here.PROS:- Pet friendly- Free wi-fi- Gorgeous lobby- Free parking in a garage just across the street from the hotel- Grassy areas near the hotel, which were well lit at night- The room was immaculate, it came with a microwave and refrigerator, and it was extremely comfortable and quiet- Very helpful staff- Easy to find from the freeway, and far enough away from Oklahoma City that prices were reasonableCONS:- None come to mindGreat location and great staff - highly recommended - SPG is upping their game that is for sure...and they are usually better priced than divey Hampton Inn around the way. Watch your ass, HHonors! SPG is coming for YOU!Carpet in halls clean, lobby nice...however...room dusty, carpet in room filthy, furniture scratched, and bathroom looks like Motel 6.  They should have spent the same money on improving the rooms as was obviously spent on refreshing the public inside areas and outside face of the building!Nice but small.  Pros -Comfy beds and a huge work station.  Upgrade to Club level for free drinks and light dinner and a better than expected breakfast.  Cons - Small borning indoor pool.",,,,,"['pleasant', 'surprise', 'hotel', 'turned', 'taking', 'road', 'trip', 'new', 'crunching', 'hours', 'day', 'saw', 'city', 'good', 'resting', 'point', 'since',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/renaissance-waterford-oklahoma-city-hotel-oklahoma-city,Renaissance Waterford Oklahoma City Hotel,3.0,$$$,39,"Very friendly and helpful staff from the front desk, bar and concierge lounge. Food in restaurant was a 3 of 5 stars. I could hear the TV in the room next door.This property upgraded to a Renaissance two weeks ago, and I am very impressed with the face lift!  Additionally, they served bacon wrapped scallops tonight at the Club House on the 9th floor. They were delicious!  I love that the rooms are now modern, and the snacks offered to reward members are way better than before! I'm definitely staying here next time I'm in town!Very nice hotel. Newly remodeled, nice decor, spacious clean rooms. Very comfortable bed, nice staff. Down side if you want the heat off in your room or the air on you have to call to have a engineer to come to your room and get in the closet and adjust it. I had to call twice before he showed up. This was after 1a in the morn.Horrible renovation and makeover.  Definitely not the service you would expect.  Called and asked for q-tips and I was told I may be able to find some in the basement vending machine. Lighting poor. I had to go buy a make-up mirror with a light in it. No valet. No bellman. Waiters cell phone went off during service and he was unknowledgeable about the pronunciation of alcohol. He was friendly and eager to please, just poorly trained. I will never ever stay here again, although I have been a frequent guest over the last 20 years.I have a feeling this place used to be in a lot better shape years ago, but at my stay it was definitely showing its age.  The reason for 3 stars and not 2 was the fantastic service.  I checked into the Waterford on a Friday afternoon.  The lobby is small, and there was no one out front to handle valet parking.  But, someone at the front desk called a valet and he arrived within a couple of minutes.  Check in was quick.There was a sign near the front desk informing guests that floors are being renovated, so construction would be going on during the day.  This places needs a face lift, so good on Marriott for investing.  Additionally, during my short time at the Waterford, I wasn't bothered by any construction.My room had not been renovated.  The decor was dated, although it was most certainly clean.  The mattress was not comfortable, and the drapes wouldn't close all the way.  This was incredibly annoying as light came into the room as soon as the sun came up.  It was impossible to get the room completely dark, which shouldn't be the case in a hotel room.  Additionally, the bed was situated so that your head was toward the door and you had to lean on your side to watch TV.  I've only been in a couple of rooms with a configuration like this, and I really don't care for it.I didn't check out the restaurant or bar.  Every employee I came in contact with was very friendly.  I actually forgot an item, so I had to go back to the Waterford the day after my stay.  The item was retrieved very quickly, I don't think I was waiting a full minute at the front desk.  I think were I to stay here after the renovations are complete I would update my review and give the Waterford 4 stars.  But, as it stands now, the price of the hotel is not commensurate with its quality or its location.Very nice hotel!!!!! My first stay here....and I've been told that they've undergone a renovation so the rooms are much more updated. Front desk is very attentive, room service was on time. I'm not very familiar with the area as it was my first time in OKC but I was pleased with my stay.Marriott has really 'mailed it in' at this location. Its average on a good day because the lobby is nice enough.  However. The rooms are outdated and need some TLC.  Something in the closet is making a horrible noise... See photo, it's part of the ac behind the air filter. Classy.The rest of the room is a bit below what you generally see in other Marriott properties, old dorm fridge sitting on the floor, nasty grout on the shower tile, old decor.On the positive side.. The towels were really soft.We were fortunate enough to have our wedding here in 2012. All staff that was involved was excellent, and we still send people here to check it out for their wedding!The room was ok (although the wifi was spotty at best and the air conditioning remained on full blast regardless of what temperature it was set at). Room service on the other hand....Awful. My pre-ordered room service breakfast never came and I got so tired of holding that I didn't even bother ordering dinner. I could almost understand if this was a huge property but it isn't. Not that the ""restaurant"" was much better...If you stay here...I suggest eating your meals at the Cheesecake Factory down the road.A real disappointment for a Marriott loyalist.Clean friendly establishment, easy location to shopping and some corporate locations, service is slow in the restaurant for both breakfast and dinner, the HVAC system is very outdated and requires a technician to come just for the heat or AC by adjusting a manual damper. The thermostat is very outdated as seen in the pic attached. The beds are somewhat comfortable and standard for the type of room but you can tell it's much older hotel that they're trying to maintain a look for its design. The infrastructure definitely needs to be updated. I'm staying here on business &amp; I'm not sure if I could never stay here again. I would request to stay at a newer Marriott location although this is more convenient for my destination on business.I stay with the Waterford pretty frequently (several days a week). I've stayed in all kinds of different rooms, on different floors, on different sides of the hotel. Here's what I learned:1) There are lights of prison-break brightness levels pointed at the front of the hotel. The blackout curtains work, but if you want to see outside AND not be cornea-raped, don't get a room facing the front of the building. 2) Vacuuming MUST happen at some point, but I'm basing that assumption on the craziness that it wouldn't happen. A lot of floor debris/dust stays in the same place from week to week.3) The kitchen knows their stuff. Food arrives fast, hot, and tasty.4) Beds are comfy. If you're prone to overheating, request a regular (non-down) blanket.Enjoy!Comparing this to other Marriott properties I have been to throughout the US this property is in dire need of a refreshing. Things just seem overall aged. Watch out Elite Gold Rewards members they charge $10 extra a night for concierge lounge access. Compared to other Marriotts this is only 2 stars. Hope the elevator gets fixed or you will waiting awhile on busy days to get up or down to the 8th floor. Also be aware that the paper thin walls will let you hear the plumbing of your neighboring hotel guests.Save your money for better food and don't eat at the hotel restaurant either. Mediocre hotel breakfast.The only redeeming factor is the staff we nice.This Marriott is in a great part of town and offered lower rates than any of the other properties in the city. The lobby and the bar area were very nice but I found the rooms to be lacking slightly. Our room was a bit dusty and was a little out dated. Nothing that would stop me from returning, but for a building as nice as this one, I'd expect updates to come soon.I had a pleasant stay at the Waterford Marriott. However, I did expect more from a four star hotel.I checked in late on a Friday night and noticed the lounge was packed with patrons. The sound leaked over to the check-in desk making it hard to hear the staff. I had the usual small talk comparing Oklahoma's weather to Texas. Hmmm.. Not sure why the lady asked if I reserved the room using Orbit, but anywho I was looking forward to getting a great nights rest.The room was clean, but looked a bit ""dated"". I also thought their blue office chair looked a bit funny. The restroom was smaller than I had expected and overall the room resembled more like a 3-star hotel room.Breakfast was expensive with small portions and slow/late-service. Next time, I would just head to the lobby, grab a free cup of Starbucks, and head out for breakfast elsewhere.Overall, the staff was nice and apologetic for their shortcomings and my stay was pleasant. To-date, this has been the nicest hotel I have stayed in, but there is room for much needed improvement.Oh! I would definitely recommend everyone to ""shop around"" and look for their best rates.I had the pleasure of staying at the Waterford Marriott for the first time last week When I booked my reservation, I was a bit hesitant based on some of the reviews I had read on Yelp, and I wasn't sure of what to expect To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. My boyfriend and I had a flawless experience from the moment we checked in. We were greeted warmly on arrival, and our room was immaculate. The bed was so comfortable and cozy, the bathroom was spotless, and we had a lovely balcony from which we watched the snow fall. The hotel has complimentary Starbucks coffee in the lobby all the time, as well as warm cookies, tea and flavored water in the afternoon. There is ample complimentary parking. The hotel itself is quite charming. Coming from Los Angeles, my expectations are pretty high in terms of service and setting, and I must admit, I'm a bit of a hotel snob. The Waterford exceeded all of my expectations!I must mention the person who truly made our stay exceptional. Bert, the front desk manager, is an incredibly warm, gracious, and caring woman. She was attentive to all of our needs, and offered wonderful suggestions about places to visit in Oklahoma. She was spot on about everything, and I truly enjoyed learning more about the city from her. In fact, we so enjoyed our experience at the hotel, due mostly to Bert's hospitality, that we returned to the hotel for an extra night.Special thanks to Randy as well for helping to make our stay so wonderful. Truly, every staff member we encountered was friendly, inviting, and professional.I cannot wait to visit Oklahoma City again, and I look forward to staying at the Waterford Marriott. I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.  :  )And it keeps getting worse....went out for the day and came back to our room and it was just as we left it! No housekeeping even came by to leave fresh towels...much less refresh the toiletries or empty the trash. Also, our room keys have malfunctioned every night requiring us to trudge back to the desk each night!Based on a pleasant experience a decade, or so ago, I recently steered some out-of-town guests to the Waterford. When I fished for response as to how they liked their room, I was shocked to hear that they were not pleased. According to them, the room was very average, not expertly cleaned, had no concierge on duty and no hint of luxury. When they booked the room they had requested a room with a refrigerator. After nearly 24 hours, someone on staff finally robbed one of the other rooms to provide one. I was embarrassed for having recommended the Waterford and will not do so again. One of the other reviewers described it as a ""hotel with faded glory"". I suspect the statement may be correct.You become a loyal Marriott customer. Join their rewards program. Use your reward points to stay ""free"" and at check-in they swipe your card for ""incidentals"" to get pre-authorization. I would assume incidentals would mean $20-30. Nope. Try $90 per night. $50 per night if you are a paying customer. Not once during check-in was it explained to me how much money they were charging to my account. I just called and spoke to a front desk employee to express my annoyance. He said there is a sign at the front desk saying the bank card will be charged. I said the sign does not say they will charge my account $90 per day. It can take a week to 10 days for a persons bank to release the funds back. Obviously if you are staying at a hotel you are most likely traveling so the money is kinda needed. Long story short, I am tearing up my Marriott rewards card. This didn't feel like loyalty service to me.I'm actually kind of surprised that Waterford has such a poor overall rating. That's not to say that the other reviewers are wrong. Based on their reviews, most of them are justified in giving the ratings they did. However, I had a great experience at Waterford Marriott. But I am also easily impressed so that should be taken into account.Of particular note:- Service was fairly impressive. Everyone I dealt with was cordial, and their assistance/service went well beyond anything that was required of them. And they kept calling me sir. I'm a sucker for stuff like that.- The food was delicious. Honestly, I was surprised that it was as well-made as it was considering some of the issues that others had about the place. Genuinely well made dishes, and that was pretty much for everything that I had: Brisket (decent), Chicken (amazing), Salmon (lacking salt but otherwise good), Sides (yum, particularly the mashed 'taters and green beans), Desserts (yum raised to the power of 3. Yum cubed).- Decent aesthetics that one comes to expect and associate with boutique hotels. Sure, the prices are a touch on the high side, especially for a small town like Oklahoma City, but my experience was pleasant enough that I have to give Waterford its due. 3.75. Rounded up because the desserts were so amazing.First of all I have to thank the kindest Marriott employee ""Tiffany""- if it wasn't for her this review would have been 1 star and we would have found a completely different hotel the night we checked in. She was over and above friendly and accommodating ....... Deserving of five stars!!! But the real problem was the first room we checked into smelled horrible, like sewage, it was disgusting. The carpet was dirty and had lots of hair stuck to it and there was a pile of hair behind the door in the bathroom. Also, as listed in another review, the air filter was uncovered in the closet and making or horrible banging noise. So after checking in and lugging all of our bags and newborn up to that room - we had to change rooms or hotels all together. As mentioned Tiffany got us another room- upgraded to a suite. It was nicer, smelled a little bit better and no banging noise. But it was still dingy. There was coffee or some brown stain on the bathroom vanity. This hotel is old and it shows, still no excuse for poor housekeeping- yuck!","We stayed here a full week and had a pleasant stay.  Pretty rooms, comfy beds, good parking, nice lobby.  My only complaints was the cleanliness of the room and they were pretty minor.  I've seen worse!We left a tip every day for housekeeping and they dutifully changed our towels and made the beds.  However, the room was dusty when we checked in and remained so.  We ran out of TP and had to ask for some.  They never changed out the glass cups in the bathroom or refilled the disposable coffee bar over the course of the week (six nights, seven days).  I found a toenail clipping with blue nail polish on it in the bathroom (NOT MINE!) and a hair in the bed.  I asked for the bed linens to be changed and they weren't.  (there were two large stains on the top bedspread corner and they were still there after supposedly being changed out).All in all, I'd stay here again.  I would definitely ask for a room with a window that opens next time (too stuffy!).On my trip cross country with my sister we stayed one night at this property.  Of all the Marriott in all the towns we stayed, we liked this one the best.   The lobby is lovely, really beautiful.  Felt like the kind of place you where you could have a nice wedding reception or bar mitzvah.   We are Elite Gold Members and we were offered access to the concierge lounge, where they not only had the regular crackers and cheese, but some really great dumplings and soy sauce, which we could not get enough of after our long drive through Arkansas.  The room was extremely comfortable and we had a great night's sleep.  There was also lots of extra space for the two of us.  Finally, before we left we had a complimentary breakfast buffet.  THAT was truly the highlight.  Some of the Marriotts we had stayed in over the course of our trip only offered cereal and muffins and the like for breakfast.  This place had eggs, sausage, waffles, french toast, BISCUITS AND GRAVY, which was really the kicker and something we needed on such a cold morning.  All in all, I would stay here again.  The only criticism I have is that it's not really in the city proper, but it was close enough to Bricktown, where we hung out for the evening, to be convenient.I usually stay at Hilton's for work but decided to give this Marriott Waterford a try, something I really regret.First off this hotel is really out of place, it's stuck RIGHT inside a community, their backyards back right up to the pool, just a weird location.  Not a deal breaker.  Parking was limited for such a large property, maybe there was underground parking  somewhere.First night I tried the bar, asked a few questions about the wings like what exactly was the special hot sauce named after the place, he had no idea. OK not a deal breaker.Headed up to the room, 6th floor.  First warning sign stepping out of the elevator was a sign that said to be quiet.  That's odd, this is OKC not Las Vegas.  Didn't really think much of it.Then when I went to lay down I found out why I hated staying here, PAPER - THIN - WALLS.  Really, you can do everything bad at a hotel, as long as you have a place to lay your head and sleep you are ok, this hotel is NOT it.  I could hear someone mixing a drink next door like they were in my bathroom, some obnoxious stories from a grandmother about how her little one ""was born form a Caterpillar"" and I could even hear a guy dropping his pen on his desk like I was in the room with him.  FORGET trying to sleep.  Two guys talking in the hall at midnight woke me right up.  Your best bet is to turn your TV up and try to sleep, that's what I did, my neighbor and I played TV wars until early morning.  Better TV noise than neighbor noises.The last night of 4 was much better, all the neighbors checked out and I finally got some peace and quiet.Another side effect of the poor wall construction is the temperature.  If you are too cold cranking up the heat only helps if you have neighbors doing the same thing.  If you are too hot its likely because your neighbors are heating so you have no control of the temperature. My advice is if you must stay here ask to be put on a floor with few others.  Positives were the gym has great quality machines.  Linens are nice, tea and coffee machine good, and alarm clock is the best I've used.Lots of other nagging little annoyances, like the rotating door was locked at 6am so had to walk to the parking lot outside in the cold instead of being in the heated walkway.  The TV is locked out and you can't use any of the important features on the remote like the SLEEP button, sure would be nice if the TV shut itself off after you fall asleep for everyone's pleasure.Stayed here again for some meetings. We had a much better experience than last time. Probably the main reason it improved was that we went next door to Bellini's to eat since our last meal at the Waterford was such a disaster. Our group was still talking about the ""last supper"" more than a year later.I still think this hotel is a bit over hyped and is more on scale with an exceptional Hampton or Hilton Garden Inn. The building is old enough that the rooms are noisy, plumbing resounds throughout the floor, and neighbors can be easily heard (if you catch my drift).Mrs Eva and I don't mind staying here when someone else foots the bill, but I would never personally pay this much money for this room.Not a very good stay at all. Me fiance is a platinum member and he called customer service for his card and we booked a room here for the night. When we got to the hotel it looked very nice. At the desk we were told that we would be getting a handicap room because they were all booked up. We had asked for a king suit while on the phone with customer service. We prob would have gone to the Marriott up the street if we had known.  Also the girl who checked us in made some off handed comment about the type of people who stay at there hotel. We were given breakfast vouchers to there restaurant and there breakfast was very good. They also had a complimentary cheese plate and small bottle of wine delivered to the room. We had also asked for a playpen for our son and they didn't have that ready either. It was very hard taking a shower in the morning because the shower head was so low. My fiance did call Marriott and let them know about the experience and they refunded us the points we used to book the room along with some additional point.Have stayed several times.  The staff has always been helpful, and rooms clean.The could probably use an update but not bad.  Like the location.I will start by saying that the room was nice and the staff was friendly, no disappointments there. Other than that this was a very disappointing stay. I booked this hotel for a date night with my 4 year old daughter so this was supposed to be a fun special night together. We ate at the hotel restaurant, I won't review that here but let's say it wouldn't have added any stars to this review. The one thing my daughter wanted to do was go swimming so it was a good thing they had a heated pool, right? Wrong. I called the day of the stay about the pool and was told that it was heated (it is October). My daughter and I get ready for a fun night of splashing and try to get in but the water was COLD! We couldn't even stay in 5 minutes. She was so disappointed, so we headed to the hot tub which is in the gym. At least it was warm. The jets didn't work and we left when a bandaid floated by. We went straight to the desk to complain about the temperature of the pool. They sent someone to check and they said that the water was almost 70 degrees and was that good enough. No, that is too cold for water. The average temp of a heated pool is between 77 and 82 degrees. That is a big difference when it comes to water temp for swimming. I was then told that they would have the heat turned up and it would be ready by morning. The next morning my daughter and I stroll down to the pool only to be disappointed again. There was no change in temp and we couldn't swim at all. Now back to the hot tub, but wait, it's out of order. On our way out of the hotel I complained again only to find out that the hot tub was closed all week (gross, we sat in a ""closed"" unclean hot tub). I received no real apology, no manager was contacted, no manager call after the fact and no compensation for this debacle. At least I got to spend some time with my daughter but I wish she could have enjoyed the one thing she wanted to do, swim.The Waterford is a hotel with faded glory.  Staff has been wonderful, which is the ony reason I am rating it as high as I am .  Also parking is free and it is always clean etc.  One reason I don't stay here often is that it is unbelievable that they actually charge for the internet here!!!!!  Not only that, but they charge PER DEVICE!!! Be careful or you'll pay more than your room charge!I use my Hot Spot here, but it really isn't as good as the free internet I get at Hampton Inn.  Also, for a lot less at the Hampton Inn/Fairfield/Hilton Garden Inn etc., I get a refrigerator and microwave and frequently a suite.  I ask for a refrigerator at the Waterford (it says they are available), but never get one.  Parking is good, even if it is a long walk if you don't get to park on the west side parking lot.  However, Valet parking is only $12 per day (less than the internet charge!).Coffee (Starbucks brand) and newspapers in the lobby in the morning are nice, but I get that at other hotels also.It appears that Marriott is just maintaining the Waterford, without any plans for improvement.  I am sure the facility is inefficient to operate in today's world.  The location is hardly a hot location anymore with Downtown and the Quail Springs area the leading area.A faded rose that is still enjoyable to stay at but hardly worth the money.  We stay when special rates are available, but still grit our teeth in anger at the ripoff internet charges.  I avoid Marriott's (or any hotel) that charge extra for the internet. Anymore that is like charging for bathrooms.  Since I stay about 70 nights a year in hotels, Marriott could make more money by not charging for the Internet.Marriott needs to pull itself into the real world.Everyone knows your name here! Their remodeled rooms are fantastic and cozy.... will definitely be back!For weekend leisure guests, the Waterford might be a decent option given the abundance of special rates. However, for business travelers, I would recommend Oklahoma City Marriott over the Waterford. Here's why.Waterford is quite overrated. It positions itseld as a ""boutique"" hotel, although there's nothing ""boutique"" about it: austere if spacious rooms devoid of decoration; very slow TVs (as it, takes forever to flip through the channels), staff not very cordial or happy to see you. Even their corporate rates are too high compared to other hotels in the area, and they do not even offer free Internet service! In this day and age, I find it hard to justify paying $25 per day for a connection, yet Waterford is penny-pinching its guests. And my room did not even have a shampoo!Exercise room is decent; however, the jaccuzzi is right outside the exercise machines through the glass door, offering no privacy whatsoever. I must note that Waterfords's bang for the buck used to be better in 2010, but has inexplicably decreased this year. So much so that I, as a regular business traveler, see no reason to stay here as opposed to a friendlier, more helpful and more reasonably-priced Oklahoma City Marriott just up the street.Food is terrible here.  I live nearby and have stopped in several times and really the service isn't great and could only be considered good by 1980s standards.  The hotel needs a total overhaul and is really only on par with 2-star or possibly 3-star hotels.Pricey by the standards of OKC. Room was nice, clean and the hotel has decent facilities. Breakfast was bland - even by the standards of a 3 star hotel. Service was attentive and competent at every level.Really pleasant. Staff and service were tremendously accomodating. I'd definitley stay there in the furueThis a boutique Marriott but it has everything you would want. Room service, lobby bar, swimming pool, conference rooms and facilities, and a small store as well.Great service - very nice associates. The room was comfortable, parking seemed well lit and secure, and we didn't really need too much during our stay. Location is near a mall, lots of shopping and restaurants, but the hotel is within a small office park area bordered by neighborhoods. Very quiet and nice!I travel a lot for business and stay at many different hotels but I  have to say that this hotel is the WORST place I have ever stayed in.  The attendant at the front door is too busy texting and does not care to open the door for you as you are entering the hotel with your baggage. Go to your room to find that it was not vacuumed as you step on nuts left behind from someone's snack. Then try to have a restful morning as housekeeping keeps knocking on the door wanting to make up your room at 8am.... And then again at 10am even though now at 10 am your tv is on and the shower is running as you are obviously in the room!!!DO NOT DARE to go to the gym in the basement unless you like looking at filthy mirrors that look like some did not have tissues after blowing there nose across the room.....  Unless you like hair and sticky stuff on the space between the petals on the elliptical cycle STAY AWAY!As if all of this was not enough....  Try getting a cab?  No cabs at all at check-out time! Waited 25 minutes before the one that I had the front desk call for arrived....  I almost missed my flight! If you want to be treated this way, save money and stay at a Roadside motel.  You actually might have a better experience. Save yourself ....... find a different hotel!!A decent hotel, but not really a ""boutique."" The whole stay got off to a bad start when I had to search the entire bottom floor to find someone to check me in. I know that I showed up late (midnight) but I shouldn't have to go into the kitchen to find someone to check me in. The rooms were large enough but they had an older, musty feel to them. Not, by any means unfashionable, you could just tell it had been there for a while. The second real issue that I have is that I could not believe I had to pay for Internet with the room rate that was paid. It is in a good location for what I needed to do but the bottom line is this, Go elsewhere.We spent some time there recently and had a great time.  Among the details that made it pleasant:  -When I called them from Bricktown they had no trouble directing us to the hotel, They upgraded us to a suite since they were out of rooms with 2 beds,  the pool was open until 11.... all things that made my trip just a bit more fun!  They don't have free wi-fi but I didn't even ask about the cost b/c we didn't need to access the web during a weekend of relaxation.  :-)Our party made reservations for two rooms for this evening.  We get to the hotel and the tiny parking lot is completely full.  We pull around to the main entrance and go inside to check in.  The desk clerk informed us that our reservations had been cancelled and they had no rooms for us.  Absolutely ridiculous, as the room had already been secured with a credit card. The desk clerk made no effort to help get a room at another Marriott establishment in Oklahoma City, and simply stated to try the one down the road.This seems more like a little boutique hotel than a Marriott flag.  Very nice yet not terribly fancy, either.  The room was clean, bed comfy and had a nice decor.  I was treated to wine &amp; cheese on my first night there, plus breakfast coupons.   The breakfast buffet was impressive, but I must say, the scrambled eggs were strange (and strange tasting) and the gravy for the biscuits was overwhelmingly, excessively salty.   A brisk, gum-chomping front desk clerk and a lackadaisical bartender ran counter to its ambience but most employees were great.  I was a little surprised that there wasn't a gift shop, only a sundries shop and I wasn't sure if it was complimentary or honor system.  Overall, I really enjoyed my stay, will probably come again and found it to be a great value.",,,,"['friendly', 'helpful', 'staff', 'front', 'desk', 'bar', 'concierge', 'lounge', 'food', 'restaurant',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hyatt-place-oklahoma-city-airport-oklahoma-city-2,Hyatt Place Oklahoma City Airport,4.0,$$,31,"Nice and clean. The staff was very friendly. Hotel was very quiet. Definitely recommend.Upsides: This hotel feels clean and modern. The staff is invariably warm and polite. There is a wide variety of hot and cold food choices at breakfast. There is a shuttle to the OKC airport every half hour. The TVs in the bedroom are large.Downsides: I was underwhelmed by many of the choices at breakfast: Red Delicious apples, scrambled eggs under a hot lamp, thick bread-y donuts, sugary-sweet yogurt. The mini-fridges in the two rooms I've stayed in were noticeably loud, as were the AC units. On my first stay (a cold night in January), our AC unit only produced cold air; after shivering for an hour, we realized the room wasn't warming up and were moved into a new room down the hall. On my second stay, I forgot my contact lens kit; the front desk did not have any cases, but offered to sell me a tiny bottle of solution for $6.50. The staff was polite, and maybe that's a standard policy at all hotels, but I felt like I was being fleeced, not helped (I slept in my contacts).This hotel was a great find, right off the freeway, and we enjoyed our stay here. Plus, they accept dogs (but with a pretty steep fee). The room was large and very nicely decorated. The breakfast left a little to be desired and wasn't that great (although it was nicely presented). I would stay here again though.We stayed a night at this hotel before flying back home recently. I wanted to stay close to the airport and after reading Yelp reviews of hotels, we chose this one.  What a fantastic experience.  The front desk staff was quite pleasant and the room was really nice.  I wish I could have recorded the reaction of my kids when opening the door because I am sure Hyatt would play it in their commercials.  They couldn't believe the size of the room.  It was spacious to say the least.  The bathroom is set up a little odd with a very small area for shower/toilet but we didn't feel that was a huge issue at all.  The hotel is convenient to not only the airport but also quite a few dining options within walking distance.  The breakfast is better than most hotel breakfast, with some hot sandwiches plus the options offered at most. The only issue we had was finding the turn in to the hotel.  Meridian is pretty cluttered so just look for the sign and you'll see where to turn in but there didn't appear to be more than one way in or out.  So, don't try to go in a ""back way"" like I did :)  For the price point, you cannot beat this hotel.  I can guarantee if we find ourselves needing to stay in OKC again in the future, this hotel will be at the top of our list.  I can't say enough good things.Really enjoyed my stay here. Came to OKC on business for a few days. Immediately greeted by front desk staff. Both reps were fantastic. I like how they walk around the desk to hand you your room keys. Room was clean and big. No complaints here.Breakfast was also great. Definitely try the egg sandwich and the oatmeal. I highly recommend this hotel. Free airport shuttle tops it off!This is our second stay at the Hyatt Place. Always a pleasure, great oversized room which is exceptionally clean! Comfortable beds and pillows. In room fridge and safe come in handy. Large vanity to get ready in the morning. Great breakfast is included we and they have a 24/7 made 2 order cafe to include coffees, pastries, cocktails and quick food. This will always be our choice when we stay in OKC.Excellent hotel for the price point and part of a quality chain.  Service has inmproved in terms of recognizing Platinum and Diamond Status, which is a plus for us frequent travellers.  The breakfast smetimes strays from the Hyatt artisan sandwiches which is a good thing and nice change of pace.   Workout room is clean, with 3 types of cardio and dumbells and all equipments has been fully functional for each of my stays.  Location is convenient to the airport and freewayxs into the city if that is where you are headed.  Since I do most of my work by the airport, this works really well.  There are a  dozen restaurants that are walkable, including one in the parking lot for a varity of fare from Fast Food, Itaian, Barbeque, Asian, Mexican and Tex Mex.  Staff is always professional and very friendly.And here's an odd thing I noticed during my last trip that I like; the bds are on platforms meaning nothing gets tossed under, lost or forgotten beneath the bed and it is one less place to find surprises from previous guests.For a name brand hotel that is within government per diem, you really can't beat it!The Hyatt Place exceeded all of our expectations.  A great room at a great price.  Christina at the front desk was quick, efficient, and very nice.  She even showed us to the elevator and opened the door for us.  Guests receive at 10% discount at several local restaurants.  This place is a must stay.  We would definitely stay here again.Stayed at this hotel overnight and had a great experience.  At this price point, there's NO beating a Hyatt Place.  VERY clean rooms, friendly staff, good location, VERY clean outdoor swimming pool, and free parking.  For $100/night what else can you ask for?We are Hyatt Place rewards members because all of the locations are consistent in offering a spotless room at a reasonable price.*This location has been updated with new carpet &amp; furniture.Great place to stay. Great breakfast, clean rooms and good access to wifi and tv channels.I was seriously stunned at how excellent this place was from the minute I walked through the door.We booked on Priceline, I'm always wary about price-lining a hotel, some places give 'lesser' service when they see you're a price line user, some have special floors they put you on, most give you a double bed and nothing bigger.  We're the bottom of the pecking order as Priceline users.  It SUCKS.  Just cause we get a good deal for our buck, doesn't mean we're not a customer or should be treated 'less than' (rant over!)From the minute we walked in to check in this place was great, the guy at the front desk asked us what floor we wanted, he asked if we wanted a King size bed (heck yes!) and when we got to the room, it was way bigger than I expected.  The kitchenette was handy, though no microwave, the fridge was useful and the TV was large (and modern).  Bathroom was a little small, though the shower was excellent (shower-fussy husband!!), the air conditioner unit was strong enough to cool my hot-water-bottle-husband down without freezing me into an icicle.The hotel was quiet, the walls aren't paper-thin like in a lot of them and the bed, although it sounded like it was going to fall apart, was very comfy and we both slept well.Free breakfast, free parking, free internet, all very important and the 24 hour shop/room service is a nice touch also, though we didn't use it other than to buy a milky way after a hockey game as we went up to our room.I'd not only happily stay here again, but I doubt I'd stay anywhere else if we were passing through the area.  The staff were friendly and accommodating, the cleaners treated my lion cub well (that's always a test for me, who puts my teddy bear lion cub back on the bed after they make it - yes I'm aware this makes me sound 12!), just an all round great hotel, we both loved it!My first time staying at a Hyatt Place. I was there for 3 days and will be returning again in a week. My stay was very comfortable and the room was clean. This hotel is reletivly new and very well maintained. I did not give 5 starts for one reason. I enjoy some protiens with my morning breakfast. Sausage, bacon and ham are all good with me. Unfortunatly I do not eat eggs and the only way to get some ham or sausage was to get it on a roll with eggs and cheese. I asked about getting just sausage and bacon and was told by a manager I should ask and they will make it for me. When I asked the next morning, I was told what I see is what they have. The worker also told me they only have sausage and ham seperate on weekends. Last, the breakfast set up is very attractive...they have electric range with skillits that the workers put the food on. Unfortunatly the skills are warm at the most (my food was so cold i braved touching the skillet and that is how i know the temp of the skillet). Both the french toast and pancakes were cold. I am hoping that when i return, this review will help some change..Very nice room, modern and comfortable. Close to the airport. Only thing that was annoying was getting the 2 dark brown pubic hairs out of the shower from the last people. It would really suck to be a housekeeper :(.Front desk staff reasonably polite. Complimentary airport shuttle supposedly starts at 5 am but may not push off til 5:30 if demand is low. Hot breakfast starts 6:30 but cold goods were available at 5: granola, yogurt, cottage cheese, fruit, baked goods. Deadline to check in is midnight, a good 6-9 hours after the other options along this stretch cut off (which also charge a nominal fee for their shuttles). Bathroom's cramped but a king suite can comfortably sleep 3-4 with the extra blanket by the couch. Basic channel list includes decent options. Plush pillows. Water took a bit to warm up and the range on the TV remote is fussy from the bed. Hairdryer and coffeemaker worked fine, though I'd recommend against the chunky powdered creamer. Free wi-fi. Unfortunately I was too tired to check out the fitness center. A bit pricey given limited options on short notice but I'd stay here again.Great hotel, great rate! ""Select service"", meaning they only give you the few items most travelers business travelers demand. Not a replacement for either high end, tip for everything luxury hotels or an extended stay hotel such a home2, Element, Residence Inn or Homewood Suites. It's more like a DIY (do your own bags if you want, park yourself, etc.) semi luxury hotel, and it's great! I don't like people touching my stuff, anyway, but I sure do like at least a touch of luxury, and that's what Hyatt Places have. :)At the time of this writing, you can earn extended checkout status faster with Hyatt than most chains -- meaning 2pm, even 4m at some properties, is easily within reach. This particular Hyatt Place is one of the few places in Oklahoma that is modern looking (for a moderate price), and generally speaking, much cheaper than similar Hilton's and Marriotts. They also give you The Wall Street Journal instead of the fear mongering USA Today that many other hotels provide. This is classier to me, and actually makes me feel better in a tangible way. I'd rather pick a paper and learn something useful, than be driven to excessive anxiety and an early grave!I simply love the format of Hyatt Places for quick stays. Easy in, easy out, large room, enormous LG TV, late night and sometimes 24 hour (as this hotel) restaurants. Perfect for business people, although I even take my family -- as the king bed and queen size sleeper is big enough for all. Hyatt's also seem to clean and keep things new looking better than many brands. Hyatt is more like a more business and family Starwood, than a run of the mill Marriott or Hilton. Good stuff for practical stays.Good price. Love the layout of the spacious rooms when traveling. Good local restaurants.Wow. This place was terrible. No idea how it has any good reviews. The service was fine, but the rooms are terrible. Stained carpet, peeling wallpaper in the bathrooms, brown stains all over the bathtub and shower area, EXTREMELY loud AC unit on the window that constantly woke up my baby all night...I just don't know how this place gets any good reviews! And it's expensive for how horrible the rooms are. Never staying here again.Wonderful experience! The room was super clean and smelled great, the price was amazing too!  HUGE flat screen tv, 24/7 room service, easy in/out, classy place!My only complaint: it was too hot in the indoor pool room~ 110 outside and it felt like 130 inside that room, I couldn't breathe!  Other than that the staff was super kind and helpful.  We'll be staying there again!I've stayed at many hotels across the country over the past seven years for work. I typically enjoy staying at Hyatt Place hotels, they are very business friendly. Unfortunately this specific Hyatt Place has been disappointing. I can't put my finger on it, it just seems cheaper and more run down than some of their other properties. The one thing I can specifically talk about us the lack of a guest laundry, what? I travel Monday thru Friday and instead of packing dirty clothes for my trip home, I like to wash them while on the road. This hotel has no guest laundry, I'll called the front desk and the receptionist said they send out guest laundry. Some people prefer the option to wash their own clothes! Especially when you don't have time to have your laundry sent out.I have stayed at this location 3 times.  Each time the staff has been very pleasant and helpful with my questions.  One thing you notice off the bat is someone is always cleaning in the lobby.  Cleanliness is great!  The rooms are very modern, and have all the amenities a room should have.  I have never used the Internet at this location, so I can't comment on that.  As you can see in the pictures you have a staging area and bedroom.  When I travel I'm always alone so a room with this setup works.  If I were with a group of people it might be different.  The sinks are basically in the middle of the bedroom with no door.  While the shower and toilet are located in a separate room, the sinks are not.  Basically it would be very hard for someone to get ready and another person to sleep.  Free breakfast in the morning with a great assortment of hot sandwiches.  I had a smoked gouda/bacon/cheese sandwich that hit the spot.  One of the best complimentary breakfast's I have ever had.  Keep up the good work!","Excellent service, good clean rooms, complimentary breakfast, worth it in any city, check them out!  We look for this place and are able to find them in most cities, and they always seem to be very much the same. That's something to count on!We stayed here last night on our road trip and it was not our favorite place. The bathroom is really small and had difficulties with the shower settings. It was a tub/bath and we prefer a larger standing shower only with a glass door. The bed was not too comfortable either.The TV was big and the room was clean, but we didn't like the layout and struggled to relax. The wifi was really slow too. We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn though in Albuquerque!Extremely nice Hotel, room was very nice, clean. The desk staff welcomed me when I arrived- which was after 2:30am! They knew I was arriving late due to flight delays, held the room with no problem. The next morning the staff got me breakfast after they had closed the buffet. I would definately stay here again.Stayed at this location on a cross-country trip back on December 26, 2012 and I had the pleasure to meet the GM, David Lamb, at breakfast. He introduced himself and asked how the stay was. I let him know I am in the travel business and stay in about 45-50 hotels a year. I ran down a whole list of positive experiences we had during our stay...easy check-in, clean and well-appointed room, wake-up call on-time, well-stocked breakfast in a clean eating area, and a seamless check-out. We couldn't have been more pleased, and the only thing I regret is not writing this soon, as I assured him I would.This place took the Hilton Garden Inn concept and did it even better.  Hyatt took their former Amerisuites and turned them into the gem that is Hyatt Place.Found a wonderful deal at an online price negotiator website.  Check-in was a breeze with their self-service terminal, but I can see that being frustrating for some travelers.The room was spacious, modern and clean.  Everything was in working order and I was delighted to find a big screen TV with HD channels and free wireless internet.One negative was that the bathroom fan was just too darn loud, and the self-service nature of check-in seems to make staff not want to deal with guests.I didn't partake in any of their food offerings, but I understand they have quite an extensive breakfast.I found this location to be conveniently located between the airport and I-40, with plenty of fast food and casual dining restaurants in the immediate area.This was my first time ever staying at a Hyatt Hotel (Hyatt Place to be specific). Due to the project I was on, this was the recommended hotel.Overall, I thought it was a decent hotel.  I love the design of the rooms and the flat screen televisions.  However the internet sucks.But what did it for me at this particular location was one of the staff.  When a staff member makes comments (every time he sees you) makes it a bit uncomfortable to stay there.  I did not need to hear from the staff member that he liked my shoes so much that he was willing to beat me up for them.  Not alone, if he beat me up, take me to my room and drop me off.  Also, my workout pants (2 separate occasions) disappeared from my room. Coincidence, I think not!!! Scary and very unacceptable.  When I noticed myself going in through the back entrance to avoid this person, I know it was time to stay at another hotel. Unfortunately, I did not complain to the hotel manager.  I just decided to leave the hotel entirely.Like some other reviews of seen of this place I found (after staying) the Internet service to be horrible. At times completely unusable. Worse yet you'll get different stories from different front desk staff and the General Manager if you start complaining. I have always had good luck at Hyatt Place in other locations including Tulsa so I didn't check reviews. Now that I have, I can find complaints going way back about the internet service here as well as the staff. You lose points not because you have an issue but via how you deal, or don't deal, with it. The staff here is definitely not up to Hyatt standards - or any decent hotel for that matter. I would never stay at this location again. Far too many better choices (even within walking distance).This was a really nice surprise. I chose it based on Yelp reviews. THe rooms are roomy and comfortable with massive TV screens. Not your average hotel room lay-out so that made it interesting. They have really gone the mile for a design oriented mass hotel and it feels successful. Nice breakfast buffet and overall atmosphere. Even the workers outfits are well thought out and modern. I will return to a Hyatt Place for sure.This was my first time in OKC..  I was at the Hyatt for about 2 3 weeks...THe staff here is great. Mike , who works Fri nghts only.. Jessy Rob and Steve and Patrick are all great people..The rooms however are not good at all.. I had gnats in my room which is very disappointing. The breakfast is just ok.. nothing special.. not enough variety.. almost no whole grains. On my last night there a cockroach crawled out of the blow dryer ground prong plug as I was pulling it out .. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen.. THere is probably a whole bunch of them between those wires coming out one by one.The pool is super small more like a kids pool only. Again lots of cockroaches there as well.The place looks clean adn one of the best places that you can get in OKC specially if you need to be close to the airport. There is one staff member with a pakistani accent who works at night. He seems not to be so helpful. I asked many times for a real person calling me to wake me up in the morning and he wouldn't call and the machine would. I got sick and asked for a bottle of water adn he refused to bring it up for me. Mike Rob Jessy Steve and Patrick are GREAT .. If it wasn't for their service I would probably report this hotel .Very nice place.  I did not even realize it was a Hyatt, it is very upscale and wonderful rooms.  Good little breakfast too!This hotel recently became a Hyatt Place, which is Hyatt's new, hip, fun brand. I joked that I had my very own lounge, which I totally did because the rooms are like mini-suites with a separate area that has an over-sized sectional sleeper sofa, desk, sink/bar area, and a view of the swiveling 42-inch flat screen. The decor was fun, the bed was comfy, the staff was totally friendly, and breakfast was free. I'm kind of a hotel snob, and I was totally happy here..",,,,"['nice', 'clean', 'staff', 'friendly', 'hotel', 'quiet', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'upsides', 'hotel', 'feels', 'clean', 'modern',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hampton-inn-oklahoma-city-7,Hampton Inn,4.0,$$,35,"Sometimes last minute decisions really do work out. We had originally planned to make our 3rd stop on our roadtrip to a low cost hotel about a mile east of Bricktown. As is often my habit before a day's journey, I google-mapped the locale, and realized a change in plans was not only desirable, but necessary. I figured that we might as well stay in an area within walking distance of Bricktown's attractions, (i.e. restaurants, ballparks), and couldn't help notice that the Hampton was quite literally behind the outfield of Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark, home of the Dodgers' AAA affiliate. So, if we planned things out correctly, we could check in and then go to the 6:05PM start for the Sunday night ballgame.Well, given that we didn't arrive until 6:30PM, and were rather tired by that point, we elected to not purchase tickets to the game. Note that I wrote ""not purchase tickets"". That is not the same as ""saw the game"", as it turns out we had a rather decent view of the outfield, straight from our room on the 5th level!I think this hotel would rank highly solely based on the ballpark view, but that would be a bit unfair. The cashier welcomed us with a smile, had her collective act together, and was very explicit in what both the hotel and area had to offer, even relaxing us by saying that getting into the parking garage wasn't as difficult as it might seem.The area itself is outside the scope of a hotel review, but I'll just suggest that this place to stay is more than strategically located. I think the most remarkable aspect of this franchise is the lack of noise - even though the hotel seemed to be full, with plenty of enthusiastically-yelling children, we didn't notice that from our room. Perhaps this is because the pool area was more than large enough to contain a small army, but more likely it spoke to a well-constructed and insulated building. The included breakfast was well set-up, with the ingredients in a separate room from the seating area, and plenty of free newspapers to read while filling our bellies.But the final piece of evidence for this rating? We boarded the elevator at about 9AM of the morning we were going to leave, along with a bunch of the maids. All were chattering away in Spanish, but it was clear they were happy - no bitching about their jobs here.This is a decent hotel in Bricktown, but I think it's far too pricey for what you get.  To begin, you have to check in before you can park.  This is incredibly annoying, and it seems like they should be able to resolve this issue.  The driveway is very small, so if you check it at a busy time (like I did), you probably won't have room.  I circled the block then basically forced myself in after calling the front desk and being told you have to check in before you can park.  The reason is that Hampton Inn shares the garage just to the west of it, and in order to get in, you need a red key card to swipe.  And, it's $12 a day.  So, I had a bad taste in my mouth when I checked in.Check in was quick and the employees were very friendly.  The lobby is fine, it's not spectacular, but it's certainly not dumpy or dirty either.  No bar, you have to go to the Hilton, which adjoins the Hampton Inn, for that.  My room was on the 3rd floor, and I noticed a lot of carpet stains.  My room was very clean, however, and after seeing the exterior carpet, I gave the room a good inspection.  The rooms have a nice view of the ballpark, although mine was on a lower floor and was obstructed by the scoreboard.  The bathroom has a shower stall only, and if you are over 6 feet tall, you'll need to duck.  I nearly scalped myself the first time I got in that thing.  Standard sink, toilet, and toiletries.  The bed has outlets easily accessible on either side, which I like.  That being said, it wasn't very comfortable.  It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't a great night's sleep.  I didn't use the pool, but checked it out.  It's for kids, there are a ton of toys, a basketball hoop, and other stuff for them to do.  If you're looking to swim laps in the morning it'd be tough.For what I paid ($175 for a Friday night with an OU home game the next day) I would rather stay at the Colcord or Skirvin just a mile or so away.  Even if you are going to an event in Bricktown, you could walk the distance, take a cab or Uber, and I think it would still be worth staying further away given Hampton's price.  If Hampton was 40% less I'd give it 4 stars, but my stay wasn't worth the price charged.  I'll keep it in mind and would stay here again, but only if the price is much lower.Stopped here during a road trip, and was pleasantly surprised by the surrounding area!On the other hand, the beds were not as comfortable as other hotels. I have a bad back, so it would have helped if they have good mattresses. The rooms were clean, and NO bedbugs!For the price premium, I'm not sure if it's worth the uncomfortable bed.This is a great Bricktown location! We were in town to see a musical (The Book of Mormon), and we were able to walk to the civic center and almost all downtown and Bricktown locations! It was so nice to not have to fuss with parking.The staff at the hotel were all wonderful! Big shout out to Gerry at the front desk who was so warm and welcoming and truly embodied all that it means to be hospitable. The woman who ran breakfast each day was also amazing! Speaking of breakfast...it was wonderful! Complimentary breakfast every day from 6-10. This was a hot breakfast buffet (don't worry, there is a waffle maker), and the selections switched up every day. They had these things called ""bagel toppers"" that were round egg patties with cheese and bacon. Yum! As an avid egg lover I was happy to see that there were either bagel toppers or omelets every day. Like I mentioned before, the woman who was working breakfast was so pleasant and patient. She even walked around on Saturday morning with little extra snacks and treats for the kids in the breakfast area. Very sweet.The rooms were clean and comfortable. The shower was gigantic! The housekeeping staff was very on top of things. We left the room late in the afternoon and it was clean when we returned that evening!This was a very pleasant stay experience, and I would definitely come back here next time I'm in OKC!Great hampton inn! I've spent any nightstand hampton inns and this is one of the better ones I have visited. There was even a rubber ducky in the bathroom. So cute. Also a bunny towel sculpture. Along with all the other typical hampton amenities. It is in an excellent location for dining etc. The view from the upper levels onto the ball field is really neat. Parking is an extra $12 a day but worth it. In other cities the cost is double or triple this amount for such good proximity to attractions. Clean, larger than normal gym area - also a plus. Indoor pool etc. I will definitely be back here.Location Location Location! This was easy to get to despite some road construction that was blocking an entire street. The hotel is far enough from the major bricktown spots to keep it fairly quiet, but close enough to walk to everything. We even walked as far as the art museum with no issues (except nasty cold weather).The staff were a bit overwhelmed when we arrived, probably recovering from New Years Eve. Our hotel room was clean and very comfortable. The breakfast was fresh and options rotated daily. The breakfast cleanup staff was especially nice!Great hotel this experience, staff very cordial and helpful, the breakfast was excellent with an omelet as a new twist. I would recommend this hotel. A bit dated showers needed some work but it is a busy hotel staff was excellent.Hampton Inn Bricktown. Where to begin! My husband and I spent 5 nights at this Hampton Inn in the early part of July during our first visit to OKC. I have to say the hotel gets high marks because of the location. Bricktown... Some rooms (&amp; parking garage) have a great view of the OKC Dodgers Ballpark. Walking distance of many great restaurants, Bricktown Riverwalk, bars/pubs, Bass Pro Shop. The second best part of this hotel is the staff. Very friendly and welcoming every time we walked back in to the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. Coffee &amp; tea were available all day long. Something important to a coffee lover like me. The only down side was the breakfast selections when you stay more than a couple of days. Tend to repeat it self but the food was warm.  It was a pleasure to stay here.This hotel was clean, the rooms were big, and we enjoyed our time in this hotel. You can't really stay at a better location in OKC either. The breakfast buffet was great, with lots of options, and we slept really well during our stay in the comfy and large beds. I have to especially complement the staff working here, everyone was fantastic. I think the morale here is great, and they were happy to be at work and also to help/interact with my family. This is something I especially appreciate. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The only reason I am giving the hotel 4 stars, is that the pool had way too much chlorine in it. After swimming, my nephew, sister and I had red eyes that burned from the water. Other children playing in the pool had red eyes and complained of burning. Also, the rest of my family had irritated eyes from simply sitting in the pool area. This is a very easy fix however. Great job Hampton Inn.This is a great place to stay in Bricktown. The bf and I had a great room overlooking left field at the ballpark, so we got to watch the game from our hotel room window :)The pool is really nice here. If you have kids, this is definitely the place to stay. They have fountains and slides and tons of water toys. We would have preferred a quieter swim experience, but we did enjoy sitting in the hot tub.The continental breakfast is delicious; omelets, oatmeal, sausage, cinnabons, toast &amp; bagels, cereal, fruit, etc. It's good.The only downside: it's in Bricktown. Parking is $12/night on top of your room rate, and the noise level is high. The ball game didn't get over until about 11:30, and then the music and noise started up again at 8am the next morning when workers were setting up for the daytime baseball game. Unless you're a heavy sleeper, don't expect to sleep in. But, hey, you're in Bricktown, so it is what it is.I gave this place four stars due to the inconvenience of having to park in the garage then take the elevator to the lobby and then another elevator to your room. Other then that it offers great service and clean rooms well done!!!!This hotel is great.  The location is great.  The staff is great.  It's clean.  It's comfortable.  I don't have to go into a lot of detail except to say that if you're looking for a basic hotel (as opposed to the Ritz or Four Seasons), then this place is a winner.The only strike against it (and why it only gets 4 stars), is the breakfast.  It's not just this hotel--it's ALL Hampton Inns.  Hampton Inn breakfasts are some of the worst free hot breakfasts around.  The food service and dining areas are clean and comfortable, so there's nothing particularly WRONG with it--but there's nothing really RIGHT with it, either.  Unless you eat exclusively oatmeal, you're going to be eating a lot of really unhealthy processed meats, sugary pastries, or flavorless machine-made omelets.Still, I plan on going back to this place next time I'm in OKC.I've stayed at this Hampton Inn twice and have plans to stay here again. Walking distance from restaurants and activities in Bricktown and with a view of the ballpark, this Hampton Inn offers both convenience and value.Like other Hamptons, they provide free internet and a free breakfast. You do have to pay for parking, but since you're smack dab in the best part of in town, that's not surprising. While the hotel has no restaurant, you can easily walk to Nonna's or Mickey Mantle's for a great dinner.Customer service at this Hampton seemed a notch better than at other Hamptons. While you won't find a concierge or an executive lounge like at the big Hiltons or Doubletrees, the friendly employees here offer great dining suggestions, provide directions, and generally make sure your needs are met.If you're lucky, you might get a room facing the ballpark.  Enjoy the view!The Hampton Inn is oddly a great choice for both bar hoppers and families alike.  The location is prime - super easy walking distance for brick town's baseball, bars, and the riverwalk, even in the heat when walking a block feels like a 1/2 a mile.  The rooms are complete little living spaces, almost a studio apartment with decent furnishings and a comfy bed!  Now.  If you are a family, you will love the complete hot breakfast (free!) and a very kid friendly pool that includes a cool looking slide, water basketball, those floaty noodle things, and beach balls.  If you are a couple who have been a little heavy on the adult beverages the night before, the bright and busy breakfast may not be in your comfort zone, and you won't find the pool to be very relaxing. All things considered, I would definitely go back on a weekend trip.I stayed here with my family recently while visiting OKC. It's in the Bricktown area of downtown which is going through some gentrification/revitalization. It's right up against the baseball stadium and is within a short walking distance to the canals/riverwalk and a bunch of shops and restaurants as well as a big movie theater.First and foremost, if you have kids that like to play in water and/or swim, this hotel is great. They feature a fairly large indoor water area that has several water features for the little ones to play and frolic in. The rooms were nice and quiet and the beds were comfortable. Although I HATE, HATE, HATE the pillows (the down feather ones) that this and other hotels are using lately that simply refuse to hold any amount of weight on them or any shape whatsoever so that when you rest your head on them they simply let your head drop down the middle and rise up on the sides to smother you as you try to sleep. This sounds ridiculous but if you can, take your own pillows from home and you will sleep soooooooo much better.They offer free wifi and a ""hot breakfast"" but seriously the breakfast was a huge disappointment. You're better off skipping it and finding breakfast at one of the area restaurants. They do charge you for parking at the attached parking garage. I think it was $8/day.All in all my little boys loved playing at the pool area during our stay and the service was fine so I give it four stars. If they had firmer pillows that held their shape and had a better breakfast I would gladly give them five stars.The facility its self was nice. However, the night scene is ridiculous. The hotel is right smack in center of the bars and clubs. You can hear all of their music! This went on till about 3am, we got no sleep that night. Perhaps staying on the south side of the building would be better.I was really surprised by this hotel. To be honest I don't often stay at these types of chain hotels, but I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Customer service was average, but I didn't have the highest of expectations.  The beds were comfortable, it was clean, they had a surprisingly nice fitness center and it was fun being right next to the baseball stadium.  The breakfast was terrible, but then again, it's a Hampton Inn not a bnb.  Overall, I would definitely stay here again. For the price and location it was a bargain!This ended up being a great, standard hotel. The room was especially clean, the bed was comfy, and the location is perfect. It was just 10 minutes from my client but right downtown. There are many restaurants just down the street to enjoy, all of which are great. What really sets this hotel apart is the staff. I have stayed at numerous hotels all across the country on business and I have never, ever had the pleasure of meeting a nicer hotel staff. They really go above and beyond to make you feel welcome. Also, I loved the breakfast to go bags.I had to go to OKC on business and my company put me up here for the night. Damn do I like my company!!! The staff was great and very friendly. The clerk even suggested some places to visit while I was there. My room was on the 7th floor and overlooked the minor league baseball stadium. My wife and I chilled for little bit and watched batting practice. The room was extremely clean and very spacious. The bed very very comfortable. Location is everything and this hotel is within walking distance of lots of restaurants and Bricktown's riverwalk. Even better, it's within stumbling distance of lots of bars. I've never been to Bricktown before and was really surprised. It's like a little hidden gem in OK. I'm sure I'll be back up here on business and when I do I'm headed straight back to Bricktown.My wife and I took a random road trip up from Dallas last weekend to spend a little weekend getaway in OKC(Bricktown).  Our Saturday night rate was $159 for the night which is a little pricey for a Hampton Inn, but it ended up being well worth it.  This location is great for both families and those wanting to party in Bricktown.The Hampton Inn is located adjacent to the Redhawks ballpark which is great if you plan on catching a Minor League baseball game.It's located basically right in the middle of Bricktown and is in easy walking distance to anywhere in Bricktown.The room was very and large.  Everything was clean and contemporary.  The bed was very comfortable.  The room rate includes a pretty good breakfast as well.The Pool: The pool looked really great......only if you have kids.  It's an indoor pool with lots for kids to do.  If you are going with your significant other and planning on relaxing by the pool you can forget it.Overall this hotel is the best choice if you plan on spending time in the Bricktown area.","Excellent location (convenient to most everything, including major highways) and the staff is amazing.  We were there for the softball World Series and so experienced the tornado outbreak.  The staff were very knowledgable and kept everyone calm and safe.Rooms are clean and hotel is very nice.  The only knock is the construction next door starts early.  I didn't reduce the number of stars though as it should get better.  Other than that, the hotel was quiet, a definite bonus.This place is in the perfect location right in Brick town and right next to all the action (clubs, bars, restaurants)  I stopped in on my way across country and was pleasantly surprised how nice the hotel was and how great the location was.  I had never been to OKC before but for sure now I will be back.  I had nothing that I didn't enjoy of this hotel and they even serve complimentary breakfast that wasn't just cereal and milk.  They had a nice pool for the kids if you have any and a parking garage to keep your car safe while staying with them.I had never been to Oklahoma City before, so had no idea what to expect when we pulled into the Hampton Inn in Bricktown. Bricktown itself is interesting part of town - very quaint. It seems as they have built it to be a sustainable little neighborhood. For tourists, of course. But it was very cute nonetheless. The lobby itself was very standard, nothing special. The guy at the front desk checked us in and gave us our room key. Again, nothing special. What one would expect from a hotel chain.What was special was our room - it looked out onto a huge baseball field! We had absolutely no idea that's what we signed up for! The BF is a HUGE baseball fan and basically parked himself at the window seat for the next few hours. It reminded me of an indoor cat watching the birds at a bird feeder :)The rest of the room was great too. Comfy bed, mini fridge and decent toiletries. I forgot contact lens solution and the concierge brought some up to our room as well. There are a few drawback to having your room face a minor league baseball field. #1- the lights are kept on until midnight. And they are bright. #2 - the hotel doesn't give you a schedule so it can be a little alarming to have game noise wake you up in the morning. #3 - although you can see pretty much everything from your room, it's not the same as being at a game.Besides that, we very much enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn in OKC. The room was affordable and offered a unforgettable experience. Would absolutely go back if ever in town.Stayed there one night (Saturday) and the Bricktown area is lots of fun.  Lots of bar's, clubs and restaurants, most of which were family friendly up till around 9pm.  The hotel overlooked the ballpark which was great, there was a high school game going on so we sat in our room and watched a couple innings.  The only downside I have on the hotel was the parking lot was closed but it wasn't their fault.  They don't own it and the owner had some work done the weekend we were there.  The hotel made up for it having shuttles to the parking lot they were using thought it was only a block and a half away and the shuttle wasn't needed.  It was a nice walk.Highlights for the hotel were:- Room cleanliness- Pool (great pool for kids look at the pictures)- Customer service.At about 2am a bachlorette party came stumbling, and I mean stumbling back to their room, you could hear them from the moment they got off the elevator till they got in their room.  Their room happened to be right next to ours.  The soundproofing on the rooms was good, but nothing was going to block the noise these ladies made.  Within five minuts of a call to the front desk there was someone at their door making sure they kept the volume down and the ladies did.  Great hotel and we will be back.This hotel has a great location. You are walking distance to great restaurants and shopping. When I stayed in town, the Miami Heat was also there causing a lot of hotels to be fully booked and rates were rather high. The breakfast was delicious and the place was really clean, just a tad pricey!Great location with the type of room you should expect from a Hampton Inn. They don't have the welcome home happy hour that most Hamptons have which sucks. Also no fresh baked cookies in the evening but that's a good thing since I don't have the temptation of them!This hotel is Great - I travel a lot and I have never been more satisfied with a Hotel and it's staff.  The Staff as others have yelped are -- ""The Best""..  I can't find one thing to compain about with this hotel..  Clean, Comfortable, Safe, in a good part of town, friendly, convenient to Downtown.  Many Restaurants around.  it's Awesome...If you do not have children...avoid this place. I am Hilton diamond and I can never get an upgrade at this hotel. There are children running up and down the hall at all hours of the day and night and don't even dream about having breakfast in the lobby! The room was clean and in order.My spouse and I booked a room here for an overnight stay while en route from Omaha to San Antonio.  I liked the property because it was easy to access from the interstate and I had read that it was very recently built.  Arriving, I immediately saw the family-friendly, resort-style swimming pool inside the hotel.  I am sorry that we could not use it, as we were too tired and it was packed with people.  The front desk agent upgraded us to a studio suite (room 828), which overlooked Sheridan Street.  Self-parking was an additional charge ($8/night), but was in a controlled-access parking structure connected to the property.  Our room was very large, and had very nice and new soft goods, as well as a large LCD TV.  The bath area was also nice, as was the wet bar.  Facing Sheridan Street on a Friday night, I thought that we would be disturbed by all the noise, but it was hardly noticeable, and went away completely after 11pm or so (I probably was fast asleep and unable to hear anything by then).  We enjoyed the complimentary continental-style breakfast the next morning, and hit the road not too much later.  I would definitely go back to this property so that I can experience it again, as well as take in some of Bricktown.Trusted the Yelpers and wasn't disappointed.Workout facility is one of the best I've seen for this price point.  Free weights, mats, rollers, disposable headphones, water cooler and towels were all available.  24/7 access is great too.Adjacent parking structure is secure with keycard access to leave as well as go down the 'guests only' elevator.  When there's a stadium event, things can get hairy around the turns, though.Tea and coffee station by the front desk was always stocked day and night.  Really nice touch to the already chill lobby space.Wifi and spacious rooms, plus and plus!Only 4 stars for sorta tight registration parking &amp; *meh* hot breakfast (included with rate).Awesome place to stay, convenient location, excellent staff.This is an outstanding property -- by far the best Hampton Inn I've ever stayed in. The hotel is brand new (opened in late winter 2009) and it shows--everything was in perfect condition.The beds were exceptionally comfortable and the staff friendly and efficient. Breakfast was Hampton Inn standard -- very decent for the price (free).Like the other reviewer, my room overlooked the baseball stadium. The team was at an away game when I was there, but it was still a nice view--better than you get from most hotels of this type.This hotel is significantly better than most properties from other higher-end brands. On a previous trip to OKC, I stayed in the Skirvin Hilton. It was perfectly nice, but I think I prefer the Hampton Inn.Me and my sister were in town for the Kings of Leon concert at the Ford Center and wanted to stay in Brick Town so we could walk and be around night life.   Check-in was a breeze and the staff was extremely friendly and conversational. The room was great and very clean. Big fluffy king size bed that can just engulf you. Late night the snack store was open and they let us use the microwave. The only slight down was the room temperature. We could not seem to get it situated where it wasn't hot or too cold. We had it turned down to 68 at one point and yet we were both sweating..that could have been error by operator...but it cooled wayyy down and was fine in the morning. Check out was equally as quick and easy. I will definitely stay there if I go to OKC again!Wonderful location! Great restaurants you can walk to (check out Mantel's and Sage), big, clean rooms, super comfy bed. The staff was very helpful. And complimentary breakfast!after a 13hr drive on day 2 of a road trip from california to atlanta georgia, this place sure beat staying in a motel. the bed was comfortable &amp; though they give you 2 different types of pillows, i still found that neither provided the proper support needed. though for the price you pay, glad to have the various amenities - pool, gym, wifi, breakfast. sure, it's not a typical place to stay when you plan to be there just for a little less that 6hrs... but like i said, it beats staying in a motel.",,,,"['sometimes', 'last', 'minute', 'decisions', 'really', 'work',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/crowne-plaza-oklahoma-city-oklahoma-city,Crowne Plaza Oklahoma City,2.5,$$,29,"This place was rated 3 1/2 stars but I think that is an overstatement.  In my room I had trouble with the outlet for the coffeemaker.  Got that fixed.  Then, the TV didn't work.  Took them until the 2nd call the 2nd day to get it fixed.  The best part was the breakfast buffet downstairs ... it was awesome for the price paid.I must've sounded like one of those crazy hotel guests when I was staying here but it really was one of my worst hotel stays ever. This hotel is so poorly run at night and I don't know what kind of guests they have staying here, but they need to review the kind of market they're trying to keep if they wanna keep the contract with the company I'm with. We came in late at night and needed a fridge. No avail. They had nobody to carry one to our rooms. Bummer, oh well. Atleast their elevators fit all three of us. Yup... three average sized people it fits.I got a lovely wakeup call from my drunk and confused neighbor next door banging on my door to ""Open up! Get out of bed!"". I didn't know him. He then started banging on his hotel room door and told his roommate or whatever to ""Hurry up and clean this damn room. Check out is at 11am, MAKE SURE THERE'S NO SMOKE"". Ring ring, I called the front desk and they were out of there. So why two stars? Because the shuttle driver was nice enough to take us around in a 3mile radius and somebody eventually did bring up a mini-fridge and a microwave. I'm spoiled..Later that night...they put a baby next to me. I know.. you can't stop the baby from crying HOWEVER can somebody please explain to mommy and daddy how slamming a door continuously is going to help? Slamming door + screaming baby = Crystal reading the contract the company made with the hotel about quiet rooms etc. Yeah. I was not happy. There are plenty of other hotels in the area. Do yourself a favor.My family stayed here and the service was amazing! The rooms were super clean and the staff really stepped up. My mom was in the hospital passing away and one employee went out of her way to make us as comfortable as possible! Jenni, thank you so much for your caring and compassion. She was truly a top notch professional. We will definitely stay here again! Awesome job!This place is a JOKE! I reserved my room online with CitiDeal and paid in advance.  The bathroom seems like it has not been clean for weeks; there is no fan in  the bath room. I can't even take a shower. The breakfast was taste gross, the elevator broke.  Check out the next day and found out they charge me another $85 on my credit card.  Called back and explained to them the situation, they promised the charge would be removed within 48 hours and it has not. Called back again, this time, they told me the manager will call me back.  Will see.This is my first time, and would be my last.DO NOT BOOK HERE!!AWFUL HOTELWe checked into the honeymoon suite, when we got into the room, the room had a awful nursing home smell, the leather couch was worn out with holes in the leather, couch looked like they found at a 1970's garage sale. The private pool attached to the suite was filthy dirty, and then when my wife wanted to take a hot bath in the jacuzzi tub, NO HOT WATER!!!! WTF? Shower had no hot water either. We called front desk to complain and stated that if the hotel expects people to pay $180/night, these issues should not occur. Their response was that if we feel we should not pay than please leave our hotel now and we will refund your money, it was 1am. So that's exactly what we did, we left immediately and next day room was still charged to my debit card. Called the manager the next morning and she was just as rude and said we kicked u out and do not come back. Really!! That's their story. Ok gotcha. That is not customer service. Never will I ever stay at another Crowne Plaza, first &amp; last time. Stay away from this place!!!I was kinda freaked out when my boyfriend told me he booked a room here for us to stay in at the 4th of July. But to my surprise it was totally updated. Rooms looked pretty good. Pool was on point and they staff was ultra friendly. Close to everything.. just wishing the breakfast was included. Oh well.... a girl can dream :)In town for weekend getaway. What a gem.  Great rooms, service and hospitality. I highly recommend getting the up-charge for the breakfast buffet. Hot breakfast full service for $6. Definitely worth it. The beds are comfy and the room is very comfortable. We only stayed one night and felt like moving in. The water pressure was a bit weak but we were on the 8th floor so the view was nice. The amenities are all there with even a Keurig in the room. $95 a night...well worth it!!Pretty clean, easy parking... Not many food options after midnight. We settled for whataburger. The hotel was quiet and the staff was polite. Kenneth was super helpful and eased the stress at check-in. Our toilet didn't work but the good out weighed the bad so we didn't complain. I would recommend this to ppl traveling north of the Red River.The breakfast buffet is one if the worst i have ever seen. No menu only old eggs, runny sausage, and rude service. Way over priced. This is a hotel that is there with no heart. Go elsewhere.This is my second time staying at this Crowne Plaza and the first stay was horrid, but this was even worse.  When I checked in I told the desk manager about my experience last time, when I presented and the audio was terrible and nothing was done about it.  She called the banquet manager, who is useless, and we went down to the room and I pointed out some water stained tiles, which she replied ""I don't think they're that bad.""  This should have been my first sign that trouble was brewing.  The next day I head downstairs to eat, which the first time was terrible because the waitress ignored me because she was flirting with some construction guys, but I let that go knowing everyone needs love right.  Well, this time the server (a different one) was straight up rude.  She only filled my coffee cup once, it wasn't busy but she just kept walking into the other dining area.  The buffet is gross.  The eggs are runny, the sausage looked like they were swimming in a pool of grease, and the oatmeal had this crusty film on it.  They only have the buffet for $15.00.  I paid that much for coffee and two little boxes of cereal.  I will never go back.  I had to track her down to pay and then she took the pay sleeve and just kept walking around.  I had to stop her and say ""Could you run it, so I can leave please.""  The she ran and shot me a dirty look.  Also, they tout that they have Starbucks in the lobby.  BTW, it is never filled and was empty each time I checked.  Ridiculous how this property is run.During my presentation, there is NO audio.  Not bad audio, but NO audio.  Fortunately, my coordinator contacted the banquet manager, same one from yesterday, she told the coordinator, ""I guess I should have listened to him yesterday when he said he had problems.""  She called the a/v people, which are off-site, and an hour-and-a-half later the audio was working.  My presentations represent me and this hotel is not worth anyone's business, let alone looking like you represent a substandard product.  Go elsewhere.  Go to a hotel that listens to its customers and cares about quality and professional presentation.Secured the room via Priceline.  Have never stayed at a Crowne Plaza hotel before so my wife and I were excited to have the opportunity. While checking in the girl was very nice.  She asked if we would like a room with two queen beds or a king size bed.  I told her a king size be would be great.  Again, she was very polite.  During the process the guy at the kiosk next to hear came and looked at her screen, pointed to it and quietly said something too her.  He left and when I was handed my key I was told that they only had a room with two queen beds.  No biggie as it was already 11:30 at night.   We arrived at the room to find it was located next to the elevator.  Every time, and I mean EVERY TIME, the elevator went up or down it sounded like a 747 taking off.  My wife called the front desk to ask if we could change rooms.  The guy who had said something to the individual checking us in answered the phone.  He was extremely rude and said they were sold out there was nothing he could do.  My wife was upset as we had been on the road for 8 hours and she needed to get a good nights rest for the following day.  Not believing the individual and his comments I called the 800 number for Crowne Plaza and was told there were plenty of rooms available.  I called back and our buddy once again answered the phone.  He was very curt with me and said there was nothing they could do.  Being it was so late we went ahead an just dealt with the noise.  If it would have been a little earlier, we would have checked out and left for another hotel.Crowne Plaza...you should respect your Priceline customers and use it as an opportunity to introduce them to the level of customer service one would expect from a quality hotel.  Don't treat them like garbage and through them to the wayside.  You missed out on making a good first impression on us.  At the very least the type of first impression that would get us to come back.As the saying goes.....ONE AND DONE.I enjoyed my stay here!! I didn't have much interaction with the staff but the room was clean and confortable. The pillows used on the bed was worth the stay alone. Only issue is i think the rooms are over priced for what you are getting. For over $100 per night i was just expecting something nicer. But it had a sm fridge in it which i like and they said if asked we could of had a microwave tho there was no way to know that. Thought about doing breakfast but there is a breakfast dinner up the street called Beverly's which was excellect and cheaper than get breakfast at the hotel. Giving 3stars b/c of the pillows :)Is there a rating lower than one??  Check in is major problem, bar is a mess.  I  lying in bed and a huge cricket is walking across the floor.  I will NEVER stay here again.  Holy crap!!!!!!!!The hotel is fine.  The rooms are semi well appointed  but the restaurant is horrible. The worst.  We literally had to get up and leave because service took so long.  The staff is super friendly but there is no excuse for the lack of food quality and poor training and equipment. The server literally had to deliver our huge party's drinks individually because they have no service trays!  Our big party agreed we won't go back.Overall I have been exceptionally pleased with both the service and the quality at this hotel. Everything has been clean and the front desk staff have gone out of their way to make me feel welcome. The main reason I rated a 4 star instead of 5 is both the room and the food were just a little above average, but the service should get a 5 star review.  I will certainly add Crowne Plaza on my list as a hotel to return to. I think the outstanding customer service is some of the best I have encountered.I was originally going to give two stars for the sole purpose of not trying to look vindictive, but ultimately decided it really is only worth one-star. Check-in is unnecessarily slow and annoying. Was assigned to wrong room (someone else was already in there). Was told I'd get breakfast vouchers for myself and my husband for the inconvenience; didn't have them the next morning, but after asking about them to the manager (who explained there was nothing she could do), received them the day after. Housekeeping was lame. They didn't bother to make the bed, give us more coffee (after two days) or give us fresh glasses - all they did was take the dirty towels off the bathroom floor. Got locked out of our room on the third day, yet another inconvenience. Stayed on the ""Club"" level - NOT worth it. The club lounge is like 7 different couches that look like they all came from Craigslist all spread out a large room with a TV in it. That's it; that's what you pay $30/nt. extra for. Room is nothing more than standard. Your typical bed, chair, desk and dresser w/ TV. Bathroom is very cramped and bathtub was not clean. We didn't pay for breakfast since we had the vouchers, so it's hard to complain about free breakfast. They definitely had quite a selection for free (pancakes, eggs, meats, potatoes, biscuits and gravy, fruits, oatmeal, breads, cereals) but for $9.95 I don't think it would have been worth it, go next door to Beverly's instead.And lastly, and most importantly, the customer service was absolutely horrible with regard to every single employee we encountered. They weren't necessarily rude, but they weren't friendly either, especially when being asked for things that were caused by their own screw-ups.*** Needs management overhaul! ***Not amazing by any stretch. The lobby is very modern with bright colors and a bar. The business center is also located here.Check in was fine. I came for business and we arrived well before check in time. Room was ready for me.  The room I booked was a 2 double bed room; my co-worker booked the same room and was asked if he wanted a king! I never got that option.  I did have a little rest and relax spa aromatherapy product sample on my bed and the sleep spray really worked. My co-worker did not have such samples provided.There was no clock in my room. i thought that was weird, but maybe they were being modern? Room was a standard room. Hairdryer in the room but the bathroom outlet did not work so I had to use the one for the TV.Beds are kinda comfortable but not really. I didn't sleep all that well. I was also across from the ice machine (which was in a really uninsulated room) so I had those sounds waking me up regularly.Free Wi-fi but it broke up here and there. Decent selection of TV channels; no complaints.Bathroom amenities were nice. I liked the temple spa branded items.If you are a Priority Club member you get free Starbucks. Nice perk. Finding a place to walk to for food was hard as there are no sidewalks in the area. Note: If you need help with directions, the front desk was not the place to ask. We wanted to visit the Memorial but the front desk member was unable to help  us with cab info or get us a shuttle ride. We ended up calling a cab ourselves...cost was $25Cost to hotel from Airport: $35. I probably won't stay here again if I was visiting the area.Very disappointing experience. We come for Memorial weekend to get away, relax poolside, and enjoy the weekend. When we first checked in, Tommy did a great job of looking for adjoining rooms and welcoming us. Later that evening we called to find out how late the pool was open and they indicated it closed at 10 but would open the next morning at 10. We go to the pool the next day and it's closed for what we found out - the entire weekend. The front desk said they would credit $10 per night and upon checkout that is not on our reservation. Crooks!The room was great! Updated, clean and comfortable!Free WiFi!Downside - No free breakfast and the food was VERY overprised! I was there on the companies dime and still didn't want to spend their money on meals here.Logan was great when we checked in, friendly and personable. That's where the good ended. The hotel need updating. The halls look old and dirty. The room has some updated features but still felt dirty. In the morning, you could see down to the pool from my room and you could tell it hasn't been cleaned in a while. The shower floor has something gross stuck to it and there were so many dead bugs in the overhead light it covered half the light. The icing on the cake was not having ANY hot water to shower in the morning. At check out time, I complained to the front desk girl, I believe her name was Tamika, and her only response was ""several people had to take cold showers so you weren't the only one.""  Great way to empathize with my situation. As a frequent traveler, I spend more time in hotels then I do home, this was by far the worse experience I've ever had at a hotel. Not something a Priority Club member wants to associate with.I think this place is going through some kind of improvement initiative.  The first thing we noticed upon check-in was a nice man (dressed in a suit) at the door who greeted us and was eager to assist us.  He was there at check-out too the next morning.  There were two very nice people at the front desk who helped us check in.We found the room to be well appointed.  Beds were comfy, wi-fi was reliable, and everything was clean.  No noise problems and free parking.The location left much to be desired in terms of dining options within walking distance, but it didn't really matter to us since we only stayed one night.","Friendly, nice staff. Run down and dreary looking property. There's a brand new hotel across the street I'll try next time. Hope the redecorate this place soon.Worst customer service ever! Needed to leave town and the hotel would not work with my reservation. This is the hospitality industry and this is a dishonest hotel. They told me one thing and then did something else. Will never stay at this hotel again!!!Where to begin?! We stayed at the the Crowne Plaza the first weekend of October and will never stay there again. The only positive feedback I can give is that the hotel is aesthetically pleasing.  Once the front desk clerk determined we had booked through Priceline, we were put in a room near the stairwell. The look of the room was fine. It was clean and well decorated. We unpacked and went to hang-up our clothes, but there was no closet. There were hangers hanging from the towel bar...yep that was the closet. The first morning we had no shower pressure. He called the front desk to have it checked out. When the repair person came that evening he said ""OH! I didn't know we even had these shower heads in the building anymore. We got rid of these."" Again, I think this was reserved for the people who book on Priceline or another low cost site. When we returned to the property the afternoon of our first day, we learned that both elevators were out of service and had been for hours. There was no timeline available. So, we packed up our baby and all of her gear and hiked up the 3 flights of stairs. Thank goodness we weren't on the top floor! When we got to our room we also saw that housekeeping hadn't visited....it was 5 oclock pm. So, we again called the front desk and asked if we could get a visit from housekeeping or at a bare minimum get fresh towels. The towels never came. So, we called again. Finally at 9 pm, a stack of towels (no washcloths) were delivered to our door. The elevator issues continued throughout our stay. After the outage, only 1 of the 4-person elevators got going again. Neither my husband, baby or I got sleep any of the nights on our trip, especially after the elevator went out. People were going up and down the metal stairwell (right next to our room) at all hours of the night and you could smell cigarette smoke seeping into our room. I have NEVER been happier to check out of a hotel before!I am not sure I stayed  at the same hotel as some of these reviewers.  I thought the hotel was clean, quiet, the carpet looked fine to me.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in.   The only thing I thought was pretty lame was paying for the Starbucks in the lobby.  I have stayed at other hotels that offer Starbucks coffee in the room or in the lobby at no charge.  I would most certainly stay here again.it's a nice hotel, however, it does need a total make over compared to other Crowne Plaza i've stayed at. Other than that, very friendly helpful staffs. i Can't really complain because the van driver is so nice, he will drop you off and pick you up anywhere within a 5 miles radiusI was matched to this hotel through a discount travel website. I booked two rooms for one night to accommodate my group of girlfriends and our two kids for our friend's bachelorette party. I arrived to the hotel early before all of the other guests. At check-in, the woman at the front desk informed me that this was going to be a very busy weekend and that she had placed our party in two king size rooms. I was immediately alarmed and responded that based on the number in our party (6 adults and two children), I had thought we would have had two rooms both with double beds. The woman at the front desk said that she didn't have any other rooms available as the hotel was already overbooked. I explained that the booking was for a bachelorette party. The woman then said that she had put our rooms on the same floor as the flight attendants and pilots that they typically host, so could we please keep our noise down. I told her that noise wouldn't be a problem (although I don't really think I owed her that), but also that did she honestly think that we could fit three adults and one child in a king size bed? She responded by saying, ""Well, are all of your friends your size?"" I responded by saying that our size wasn't really the issue but I was unsure as to what to do give that I had so many guests coming in from out of town and they needed places to sleep. To problem solve the issue at the moment, I took the keys and then went to the room. The room I checked in was fine, but at this point I did not have any intention of staying in this hotel unless they changed our rooms (all of the rollaway beds were also checked out). I called the website through which I had made the original reservation and explained the problem. They first tried to resolve it by calling the front desk. The representative informed me that based on the number in our party the booking should have automatically included double beds in each room. They cancelled the reservation with no problem and rebooked us in a different hotel. I have used this website numerous times for hotels, have stayed in many many different kinds of hotels across the country, but have never had the rude and ineffective service like I encountered at this hotel. I think it was inappropriate that the woman at the front desk inquire about the size of our guests, or that she make the assumption that because we were there for a bachelorette party, we would be so raucous as to disturb other guests (two of us had our kids with us, so it wasn't as though we were planning on going bananas anyway). They didn't reserve our rooms correctly to start, and if they can't handle the volume from partnering with discount travel websites , then that is clearly a managerial issue and should NOT be passed down as a problem to the hotel guest to manage. The whole transaction left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. I live in Oklahoma City and can't see recommending anyone to stay at this hotel in the future.Grace was very professional on the phone and found a reasonable rate for me. Rooms need updated.Average Hotel, absolutely nothing special...The location of this hotel is pretty descent, for a 6 dollar cab ride you can get over to the mall, that has plenty of restaurants and shops.  For some reason this Hotel's van doesn't run to the airports on the weekends so a cab is needed.  The fitness center is located is a spot only accessible by going outside into the pool area.  The equipment was good and was surprised to find actual weight machines.  The elevators were kinda weird, in that you can only fit about three people.  The staff was pleasent and rooms were clean with a good view.This hotel needs a massive update to its infrastructure, which given this economy isn't likely to happen soon. Many of the rooms have broken or ailing air conditioning, there are water stains and badly patched areas in the walls and ceilings. The hotel has a general musty smell. A fire alarm went off at 4am and myself and several other guests were left standing outside until one of us went in to inquire what the situation was and finally the night manager came out and told us it was a false alarm. The only up side was the staff was generally friendly. There are plenty of other hotels in the area. Avoid this one until they do the right thing and close it and completely remodel it. I've stayed at other Crowne Plazas in the chain, and the only thing they have in common is the name.",,,,"['place', 'rated', 'stars', 'think', 'overstatement', 'room', 'trouble', 'outlet',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/oklahoma-city-marriott-oklahoma-city-2,Oklahoma City Marriott,2.0,$$,21,"It feels bizarre to feel slighted by a full service Marriott. This is a great location which offers free parking. I was fortunate to be selected as the guest of the day. The special gift was in the room. While I had no idea what to expect, I was still excited. When I arrived to the16th floor, I wanted to kiss the carpet because I was happy to get off the elevator with a pulse. This elevator is literally two rides from shutting down. It rattles, shakes and sounds like a service lift in a scrap metal yard. And I really wonder what inspector passed it. The person who gave a certificate either stays here free or received a big check.... That alone was a reason to check out but I couldn't bring myself to ride the elevator again so soon. Plus I wanted the gift in my room. The room offers standard Marriott bedding and toiletries. I love the soap, lotion &amp; mouthwash. It is better than most full service hotels. The TV was a flat screen &amp; there was a refrigerator in the room. So needless to say, I easily settled in hoping to ride a different elevator the next day.While things in the room were as expected, the rooms are in desperate need of updates. The place looks old. The bathroom showed the most evidence of poor upkeep &amp; the hotel's age. The check in desk agent was cordial and all but I was not at all impressed with his behavior. He placed my identification and credit card on the counter and slid it to me. If you are going to slide it really close,  wouldn't it be easier to just hand them to me. What was that about? Admittedly, the gift of crap (Merlot, chips &amp; candy) helped me to overlook the agent's bad showing.Is it worth $150 a night? I'd say no... Especially if there are newer places in the area for the same price.Time for the new owners to spend some money on new TV's, pillows, updating the bar out of the 80's, getting some better beverage options....Good solid Marriott with comfortable beds, good location, absolutely GREAT staff.$189 rack rate is nuts though, I would be upset if I was paying close to that - especially with much newer places within 2 miles at 60% the priceI thought this Marriott was okay until the day I was leaving here (I'll explain later).  The rate was about $112 a night including tax but I'm not sure what it usually was because I was here on a business trip so my company arranged something with the hotel (I think).The staff were friendly and I think the manager (maybe not) asked me if everything was okay.  My room was on the 15th floor because I decided to start that rewards thing.  The TV was probably more than 20 years old. lol  I felt like the water in the shower could not go any hotter than it did but that's okay.During our stay, one of the guys on our team for our business trip got stuck in the elevator for 10 minutes because the door wouldn't open.  I heard a bunch of strange noises coming from the two elevators on one side.  The single elevator opposite of them was okay.  One thing to note about these elevators was the fact that the doors close almost immediately after they open.  It was a lot shorter than the normal time for an elevator to stay open.Bistro 44 was their ""restaurant"" and that's where I had my complementary breakfast buffet.  Of course, I had that because my company took out a block of rooms for us to stay in and it included breakfast.  Normally, the price for the breakfast buffet was $12.99 for weekdays and $13.99 (or was it $14.99?) for weekends.  The food was not bad but it also wasn't great.  It's something you would eat with little portions and go on with your day just to have something in your stomach.  They can also make omelettes or waffles but I'm not sure how much that would be normally.Now on to what happened on the morning... I woke up and went to the bathroom area.  I noticed something on my wall and when I turned on the light to look at what it was, it scurried behind the mirror.  It was a roach and I didn't want to see that.  I was paranoid that it got in my luggage since I left my luggage opened one night.  I called the front desk to tell them about what I saw.  They told me that they would refund me one night's stay for the inconvenience and they did.  I gave them one more star because of that; otherwise, this would be 1 star because of that roach.Spent 2 nights here over Thanksgiving 2013. At $76/night it was an excellent value. Good bed, however the pillows were just OK. My star rating is low for these reasons. 1: no free wifi, unacceptable in these times. 2:the restaurant is terrible. Horrible service, mediocre food and worst of all, they don't seem to care. 3: the whole hotel has this sort of musty thick air. It's hard to put a finger on what it was but it had everyone's allergies going nuts. The place needs to be renovated in the worst way. It seemed like a hotel on its last leg and the employees know it.Glad to see that they removed the Marriott name from this hotel. It was a pretty bad one. The service was great, but my room was dated and drafty. Freezing might be a better word.. And musty. I stayed here in Dec 2013 for a few nights and am glad I went to a different one after that.Front desk was very nice.  Internet is rip off--not free.  and as a business traveler, this is extremely inconvenient for me.  Breakfast not free--even though my coworkers have always gotten breakfast the last 4 years in a row.Coffee in the lobby is good, not that fake creamer stuff other hotels often put out.Room was kinda dirty, got put into a king room that was EXTREMELY loud.  I sleep really hard and was up all night with just hotel noises:  footsteps, doors, ice machine, sex in the next room-you know the regular stuff.....then the weird stuff that started happening:  beeping from inside my room without a source, toilet running loudly in the middle of night for no reason, pounding and scratching from walls.  Just saying I didn't get any sleep my first two nights but front desk graciously moved me to another room and all was quiet in the night.Housekeeping seems inconsistent--first room dirty, second room was fine.  they threw out my co-worker's personal bar of soap that was his hypo-allergenic stuff.  I would have been pissed if that were me.  Good thing is the starbucks and panera close by, can go sit over there and use internet if needed.I just checked In and I was planning to get some work ready for Monday morning and found out that they do not have free wireless OR any free Internet! I normally look at a variety of things when I rate hotels but this one thing is enough for me to give them one star. I can not understand how a freaking hotel cannot offer free Internet. They have it for free at the Starbucks and panera across the street! Hotels are supposed to be a home away from home! I have Internet at home! When I pay for a hotel I expect the Internet to come for free!I just can't even fully process this. It just doesn't make sense to me at all. I would post this now but I can't. You can only post from a computer. No phones. I am going to make this known to my company which lists this hotel as a preferred hotel.Also, they did not empty the water out the ice bucket from the last customer and instead just thre wa fresh bag in to bucket. And they did not turn the alarm off on the radio from the last person.I probably will choose another Marriott next time I'm in Oklahoma City.  This one just didn't make the cut. Pros: - The location is good, right on Northwest Expressway with a lot of amenities and services nearby.  - The beds are very comfortable, as (thankfully) mandated by Marriott. - We requested a rollaway bed at the last minute and had one sent to our room, for free. This was very nice. - Fast wifi. Cons: - The service was lacking.  From the check-in desk guy who asked if we were very sure we wanted one king-sized bed (as a same-sex couple), to NEVER being waited on during breakfast -- literally never -- the hotel needs to step it up. - The room had a funny smell to it. Not quite cigarette smoke, but maybe a formerly smoking room that needs new paint or something. - It needs a refresh badly, just as a general matter. The carpet and furniture are just old and need updating. Meh. Just meh. I'll try the Renaissance downtown or the Colcord next time.This place used to be a Marriott and it still has a few of the same friendly staff that were here before, but the hotel went into receivership and now its been rebranded. All the amenities are gone, including getting loyalty points with Marriott. They still have a few copies of the morning paper available, but none of the other perqs, such as the concierge lounge, exist anymore. The hotel actually feels a little haunted now, as its largely empty. On the plus side, it's a lot easier to get a cheap room.Very old and rundown. I had to look twice to be sure this actually was a Marriott! The really cheap rate should have warned me ... Plus no airport shuttle ( or shuttle of ANY kind..).The toilet loudly burping and bubbling all night long kept me awake...Awful AWFUL place....Parked out back with our trailer locked to our truck. Well lit with security guard walking around. Trailer was stolen over night!Pros:1. Friendly staff, Nice environment, Good location, Good size TVCons:1. Dirty house keeping. (We found a pair of sun glass lying under the bed)2. Horrible sound blocking.Awesome staff, crap old hotel. I expect more from a Marriott. My wash cloth had a brown stain, nice. The TV was a CRT model from 1989. The pillows had a faint odor. The carpet looked 50 years old. But the people were nice. Close this place down, remodel and update, increase your prices 50% and reopen.This is my first Yelp review, but I couldn't resist. This property is NO LONGER affiliated with Marriott. It is bank owned and in horrible condition. I stayed here for 2 nights. The first night, there was no internet throughout the hotel. From guest rooms to the restaurants, no internet. So, it was a ""cash only"" night. The second night (tonight) a water main line broke and water was pouring into the lobby, nearly flooding the place. I genuinely feel bad for the employees they all seem dedicated to doing a great job, but are bound by no Corporate leadership or help. As much as I liked them, I won't ever stay here again.This Marriott needs some serious updates. My first room had fleas in the bed, my second room was the tiniest awkwardly angled corner room. The toilet ran all night, concierge breakfast was terrible and included hair in my food, and even the restaurant was no good. Ordered dinner two nights thinking the first bad night was just a fluke... nope just as bad the second night too. Parking is awful! The elevator might break at anytime. Shall I go on? I will say the gym is nice and spacious! Lots of machines for a hotel. Think twice before you stay here. Not worth the money they charge for rooms!This hotel has one of the most helpful, polite and friendly personnel I've ever encountered in my business travels. They would truly go the extra mile to help you out, and sort out any inconveniences promptly and with apologies. I like their cozy rooms (try to get a corner one), views from the top floors, gym/jaccuzzi and accessibility of the consierge lounge. The only drawback is that this is a fairly old facility. I don't personally mind old TVs since they change channels much faster than the newer flat-screen ones, and the bathroom facilities are pretty good, too, but the overall feel is kind of 1970s. Still, a gread deal of a hotel for a business traveller overall.Its a Marriott, so it's not going to be horrible....however, this is not one of the best properties I've stayed in.  I have a few things that drive me crazy.......gross grout in the shower, not enough plugs (phone, laptop, kindle, GPS....) and a bad iron.  This one was OK on all....not great, but OK.  Paid 128 a night, so the price was good.A little update would be good, but I know that has to be costly, so I'm OK with this place at 128!!!I was really disappointed in my stay here. I was in OKC for a week and a half - and not once during my stay did I feel like I was coming back to a clean room. The bathroom floor consistently had stuff left on it, and I don't think my sheets were ever changed. And to add to it, the air conditioner never seemed to actually cool off the room - and for a girl who thinks 80 degrees is hot, this was a bad, bad thing.To add to my misery, the walls of the hotel were thinner than paper - I could clearly hear EVERY SINGLE phone conversation of the person in the room next to me...and at 10 p.m, when I need to get up at 5 the next morning, I wasn't too happy about it. The room service options were kind of crappy, but the service was good - the gentleman who delivered my food was incredibly friendly (I think his name was James), and the front desk even called to make sure I enjoyed my meal. I was certainly impressed by that.Sadly, a clean room is top of my list  - and that just wasn't happening during my stay in OKC.I can imagine this is a good hotel for OKC standards. However after visiting hundreds of Marriott nationwide (for business), this one stands below the average. The staff is very nice which is always appreciated but this place needs a STRONG refreshment. It feels like the hotel is stuck in the 80's with old carpet, wood furnitures, small TV, etc... The hotel bar feels like a karaoke dive bar..... The room are decent but again needs to be revamped with new equipment. The morning buffet is good (smoked salmon??!!).Oklahoma sucks! But the hotel was nice. I got a last minute check-in and they treated me like a VIP. Nice spacious rooms, quiet and comfortable.The gym is well appointed and the staff was very friendly. The price was ok. They could have gouged me since I just walked in to reserve a room but the lady at the front desk took really good care of me.","This Marriott was the high light of my stay in Oklahoma City, The rooms are clean.  Tip; Ask for the northern side of the hotel.  You will thank me.  Russell's is a great sports bar loads of TV's, perfect for bowl games.  Good prices.  Only 15 minutes from Airport.  The prices were great.  The Brunch was awesome.

http://www.yelp.com/biz/aloft-oklahoma-city-downtown-bricktown-oklahoma-city-2,Aloft Oklahoma City Downtown - Bricktown,4.0,$$,44,"I loved my stay here, and hope to return again. It had the PERFECT location for me. Right down town. You walk out the door and you're downtown with unlimited options of things to explore. The rooftop was AMAZING. Super comfortable, and the views were breathtaking. Stayed numerous hours up there, and the best part is they serve drinks! Parking was $15- valet or self park. The pool was closed even though it was 85 degrees.Super friendly staff. Very nice and helpful. Very cool bar in the first floor, however I could here the music in the early morning &amp; I had to call to complain so I could sleep. I recommend staying here! But not on the second floor due to the loud music you can hear from the 1st floor!I keep telling myself to stop trusting Yelp reviews. I thought for sure this would be a great hotel for us to spend Valentine's Day weekend. I was very wrong. First off, this hotel is downtown but  definitely not in Bricktown. My boyfriend booked this hotel thinking we would be able to walk outside and be in the heart of Bricktown, which isn't true. The hotel itself is okay, but definitely not worth the nearly $200 we paid for one night. The room is very modern. Too modern. The furniture is clunky and not comfortable at all. It has a very Euro vibe to it, which in this case isn't a good thing. But the kicker, the reason I will NEVER return to this hotel or any Aloft hotel for that matter is the noise. The walls are so poorly insulated that I can literally hear EVERYTHING going on in the next room. Seriously. I can hear them talking, using the restroom, running water, closing drawers. It's insane. Yes, I'm in the room right now wishing I was at a Holiday Inn. Yes, I'd rather be at a Holiday Inn. I just pray I don't hear anyone having sex...fingers crossed. Save yourself the headache and choose another hotel.Well, it's the next morning, and I have literally gotten maybe 3 hours of sleep. The noise level of this hotel is unreal. Out of all the hotels I've been in - Vegas strip, Times Square, downtown of big cities, this one takes the cake. There were literally people yelling in the hallway, running down the hallway, slamming doors, just being loud and obnoxious ALL night long. This is by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Unless you're coming here to party all night long, DO NOT stay here.You wanna experience luxurious lodging at its finest, come book a suite at Aloft in downtown Bricktown. Everything about this place is stunning; from the convenient location with dozens of restaurants and stores within walking distance, to the contemporary design of the rooms and lobby. They also feature valet parking for a mere $15 fee (which I didn't use). That may seem steep to some. But when you see the area you're staying in, you quickly realize that attempting to drive and park anywhere else in Bricktown is either expensive, inconvenient, or both. Pretty much...there is no such thing as free parking in Bricktown. Besides, you wouldn't want to drive anywhere anyway, unless you plan on heading to some other part of OKC.This hotel has a fully stocked bar. I absolutely love the design of this bar. It also has a kitchen. Although, to be honest, there's not much there. The menu is small. So if you're looking for something more elaborate than, say...a burger or sandwich, just take a walk into Bricktown (but for gosh sake AVOID Mickey Mantel Steakhouse!).The rooms are where it's at! Spacey, huge shower, contemporary design throughout. Now I can't speak for the other suites, but the single king size bedroom has no bath tub. Not a big deal really, just a small caveat.Ultimately, I may find myself returning to this very same hotel if I ever decide to make another impromptu get-away to OKC. The location is convenient as ever! Easy access to the highway, dozens of restaurants in the area, and a great view. If you're wondering where you should stay in or around Bricktown, this place is what's up!We stayed here after four nights staying along Route 66 driving from California to Missouri. I was beyond elated to in a nice hotel rather than a quaint or iconic motel. Staff was friendly and helpful. Parking was $20 whether it's valet or self park in the garage. The room was the most spacious I've been in when it has been a regular room and not a suite. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was immaculate and very modern. Bliss products are in the room and also in the shower. There's a dispenser for body wash and shampoo/conditioner.  The bottle of water in the room is free! No mega charge for a cheap bottle of water. I would stay here again without hesitation.I chose this for our one night stay in Oklahoma City, primarily because it was a good rate, was Starwood and was in the Bricktown area. I've stayed at Aloft's before and this was consistent with my expectations based on those stays. The hotel certainly had a younger, hipper vibe --- was staying with my family including three children (16, 13 &amp; 10). The room was clean and spacious with a king bed with a very large bathroom (turned out to be wheelchair accessible). We had been on the road for three weeks and were glad to see a washer/dryer on the floor. Even though they were pay machines, they came in handy as we were able to do laundry. Even though the hotel had a young crowd, it was not excessively noisy and our floor was quite quiet. The hotel is a short walk to all the bars and restaurants along with the OKC Dodgers stadium so is perfectly situated. We had a short 10 minute walk to grab dinner and enjoyed the chance to at least see a bit of OKC. Even though we didn't use the pool, it looked clean and only two other families were using it so wasn't crowded at all.The only problem we had with our room was that at 5AM, the blinds, controlled by an electric switch, started malfunctioning. There was simply no way to shut it off or disable it and basically prevented us from getting any good sleep for the next 3 hours. Upon check out, my wife mentioned it to the staff and they graciously refunded our parking ($15) and gave us free bottled drinks and snacks for our drive to Memphis.Overall, I'd recommend this location although if you are looking for something a bit less modern and ""hip"", you'd best find another place.This place was awesome. The concierge's where rude, young and inexperienced. Doesn't make the hotel bad but just needs a tune up on their staff.Really great boutique hotel. Has everything you need in a well designed space. It's very pet friendly and there's a dog park located next to the hotel.Love this place. Look no further when making hotel reservations. The Aloft Hotel is #Awesome!I checked into the aloft for a 29 day stay. The first 15 were fantastic. The bar staff was always first rate.  The issue came about trying to use the go green points earned. There was misunderstanding among the employees as to where they can be used. No problem really it was figured out. No harm no foul.  I had a couple of discussion with a woman at the front desk about different services offered. I.e. Keyless entry as well as vouchers owed. Each time I was left without any resolution. The final discussion we had, where I knew that she was not reporting the correct information I snapped and told her that she was being restarted. I know this was uncalled for and inappropriate. So when I returned to the hotel later that night I apologized for my lack of understanding. I was told that it was no problem. I apologized again and went to my room. The next day after work I arrived and gave the valet a lottery scratcher. I also gave one to the woman I had offended the previous night. I went to my room. I had a question about a door hanger so I went back down stairs. I spoke to the manager on duty and got my question answered. I again gave the valet another scratcher lotto ticket because she was good at her job. I also tossed one to the front desk woman and went to my room.  45 minutes later I was asked to leave the hotel by the manager and bar manager. For being hostile to hotel employees. They would not here what transpired and I was given 15 minutes to vacate. Oh well there are other hotels in OKC. But, on my way out I was met by the bar manager and told to exit the side door. Where my car would be waiting. I did as requested. Finally I was in my car trying to secure another room is this wonderful town when both managers came out and informed me that the parking lot was still SPG property.    I'm now at the Hyatt. I'm saddened that a simple misunderstanding turned out so wrong. I'm glad that SPG will be purchased in June. Best of luck aloft OKC. Never again.I am giving this hotel 5 starts because it is in a great location, clean, professional, modern and because the staff is excellent. Especially the vallet, Jace, she is super attentive and accomdating, not to mention very friendly! The price you pay is excellent for the type of room you get, including all of the extras like the beautiful patio view on the 6th floor and the 24  fitness center. It is also a great place to stay also for young professionals and people who want to treat themselves to a relaxing, enjoyable stay. In addition to this, accomodations can be made for handicap people even if the hallways are longer, the staff will make sure you are comfortable and can get to your room with ease.I booked a suite here last weekend for my friends Bachelorette party. I was really disappointed overall. When we arrived at 3pm the room was not ready. The woman at the desk kindly gave us 2 complimentary breakfast tickets for the inconvenience. We waited in the bar, went back to the desk after 20 min and was told it is taking even longer than expected and we can't put our bags in our room. She gave us two complimentary drinks for our extended wait.Later in the night we went to the bar, sat at a table and waited 30 minutes at a table without any service. We even went to the bar and asked for help. We ended up leaving without any drinks and going to another bar.In the morning when we went to redeem our breakfast we quickly realized it's about the same as a McDonald's value menu only without the value. It took 40 minutes for us to get our meat, egg, and cheese sandwiches from the kitchen. It was not worth the wait, even for a free breakfast. Many others were frustrated with the wait time.Great view from our room, neat design features, but poorly executed services.Decent hotel for okc. Seemed like the euro hotels small and shower only. The shampoo dispenser was broken so they left a plastic cup of communal shampoo which I thought was gross. The rest of the room and hotel were good but definitely would pick another hotel for $200.I wish there was a sixth star so I could give it to this hotel. As a long time Aloft fan, this bricktown location was my first stop when searching for a hotel to host my sisters bachelorette party. Not only did the hotel have the space, but the booking agent helped me find the right room for the party. We booked the King suite, which had a perfectly sized extra living space for the party and a beautiful balcony with an amazing view of downtown OKC. We forgot multiple items, like tape, and every ask was met with excited staff here to help! The room was spotless, chic and really impressed party guests. It was a four minute walk to the heart of bricktown for a night out on the town. Location couldn't be better! My ONLY negative would be that the hotel should include valet if you are already spending $400 on a room. Can't wait to stay again!Awesome hotel! My Wife and I travel ALOT so we have seen our fair share of hotels in the States as well as overseas and this one is at the top of the pack for the price.Very modern layout with plenty of space in the room, fantastic onsite bar and food options, fairly adequate gym space considering its in a hotel, and outstanding staff. It's located within a 10-15 min walk of plenty of bars, restaurants, museums, and sports venues. Rarely do you walk through a downtown area at midnight and feel completely safe, but the Bricktown area is an extremely well maintained part of town. It is a very well-lit, safe environment for families, single travelers, couples, or parties with just women. I would have very little worries letting my wife walk around here on her on.I also recommend that the hotel add an info binder in each room. That way the customer can accessibly have: room service menus, room service hours, locations to the hotels laundry, gym, business center, local attractions, history on the area of the city, ice and vending locations, etc.All in All, we will stay here again when we pass back through OK City.My husband and I have stayed in numerous Aloft hotels over the years and we were excited to see them come to OKC.  The location is perfect and the ambiance fits in with everything in the Deep Deuce area.  Given how busy both the hotel and bars (upstairs on the roof and in the hotel itself) are seemingly all the time, it is evident that it filled a void in OKC.  I love the feel of the lobby: trendy but accessible and it always smells good (same across all the ones I have stayed at, so it is a familiar scent).  The re:Fresh bar allows you to grab a snack (healthy or otherwise) and it is all very affordable when compared to most hotel grab and go options.  Check-in was fast and friendly, and he gave us options for parking if we wanted to skip the $15 valet.  Each time we moved the car, we were able to find street parking, but had we planned on hoofing it around the area (which we very easily could have if we had planned our evening better), I would've been happy to pay to be in the garage.Our room was lovely and what I expect of Aloft: not a spacious room but an excellent use of space.  The perks are what makes these rooms such a great deal: a fridge comes standard in every room, as does a coffee maker, bottled water and Bliss toiletries.  One complaint about the floor (4th): it was super stinky in the halls. Like held my nose on the way to the elevator.  While I love that they are pet friendly and have utilized that option many times elsewhere, the hall smelled like a big wet dog and I couldn't get over it.  Maybe they can spray some of the goodness from the lobby and improve that?! Every employee we encountered was friendly and personable and you can tell they like working there and enjoy working with one another: that is a rarity in customer service!  Again, I wish we had planned our evening differently and spent more time at the bar, but that just means we need to go back soon.  Dear husband, if you are reading, go ahead and book us another staycation here ASAP!Great hotel!  Very clean and modern.  Great location with several restaurants in close walking distance, Micky mantle, KDs, a few bars.  Has all the basics.  Mike the Manager runs a tight ship and provides excellent service.  I had the worst trip starting with a delta  flight delay, making miss my connection and needing to stay over night in salt lake.  Finally arrived to aloft to find my hotel room was given away and the hotel was full.  Mike was able to fully comb through availability and made sure I could finally get my room and a good night rest ( FINALLY).  Huge thank you to a management team that cares about their loyal customersWe went to Oklahoma City recently when one of our family members was hospitalized nearby. The staff was so welcoming and helped us in every way possible. When we arrived late in the evening from the airport, the gentleman in charge of the cafe; (which was closing in a few minutes) came over to us when he heard we were asking about a place nearby to get some food. He gave us a menu to look at as we were registering and offered to bring up the food we ordered; so we could get settled in our room.  Wow, what a nice thing to do for us. We had a four year old who was hungry and tired.  Each day the staff checked on our son's progress and always wanted to know how they could help us. Patricia Alva, the manager, gave us the lowest rate to help us since we were staying for an extended period of time. I'm sorry I cannot remember everyone's name, I wrote them down so I could include all the names, but when I got home, I must have misplaced the paper. All I can say is that everyone, from the housekeeping staff, the cafe staff, to the valets and all the staff at the registration desk, could not have been more helpful throughout our stay. The room was always clean and well attended to. The hotel has a very nice rooftop lounge overlooking the city, which was very relaxing after our busy days. It is in a very nice location, easy walking distance to other venues in the area and some good restaurants nearby. We felt very safe there. There is a very nice little market across the street which came in handy for any of our needs.  Considering the unexpected circumstances that brought us to OKC, we were very pleased  to have found the Aloft Hotel. We would highly recommend staying there. Thank you to all the staff that helped us during our stay.Teresa and ErinGreat stay here in downtown OKC.  The valet system is phenomenal.  You text the number when you're ready for your car and bam! They text you when you can come downstairs.   The hotel bar was kicking on a Saturday night with a DJ.  Valet staff knew we wanted to take a cab to Bricktown and nooo they drove us in our own car and dropped us off.  Super sweet.  We will definitely stay here again.Fun fun fun! - outskirts of downtown but close enough to be in the action. Typical aloft hotel decor; beautiful modern and hip.Gold members get 4 pm checkout w complimentary gift at market...anything. Excercise room at 2nd floor is spacious w large screens and internet connection. 6th floor outdoor area for fabulous views!OK, though I had heard about and seen the place before elsewhere, this was my first Aloft experience, and quite honestly, the location and price point were the hook-line-sinker for me.They had an internet deal for pre-paying your stay at roughly 119.00/night or so, tax included, which was pretty good for something centrally-located and VERY walkable to Bricktown (a few blocks away) and downtown. I can see that they go for a really specific demographic niche market everywhere else if you're not in Los Angeles - which is the vibe they are going for.i.e. modern, trendy, hip, sleek...!this shows in their design and architecture, and the rooms really show this off with indirect lighting, vibrant colors, etc. At the same time, they don't sacrifice function with ample bed, storage, and workspace; and they also have amenities such as wiFi, fitness, pool, etc.The bathroom, and most esp with the translucent panel, to bring in natural light from the bedroom, was super cool.They also had a super cool/hip lounge with a mezznine level and floor to ceiling windows; a secondary lounge on the rooftop; and space for pool and board games in the lobby, so they are definitely targeting a 20-30-something crowd (and willing to spend more money than a motel 6) here...Unfortunately, though, I don't fit their demographic! I'm middle-aged...What I really was missing here was either a free breakfast, or at the very minimum free fruit, or if not FREE, maybe a restaurant that is convenient to the hotel, if I didn't want to travel out.Yes, they had a lounge, but no restaurant, or tangible food service.They also had a glorified vending machine = everything that is normally in a vending machine or 7-11 but laid out on the counter and costing $1-2. Next to these vending countertops was a breakfast window at which you can order eggs and bacon, etc. but this was only for breakfast, and there's nowhere official to sit (except the lobby, and going to your room). Sorry, not worth the money, but I'd rather sit in a restaurant where you pay to have someone cater to me!Other than this, though, which I am sure is the case with all the other Alofts, everything was pretty decent.","Let me first state that I did not stay the night here, nor try the restaurant. Room:  Some girls and I booked a room for a bachelorette party. The room was pricey, in my opinion.  And very, very small. All the hype about this place had me expecting more. When I walked in I didn't feel any sort of ""wow"" factor. Just a small room, wouldn't want to stay in it very long. Pool: Lady friends and I then hit up the swimming pool. I just, I can't even explain how terribly located this pool was placed. While laying out, surround on three sides by the hotel itself, you get a beautiful view of the PARKING GARAGE. I mean, It's directly next to the pool. I can't think of a worse spot for a hotel pool.  Maybe in the garage? Why this bothers me so much is because this hotel was built from the ground up.  It wasn't renovated, and that was the only location for a pool. It was designed like that!! Huh???  With as many hot days as we have in OKC, I would expect them to design an awesome pool environment. Hotel:  The hotel itself was nice.  Folks that worked there seemed nice enough, but seemed to think their facility was a bigger deal than I did.  It also felt very small. As an OKC resident, if I were going to have a little ""stay-cation"", I wouldn't stay at this hotel. I don't understand who their customer is. Or who they think their customer is.Loved this hotel and it was great for traveling with a dog--they brought us a bed, toys, treats and bowls for her. Plus it was decorated very well and had comfortable beds!I was sent on a last minute business trip to do some work in Oklahoma City and a small town 2 hours north, called Enid. I have never stayed at an Aloft Hotel prior to this trip, but my boss booked the room for me and swore by it. Needless to say, I was very pleased with the staff and the King Suite. Although I was traveling alone, the suite was a perfect size, and would have been the perfect size for a couple traveling as well. My room also had a lovely view of the hip, yet beautiful Oklahoma City. I was extremely comfortable and felt a warm welcome from every staff member. Whoever gets a chance to travel to The Sooner State, be sure to check out OKC and try to stay at this lovely, modern style hotel.Fun, sophisticated vibe in a location close to destination amenities. A nice change of pace from the usual chain decor. Everything was top-notch and clean. Top floor terrace was a fun place to enjoy a beverage and watch the sun set behind downtown skyline. Well worth the price in my opinion.My experience with this hotel was decent, but I was highly annoyed to find a $15 charge on my company credit card days later. I understand paying for parking, but when I turned down valet service I would have hoped to be told either them or by the front desk that there is a charge to stay at the hotel you are paying that much for. Having to file a second expense report because I was never informed of this charge is definitely irritating. Also, fruit flies at the bar swarming my wine weren't exactly a positive aspect of this particular stay.If you need a professional and accommodating corporate meeting space I highly recommend the Aloft and their wonderful event staff. Professional and pleasant with great communication!  I don't have to worry when I leave my meetings in the capable hands of Lauren!Great hotel, we checked in friday afternoon and checked out Sunday morning with a total of $330.00. One problem I did find with this particular Aloft location was the parking garage was not accessible for guest unless we paid a $15.00 or $9.00 valet fee. Which is completely bogus to me, since I'm already dishing out a chunk of money to stay there. We were told we could park on the side street (if there was a parking spot) and if not, ""just look around for one"". Very silly.Before we called the Aloft phone service, we had found a much cheaper price through Orbitz or Hotels (any of those discount websites would work in this case) but wanted to double check the price and see if those websites were accurate. Come to found out, that $20-40 discount really only harms you, considering your not going to get what you actually see offered on the websites. We decided to pay the $145.00 a night and have the security of a legitimate standard king size room. The rooms are smaller, but worth it. The shower was great, the bed was great, and the staff was great. We didn't use the WXYZ lounge or the side-bar services at all but still really enjoyed the hotel.We also brought our two pups with no extra charge and they did great. I will be staying at the Aloft when I travel more, the experience was pretty pleasant.Terrible hotel!! Much better choices in Bricktown and OKC.  Assuming everyone coming in after a night in Bricktown has been drinking or is drunk I was followed and harassed by security and spoke to in a manor that a dog should not be spoken to. Was made to go to bed with the threat of being thrown out if I didn't. Clearly it doesn't stop there for Yelp removed my first review because they wanted details which u would assume was brought to their attention by the poor Management that didn't bother to access a situation and relied solely on the interpretation of ""Barney Fife's""!  I repeat DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL, very rude staff and incompetent management!!!!My boyfriend and I stayed here from 7/8/14 to 7/10/14 (a Tuesday to a Thursday). Overall, our time at this Aloft was really pleasant.Our first impression, however, was initially not all that pleasant. Upon attempting to check in, the snotty front desk lady tried to tell my boyfriend and I that we would not be able to check in because we were not 21. Now, I understand that although 18 is the universal age most hotel chains allow people to stay without an older adult, some chains have their own policies. That being said, I had checked the Aloft website, and it had said that one must only be 18 to stay alone. My boyfriend and I were a bit put off, as we are independent college students and had planned/paid for this trip independent of our parents. We felt as if she was implying we were not fit to stay at the hotel because of our age, which is outrageous. So, the nice gentleman at the desk with the snotty young lady (she was probably not 21 herself), just looked at the the woman with disapproval before taking our ID's from her and promptly checking us in, with a smile.The miscommunication at check-in was the only negative aspect to our stay. And that's the only reason I deducted a star.The rooms, although not very spacious, we're very nice. The king size bed was HUGE and extremely comfortable. The AC was able to be turned down quite a bit, which I personally appreciate. The wifi was a bit hit or miss, but that's not that big of a deal.The bathrooms were nice, especially the shower. It was made out of stone tile and was pretty large. I also liked how the mirror doubled as the sliding door to the toilet and shower itself. The sink was modern looking, as well.The location was also nice. My boyfriend and I walked to bricktown twice for dinner, and it wasn't far at all.Overall, the hotel was nice, as was the decor in the rooms. If I ever find myself in OKC again, I would definitely stay here!Stayed here for 2 nights. New hotel, clean and modern style. Easy walking distance to bars, restaurants, and OKC Dodgers stadium. Fast valet. Military discount includes free breakfast (made to order breakfast sandwiches, burritos, cappuccinos, etc.) Will definitely stay here again!Average for A Loft, the rooms are just like any other in the chain yet the valet only parking is a big ding. They have a large attached garage and could easily split out some self parking... That and always being out of coffee in the lobby makes this A Loft sub-standard.My wife and I stayed here over the weekend and thought it was fantastic. We travel a quite a bit and always try to stay in Starwood Hotels of which Aloft is a part of. Due to the amount of nights a year we stay with Starwood Hotels they have given us the ability to book a standard room but confirm into a suite before arrival. We chose to upgrade to the Celebrity Suite. Apparently we were the first people to stay in the Celebrity Suite. Blake, one of the managers was the true definition of friendly. He escorted me to the room, gave me a tour of the room, showed me how everything worked, and told me to contact him if I needed anything. Top notch employee they have with Blake. I came into contact with no less than 8 other employees while there and each of them asked me how my stay was and how I liked the hotel. They all seem genuinely excited to be there and showed what appeared to be genuine interest in my opinion and my stay. We have stayed at many Alofts and none have employees like we encountered here. Later, on our way up the elevator, we met Brad the general manager. He noticed and made mention of the fact we had both of our dogs with us. Within minutes two hotel employees showed up with huge overstuffed doggy beds, a bag of dog treats, a couple of dog toys, and a couple dog bowls. Our dogs loved the beds. We couldn't get them out of them. That was a very kind gesture on the hotels part and very appreciated. The room was great. It is 2,000 sq ft. and two stories with the second story being open to below. It has two living rooms with the most functional being on the second floor. We invited over a few friends for dinner and the second floor dining room table was plenty big to accommodate all of us. The second floor AC unit was not working and with the floor to ceiling windows it became quite hot up there. The hotel made 4 separate attempts to fix it to no avail. Not a huge deal. It's a new hotel and they made a genuine effort to fix it. This particular Aloft is very unique and different from any other Aloft we have stayed at. There is a full service restaurant that is open for lunch and dinner. No Aloft we have stayed at has had a restaurant. Usually Alofts are limited service hotels. This one is closer to full service. Keep in mind however room service is not offered. Also, this Aloft has a rooftop outdoor lounge area with couches, chairs, etc. A very relaxing space open to the public. As far as the neighborhood goes it is a great area with multiple restaurants in walking distance and bricktown about a 3-4 minute walk away. There is also a small specialty grocer right across the street. I give this place an unhesitant 5 stars.My boyfriend, myself, and two friends bought tickets for $80 a piece for unlimited drinks and a 5 star buffet for New Years. Let me just say it was a massive disappoint and I will never be going to this establishment again. As a vegetarian this 5 star buffet had just cheese and fruit for me to eat. As for drinking, you had to wait in a 20 minute line which I figured we'd end up doing for an event. After midnight they decided even though we everyone paid $80 a piece for ""ultra VIP"" they would charge us $10 a drink. We all feel completely ripped off and I would never recommend anyone going to this place.My boyfriend and I are moving across the country and we opted for this hotel because of the location and reviews and it was a great selection! The hotel itself is very fun and the staff was very nice. You do have to pay for vallet but that should be expected at an upscale hotel. They are dog friendly and had a nice little patch of grass in the front for the pups. We had also booked this room online with no issues. When we arrived their computer system had unfortunately just gone down but instead of making us wait they simply walked us to our room and manually unlocked the door for us so we could settle in while they waited for the system to reboot and make our keys. The room was small but it's a hotel! Lol. the bed was amazing! So comfortable. There were actually lights in the rooms not just lamps and the bathroom was great! Big roomy shower with awesome soaps and shampoo. Downstairs they have a nice bar and restaurant. We didn't eat there but we did get drinks. The bartender was very friendly. We were able to take our drinks into the front room where we played free pool. They also had a variety of other games. This was a great hotel. We definitely enjoyed our stay.Stayed here on a recent business trip for two nights. They have a very friendly staff and the unique hotel is very modern, clean and inviting. I would stay here again.Wow, just wow. Wow...in a bad way. If I could give a restaurant/bar a 0, I would. This place is so not worth it. Save your money and go somewhere else, seriously anywhere else. First of all, the ""restaurant"" here looks like a cheaper version of the cafeteria at ikea. The bar has a bad layout and people are leaning over you while you eat to order a drink. Speaking of drinking - don't come here expecting to drink anything more complicated than a jack and coke because the bartenders simply cannot make it. I asked for a chocolate martini and was told that ""they don't do those here."" The wait staff was not welcoming at all. We were not greeted and people just seemed to be running around with big frowns on their faces.This is my 2nd stay at this hotel as I travel from Houston for business. Both stays have been for several days and both have been very enjoyable. The food at the bar was surprisingly awesome (I got the crab tacos and bacon wrapped salmon with sweet potatoes). The bed was very comfortable and the location is walking distance to brick town activities and restaurants. I will be back!We stayed over thanksgiving weekend. Location was very convenient, both to Bricktown and the major highways. First impressions were positive with very friendly staff and a modern decor. The room was a good size and had a great view of downtown however upon closer inspection the upkeep and maintenance of the room was poor. It was clean but things were broken or damaged including a tear in the window blind, a broken toilet seat and floorboards coming away from the wall. Nevertheless the bed was comfortable and the hotel amenities such as the pool table and the bar made it a fun stay. I just expected more given price.If your like me and you enjoy a modern hotel, clean, huge spacious rooms in the heart of downtown the you will love this hotel. I didn't even know this hotel existed. When I googled hotels to stay at in Oklahoma City it didn't even pop up. Due to a crazy turn of events (Lakers playing Oklahoma) my original hotel was overbooked and the manager of the Colcord (Clara) graciously booked us at the A loft. So if your searching for a place to stay and like all the above benefits. aloft is the place for you. They even had a great bar downstairs with a few TV's showing different sporting events going on. The hotel staff has been awesome and even allowed us a late checkout because I move slow and needed to eat lunch.  My only improvement would be if there was something in the rooms that said whether they serve food or gave an idea of surrounding areas or benefits the hotel has to offer. But that's just me nitpickingStayed at this location twice... Better than aloft of Rancho Cucamonga and aloft in downtown Dallas and north Dallas when it comes to customer service, location, and amenities. This location is much newer than most and the two story bar area is very nice as well. For such an inexpensive price, this hotel rivals that of hotels three times the price.","Location is great! They have a small pool, although is next to the parking lot and it doesn't offer a lot of privacy. The gym is on the second floor and it's quite modern with top of the line equipment. They have decent food on the menu and loads of hang out areas in the lobby. Most of all the internet is great and at no extra cost!Had drinks and watched the live band here. The band was good and the drinks were decent but a bit pricey.BS service...simple asks that a Rodeway Inn could accomplish this Aloft can't seem to handle. I called the front desk at 5pm on 5.25.14 to get something as simple as a toothbrush to be brought to my room.Waited until 5:30pm and called again and asked if they could add two towels to my toothbrush ask since it still had not been brought upstairs, I got a ""uhhh what?"" by the front desk gentleman so I asked again to have two towels and let him know I was still waiting on my toothbrush, he said he'd check on it for me.At 6:15pm I had to go down to the front desk to ask for the manager. The gentleman at the desk said she was on her way in and I could leave my information and he would have her call me. At 7pm I had to go back down to the desk again to ask for my toothbrush and towels as they were never delivered from my 5pm request, not to mention the manager was still not in. The gentleman at the front desk called the managers cell phone and she said she'd be in within 5 minutes. It is now 9pm and no one has even tried to help me out at this point....I rarely leave feedback on anything, but what does it take to get something so simple accomplished at a hotel that prides itself on service, definitely wont be asking for anything else in the hotel....there's a good chance I'll have to wait until I check out to get it...Booked a room here for a staycation in Bricktown. This place is within walking distance of nearly EVERYTHING in Bricktown/downtown OKC and the price was reasonable compared to other hotels in the area.The rooms had charging stations for everything! Beds were very comfortable and the shower was a rainfall type affair.Free coffee downstairs along with a quick snack bar for midnite ice cream urges, and a short order cook for something hot (not free lol.)The swimming pool was small but adequate.The exercise room was also small but for the size had a good selection of machines and even some weightlifting items.I peeked into the rooftop bar, looked very nice and would like to come back without the teenagers and check out the drink selection.The setup of the hotel was nice also, colorful without being in a circus and the only drawback is the elevators take FOREVER to come! The man at the checkout station said they were trying to fix that.There is also a quick checkout kiosk where you use a touch screen to check out- I thought that would be nice for people on business.Overall I was happy with my stay and Aloft met expectations. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Bricktown.",,,"['loved', 'hope', 'return', 'perfect', 'location', 'right', 'town', 'walk', 'door', 'downtown', 'unlimited', 'options', 'things',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/renaissance-oklahoma-city-convention-center-hotel-oklahoma-city,Renaissance Oklahoma City Convention Center Hotel,3.0,$$$,55,"This is my 4th stay at this hotel. I stay here once a year for the National Tornado Summit which is held at the Cox Convention Center.I have been pleased with each of my stays here so far. The rooms are clean &amp; nicely decorated. There is generous space in the bathrooms. WiFi is available, but it costs about $12 per day. Restaurant, bar, &amp; a sandwich/gift shop are located downstairs. There is also a walkway connecting the hotel to the Cox Convention Center.They used to provide a shuttle service to/from the airport. This service was discontinued in 2015. A taxi from the airport may range from $30-$40. I just grab a rental car &amp; park in the Santa Fe parking garage for $10 per day.The hotel is within walking distance to the OKC Bombing Memorial, OKC Museum of Art, &amp; Bricktown.I was pretty disappointed in my stay at the Renaissance okc. Although the lobby and general areas are very nice and updated, the rooms are subpar. They are outdated and borderline unclean.Things I was disappointed in: 1. The walls were a pale yellow so I could see stains. 2. The tub in my shower was so concave that I felt like I was standing in a storm gutter. Plus, my shower curtain was stained. 3. Since the hotel is so open, you can hear everything from the lobby and general areas. 4. Wifi is not free in your room unless you're a rewards member. 5. Breakfast is only for rewards members on a certain tier and the breakfast options suck. Things I liked: great location.I will stay at the Hampton inn or the aloft next time for sure.A-okay.I've spent many a night in this hotel. It's typical, some things better than normal, others not.Staff was very nice. I didn't have a negative experience once with the probably 20-30 employees I encountered over the weeks.Many of the rooms I stayed in had dingy carpeting. Flat-out unappetizing carpet that made me wear my shoes in the room. Everything else was clean. One of my colleagues stayed here once and refused to come back because of the state of the carpet. My next stay had a wet spot in the carpet; I cringed, washed my feet in the tub, and wore my flip-flops to the bed.Frequently, the curtains were broken in a way that I could not get the blackout portion to slightly overlap so I had the sun peeking through while I hissed like a vampire in the morning. ""Ah! I'm melting!""If your room is on the East side of the hotel, you may hear the bands of Bricktown while trying to go to sleep. Dial 0 to get earplugs and ask for Maintenance if the operator tells you they don't have them.The entry area, bar, check-in, pool, and little shop are all very nice and open. The gym had everything I needed.Room Service was slow and I only did it once. As an apology for taking over an hour to deliver a salad, they brought a slice of pie after I specifically said ""No, please don't bring me a dessert"" over the phone while I was checking on said order. The pie was yummy, btw... pre-workout meal of champions of course.They do offer the 500 Marriott points program for skipping a day of housekeeping. If you travel for work and have become point-obsessed, this is nice. I mean, it's not like I view my point statements and mutter ""my precious"" in a Smeagol voice or anything like that.This does beat the Sheraton across the street. I've also spent too much time in that place. My Sheraton colleagues came over to the Renaissance one time and said things like ""omg, it's like you're in a real hotel.... with a real bar!"" when they walked in.If you enjoy waiting for service items that will never show (such as as towels and toilet paper) and having to clean your own hotel room, this place is for you!As a Platinum Rewards member who stays in Marriotts 70 night per year, I have been a Marriott loyalist; however, my experience at the Renaissance OKC may have me switching brands. Most of our friends we traveled with stayed at and highly recommended the Hilton Garden Inn. Next time we are in town, I won't be coming here We did not get maid service despite requesting it. When I called back down, the front desk said it was too late as housekeeping went home. I asked for 5 towels and some toilet paper- they never brought it.  I went to the front desk and asked for 5 towels, sheets, toilet paper and toiletries and only some of it was brought up.  I had to take out three bags of garbage and change sheets on the beds.   We were still short 2 towels and no toilet paper.  I called again for 2 towels and toilet paper.  Nothing was brought up.  About 9pm, I went downstairs again requesting 2 towels and toilet paper.  Still nothing . . . .In addition to the our housekeeping woes, the restaurant was excessively slow and our food was overcooked- a dry, tasteless burger, tough, dry chicken and burnt grilled cheese.   The walls are paper thin so we heard many conversations and the trains woke me up constantly.  My frustration was the utter lack of professionalism and customer service from anyone on staff   I gave them numerous opportunities to make things right and they never did.  Also concierge was not open on the weekends. Morning cannot come soon enough.  I want to go home.   I'm mad I wasted so many of my points redemption in this terrible experience!!!  I am shocked at the amount of ineptitude of the staff- it was 100% across the board.  Sometimes you have one bad one in a bunch, but everyone I interacted with was of no help to us.  The only positives were the location to the Cox Center for our gym meet and the kids liked the glass elevators and koi pond in lobby.   Should we compete in this meet again, I won't be staying here.I'm basing this review on a comparison to other Marriott and specifically other Renaissance properties.Check-in: There was no line and the check-in process was fast and easy. I did check-in online beforehand so that probably helped.Lobby: The lobby area is beautiful. There's a koi pond!Room: Now this is where the 2 star rating comes into play. The rooms seemed very outdated. Bright yellow striped wallpaper, yellow/orange striped carpet, those horrible fabric shower curtains that always get stained and likely never washed! The beds themselves were very uncomfortable and not the typical comfy Renaissance feel. The walls were so thin that I could hear the man in the next room having a normal conversation over the TV...he wasn't yelling at all.Breakfast Buffet: Here's another reason for the 2 star. The breakfast buffet was a typical breakfast buffet...not remarkable. We went early so we were one of the first people there and only one of two parties in the entire restaurant. Despite that, it took my husband a good 10 minutes to get an omelet (no one in front of him). I had eggs and biscuits and gravy. The biscuits definitely weren't fresh because they were hard and dry. The pastries looked like they were weeks old and my kids had to eat cereal in a cup because there weren't any bowls out. Not a horrible thing, but who doesn't have bowls for cereal? Luckily the waitress noticed that none of us ate much so she only charged us for one buffet ($18). Definitely a bright spot!Coffee shop: There's a coffee shop within the hotel that claims to sell Starbucks coffee. Don't expect to get Starbucks quality though. When I first walked in there was no one behind the counter and the man in front of me asked if we were supposed to make the coffee ourselves. A woman finally came in and fairly quickly made me a skinny hazelnut latte (just like I always order at Starbucks). It wasn't drinkable. The latte tasted like chemicals and I couldn't drink more than 2 sips. Valet: Now if I could rate only the valet, it would be 10 stars! They were amazing. I've never had a valet not only help load the car (typical) but also assist my kids in getting in their car seats!Overall I just didn't feel like the hotel lived up to the Renaissance reputation. I've stayed in many Renaissance hotels (Dallas and DC mostly), and this one didn't come close. The Residence Inn not far from here was a much better experience and I'll likely try to stay there again.From someone who stays in a lot of hotels and primarily Marriott properties, I don't understand the 3 star rating.From the Valet service, the front desk staff, room service and everyone we came in contact with were really prompt, friendly and competent.  The rooms have always been everything they need to be with comfortable beds and good work area.  Well decorated and inviting.  Great location and easy to get to.  What am I missing people?I called the hotel a day prior to my stay and asked for a specific room, understanding that an NCAA event would be in town and the hotel would be swamped due to it's proximity to the convention center and arena.  They were very pleasant on the phone and I was delighted to find my room was assigned as requested.At check-in they were quick and friendly.  They even offered bottle water as the concierge lounge was closed at the late hour I arrived.  I thought that was a real nice touch and an easy way to personalize check-in and show they care.The room was decent.  Certainly not the best room ever, but it's been renovated and it was generally clean.   The room faced the convention center with a decent view of the nearby Devon Energy Center and tower which dominates the OKC skyline.I found the bedding and pillows to be very comfortable.  I was disappointed that the power plug in the lamp next to the bed was very loose and unusable. I ended up having to run my extension cord to behind the TV.  Otherwise there's lot of power plugs on this nifty multi outlet they had on the desk.Thoroughly unimpressive was the fact that the room lacked a mini fridge. I called to have housekeeping deliver one, but the one they gave me was more like a mini freezer.  As it turned all my beverages to slushies.  Sadly, the little knob to control the temperature was busted off.  The room also lacked a in-room safe. The bathroom was ok, but they seriously skimped on towels.  I mean just two towels...how do they expect a couple to function? Or a solo business traveler that likes to carpet the floor with bath towels? Or a yoga enthusiast that likes to use them for a make shift mat?  Worse yet in the bathroom was long hairs in the tub.  If you've seen my profile pic, you can pretty much deduce that they weren't from me, and the bathtub wasn't thoroughly scoured prior to me arrival. I was upset that housekeeping wouldn't replace toiletries like soap and shampoo-seemed skimpy. Also, had to ask for more laundry bags when it became apparent they wouldn't be replaced. The hotel stepped up their game when it came to laundry service which was very good &amp; very affordable for a hotel. As they should, they delivered the finished laundry right to my room.Now room service left a lot more to be desired.  First night I called they said it would take 30-45mins.  Second night they said it would be over an hour. I feel that's unacceptable for a club sandwich, side &amp; drink.  If that were my operation, I'd take on more staff, or cross train folks in other departments to assist with service.  Let's be honest, there's not much to eat late at night in OKC without going under the railroad tracks for a ten minute walk. The Renaissance had a great shuttle service with a very friendly driver, but the valets were always unwilling to summons her for a lift.  You'd ask where they go and they give you the radius, but then they suggest you just walk...what gives.  Cab service in this town was abysmal.  Suggest Uber (UberX cars only) or a limo service.Renaissance's 15th floor concierge lounge was nice.  Stocked with beverages and light snacks. Only wish was that they refrigerated their yogurt instead of placing it in ice and having it melt for long hours.Overall a decent stay, if they tweaked a few service issues it's be great.Hotel decor is dated, no fridge in room, a little pricey. Check in staff was not friendly at all. Breakfast buffet was good but again pricey. Not super impressed and I generally like Marriott hotels. Wish I would've stayed somewhere else.Pleasant employees but service is very slow.  Check in.  Valet. Housekeeping.  Not consistent with other Renaissance locations.  Decor dated.Room service is a joke. I ordered dinner and it took 2 hours before I saw it. They comped me and I figured it was a busy night. On my last day I ordered breakfast only coffee and an English muffin. That took over an hour.Frequent traveler.Staff - front desk / other - MehTop floor status area - amazing, so polite and friendlyGreat breakfast buffet for those with the option.Rooms are good size and offer a quality desk and chair which is important as I'm someone who often leaves the client and continues to work.Very nice decor upon entry with a waterfall touch, didn't get to check out the gym due to lack of time.Valet parking w/ neat text ahead of time option.Would certainly recommend it.This place used to be the bomb...but mother time has had its way.  Excellent service but just an old property.  Most folks don't know what I'm talking about but they will bitch about the rate.  I paid $269 for a 2 room suite (and have many times here) and that's a fair deal.  Clean, good service, attentive staff!Now the BAD...train goes thru at 6:30 am blowing its horn...wth, most cities havebanned that in their downtowns...OKC???Next my suite just has to above the next door Sheraton Hotel service entrance...6:30 am..trucks backing up...beep,beeep,beeep,beeep, !   Then here comes the 7:00 crew, car door, horns, loud pipes...aye aye aye...I'm up 2 hours early!!Probably no more!Beautiful hotel lovely facilities pool area was very clean and very nice had a Manny Petty at the spa and really enjoyed it very great service in concierge room loved our stay thereThis is my 2nd time staying at this hotel.  First time was when I was visiting my sister in Lawton and we came up for a spa day.  That stay was okay - but nothing to write home about - but certainly nothing bad.  (about 6 months ago).This time, I was in town a couple of days for business and decided to stay here again.  Hotel staff is friendly and polite (at least to me) - which is a plus.   Concierge lounge had good supply of drinks (coffee was NOT good) and breakfast was good.  Closing at noon on Friday was not cool - as I wanted to get some water since there is no fridge in my room.  Went downstairs and they wanted 3.20 for a diet dr pepper!  What?  No thanks.Valet is expensive - but colleague had the car this time and was at a different hotel (I prefer full service to a Fairfield). Room cleanliness was not up to Marriott standards.  My coffee pot was in the bathroom (a pet peeve) and there was loose sugar in the box.  There was no room service menu - of which I had to call down for the 2nd night.  My room was not cleaned properly for the 2nd night-  where I had no shampoo and conditioner - had took the used ones from the morning - and put them in a spot where I could still use them but expected fresh.  The maid took the used amenities and put them where fresh ones were to be.  What???  I didn't realize this until I was ready to shower or I would have called down.  I have no cream for the 2nd morning - and the sugar is still loose there.  Room service was fast and reasonable.  Bar downstairs is way overpriced!  Spa is a joke (went both times I was here - but won't go again).  I wrote a separate review of that.I travel quite frequently and love my Marriott brand - but this is average at best.  Too many choices in OKC for an average stay.I have multiple complaints about this complex. The ""Bar"" in this hotel, is both overpriced and a joke. I was ignored for quite a long while when I came to the bar, then I ask for simple drinks that the joke of a bartender ""never heard of"". WOW. SO, they hired him just to be a snooty scumbag to women and out of town types who know more about hs line of work than he does??? I was ""yelled at"" (warned harshly) as well as my boyfriend to ""cover up"" while WALKING and TAKING THE ELEVATOR to the pool. I couldn't believe that!! I understand this is a ""nice"", ""classy"" place, but do you know what isn't ""classy""??Being sexist and ageist (discriminating based on age). This place definitely has the ""old conservative white man"" power hungry control freak standards going on at this establishment. I wasn't wearing a G-string. I had a conservative 1 piece bathing suit on. My boyfriend simply didn't have a shirt on. Apparently, this is enough for a warning. We happened to be barefoot, too. They must have missed that to bitch about. The mini-bar was incorrectly charged, for whatever reason. The best I can guess is that it is ""weight sensor activated"" and even if you picked something up and put it back (or put it back in the wrong spot?) you were charged, regardless.Snooty, rude, unhelpful hotel staff. For my multi-day stay my towels weren't changed at all. WTH? That just seems cheap.And worst of all, no free/complimentary breakfast. They had the nerve to charge like $6 for fruit. Even 2 star hotel chains have free bananas and bagels for breakfast!! I guess the greed of this ""classy"" establishment couldn't be bothered with complimentary breakfast. (They figure the typical client here will overpay for a subpar hotel breakfast??)Paying for parking irritated me, too. No such thing as validation? At a place like this? You would think the room rate would cover that.I've stayed at TRUE 5 star resorts and hotels before. THIS IS NOT EVEN CLOSE. I've been to comfort inns' that had ALL of the same amenities PLUS had free breakfast AND DIDN'T have a snooty staff, or any of the other problems I had. I RECOMMEND JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE ELSE BESIDES THIS PLACE. This place is literally just ""for show"". (The nice looking lobby)My wife and I stayed here for one night, on points, while attending the Bulls @ Thunder game. Which, I must tell you, makes this hotel in the perfect location - you can stroll to dinner and drinks in Bricktown, about 5 minutes away, and then walk another 5 minutes to the stadium, and another 5 minutes back to the hotel after the game. Really, the perfect location.We showed up early and got right in. The hotel is an open atrium setup, and feels like an Embassy Suites as a result. They accepted my ""high floor"" preference, but not my ""far from elevator"" preference. Oh well. Our room overlooked the convention center and train station, and was very comfortable. Large and spacious, with a huge bathroom...that really could have been made smaller (and the extra room used for the living area. But that's just my preference). I've seen reviews around the Interwebs that housekeeping here is very loud. Before we arrived, I thought ""Huh? How can that be? And who cares?"" But holy cow, it's true. They're always speaking very loudly in the halls and banging things around at all hours of the day. Nothing better to wake up to on a cold December morning than two housekeepers being incredibly loud at 7:00am. We didn't eat or drink here, but the bar area looked nice. The lobby was spacious and bright. Valet parking is expensive and a pain - they have to park it 4 blocks away, and when you give them your car, they say to expect 15 minutes for it to be returned. Perhaps longer if there is snow and ice. So that's not cool. I would stay again, but I wouldn't be against looking elsewhere.Great location and friendly staff.  Nice rooms that are very comfortable.  Club floor is just okay.FREQUENT TRAVELERS MUST READ. Their ratings do not accurately convey the quality of this hotel. Okay, let me preface this post by telling you how often I am in hotels and how much the little things really matter. I travel every week and I stay in hotel rooms about 3-4 times per week. When you have a 'home away from home', the little details almost everyone neglects become important. It's not about how the rooms are decorated, how new and progressive the features of the hotel are, and how amazing the pool is. It's about comfort, convenience, and making you feel important and valued as a consumer of their service. I got to the hotel, which is conveniently located in the Heart of OKC; check - convenience is taken care of. I get my room key, which was all ready to go due to their mobile check-in feature, and everything goes smoothly. I continue on to my room and I am elated that it is clean, the air conditioning unit doesn't sound like a jet engine, and it's relatively quiet given the location. The bed is comfortable and the room has adequate space for work and 'spreading out'; check - another one off the list. Now for the most important part - feeling valued. Matt Clauson checked me in smoothly and was EXTREMELY prompt in greeting me as soon as I stepped in the door. He had my room key ready and asked if I wanted points or a $10 voucher (perks of Marriott Rewards Membership). I said points but then stated it would be nice to have the voucher, as I had a long day and a beer sounded delicious. Completely unprompted and without me asking, he decided to give me a $20 voucher. I thought to myself: ""that was extremely kind and something I have never received (above and beyond) from any other Marriott property I have been to."" Don't get me wrong, they are always good with giving bonus points or a free market item but I have never had someone take it one step further. He looked me in the eye and told me: ""thank you for being a loyal member of Marriott and have a couple beers on us."" Finally, a check for the last item on the list. Matt's professionalism and courtesy on my initial interaction with hotel has made me a loyal customer; I will be staying here every month now. I had just finished up a stay at a Marriott property in Tulsa and did not have a great experience. In fact, I even considered switching my 120-180 nights per year to Hyatt. This small gesture kept me from jumping ship. Again, the SIMPLE things matter the most when you are traveling as much as I do and he nailed it! That man deserves a raise. Well done Renaissance OKC!Everyone else's bad reviews don't do this place justice and are not accurate.I will stay here from now on anytime I need a hotel downtown OKC! We started off on the wrong foot by waiting an hour for a sandwich and soup. The 5 Stars is for how well they did completely making up for it. It made the stay for me and my wife thoroughly enjoyable!If they make a mistake they will bend over backwards making up for it! Thanks to the manager, Morgan, for doing your job so well!The perks here are complimentary limo rides to anywhere downtown (be sure to tip), great food and drink, morning breakfast/brunch buffet was delicious, the rooms are very nice and the in-room coffee is pretty good too, the room service is quick and anything we needed they would have it up to our room within minutes!The valet takes a while (10-15 minutes) but it's understandable because there's no parking downtown so I can't fault the Renaissance for this and they forewarn you too.Other than that... Great stay! Thanks guys!After 12 hours driving from Chicago to Oklahoma City I was expecting at least to enjoy the stay at this hotel for a night until I got here... I got a reservation through Priceline thinking I was getting a good deal but when I got here they wanted to charge me triple what I payed because I had my dog with me . It wasn't saying anything about charging extra for dogs in the reservation . It doesn't make any sense !! And I heard the manager saying that they were booked up so I guess they just wanted to get rid of us so they could charge a guest that was willing to pay full price instead of one who got a reservation through Priceline . SO BAD!!!!!","This hotel - while nice on the inside - offers HORRENDOUS customer service. My personal card was charged over $2,000 for an event that I had nothing to do with and it took over a week for the hotel to refund this amount - after much back and forth. For anyone planning an event in Oklahoma City, do yourself a favor and go with another hotel. The worst customer service. And, the worst Renaissance hotel I have ever had to deal with. How do you incorrectly charge a customer more than TWO THOUSAND dollars and make it seem like they are somehow at fault?Beds...FIVE STARS.sorry, nothing more to reportI just went to be early, slept in...AHHHHHHHI stayed in this hotel the night of 11/20 while making my way back from Austin, Texas.  Considering the reviews and the price, I had fairly high expectations that weren't met.  The hotel isn't bad but it isn't as nice as other hotels that offer rooms for a similar price. The entire place was very clean though a little dated.  The person that helped us at the front desk was friendly and told us how to get to our room.  We took the elevator to the 11th floor and entered our room.  The color scheme was terrible but it was clean and the room and bathroom were a good size.  It was acceptable though I was a little disappointed.  I expected something that rivaled the Hyatt Regency we stayed in the night before in San Antonio.  While the beds were comfortable, the pillows weren't.  I also didn't get a very good nights sleep due to the noise from inside and outside.  We heard a lot of street noise and maybe even a train.  I also heard a lot of noise from the hall way.  Not only that but the toilet was loud and would run for several minutes after being flushed.  The only other complaint is that the room was too bright.  It looked like someone used a voltage of light bulb that wasn't appropriate for the lamps.  I also wanted to mention that WiFi in your room costs $12.95 per night and the valet parking is $25.  I didn't use the WiFi so I can't speak to its speed, however, the staff was very friendly and quick in getting my car even though the hotel parks it 5-6 blocks away.   I primarily booked this place because of its proximity to Brick Town.  I would say that its 3-4 blocks away and I'm not sure I'd want to walk it at night.  Fortunately, they have a limo that will drop you off anywhere within a mile of the hotel from 3 PM to Midnight.  That's a nice touch.  In the end, I'm not sure that I would stay in this hotel again.  I've certainly stayed in much worse places but for the price, I had high expectations.Hmm...Mrs. Eva and I stay at Renaissance usually twice a year, usually for a convention or board meeting.The place is very nice, service is good, lobby and bar are nice places to gather. Rooms are always clean and detailed.The rooms are starting to show a little wear and it's about time for a makeover. It's a little pricey if you just consider the room price, but the amenities help make it a little easier to deal with the price.All in all, still a nice place to stay.I have mixed reviews about this hotel. We originally got the hotel b/c our friend was an artist at a music festival in Oklahoma City. When we were greeted and when we left the staff was very nice to us. However, the second day staying at the hotel, some guard had the audacity to start assuming that we were going to cause problems even though we had no history of starting any in the hotel. He even knocked on our door and warned us not to think about fooling around that night even though we hadn't at all! Idk about you but the hotel should always treat everyone with respect until given a reason otherwise and in this case I felt there was no reason. I felt patronized honestly. Also the food was horrible and expensive. But the waiter was really nice. Overall I probably wouldn't stay here again since they have a bias against younger people even though we should be treated the same as long as we behave since we are paying just as much as anyone else and are a customer regardless. However it wasn't terrible.WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER!My guy had a work conference there so he invited me to come for a mini getaway. He upgraded the hotel room since I'd be there so we ended up on the executive level (required key card access to get on the floor). No one ever mentioned that one of the amenities that came with that was a free continental breakfast. We found out on morning 3 so we were not very happy. The cleaning service was slow. I had to call down to the front for more towels b/c room service hadn't shown up by 2 pm. Then the operator tells me that they have until 3:30 pm to clean my room. The towels finally showed up 45 min later after a call from me and my guy. BTW - the actually cleaning lady didn't show up till almost 4 pm. My guy was upset and asked for the mgr who didn't answer and NEVER returned his call. You can only valet which is $25 a night. And we were there 5 nights so total that up. One of the water ponds downstairs was dirty and smelled horrible. The TV kept freezing up or losing signal the last two days we were there.And the thing that topped it off was that you could only have free wifi access on the 1st floor. For $165 + a night, we should have wifi access. To get wifi access above the 1st floor, cost $13 a day. I've stayed in hotels that range from $75 to $300 a night and know what to expect but I can honestly say that I had a better experience @ a $99 a night hotel than at this one. And we met quite a lot of people who felt the same way. Everyone said that if they had known ahead of time, they would have rather stayed further out.....AMEN!We would never ever stay at a Renaissance Hotel again. We were happy to say goodbye to that place. Seriously.Beautiful atrium lobby. I didn't stay here, so I can't comment on the rooms. We did have a meeting in one of the meeting rooms and it was nice. The Hotel is directly across the street from the Convention Center so quite convenient. Unfortunately, they were all booked so I had to stay out by the airport.This is the worst hotel experience I have ever had although only some had to do with the hotel itself.  Rented a room and asked for an upper floor so it would be quieter.  Was put in a room next to the ice machine and elevators, not what I had in mind, but fine.  Went to the Thunder game and had an excellent time.  This hotel is within walking distance of lots of restaurants and venues.  Around 2:30 is when the neighbors came home.  Slamming doors, loud talking and ridiculously loud sex.  It went on for HOURS!  People came and went and on it continues.  Called down to desk and they sent security up after hour 4 but this only briefly deterred them and they started back up again shortly.  The walls are incredibly thin and there was not a word or a sound we didn't hear.  The hotel was not full but did not offer to move us or them or take any real action to shut them up.  Neighbors on the other side complained as well.  I have never paid so much for a hotel and gotten so little sleep in my life.  Housekeeping knocked on the door at 8am wanting to clean!  Um, no!  I had just fallen asleep.  Then the hotel bill came it was correct on the print out but after checking my bank statement later that day I realize they overcharged me by $75.  Room is nice but not worth the price.  I'm just glad this isn't a time I took my son with me.  HorribleThis might be what you're looking for, but it wasn't for me. I spend a lot of time alone in hotels, so internet access is a must. I don't know how good the paid internet is, but the free internet is worthless.  It's kind of fancy, but lacks in amenities. I'm going back to the Residence Inn the first chance I get.Slip into a robe.  Get comfortable.  I have things to say about this place.First off, Israel greeted us with more honest to goodness hospitality than my family has greeted me after three years of not seeing me (I exaggerate).  But the man went above and beyond to find off street parking for us (parked it), explained things to us in the room, and made sure we were just taken care of.  Not the usual treatment you receive.Jesse?  Oh Jesse.  Was he really talking about how the universe started with my boyfriend on the way to Bricktown on our complimentary shuttle (anything is free within one mile of the hotel apparently)?  I tuned out most of that conversation.  But you can definitely get the shuttle bus or Cade ""the driver"" (yes, per the card) up until midnight daily gratis.We had a slight problem with our room.  But we were taken care of immediately by who I assume was the same person who checked us in... Chris?  If you haven't figured it out, i am in fact trying to work on my name recognition.  Goodness, if I were to name everybody at this hotel that hooked it up it would be like the first day of kindergarten with everybody listing their names!  This is a great little hotel with very kind employees and a very modern decorated hotel in the heart of OKC.  Stay here and you will not be disappointed by the service that you receive.This Renaissance is completely worth it. It is located six blocks from the Oklahoma City Bombing Memorial, a stone's throw from Bricktown, the new hip place to be, and the amenities are working! While the rooms are nice, the bar well appointed, and the finish outs of the hotel are all together nice, the best part of the experience was the concierge. I asked if I could have a shuttle for some guest to make it to the memorial and back within an hour. He told me to meet him at the concierge desk when I was ready. We rendezvoused as planned, and he had a stretch limousine ready for us - for no charge. It was a courtesy of the hotel! What?! I looked pretty good in front of the VIPs, though I did not intend to do so. Thanks, Renaissance people!We spent our anniversary here. We were on the 14th floor and the room was huge! I was concerned because the ice and soda machine were next to our room but noise was not a problem. There's a lot to like about this hotel but there were a few things I wasn't too happy with:1. There was no fridge in the room. There was a place for one in the tv cabinet but it was just empty space. I called the desk and they offered to bring us one. Seriously? In a hotel like this there should be a fridge.2. WIFI in the room was $12.95. OK, but when my wife tried to use her laptop that would have been another $12.95! GRRR! To be fair, there is free WIFI in the lobby and the business center.3. Our room had a flat screen TV but it was kind of small for that room, probably a 32 inch screen which we had to angle to view it from the bed.On the good side, the staff is friendly and check-in was very fast. Although valet parking is availble you can enter the parking building off Broadway and pay $5.00 for the night. You can walk to the hotel using the covered skybridge and not be subjected to the elements. Breakfast was included and it was very good--omelets made to order, lots of fresh fruit, pastries and just about anything else you could want. The beds were comfortable enough and we requested extra pillows were they promptly brought to us.Overall we enjoyed our stay and the hotel has more plusses than minuses..I've stayed at another Renaissance Hotel which was why I had no problem booking a priceline reservation for the one in OKC. I wish I hadn't for a few reasons. I had forgotten that Renaissance hotels cater to corporate travels with expense accounts and so charges $12.95 per laptop in the rooms. They also charge $25 for valet, and unlike the other hotels in bricktown, do not have their own garage. I really, really wish I'd known that.Now, Even with that, I still probably would have given it 3.5 stars. The pool, while small, is nice, and there's a nice little workout room next to it. They also have, I believe, a sauna. Free wifi is available in the lobby, but I do wish that they had more comfortable couches. The only comfortable ones I found were in the bar and that closes at night. I was staying in room 621. I'm writing this because of specific complaints with that room. The fire alarm kept chirping which I assume had to do with a low battery. It could have just started chirping or it could have been chirping for the last day. It was a hassle to wait twenty minutes for the maintenance guy to come fix it as I'd had a long drive and just wanted to sleep. The front desk woman was very helpful though each time I called wondering where the maintenance guy was. The room itself was nice enough. The problem was that the furniture was a bit banged up. The worst part was that the decorative finial on the headboard had been knocked off previously, and instead of it being fixed (or hell, even glued) some genius decided to take little nails and not nail it in so much as create a little cage of nails where the head of the nails kept the finial in place. Really Renaissance? I've seen one star motels that would never have something so shady looking.Still, it was quiet and the maid service didn't bother me in the morning.Want to know what really bothered me? My car was broken into in their gated, video-surveillanced lot. But I think the manager said they didn't do security walk-throughs, which I don't understand. Why isn't there a security guy there walking about at night? Three cars were broken into, and according to the hotel manager who was very apologetic and talked with me while I inspected my car, it was mostly change that was stolen. So a crackhead probably walked in after a valet brought a car in and either hunted for unlocked cars or somehow disabled my car alarm AND unlocked my door (I don't think so.) I feel very lucky that I didn't have a window broken or something like that but I'm bothered that my car probably wasn't armed with my key fob. Also, my wallet (I had taken out my credit card and ID the night before but had forgotten to put it back in my purse instead leaving it in the center console when shopping) had been gone through and spilled over the front of my car. My glove box had been open. Stuff in the back of my car was rifled through. Luckily, I had brought up everything with me that I couldn't stand to lose but still. I had some prepaid cards (there was only a little bit of a balance on both) stolen (which the manager said they would reimburse which was nice) but as the days go by since then, I'm disgusted. I can't even look at my wallet because the creep thief stole all my change from that as well as a large half-dollar I carried around with me and refused to spend because my boyfriend gave it to me. I'm going to get a new wallet. The manager had told me that the thief had even gone through one of the other victim's suitcases and left everything laying out. I cannot imagine having to look at clothes that had been pawed through like that. In the big scheme of things, it's a small crime-- nothing of great value was stolen, and nothing was really harmed. However I was still charged for valet service.I wasn't offered any comping whatsoever and I didn't ask because I just wanted to get out of there. I found the people that worked there very nice, but the high up-charging for things that you could get for free or extremely less at other upscale places, coupled with shady ""fix its"" in the rooms, and having my car broken into with very little in the was of ""going above and beyond"" to fix a very egregious occurrence leads me to say I am never saying at this Renaissance again. I'm very disappointed in the Renaissance business model.I really enjoyed this hotel and hope I will get to go back soon. I was surprised at how little noise we heard from outside and the interior courtyard. The lobby is beautiful and the ponds and fountains give off just enough white noise to create a relaxing environment. Great fitness center and a huge indoor pool. I also love that they have a Starbucks coffee shop with a decent pastry selection and a pretty large gift/sundries shop. The room was very clean and I really enjoyed the chaise lounge in front of the window with a view of Bricktown. Good sized bathroom and closet. I would definitely recommend valet parking- once they take your car you can walk to Bricktown. The valets were amazing- they were hustling in 100+ degree heat and still very courteous.I love this hotel for many reasons.  It's always clean, the hotel has a really cool style and decor, the staff is extremely courteous, and the rooms are not super expensive (especially for what you get).  The BEST BEST BEST thing (and I'm pretty sure this goes for all of them) is that it's a free shuttle to and from the airport.  They also have a free shuttle to accommodate their guests in the evening, which not only help's if you aren't familiar with the area, but as to not drink and drive.  I have always received great suggestions from the staff as to where to go, even one time offering their free limo service to all my friends (a somewhat motley crew staying there for the Flaming Lips New Year's show) the night before New Year's.  The limo driver even picked us up from the restaurant afterwards.  Oh, and if you go mostly anywhere in the OKC area and order a ginger ale....I GUARANTEE you will get Coke and Sprite mixed instead.  I didn't believe it myself til my husb did it twice.Regarding ""Joe L."" 's response to my recent yelp....THANK YOU for making my point.That 13 dollars per day not only pays for internet, but for ""unlimited local phone calls"".WHAT A JOKE!  Roadside motels have had that for free since 1972.and ""unlimited long distance calls""??  WHO USES THAT IN THE ERA OF CELL PHONES?And as for your comment of providing free ""wireless internet service in the public areas of our hotel""....  So if I want to google the local movie listings I need to get dressed, leave my room on the 14th floor, ride down the elevator, go to the lobby, google my movie listing, WRITE IT DOWN since I won't be able to take it back to the room with me, take an elevator ride back up to the 14th floor, fumble for my key card, get undressed &amp; crawl back in bed where I was to begin with, JUST to know what movies are showing after I catch a few ZZZ's.  Brilliant.  Rennaissance REALLY seems to understand their customers and the nature of travel.Here is a NOVEL idea:  instead of charging me $250 for that fancy room &amp; then SHAFTING me like a sailor in Shanghai, how about simply charging me $263 for the room, and then giving me the same basic service I can get at the Motel Six.  Hell, charge me THREE HUNDRED and sixty three dollars-- I don't care!  But ripping me off over 13 phucking dollars per day for something that is a BASIC need of travel is SO INSULTING, SO INFURIATING, and SO UNCONCIONABLE, that my brain can barely process it.The marketing people at Rennaissance corporate are idiots.Great service. Nice rooms.Eat at the hotel bar. Was very good meal. Average beer selection, but very friendly staff.They are close to everything and have a van to take you around if needed.Sadly this was a very poor experience. As strong Marriott brand loyalists we have been to quite a few Marriott brand hotels including other Renaissance hotels.  This one was by far the worst experience we've had. To start, the valet pricing is standard and we had no issue with the $25/day. The problem is that the hotel does not have their own lot anywhere near the hotel. The valet has to drive 4plus blocks to park then literally runs back. The process works the other way as well. Over the three days it took on average 30 minutes for our vehicle to be brought to the hotel once we requested it. The hotel looked nice, old but nice. We were given a room on the 11th floor which, aside from the roof of the adjacent convention center, had a great view of the city. The room was large but very plain. There was no safe or fridge and the temperature was either way too hot or too cold. (We were continually adjusting the thermostat to try to even it out to no avail). The furniture was outdated and had black grease stains on the arms of the chair. We gladly began to settle in. It was then we began hearing the doors of the rooms along the hall slamming. The latch mechanism in the doors are so stiff it requires that they be slammed hard to get them to close and latch. This continued on the whole time we were there at all hours. We changed and headed to Bricktown (Fantastic!!!!!) and soon found that the sidewalk to Bricktown was under construction (as was much of the city apparently) so we had to walk along the edge of the hotel wall where the sidewalk still had some remaining bricks. It was a one foot in front of the other walk so I can imagine what would happen if someone had a drink or two.....:)  Over-all, the hotel was sub-par compared to what we have come to expect from Marriott brand hotels.Stayed here for one night and attended a meeting in one of their conference rooms. Came home to see that they had charged my card $178.61???? The company had paid for our rooms. When I called he said they do that incidentals and the charge would come off in 3-5 business days. The room wasn't even worth that price for one night. Outdated 80's decor and charge happy once they get a card. Oh not to mention no free wi-fi.","I forgot to mention that they have free shuttle to the airport. Good $30-$40 savings...Very clean, very friendly, &amp; very cheap thanks to priceline!  God bless Shatner!If it had a self parking it would get 5 stars!Nice facility. Not overly friendly staff - I just feel those of us in this business have to go over and above. Navigators were great though. I stayed 2 nights - I didn't have my room cleaned until after 5:30!Great hotel. The valet/bell service is the best part. They really go above and beyond to take care of you. Take a limo downtown and ask for recs on places to eat.Great hotel.  Staff were very friendly.  They remembered my name after the first week i was there.  I suppose that when you are there 4 days out of the week for months they should know your name.  Room service was quick and delicious.  Staff was very attentive to my needs and always upgraded me when there was availability.  If i go to Oklahoma again i would definitely stay here again.I love this hotel. Stayed here twice and was always impressed with the service. The fitness center rocks, along with the location and price (government rate). The valet parking was super fast once you called them. My only peeve is that the chef should be alittle more courteous in the morning.Nice  clean hotel.  The staff are not unfriendly, but not especially attentive.  It is quite convenient, especially if you have a meeting or conference  at the convention center that it is connected to by the sky bridge.  There are a few restaurants within walking distance, which is good because you will want to valet park, even though it is quit expensive.  If you don't valet park, the parking lot is 4 blocks away.  The food at the restaurant is just okay, but the service was not that great.  They do have a shop with Starbucks, but the pastries are not very good, and of course everything is overpriced.Hotel had a bad kitchen fire at 4am.  Guest were alerted via intercom recording to exist the nearest stairway. There was on security guard holding the door for us at the ground floor exit but no one checking/directing guests long the staircase or the smoky hallway.  My colleague, who has arthritis and walks with a cane was unfortunately placed on the nonetheless floor.  He had such a hard time coming down 9 flights during the emergency. No one assisted him except for other compassionate guests.  Needless to say, fire fighter put out the fire, and we were asked to come back into the smoky hotel and into our rooms.  10 minutes later fire alarm went off again throwing guests into panicky.  NO STAFF WAS THERE to inform guests it was false alarm... some guests exited the hotel, other Guests have to find that out from a fire fighter walking around premise.  The fire fighters were more courteous and were more helpful in event of hotel emergencies.  During the whole ordeal the staffs all pretended it never happen.  No one apologized for the early morning disturbance, no one bothered to ask if they can make the stay more pleasant.  Perhaps management needs to review current disaster preparedness plan.  If it were not for complimentary shuttle/limo, i would rate it lower comparing it to Motel 8 experience.  Free guest wifi though, ok enough to surf web and check emails.I just spent 4 nights and 5 days at the Renaissance Hotel while I was attending the Red Earth Festival across the street at the Cox Convention Center, and I think this has to be one of the better hotels I've stayed at in my time (and I travel a LOT). The maid service was excellent except for my final sunday when she forgot to replenish my bathroom soaps and shampoos (luckily I had some left from the days prior). The staff was friendly and courteous except for the night desk guy who asked me, to my face (when I had lost my key card), ""Are you SURE you're staying here?"" even after I'd recited my partner rooms that were all under the same company name. That's where I'm dinging the hotel a star because he was just being rude for no reason.For breakfast, the buffet was great, with lots of fresh fruit, and cooks who can cook an egg to order like nobody's business. The indoor pool and hot tub were excellent, and well maintained, and the excercise room was small, but largely unused this weekend, probably because their was a convention of portly cowboys meeting at the hotel.(and this led to tons of jokes about the Indian arts and dancing convention going on across the street and how on Sunday there was going to be a cheoreographed cowboys versus indians fight between both warring factions), but I digress...The bar was reasonably priced and has games and either movies or sports shows playing, and even coin-op video games and a smoking patio for those of use who don't do either sports or TV as much. There's a game room and I got the high score on the stand-up Millipede arcade game, 92,000! Beat that!The final plus was the restaurant waitress, Nina, who took care of all of us like an absolute pro, jumping to get us coffee, juices, and everything else like she was psychic! That woman deserves a raise!the hotel is fairly well maintained and the rooms are comfortable. Normally I don't eat in the hotel restaurant for dinner, but the food here was exceptionally good. The cab driver said that this was the second best hotel in the city next to the Hilton. I didn't see the Hilton but I heard it was nice.Brunch was poor quality. Few selections.  Friendly, but inept service.  Someone needed to clean up and replenish the dessert table.  We were expecting something more for $29 per person.I spent a couple of weeks at this hotel while working on a project in Oklahoma City.  My client was in the building next door so I did not have to rent a car.  There are lots of restaurants within walking distance. The rooms are large and clean. The beds are the new Marriott overstuffed ones that are very comfortable.   I also enjoyed the concierge lounge that my Platinum status grants me access to.The gym has dumbells up to 50 lbs and plenty of cardio machines such as treadmills and stationary bikes.  This worked out since I could not find a good gym within walking distance so I did all of my workouts here which brings me to my funny traveling story.After working out on a Monday evening I went up to the concierge lounge to get a snack.  Since I had been up early traveling and I had done a hard workout I decided to reward myself with a brownie.  Since the hotel was not crowded I was given a suite.  However, the couches did not face the TV.  I decided to adjust the TV while I held the plate with the brownie on it.  However, it turned out the TV was not screwed down and it started to fall.  Since I had brownie in my other had I could not catch the tv in time to stop it from falling to the ground.  As the TV was falling my plate when with it and the brownie was splattered all over the room.I heard the TV pop as it hit the floor so I knew it was a goner.  I picked the TV up and check to see if maybe it survived.  No such luck.  So I called down to the front desk and explained my situation.  It was kind of embarassing.  The Hotel Tech came up installed a new TV (did not screw it down though).The funny part is that two days later the band Def Leppard showed up.  The hotel was not that crowded so it was basically Def Leppard and me staying the hotel.  Turns out that rock stars travel just like business travelers.   They meet up in the lobby before going to dinner.  They stop at the ATM machine and they work out in the fitness room (Vivian Campbell was on the treadmill while I was working out).  The main difference is that they show up with 10 tour buses.At the end of the day I got a good road story to tell (although I have not told this story in some time).Compared to the Sheraton across the street, this place is fantastic.Very nice hotel lobby area, great staff and decent food. I did not get to walk around much due to my short time there but I would definitely go back and pay the extra $20 or so over Sheraton. Valet parking here is a pain - it is far away so it takes 10 min to get your car.Very nice hotel, comfortable beds and tastefully decorated.  Valet parking is the only hotel option ($25/night), but there is a perfectly fine parking garage connected to a skybridge that is across the street from the hotel which charges only $7/night.  If I ever find myself in OKC again, I will stay here.",,,"['4th', 'hotel', 'year', 'national', 'tornado', 'summit', 'held', 'cox', 'convention', 'center', 'pleased', 'stays', 'far', 'rooms', 'clean',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/colcord-hotel-oklahoma-city,Colcord Hotel,4.5,$$$,60,"Amazing hotel and service. Best location ever, just a couple blocks from the stadium.Met and exceeded all my expectations! Must stay here when in OKC.Just came from a Junior League event that was here, and want to go back! For starters, I love a good hotel, with retro throwbacks, mixed with modern style. Everything from the food to the service was on point this evening. I was so impressed with their spread of yummy bites -- that included popcorn with bacon salt (yes, bacon salt), and Cajun spices, to name a few. Their antipasto tray had the thickest salami I've ever seen! It was savory and soo good. Being at the Colcord, and seeing the festive holiday lights made me desperately want to renew my wedding vows, haha. There's so many wonderful views of the surrounding downtown Okie area you get.I'm trying to find an excuse for my husband and I to go back!Stayed here for a couple of days while on business. It is a beautiful Historic Hotel with exceptional service. The rooms are huge!! It is nicely situated  across from the Botanical Gardens and only couple blocks walk from Bricktown which has the Dodgers AAA farm club and since I am from SoCal and a die hard Dodger fan that was the icing on the cake. Also while I was there my husband surprised me with flowers in my room. Thank you to Patrice the hotel operator/concierge for assisting my husband in that endeavor. I am forever appreciative. Lastly the hotel restaurant/bar... Flint... was delicious! Thank you to Hunter and Tristan for your company and amazing service!  I look forward to staying here in the future on more business trips and with my family.Apologies to the Skirvin, but I've got my new go to hotel when I am in need of a room in downtown OKC.  I arrived Friday evening.  The valet was crowded, but they get you through quickly.  Now, it's $25 a night to valet.  I know a lot of people will balk at that, but look around.  You're in downtown OKC, there's not much self parking available.  Also, they are very quick getting your vehicle; just call from your room and usually it just takes a couple of minutes.  I think it's well worth it.The check in process was quick and the employee was very friendly.  I had a K size corner room, which apparently are larger.  I had a nice sitting area, a small work station, and a good sized flat screen.  The bed was very comfortable, as are the linens and pillows.  Very good quality.  Importantly, each side of the bed had 2 very accessible electrical outlets.  Too many places tuck them away to the point you have to move the bed.  This annoys me to no end.  But, very easy access at Colcord.  Free and reliable wifi, which is a plus.The bathroom is large, with a separate sink, then a large soaking tub/shower, then a water closet.  I really liked the toiletries, and I don't usually care about them at a hotel.  The shower is large, but it doesn't close completely off.  There is a sort of half wall of glass, then the rest of the shower.  So, cold air could get in while you were showering.  It was aesthetically nice, but functionally not so much.  The room service ends at 11:00 and is Flint, which is an above average downtown restaurant.  Vast is a very short walk as well, as Colcord is connected to Devon Tower.  Every employee I encountered was very friendly and constantly (but not annoyingly) asking if I needed anything.  Colcord offers above average rooms, a nice in house restaurant in Flint, and very friendly service.  There's a reason it's go so many 5 star reviews.  Definite return.We stayed at this hotel while attending a tradeshow at the nearby convention center. This hotel is wonderfully charming!The Colcord is a very charming boutique hotel! The staff is sooooo very amazingly hospitable and helpful! They offer a free coffee/tea service each morning, and they are very prompt with the delivery so incredibly kind.  The rooms are very clean, they have a nice ambiance and they are very spacious. The beds are quite comfy. The a/c was great! (very thankful for this!) Everyone is so prompt to respond to requests. They also have a shuttle that will happily take you around the downtown area, and then pick you up and bring you back. I definitely recommend The Colcord!My wife is staying there and I wanted to surprise her with flowers since she is on a business trip. That is when I had the pleasure of speaking with Patrice. She helped me find a florist close by and once they arrived Patrice had someone put the flowers in my wife's room. Let me say living out in California that type of customer service is rare to find. Patrice's friendly attitude and willingness to help was a great experience. I just wanted to say thank you for all of your help Patrice!!!!Stayed here the night prior to the OKC 1/2 marathon in April. A beautiful hotel, spacious and wonderful room, comfortable bed, and a decent sized bathroom.The service was beyond excellent. Every single encounter we had was completely courteous and classy. My wife and I were very pleased, and will return to this hotel without question. Specifically of note - we appreciated the cookies delivered to our room, and the 3pm late checkout for runners in the race. As i am a slow runner, this was awesome!The only (minor) detractors were the small lobby, and the weak water pressure from the shower. It wasn't terrible, but I like the water pouring out if possible. Great hotel, fair price, we'll be back.You would be hard pressed to beat the Colcord experience...even spending considerable more money!  This is my ""go-too"" place anytime I am in the area...I booked this room for a conference I was attending. The group I was going with had reservations at a host hotel. Thankfully, I had to book somewhere else, because I got to stay here!!!The Colcord is a super nice hotel. The staff is amazingly hospitable. They offer a free coffee/tea service each morning.  The rooms are nice and spacious. The beds are great. The a/c works like a charm. Everyone is so prompt to respond to requests. The shuttle bus will happily take you around the downtown area. I only wish this exquisite, boutique hotel had other locations in other cities. But that would probably ruin the amazing service. This place is highly recommended. Flint is a restaurant in the hotel. Eat chicken bites.It is a sad thing, when money is worth more than a good review. The Colcord did my room block and rehearsal dinner. We booked out 90 room nights with them, 85% of which, we had to guarantee in order to not pay a penalty, and over $6,000 on the rehearsal dinner.We were told that we were receiving a significant discount on our room rates at $179 a night. But as we got closer to the date, we had more and more guests telling us that they were opting to stay at other hotels because they Colcord rate for our room block, was actually MORE than what the Colcord was offering online to other guests not with the wedding. $169 is how much it cost online. Knowing that the hotel didn't HAVE to do anything (signed contract), I reached out thinking that they would at least meet the $169. After all, we had heard that their front desk was telling people to use their AAA discount INSTEAD OF OUR ROOM BLOCK.Not only were they unwilling to save our guests $10 a night, the General Manager, Blayne, was in fact, the rudest person I have spoken to in ages. He was curt, unprofessional, and inhospitable. In the end, he lowered the rate to $174, which meant our guests paid $5 more a night, than other guests of the hotel. NOT what you want when you reserve 90 freaking room nights, and pay thousands for an event.Our rehearsal dinner was great. The staff ought to teach upper management a thing or two about hospitality, because those people are the only reason I am giving ANY stars. And the rooms are beautiful. Had it not been for Blayne, I'd be giving a much better review.They also charged all my bridesmaids for their rooms after we explicitly instructed them to use the card the rooms were guaranteed under.In the end, That $5 per night cost them a good review. They cared more about overcharging MY WEDDING GUESTS and getting their $450 (total for all the rooms), than doing the right thing. Their General Manager has no business working in hospitality in a state that PRIDES ITSELF on how accommodating they are.EDIT: See Blane's response below. That's his takeaway from this review y'all. No need to improve customer service at the Colcord! Brides beware!If you have never stayed, you have no idea what you are missing. Positively the best (my wife would say romantic, but I'm a guy) place to stay in the city. Great rooms, great staff; historic yet like being at a fancy home you don't have.    Restaurant is great!    Have to admit, I miss the old oyster bar that used to be there but time moves on...On second thought, don't stay here. It just leaves more room for us!This Hotel went ABOVE AND BEYOND! My Wife and I had a reservation to stay here but upon check-in they told us that their system had overbooked the hotel and we didn't have a room there, but they had already made us reservations for a new and fantastic hotel across the street, ""ALOFT"". They drove us over to the hotel, checked us in and paid for our room, valet costs, room service, and all taxes. The front office manager named Clara made sure that everything was taken care of. Colcord or the staff didn't have to take care of this mistake this well, but it goes to show how much they truly value their customers. I will be returning to this hotel upon my next visit to OK City. I would strongly recommend Colcord and Aloft to all travelers.And by the way the ""Aloft"" hotel was nice, new, and a very upscale hotel.This hotel is as stunning on the inside as it is out. Located in the heart of Oklahoma City, this is a staple that is rich in history and style. Staying here will impress everyone.Checking in was a breeze before heading up to the room. THE ROOM. Ya, that deserved it's own sentence. For a downtown hotel, the amount of space in the room was incredible. The bed was sublimely comfortable and there was even a fancy pants chair that you could easily nap in next to the bed by a window overlooking the city.The shower had eucalyptus strung around and made me feel like I was bathing like a greek goddess.Best part of my stay? Complimentary morning coffee delivery. CHYA. I know my coffee, and this stuff was good.Thank you, Colcord for a memorable stay!We decided to take a spur of the moment trip down to the city for Christmas. At first glance, the hotels exterior is not as impressive as some of the larger hotels. However, the interior is beautiful and modern. I loved the set-up of the standard king room. We usually upgrade to the deluxe or a suite but due to the nature of this trip, this was all that was available. The little private hallway entry to the room was impressive. In addition, the separation of the sink and bath area made the room seem much larger. Overall the hotel was very clean and the service was great! Their restaurant, Flint was also superb.So..Im not the ""yelp"" kind of guy. I hate writing reviews and am extremely lazy.Recently I was forced to OKC for two weeks of work. This would be my second such trip in a year and I was dreading it based on my previous stay at the Sheraton. The Colcord changed my tune and changed it quickly.Everything was perfect. From the time I checked in...excuse me if i mess up some names...Hanna was fantastic and ensured I was happy with my days travels. My wakeup call was a knock on the door and a fresh pot of coffee, Great touch! The valet always had my car ready, or almost always, ready for me to leave as I got downstairs each morning at 645. When I returned, Flint, would always have a drink and some good conversation. Even the turndown service was nice...providing a forecast and cookie. HA.The hotel was nice enough that instead of dreading my next trip to OKC ill be looking forward to it!Stay here whenever I'm in town. Just got home from spending the weekend at the Colcord and it couldn't have been better. Had reservations and my girlfriend and I showed up from a bike ride we had been on that morning. They stored the bikes for us for the weekend, staff is great and very courteous. Showed up early and they got our room ready while we waited in the lobby. Coffee delivered to our room the next morning at the designated time. Gave the valet our number when checked out and went to breakfast. The car was waiting with the luggage loaded along with our bikes. Love these guys and can't wait to come back.We had a wonderful stay here recently. It was especially fun since I used to office in this building before it was a hotel, and I'd always wanted to stay here as a guest. Even though I had built it up for a long time, it exceeded my expectations. We had a handful of rooms for family and friends in from out of town during our wedding. I stayed in a corner suite the night before my wedding, and it was so nice to have the extra room to get ready before the wedding. There was a large bathroom with shower, tub and dual sinks with a large lighted vanity, and a separate room with the potty and another sink. All of those different areas came in handy while getting ready! There was also a large sitting room with big windows, a couch, and several chairs. We were able to comfortably have three people getting ready in there (with three different hair/makeup people) and it was never cramped. We also stayed the night of our wedding, and we loved it. We ordered room service (since we really didn't get to eat at our wedding) and it was so good. Again, the extra room came in handy as we had a place to put my dress, K's suit, flowers, cake, room service trays and more, and were able to relax in our room without all that clutter. The room service was great, and the morning coffee service was a big plus. Every single person we encountered was so helpful, polished and professional, we were all very impressed. Having Flint as part of this hotel makes a huge difference (in my opinion) in the quality of the food and drinks. We had a few tiny problems with the valets finding our cars quickly, but I think that's because we had multiple people under the same last name in the hotel. It was not a big enough deal that it even mattered, but there could be some room for improvement there.  All in, I couldn't have imagined staying anywhere else the night before my wedding, or getting ready anywhere else. And even if you only stay one night, you really should stay there the night of your wedding if you can. It's worth a little bit of money to pamper yourselves on the night of your big day!The hotel truly is ""as good as it gets."" The Colcord is a truly beautiful hotel with a little of that early 1900s swagger. The Missus and I stayed here for Valentine's Day and were completely blown away with how everything just seemed perfect.The room was clean and furnished with a big screen tv, nice furniture, and the most comfortable bed I've ever laid on. The bathroom was spotless, as well. Overall, everything in our room either looked new or was new. It really was impressive. \The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I'm not the type of guy that enjoys having a door held open for him and at Colcord...they open EVERY door except your room door for you. Kinda made me feel important. They have room service, but I was content with just walking down to the Flint, grabbing a bottle of bubbly, and retreating back to the room. Overall, I was extremely impressed with the Colcord. It's easily the coolest, prettiest, and most comfortable hotel I've ever stayed at.Did you know Colcord is actually spelled F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S? This gorgeous downtown property full of swank and swagger has every little detail covered. Seriously - from the onsite restaurant (Flint - which serves food later than most OKC restaurants!) to the richly-appointed rooms which beg you to stay, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to even the most finicky of friends.The bed is made up so lovely that it almost hurt to pull the covers back... and, I specifically carved out 30 minutes of time upon arrival just to luxuriate under the covers before we needed to get moving. Plush perfection.Service was on-point - my one recommendation is to allow plenty of time to retrieve your car from valet as it took anywhere from 5-15 minutes.Don't pass on this one just because you think it may be out of your budget - if the timing is right, you can get in for well under $200/night.I don't hand these things out lightly: it takes a lot for a pricey hotel to get 5* from me.  Though not perfect, Colcord earns it.  Stayed 3 nights for business, first week in June.  Shopped rates and found this hotel fairly-priced, comparable to the Sheraton (stayed there, blah).  Easy choice.  We needed proximity to the business district, particularly the courthouse.  This spot is in the shadows of the Devon tower (check out the patio terrace!).  Check in on Sunday afternoon was seamless. Our two rooms were ready, beside one another on the same floor.  Ate daily at the Flint restaurant, once for dinner, a couple times utilizing the patio for drinks and post-day recap of the trial.  Restaurant was very good for breakfast, and okay for dinner.  It's pricey.Experienced a couple mis-steps:  a) ""coffee wake up"" was only delivered as scheduled 1/3 mornings.  First morning--ommitted; second-got the desk wake up call, no coffee; third- coffee arrived as expected.b) Upon reviewing my folio had (1) a double charge (same amount for one drink) on the bill from Flint patio bar, and (2) one extra day's parking for one of vehicles (wife brought car on the last day).  Both were quickly corrected over email with the hotel after i returned home.But the pros so greatly outweigh the cons--a) room comfort, great bed, spacious room, great TVs--ACTUALLY HAVE HD, unlike so many in the midwest); b) impressive lobby &amp; historic nature of the building; c) restaurant is well-accoutred with bfast, lunch, dinner, drinks menu; love the multipurpose nature of the space--separate patio bar so you can come chill in flip flops; d) location (convention center/ CHK area/ business district/ park across from Devon) is top notch;e) service was generally good and friendly; loved the car service to drop us and our huge loads of stuff at the courthouse;f) though it's not cheap to stay here, they do NOT nickle and dime the customer: WiFi, morning coffee, bottled water replaced daily, etc.  Such are the elements of a 5* mid-western hotel.  My fave in OKC, by a mile.","Stayed here for two nights. Awesome boutique hotel. Everything was tastefully redone and it had a great location. The area around it is kind of dead but Bricktown is a 10 minute walk away. Internet speed was very fast which is always a plus. Restaurant in the hotel is very average (for dinner at least)  and pricey. The yogurt parfait here in the morning is awesome though. Highly recommend this place.What a gorgeous hotel located in Downtown OKC....I was very impressed with the decor, overall service, and room accommodations at the Colcord during my 2 night stay. My room was super sized and include 2 sitting areas that included a chaise lounge and also two elegant wingback chairs flanked by a pedestal table. The bathroom vanity was expansive with well-lit lighting and a deep closet area too. I was impressed by the Bvlgari toiletries as well - NICE TOUCH!The bed was very comfortable and I also appreciated the touch-key ""Do Not Disturb"" option near the door.Upscale yet comfy restaurant and lounge Flint was on the ground floor and offered up some stiff cocktails and tasty late night bites to tide me over during a particularly fun night.My only annoyances were that my key card had to keep getting reset (3x during my stay) and there was an occasion where we waited for an excessive bit of time for a valet to assist us when we returned one evening. Overall, this is a fabulous option in OKC and I hope to stay here again!TIP: Fantastic coffee and tea service to your room!Beautiful hotel and friendly staff.  Big room, nice bathroom, comfy beds, and quiet room.  Short walk to Bricktown and it is right next to the Botanical Gardens.  Dog friendly hotel.  Only thing that was questionable to me was that they allow dogs in the hotel rooms (for a fee), but won't allow dogs on their restaurant's patio.  However, would definitely stay again.We stayed here during a weekend trip to OKC. It's in a great location for walking to Bricktown and the Oklahoma City memorial and museum. The hotel was very clean and contemporary with a very nice looking restaurant (Flint) downstairs. We didn't have time to try the restaurant but it was very busy on a fri night.  Our room was very spacious and had L'Occitane soaps and shampoos. The only complaint I have about this hotel is the shower. First of all, there was no door separating the shower area from the rest of the room. It was odd. It was behind a wall, so the person watching tv in bed could not see the shower, but still, you definitely don't want to share this room with someone you're not super comfortable with, because there is almost no privacy. Also, the shower had no door to it. It was a European type shower, so water came out of it and the floor got wet. However all in all this was a wonderful upscale hotel and I would definitely return!Loved my stay here - it was clean and really charming inside. The bed was SO comfy and I love having GIANT towels! It was nice to have a big enough room to spread out and do work when needed, but also relax on a surface other than your bed. One other treat was wake-up call coffee. What a nice way to wake up! Much better than a loud phone ringing. :)Check-in was easy and I used the free downtown shuttle service both nights to get around for dinner. Looking forward to staying here next time I'm in OKC.I was lucky enough to win a free night stay here and decided to use it for Valentine's Day. We had the most wonderful experience. We stayed in a king suite and it was so nice! The bed was amazingly comfortable. There are a large amount of tv channels along with free wifi. We had some miscommunication with the service but they took care of everything so I was pleased with that. You can get room service provided by Flint which is on their first floor, but you can also just go down there to order and save a few bucks since the room service is more expensive. This is a beautiful, historic hotel that I am proud to have in OKC.The lobby itself is worth a touristy walk-through from Devon Energy Center if you're an architecture fanatic. The staff are quite friendly towards randos wandering through their structural wonderland in awe. This combination of strategic wood paneling, wrought iron stairways, and monochromatic marble would arouse most people's aesthetics.While on business in OK City, stayed at the Colcord.  Great experience...a very nice hotel.  I recommend.  I stayed in a suite with very nice views of the city. Suite was large with a living room, a bed room, a hot tub and a shower as well as two large Hi Def televisions, and very comfortable bed.  The staff was very accommodating and friendly. A little pricey but worth it, and the connected restaurant (Flint) is quite good, and the hotel appears to be recently renovated.Liked it at first.  Rooms smell of moisture and latent smoke.  All the renovation in the world  haven't made this place better.  Staff is great, accommodating, and is honest in trying to deal with the problems you call them about, but the management can't whistle the big issues the hotel has away.  There are humidifiers or something in all the rooms I've been in. They're loud and I don't know what they are supposed to be doing.  If you have an envelope it will be stuck together in the morning. Much better choices aroundI've stayed in many fine hotels  but I have never seen such OUTSTANDING service as in the Colcord.  Everyone was friendly, interested in helping IMMEDIATELY and went out of their way to  make our conference and my stay over the top!  The hotel is beautiful.  I've stayed in two different rooms during stays at the Colcord and I give both the highest recommendation.  The combination between a historic hotel with all of the most modern amenities and expected in a luxury hotel was fabulous.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  Room service was fast and the food was very good.  Oklahoma people are very nice and the people in the hotel are very nice people. Thanks for treating me royally.   I highly recommend.This hotel is fabulous!  It's located in the mecca of Downtown OKC, next to the Myriad Botanical Gardens.   The hotel is still under some construction, but I hardly noticed it unless I was outside. We were in town for a wedding and I truly have to say this hotel is close to perfection.  The staff is great, the rooms were beautiful and clean, the original art deco structure is still very present, I love that they kept the original design. The rooms come equipped with air purifiers, huge plasma TV, swanky bathrooms and the most comfortable bed I think I have ever slept on. It's the type of room that if you are only staying one night, you wish you were staying longer.  I was somewhat upset when we had to checkout...hmph.The room was so quiet I never heard ANYONE other than me and MP.  The shower was nice but weird.  No door.  I'm old fashioned (I guess), I make a big ol'mess when I shower.  So the whole time I was bathing I was trying to not flood the place, did a pretty good job.  Shower was still super refreshing.  The complimentary toiletries are Bvlgari and very lovely, hair dryer, iron and safe are also present in your room.  The hotel also has a concierge lounge that is open till midnight on the weekends!  This means, that after a night out you can come back to the hotel and drink and have a little nosh before bedtime.  Sounds good to me! Also, I seriously can't pay them enough compliments.  The staff is truly so amazing.  Everyone from the front desk to the guys valeting your cars (which I would recommend, $10 a night).  I'm super picky about hotels, I'm like that crazy lady who inspects EVERYTHING in a  room.  Thank you 60 Minutes for the expose a few years back...ugh.  Anyhooo, I think its a fantastic hotel, next time I'm in OKC, we will def be staying here....If you can get around the street construction and repair on Robinson street in downtown OKC, then you should stay at the Colcord. This boutique hotel is very charming and is priced comparably to the Sheraton and other chain hotels that are in the area. The staff was warm and welcoming from the  three valets who met our car, opened our doors, carried our luggage and escorted us to the front desk; to the front desk personnel who were polite and efficient. Apparently the Colcord was built in 1906 and renovated into a boutique hotel 10 or 15    years ago, and it is very lovely. It sure beats a cookie cutter experience at a chain.  You can tell it was an office building back in the 20th century, but that is part of the charm.  From the elevator banks in the lobby with the metal / Art Deco look, to the marbled dual staircase, you can't help but feel pampered even before you get to your room.  The rooms are expansive, and laid out in a ""U"" shape; (at least ours was). After you slid your magnetic key card in the door (I half expected to use a skeleton key!), you walk down a narrow entry to reveal the large suite replete with a 60' LG high def TV (that even  offered the OKC TV sub-channels).  The king-sized bed was adorned with soft linens and numerous pillows. I wish I were adroit enough to tell you that it was ""Egyptian cotton"" or such-and-such thread count; but suffice it to say that it was high end bedding - very comfortable!There was no tub in the bath, but the shower was strong and hot (let me take a moment to thank mngt for not putting lo-flow shower heads in the bathroom).The other thing that struck me is that when I first turned on the hot water in the lav, it was  hot immediately; no waiting for the water to ""warm up""The only blemish on a great hotel stay is that the windows were very dirty. While we kept the blinds/curtains drawn for most of the time, when we checked in around 4pm we went to look out the eastern facing windows to reveal a caked layer of dirt and dust. It may be time for management to pay for window cleaners.  Lastly (and only b/c I am nitpicking); the walls were a little bare and could use a floor length mirror and maybe a picture or two plus there was a finial missing on the floor lamp in the room. I only noticed because I bumped into the lamp and knocked the shade off!)Okay, I know u was long-winded in this review, but I whole-heartedly recommend this hotel. It is literally across the street from OKC Thunder games and in the middle of everything.  We also had room service from the in house restaurant ""Flint""; look for my review of FLINT in the restaurant section of Yelp.One word: DNR!I stayed here the night before I got married across the street at the Myriad Gardens and for my honeymoon. The staff was exceedingly friendly and the service was superb. The rooms were very nice as well. I enjoyed having complimentary coffee delivered to my room in the morning. The only two things that keep this place from getting a five star review are the fact that they key cards tend to get their information demagnetized rather quickly and the strange set up of a glass pane on the showers instead of a shower curtain. My brother and I enjoyed the room that we split the night before and my wife and I enjoyed the suite on our wedding night. If you want a great hotel to stay in OKC I'd recommend this one (I'd imagine that it would be a great place to stay at after a Thunder game as well.)I've stayed here three years in a row for an event and it's only gotten better. The service this time around has been wonderful.Jacque (spelling??) at the Flint bar/restaurant was awesome and super friendly. I look forward to next year.Beautiful hotel on the outside and inside. Walking distance to shops, museums, and restaurants. I suggest not ordering room service or paying 25.00 for valet. Each time we ordered room service, they forgot at least 2 things, which is annoying.....by time you get back up with what you forgot, my food is cold. We chose this hotel so that we could have less hassles being unfamiliar with ok city. The valet is always late, they do not leave your car tuning for you or open the doors. The Flint restaurant manager did personally come to our room and apologize, and removed room service charges. That was nice, but still not what I expect from such a top notch hotel. We decided to go directly to Flint restaurant and order breakfast since we are starving. We shall see how this service goes.We stayed at the Colcord Hotel for a girlfriends weekend while we attended the Peace, Love and Goodwill Festival at the Myriad Botanical Gardens (which were seriously right next door).  The hotel is just lovely, the room was comfortable and clean - I wouldn't say opulent, but it was everything you need.  Big beds, lots of pillows, L'Occitane products (teeny tiny ones, but nice) in the bath.  Showers only, no tubs.  We were on the 10th floor and had a great view of the gardens from our window.  Cocktails outdoors from the restaurant was a highlight of our stay.  The breakfast menu looked tasty and was reasonable, but we choose to venture elsewhere.  TV reception was spotty, but that's about the worst thing I can say.  There was a humidifier in our room (I've read other reviews and now see why) but room 1006 is not musty at all.  Oh, and several guests had their pets with them!  We were surprised it was dog friendly.  Too bad most the guests aren't as nice as the staff!  LOL.  I would love to stay there again...Wanted it to be great- it wasn't. Valet and bell service were topnotch. Front Desk was uninterested. Room was great except for musky smell- humidifier was running. Bed was good- nice linens, etc. Nice bathroom.PROS:Really nice looking hotel. Friendly front desk staff. Stylish suites, and well-done remodeling.CONS:Cheap bouncy mattresses (you can feel the mattress springs poking your back). Horribly rude and unhelpful valet staff. Non-existent bellhops. No free parking anywhere. The hotel will charge you extra money for a ""parking pass"" that you can just buy at the garage for cheaper. There is a restaurant inside the hotel that tries to be gourmet, but doesn't execute. Rude service and lots of mess-ups at the restaurant. Extra charges on our room bill for services we never used, although the front desk staff gladly removed the charges after bringing them to their attention.All in all, the hotel looks really nice, but for the price, the service is a D-minus.Excellent hotel! I will stay here again. Super comfy bed, complimentary coffee with wakeup each morning, bottled water, luxury car shuttle to Bricktown with very knowledgable, courteous drivers, efficient service at check-in, lux toiletries, huge room, giant tv, free wifi, everything sparkling clean, great view, perfect room temp, dramatic lobby.Problems (resulting in 4 stars): one of the water sprinklers for fire suppression in our ceiling was missing the chrome cover so it was a spigot sticking out of a large hole in the ceiling--very unsightly and ruins the mood. Also, the stopper in the sink did not work so I could not have hot water in the sink to shave with. Irritating! Small details but important in a luxury hotel. It's all about attention to detail. Oh, and the man who helped with our luggage when we left was very nice but he absolutely stank of cigarette smoke. He should change clothes occasionally.Ordered breakfast room service. Delicious pancakes! But our bacon was burned! No excuse for burned bacon. The fresh OJ was delicious.Highly recommend.","This is a beautiful hotel - very clean and well-kept.  The rooms have an apartment like feel and the windows give great views of the Botanical Gardens across the street!  The beds were comfortable with a warm and comfy comforter.  The television is a nice addition at close to 47"" with many free digital cable stations.  The hotel staff is extremely friendly, welcoming, and helpful, especially Sheneca and Cleo!There is some issue with the maid staff replacing shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and soap as well as vaccuuming.  We've been here since Monday, October 15th, and I had to ask for more shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and soap.There are some very nice amenities, like free bottled water, apples, and newspapers daily.  The best thing...FREE WIFI!This hotel was obviously designed by a man. Allow me to explain.They advertise ""European-style showers"" as a perk. This is not a perk; it means there isn't a bathtub for awesome hotel bubble baths. Sad. The toiletries, while fancy and by Bvlgari, smell strongly and also of man. Not something your average female will slather on her body fellas, sorry. Additionally, the flower pictures in the hallway, while appearing to be very feminine at first glance, are VERY FEMININE at second glance, ifyouknowwhatImean. Ahem.All that aside, I really enjoyed my stay here. There's quite a bit of construction on the streets surrounding the hotel, as well as in the attached restaurant but my room on the 9th floor was an oasis of calm. The staff certainly goes out of their way to ensure an enjoyable stay. I experienced a couple small issues that were resolved expediently and with a smile. They've made up for the lack of a restaurant by providing a complimentary hot breakfast and hors d'oeuvres at dinner time. I didn't take advantage of either, but nice touch!Also, best bed ever. You can even order one; they're that good.Corporate Meetings / Workshops / Events THIS IS YOUR PLACE!!!! The company I work for hosts 12 workshops a year for C-Suite Execs and we needed a venue that our out of state clients would be pleased with to stay at and a venue that was cool but still functional to meet in as well. The Colcord has accommodated us to no end. They even came up with a unique out of the box floor plan layout for us when we gave them our vision and then they produced. We wanted a non stuffy feel for our workshop full of business execs, and they delivered. Rebecca Eaton is YOUR GIRL to work with for events. She is amazing, has the best attitude, and attention to detail. She is genuine in her work ethic and so easy to work with. She has THE BEST customer service skills, and a friendly demeanor about her too. The event staff is amazing too, every single one of them. Frank, BJ, Richard, etc. ALL of our C-Suite client have been very happy with their stay at the Colcord, their rooms, the atmosphere, and especially their experiences at Flint, the restaurant downstairs in the lobby area of the hotel. The Terrace Room is where we have our workshops / meeting/ corporate events. They've set up the room in a very USEFUL, COZY, FUN, LASTING IMPRESSION, unconventional way. They know how to think outside of the box and provide EXCELLENT service.Very nice, full service hotel, which was quite welcome after several days on the road.  Room was large and comfortable; staf was friendly and efficient.This hotel was a mere ten dollars more than the Sheraton, which is across the street, but it is a world of difference!I first discovered the Colcord when walking by. We'd checked in to the Sheraton, and hadn't realized it was unsuitable. While walking by the Colcord, I asked the doorman where I could buy some bottled water. He went inside and gave me a complimentary bottle.An hour or so later, we'd vacated the Sheraton and had checked in to the Colcord. It was a *very* busy time, with a VIP actor and sports stars in attendance for a charity weekend of events, along with many NBA players in for the basketball series with the Thunder, but you would have never known it from the friendly efficiency of the staff.The staff was unfailingly wonderful, from the front desk, to the doormen, everyone in the restaurant, and housekeeping. Our room, a King, was incredible, with a shower that had to be 5X7 and glass walled.The hotel goes the extra mile, with the complimentary water, the gourmet coffee and tea by the cup in the lobby.Internet service was speedy and we were able to connect without any problems. The servers, managers, and cooks in the restaurant (especially Jordan and the woman from Tinker who works on the weekends) were phenomenal. Make sure to try the Jerk Pork Chops--amazing! Wines were suggested that really brought out the flavor of the meat.Breakfast was similarly good (the lobster crepes are amazing!). The wait staff were attentive without being pushy and were incredibly friendly.This hotel has a storied history and it is obvious in the variety of touches that harken back to a time when it was one of the tallest buildings in OKC. It has such warm and unique charm and the staff embodies that feel.Only a short walk to Bricktown, the memorial,  and the area, and a short drive to shopping, this hotel is convenient to it all!I'll definitely be back!We got a great deal and really enjoyed it. The rooms are generously sized with charm. Art deco design for an old bank building. Nice shower and bath area (although the room had a shower door and not a curtain which got the floor all wet). They bring you complementary coffee or tea in the morning which was a great way to start the day. I would definitely come back.My husband and I visited Oklahoma City July 18th-July 20th for a concert. We decided to stay at the Colcord because we could walk everywhere we wanted to visit; we had read that the parking situation downtown is terrible as you have to valet or park in the large parking structure. The hotel is beautiful, inside and out. Built in 1910, the Colcord was the first ""skyscraper"" in Oklahoma City. The detail on the outside of the building and inside the lobby area is gorgeous. The room we got, just a standard suite was beautiful. The bed, the chaise lounge, and the seating area was all comfortable. The shower was very nice and all the amenities within the room were appropriate. We were surprised to find out that there was no refrigerator, because we typically bring our own drinks, but it wasn't too much of a bother. Our toilet had some type of problem during our stay in which it wouldn't flush on command. You would pull the handle and it would do nothing, for about 20 minutes, then it would randomly flush. We called it in and it was fixed immediately During our stay, the heat was in the triple digits every day. The lack of a pool at the hotel was very much noticed. To ease some of the walking in the heat, we did opt to use the free hotel shuttle to go to dinner one night. A gentleman in a nice private Cadillac took us to, then picked us up, from the Melting Pot. Unfortunately, the beauty of the hotel is marred by the ridiculous amount of construction taking place all around it. Next to the Colcord there is a monster skyscraper being built which has prevented easily driving through to the Colcord. Also, the street running on the other side of the Colcord was getting work done so there was traffic cones everywhere and people directing traffic. Thank goodness we chose to walk everywhere. Let me just state that the construction did not present a problem with noise inside the rooms. It was peaceful and quiet!For those not aware, parking is not free, I believe it is 7 dollars a day at the structure next door and 10 dollars for valet at the hotel (this is what we chose).I am in OKC for a conference an the Colcord Hotel was one of the hotel choices...This is a great hotel.  It has all the charm of an old, historic hotel and has been very tastefully remodeled.  The lobby is very nice and the restaurant, La Baguette, is quite good and very reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant.The rooms are awesome.  I had a corner / king - sitting area, large bedroom and an enormous bathroom.  The shower is incredible.  My room had a great view of Bricktown.The hotel has a very spacious and well equipped fitness center, but has no pool.The staff is friendly and attentive.Now for the negatives...The hotel offers free WIFI, however, the signal is extremely weak and does not reach rooms that are furthest away from the router (i.e. elevator).  I talked with the front desk, they confirmed the problem and offered to move me to another room.  I decided to stay where I was.  Therefore, the free WIFI was of no use to me.Now for the big issue...  Devon Corporation is building their headquarters building next to the hotel.  Building a skyscraper is very, very noisy.  The construction starts early and continues late into the day.  As great as the hotel is, I may consider not staying here until the construction is complete.Even with the issues, I gave the hotel four (4) stars...My wife has wanted to stay at the Colcord for several years, but we had gotten into a habit of staying at another nice hotel downtown.  However, I decided to surprise her with a trip to the city and a stay at the Colcord.Upon arrival the staff was exceptionally professional and pleasant.  We were equally pleased with our room.  My wife loves to be pampered and to feel spoiled when she stays at a nice hotel and one of the first things she looks for is the nice, fluffy, and clean bath robes.  Guess what, they were there!  She was sold on the Colcord at this point.After settling into our room we decided to go down to the lounge and have a drink and a small appetizer prior to our evening on the town.  We were going to a tapas and wine tasting later in the evening and were not wanting much.  Being accustom to the other establishment we normally stay, we decided to both order an appetizer.  Wow!  The cheese plate came out on a cutting board with several different cheeses, meats and breads.  This would have been more than enough for the both of us.  Then my burger arrived shortly after.  Not sure why it was on the appetizer menu after seeing the size.  However, I was not disappointed with the real meat and great bun!The selection of drinks and beers was great and the bar staff was more than helpful with explanations of the different drinks that were offered.When we left for the evening, the door staff offered to give us a ride in the hotel's complimentary shuttle to our event.  We were within walking distance, but were impressed with the offer and that their shuttle is not a van, but a Cadillac Escalade.After a restful night's sleep, the staff delivered freshly brewed coffee to our door with our wakeup call ""knock"". We then went back to the Flint restaurant for breakfast.  This is when we met Victoria, our waitress.  She resounded the other pleasant experiences we had at the Colcord. She was very professional, cheery, and pleasant.  She made suggestions for our meal and we were very pleased with the food she had suggested.Thanks to the hotel staff and all around pleasant experience we had at the Colcord.  We will be loyal repeating guests.Thank you to you the staff!Lots of potential but just misses the mark.  It's a historical hotel that has recently been renovated.  We were in town from Austin for a rowing regatta and wanted to stay somewhere nice.   When you walk in the hotel is playing dance/club music- kind of loud. It doesn't match.  I like dance/club music in its appropriate venue- a historical hotel is not that venue UNLESS you are in Miami on the beach in an art deco hotel with doors open on both ends and sheers of fabric flowing throughout the entire bottom floor of the hotel..... The rooms were okay.  Comfy beds, which is what you want in a hotel.  They just lack attention to detail- needed more towels and Kleenex and they missed it- even when I purposely left the empty Kleenex box on top of the holder in plain site.  The bed was thrown back together, not actually remade.  the place was moldy. The front desk staff were not warm and fuzzy at all.  They always seemed slightly frantic and running around, even when no one else was up there.  Just not smooth and enjoyable. Don't get me started on the restaurant, Flint. Just read my separate review for them. Overall not impressed and will not return. Bummer.What a great hotel!!  We spent the night in an end room with a king sized bed. The room is considered a suite. There was a comfortable sofa and chair. The hotel provided complimentary bottled water, delicious Illig coffee, and high end designer toiletries. The bed was awesome.  All the staff was very welcoming and helpful. The hotel is at a great location tooI absolutely loved my experience at the Colcord. Our suite was huge; a living room, a bed room, a hot tub and a shower as well as two Hi Def televisions. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. A little pricey but well worth it.Stayed here Sun-Tuesday. Great hotel. Great service with a smile and friendly staff.  Free shuttle and mins from Bricktown!!Loved this hotel. Great boutique hotel w/ reasonable rates, friendly and attentive service and nice decor. We travel with our dogs a lot and always find places that are relatively hassle free for pets (no 40lb weight limit or nonrefundable deposits) so I was glad I called a few that I turned down because it eventually led me to the Colcord. Our room was big and super clean with a sitting area w/ 2 chairs and lamp/table, an entryway so the door didn't open and expose the room/bed, lots of drawers and closet space, comfy bed, small pillows but amazingly they worked out okay, complimentary bottled water, big windows, big bathrooms, robes, flat screen TV etc etc. Check out their web site for pictures, the hotel is on the Historic Register and they did an excellent job w/ the renovation and decoration. We didn't have time to try the restaurant or room service but the menu looked nice and the prices seemed good too. The location is right downtown and across the street from a little botanical garden if you need to get out and take a walk. No more chain hotels in OKC for us now that I've found this place!We stayed here while in town for a rock show.  The Colcord looked like the best place to stay that was near the ford center so that is what we chose.  Overall it was a good choice.  The room was upscale and modern. Staff was nice and the room was very comfortable. Only slight down side was the wifi sucked (since i was here for pleasure and not business it was not that bad since we rarely used it).  Other issue was the construction going on next door.  The hotel cant really help that so i did not really factor it in on my rating. I would stay here again for fun.This review is of two rooms: a 5th floor ""corner king"" and a 4th floor suite.I stayed here with my two cats while our house was being deep cleaned. In accordance with downtown laws, there are specific rooms designated for pets; none of them are higher than the 5th floor. The view, however, from the 5th floor is still very nice! Ask to be on the botanical garden side--its view is like a mini central park--tall, lush green trees amongst concrete. The corner king had the best views and light--LOTS OF LIGHT!The rooms are decorated very nicely. If you like contemporary decor, you'll feel at home at the Colcord. It has beautiful appointments typical of nicer modern homes. The mattress and bedding were nice, too. The bathrooms are large and lovely. The corner king had a garden tub/shower combo and the suite had a jetted garden tub and separate glass shower that had great tile. The shower head wasn't so great, but it was powerful. The towels were of typical hotel quality, but in the suite you do get bath sheets.The toiletries were low quality. The robes looked quite cheap with thin royal blue velour shells and terry lining. The terry was pilled. It looked like someone's ratty old robe--not something you want to step into after a bath.There was some dust on the TV (they are approximately 32"" flat panel in the corner king, and a 32"" &amp; 42"" in the suite). There was a reeses peanut butter cup under the sofa--which luckily I found before my cats. Windows were very dirty. The remote for the TV in the corner king didn't work. The remote for the TV in the suite worked, but only at very short range.The corner king was $200/night and the suite was $300/night on a non-event weekend (Friday &amp; Saturday). It was a little pricey, but is it worth it overall? Yes &amp; no. If it's more important that things be aesthetically-pleasing--then yes. If it's more important that things be practical--then no. It is undeniably gorgeous (I want their designer), but you don't really get much for what you pay. There isn't much luxury in the the ""luxury boutique"" except visually.If you're staying with a cat who likes to hide under the bed, get the suite. You can put him in the living area and he won't have anything to hide under that you can't easily move to get him. We had to have the manager come and lift the enormous king bed (we could have lifted it but didn't want to be liable for damage) to get our cat because he crawled up IN the base! I feel this was an oversight on their part because it was a pet room, but I don't want to nitpick. I would stay in the suite (with cats) and in the corner king (without cats) again. If you care about the tub, make sure you ask which is in the room because not all of them are the same.Best in okc. Trust the great reviews... This place is truly a gem. Impeccable service, luxurious accommodations, and overall wonderful hotel.  Free shuttle to/from Bricktown?!  Just another reason why this is the hotel of choice for a great downtown OKC adventure!The staff at the Colcord Hotel are so friendly and helpful.  This is the best staff at any hotel I have been at this year.  The complimentary coffee delivery each morning is lovely!We stayed at the Colcord Hotel last year as a treat and what a treat it was! We loved it and it was definately the nicest hotel we've stayed in. The sheets and towels were so luxurious and the bathroom was huge. The decor was simple, but beautiful. It's centrally located downtown and close to Bricktown. We are going again this year in May. We would highly recommend this hotel.I'm actually writing this review while staying at the hotel on business. I usually stay at the Hilton Garden Inn but have decided to upgrade my stay while staying in OKC. The Hotel Colcord is a very nice hotel and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the rooms. When I showed up at the hotel I asked for an upgraded room and they did so without any hesitation or increase in price. I received a deluxe king corner suite. This room is huge ( 646 sq ft.) and has a couch and chair. The accommodations are contemporary and tasteful. The AC works awesome! The bathroom is very stylish and includes a standup shower with Kohler fixtures. The only drawback is the fitness center doesn't have weights over 25 pounds and doesn't have a great selection of workout equipment. Also, this hotel does not have a pool. Other than that, it's a great hotel and I will continue to stay here when I come to OKC.",,,"['amazing', 'hotel', 'service', 'best', 'location', 'ever', 'couple', 'blocks', 'stadium', 'met',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/biltmore-hotel-oklahoma-city,Biltmore Hotel,1.5,$$,57,"If you're looking for a solid, economical stay with friendly, smiling faces greeting you as you check in; then head to the Biltmore in Oklahoma City.  I knew I made the right decision as soon as I got out of the car.  That's because when I did get out of the car; there were two ladies who worked there, and they were singing ""This little light of mine..I'm gonna let it shine"" as they watched the incoming thunderstorm that evening.  Their smiling faces and friendly manner was the perfect way to end my 8-hour drive from Albuquerque.   When you walk into their lobby, you get the feel of 1950's Oklahoma.  It's a huge lobby with a rock wall, and fireplace (which wasn't lit, but they told me it is during winter).  The ladies walked me in and were fun to talk to as they handled my reservation flawlessly.  The only ""hit"" I'll give this hotel concerns a funny, (but not overpowering) smell that was in my room.  It wasn't enough of a smell to make me change rooms; and I quickly acclimated to the scent.  It really wasn't that big of a deal.  The king size bed was extremely comfortable; and I honestly didn't want to get up from it after I plopped myself down on it right after I dropped my bags on the floor.  The room was decorated with kind of outdated, but not tacky 1970's decor.  I ran that A/C like a horse, and it kept the room frosty cold, as I like it whenever I stay in hotels during the summer.  The bathroom was clean, and the hot water plentiful as I washed off the dust from the 8-hour drive that had just ended.I met a good friend at the hotel, and we hung in one of the two bars in the hotel.  The Bombay Room was full of (smoking) patrons who were laughing and talking with the young lady tending bar.  At $4 a beer, it was a cool place to hang out during the rainy evening.  There's an indoor pool right next to the Bombay Room, as well as at least one outdoor pool.  Since it was raining, I didn't make use of either, but I did notice that both were kept up well.  Supposedly, there's a country/western bar in the place as well; but few things interest me less than hearing ol' Toothless Jim singing about his damned dog and truck for hours on end; so I passed on hanging there.I had a great experience there, and I only spent about $60 after fees and taxes and all that crap.  Along with the great service was the convenience of the location.  It's right off the I-40 with easy ""on/off"" access.  If you're on a budget, and need to stop in Oklahoma City, then you really can't do much better than the Biltmore. If I'm ever in this town again on a budget; then I'll make sure to book a room right here.I wish i could give them no stars. This is what we dealt with... The ceiling caved in. On the bathroomWorst hotel I have ever stayed at! I had to get 4 different sets of keys and had to have maintenance come fix the lock. Not only did it take maintenance 45mins to get to my room to fix it... They just walked right in without knocking. I pulled the blankets back and there were stains on the sheets... A LOT of stains. Rooms are very outdated. I had a room booked for 3 days and I ended up canceling before the 1st night was over. I refused to shower there because I was so grossed out by the place.The worst hotel I have ever stayed at in my humble life.  The feel of the hotel is great, maybe someone had a lot of funding money in the 1980s, it is cowboy and horse themed. And everything they have as decoration appears to be the same things they had in the 80s.  That being said, I would not avoid a hotel because of dusty horse statues.  BUT, I will avoid this hotel at all cost after my last experience.  I went into my room and turned the lights on and there were about 15!! roaches that scattered, as we looked closer they were actually everywhere, but blended in with the carpets ect.  The contrast between their red shells and the off-white/yellow bathroom tile created an intense opportunity to correctly identify them.  I got the chills, afraid that I was stepping on them as I set my luggage on my 80's bed spread. I called the front desk, they apologized and offered no refund, only to move us to the ""best room"" they had.  We gathered all our luggage, left room 217 (home to many lifeforms) , and went to our new room '103'.  When I went inside I turned on the lights, half-expecting to see more things scatter.  I did not see any bugs but as it turned out, their best room was no different. In fact, it was missing a few amenities the previous room had had.  For example, the curtain did not even cover the window, which faced into a courtyard and pool, absolutely no privacy, the TV was now down graded into the really large ones we used to use in 90s, and the bed-spread had cigarette holes and stains everywhere, so much that I took it off and slept on a towel.  I had to leave for the airport at 4:45 am and at this time I gave up I was too tired.THEN to ice the cake, when I was checking out and waiting on the shuttle at about 4:30am, I requested an out-going mail need and the worker spoke english just enough to laugh and tell me ""WE DONT DO THAT HERE"". I asked, ""What do you mean, this is a hotel, of course you mail things.""  He REFUSED for five minutes, enough for the security/shuttle driver to come up and ask what was wrong, I explained it to him and he also said WE DONT DO THAT HERE.  I wanted to cry I was so flabbergasted that I paid over $50.00 for the most roach-infested, invasive room I have seen, minus TV shows like COPS, AND they refused to offer any services like out-going mail. NO EXPECTATIONS WERE MET EVEN THOUGH THEY ADVERTISE FULL SERVICE. I will be contacted the BBB over them. I hope all the other people and their concerns, whom the hotel seems to ignore, will also stand up for themselves and insist on retribution.BED BUGS!!!!!!We stayed at the Biltmore 1.5 nights. We only made it half way through the second night because my wife found bed bugs in the bathroom and under the bed. I immediately brought the bed bug to the front desk and received a refund for our entire stay. Before speaking with the front desk employees I had to wait in a line for about 20 minutes while other guests lobbied their complaints about issues unrelated to bed bugs.We were staying with our 1 year old, which meant waking him up in the middle of the night so we could travel to another hotel.Aside from the bed bugs the overall experience wasn't much better. Basically the hotel is trapped in the late 80's. It was probably once a nice place, but today's version is dirty and a bit unsavory. I guess the worst part of our experience was that the staff acted like this was just another day and the issue was nothing new to them.Fun place, TERRIBLE service. Been here multiple times, great atmosphere, rude staff. Seems to me that management is non-existent.By far the worst hotel and staff, just overall experience being here. I wouldn't suggest this place to a rotting corpse. So I made a reservation here for 4 nights. When I showed up it took at LEAST and hour to get me through. When I get to the room there isn't a fridge like advertised, when I called to the front desk to ask about it the woman beat around the bush. I asked her if there's any chance to to check on the eta. of the fridge to then she got a little defensive and laughed at me then assured me that she couldn't do that.No stars for this place. We had our family reunion here and the service was horrible. The employees were rude!! The AC did not work and it was 90 degrees outside. The food was disgusting as well. We have had several other reunions here but never again!!Very accommodating place. When I walked in the front desk was very helpful and pleasant. I got my room key no problems. I walk into the building I was to room in and the night security guard introduced himself and showed me to my room.  My key wasn't program correctly and the security guard was MORE THAN HELPFUL in getting it activated. My room was right next to the pool area (only complaint was the noise). Early day next day so sleep is a MUST.  I went back down to the front desk and asked if I could get another room. With no hesitation they made this request possible. No fuss no excuses he checked for an available room and WAAAA LAAA!  Less than three minutes. This place is great!  Very affordable and clean. Thank you guys for helping me get a great nights rest!I wish I could give this less stars. One of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. Only desirable if you want a nice evening of meth addicts and men harassing you. -Dried blood all over the bathroom-police there for several hours-issue with with toilet and displaced for several hours-offered new room finally at midnight-dirty room smelling of stale smoke We are two young women traveling and everything about this hotel was unsafe. If I had children I would have immediately left. This hotel should have some sort of security.  We ended leaving around midnight and had to find a new hotel. We felt bad for the two very friendly front desk clerks who were being screamed at by a unhappy guest every time we passed.Good value for the $49.99 per night that I am paying. I love the character of the hotel since it is ""retro"" itself, but the amenities in rooms are completely decent. Not luxurious, but I have lived in worse dorms.Some pros and cons to consider:- They make you sign an agreement saying you won't smoke in the rooms--the first non-smoking room they tried to put me in totally had chain smokers before me, but when I mentioned it they moved me though acted like it was difficult (there's plenty of vacancies they are advertising now so I don't see the issue!). Have seen many people with out-facing doors smoking in the doorway to their room... Depending on their knowledge of aerodynamics I suppose it's possible for the room to not stink later... But as a former smoker who doesn't want to be tempted the whole place sort of leaking the cigarette fumes of 40 years of abuse has bothered me.- Unlocked access doors from outside to the halls with rooms are all over the place. Convenient and discrete... but also alarming.- They allow pets, and the place isn't nice enough that I'll owe thousands for a pup's accident--big bonus. Be sure to discuss when you reserve or check in (as per their policy). They earned an extra star for the pet friendly status in my opinion. Also, excellent vets in the area so if something has happened it's a good base point to stay if you have an animal emergency or hospitalisation and you've driven in from far away.-Housekeeping very respectful of ""do not disturb"" signs so farRecommendations to bring:- Glade plug in Doo-hickey or whatever- That ozium odor spray that helps cigarette doors- Power strip with multiple outlets (all covertly hidden by furniture and one in my room didn't even have enough plugs for everything)- Possibly a door stop alarm but I bet it's ok not to,For the price of this hotel, I was very impressed.  When we arrived, we had to wait in line for about 20 minutes, there were a lot of guests checking in.  The woman who did our check in was very nice and helpful with explaining how to get to our room.The room was clean and fairly large.  The amenities were older, but everything worked.  I was particularly surprised by the age of the television, but it worked well.I noticed almost immediately that we didn't have a tv remote, and it was inconvenient that there was no refrigerator.  I called guest services to request a remote.  I was told that maintenance would come with one, but that never happened.  We waited for maintenance for 2 hours, but we had dinner reservations, so we left.  On our return, still no remote. I called again, and security came with a remote within 10 minutes.Checkout was fast, everyone was friendly.I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.prostitutes, dried blood sprayed on the wide of the mattress and box spring. a pool that is actually a dirt hole in the ground filled with discarded furniture.  old dog turds piled up by entrances. carpet missing in huge chunks in the hallways.  toilet not working, wifi not working, front desk not answering from hotel phone. initials scratched into the cabinet in the bathroom. and to top it off a racist receptionist who wouldnt let 2 mexican men stay there and then punished me by telling me i couldnt check in for 2 more hours (at 11pm). dont ever stay here EVERDo NOT stay here! The lobby reeks of smoke and my non smoking room wasn't much better! The hallway carpets are filthy with stains. The doors are hollow, noisy and beat up! Duct tape is used to hold the plumbing in place! The curtains don't close all the way! Need I go on? My flight was cx and this is where American Airlines put a few of us up for the night! Absolutely gross when there are so many other better hotels closer to the airport!Booked a two night stay and left after the first night. Should have known with the Hustlers Erotica store across the street that it may be a bit shady. The rooms are very outdated and old, don't let the website photos fool you. The hotel is a maze and hard to find things. After a 20 min. walk around we found an ice machine that worked; 3rd machine we tried. Beds are plywood hard. We could hear everything next door and would have rather not. We went to dinner and came back to find 3 police cars in the lot with lights on and walking through the hotel. Could not regulate the room temp. Was cold all night. This hotels allows pets so be ready to deal with barking dogs. The Chisholm Club charges $5 cover even if you are a guest and there was no band. The Bombay Club for casual cocktails was nothing but a drunkards bar.  This was an upgrade to begin with. I would not recommend this hotel AT ALL!!!!Biltmore for fans of Western attire, and smoke on top of smoke with a layer of smoke wrapped in smoke with just a hint of smokey smoke.Biltmore for individuals who prefer that their surroundings not include trivial things like air conditioning.Biltmore to serve as a scene straight out of Breaking Bad when Jesse decides to go to that shady motel to get with the meth addict prostitute who had the grody teeth. Just to be clear, there are no prostitutes at this location (that I am aware of). Biltmore for patrons with low standards.Biltmore for people who expect less.Actually, Biltless may be more accurate.I'll stop now.P. S. The employees are delightful. Very kind, helpful people.P. P. S. John P. states that this place ""ain't the Taj Mahal."" I'm not sure if you know this John P., but the Taj Mahal is a mausoleum built by an emperor in memory of his (third) dead wife. A mausoleum is where you put (surprise, surprise) dead people. It is therefore quite different from a hotel. Not exactly an apples to apples comparison, is it? Just thought I'd toss that out there. Unless he was referring to the Trump Taj Mahal, then my response would be, ""You're certainly right about that.""I'm sitting on my bed at the biltmore as I type this. I've pushed one cricket out the door already, three more are lingering in the bathroom and since they're quiet (are they dead?) I'm fine with leaving them be. Another, however, seems to be hiding somewhere in the drapes and I'm debating on whether I'm willing to go through the hassle of requesting a new room, as this one seems to be infested with the critters. Will I wake up tomorrow with one on my face, cozying up with me on my bed? Am I willing to find out? Hmmm...Outside of the noisy roommates, the room smells. It's just dirty. I'm not uppity or coddled when it comes to hotels by any means, either. I grew up on Motel 6 and Best Western's. I still remember how i felt the first time I stayed with in a room with an INTERIOR facing door... All fancy and whatnot. Should have stuck with my roots. Passed plenty of the motel 6's to get here. Think the light's are still on?The term ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind booked thru <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> got a 5 day stay for $183. Not the best in the world. No flat screens people constantly lingering the place and worn outdated furniture. However the room was clean and neat. As for the staff  this was why I left a 2 star rating. They seem like they are just waiting for their shift to be finished and customer service is the last thing on their mind. on check in I prepaid for the room and then they lost my booking email showing proof of payment ( I pulled up my copy of the receipt on my iPhone but they would not accept it and tried to make me pay twice). After a 45 minute call with <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbooking.com&amp;s=c178a46bcdd8acf675af1d0cc8c8d35ab72dc1a82c627540cafb59919d30f279"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">booking.com</a> they allowed me to check in. The free Breakfast buffet was excellent eggs bacon or sausage every morning this was a real pleasant surprise! If your looking for a cheap place to stay and don't care about the frills then the Biltmore is the place for you.I would rate no stars, but unable to. First off, do not stay here. It's a dump. The heater did not work in my room and the fridge was broke, so when I woke up in the morning I discovered my food was spoiled. I didn't check in until 11 p.m. I went straight to sleep. When I talked to management in the morning about how freezing it was and the fridge situation she just brushed it off and said you should have let us know. Oh, how was I supposed to do that when I went straight to sleep? Anyways, there are plenty of other motels in the area, so take my advice and do it moving. On top of that, it took them an hour after I reserved the room on priceline to check me in. And there wasn't any wash clothes to shower with, so I had to use my hand...yuck lol! 02/13/2015This is one of the most disgusting hotels I've ever stayed at. There's food or something splattered on the walls and furniture, cigarette burns on the furniture in a non-smoking room. The bathroom door doesn't shut and looks like it's has a lot of water damage and something splattered all over it. The door to the room doesn't latch properly. Has some of the rudest staff I've ever met.","I have always trusted the Biltmore name....until now.  Booked this dump from online pictures that were as usual pretty good and saw it didn't have as many stars but a bad Biltmore beats most other chains hands down.  This was by far the nastiest place I have ever tried to stay...room numbers ripped off doors....mold and mildew in drooping ceiling tiles in hallway...dirtiest cafe with the worst service...waitress actually came out holding food and chewing it to ask for our money before we even ate. No tv remote...no elevators...lamps looked dangerous to operate....and within 10 minutes of check in a man knocked on the door saying he left his knife on the bed...was it still there.  Honestly we thought we were on a comedy tv show it was so bad.  STAY AWAYSounds like the people who are complaining had one of the rooms where you have an entry that leads outside. We always request one of the rooms in the ""middle"" overlooking the indoor pool. Extremely spacious and comfortable. Friendly staff. Pet friendly. The pools are always clean. It is an older hotel that appears to have been an extremely nice place years ago. Affordable rates. Trucker friendly also.Check in is sssssssssllllllllooooooowwwwww. People are nice. They need a motivated building maintenance person who can do the little things like put plates over the outlets. I think people are being over critical.  Room is dated and so is the facility.  The thing is, you are getting what you pay for.  It is a fair room at a fair price.I'm writing this for the soul purpose to help prevent the spread of bed bugs to future customers.  This place is disgustingly dirty.  Since our one night stay have been battling bed bugs in our home. This 50$ hotel now has cost over 200$$$ in repercussions,  not to mention the depression that comes with no sleep and feeling dirty all the time. So disappointed a place like this is open for business.  I've already filed a complaint with the ok health department.I swear something ate me alive in that horribly stiff bed! Our group reserved three rooms with five people to a room, and they charged for each person, but they only gave us two breakfast tickets per room despite this! those of us who ate there had a buffet style with only scrambled eggs, burnt sausage and brick biscuits. they also charged us a surprise 75 dollar deposit per room and said nothing about this! we had to find out about this from our bank that told us of our overdraft! if you even touched the thermostat,  you would be rewarded with an ear piercing whisle from the vent, and each room only had two towels, and housekeeping refused to bring more, despite reserving FIVE TO A ROOM! no stars!Their advertising is all the exact opposite from what they really DO NOT offer.Their photos in their website do match what is really here. #1: Pillow-top mattress tops, NOT TRUE. #2:Air-conditioning, COOL AIRFLOW IS NOT air-condtioning! #3:If you desperately need a refrigerator, THERE ARE NONE! We were forced to keep filling the tub up with ice. This sucked!!  #4:Room came w/o one HANGAR. #5:Not enough electrical outlets. #6:dusty old carpeting in the halls and odd smells walking down several hallways. #7: We just found out that our door lock doesn't work, YIKES! This sappy out-dated hotel is not worth your hard earned money. SAVE YOUR $$$. This hotel wouldn't get even one star-rating. We know in the future which hotel we will pass on. Most hotels offer free wifi, we will definitely go there.Filthy,   bad service,  no A/C, drug needles found in rooms,  hastle for a refund.  Would not recommend to anyone.Do not stay here. We were passing through and needed a place to sleep for the night so we came here. We got a rate for a room with 2 queen beds for $59.99. The guy at the front desk had me sign stating that I was paying $59.99 only to find out in the morning that they were going to charge an extra $10 and say it was ""taxes"". Why not just include the tax into the rate of the room at the time of payment so we know what we are being charged for? It doesn't make sense to me. Avoid this establishment!Where to begin? We just got home from two nights stay in the Biltmore Hotel in OKC. I was pretty horrified - first, when I called to make our reservations. Their system was down, she asked me to call back. I called back the next day and asked for the $49.99 rate as seen on a billboard, she said, ""We are talking those down."" Well, they are not down yet, so she did honor it after asking if I was out of state. No, I am not. ""Well, she said, they are for out of state people."" They do not say that. We got the $49.99 rate. we got there, waited in line a long time, took a long time to process, none of their office equipment was working .... printer, etc. They told us we would be in a certain room. We went to that room and tried to open the door, but it was locked a person (we were unsure if it were a  man or a woman) said it was their room. Back down we go to get another room. The room was very warm....too warm and not super clean. There was no hand towels, no clock, two irons and an ironing board.  ( I would have gladly traded an iron for a clock). The room had roaches and the BED WAS HORRIBLE! Neither of us slept much that first night, but the second night, we took the mattress off the hideabed and put it on our bed along with the cushions of the couch. We slept better, but ... can you imagine having to do that ?? The stairs were horribly dangerous with some rubber edges that were loose and dangling.You could see light around the doors AND one of our windows was open. We would have liked to have had the room coolers, but that was just weird! We turned down the heat, but it never cooled off. Did I mention roaches???? ugh.You get what you pay for. I thought this was like the Biltmore in Phoenix, I guess NOT!!  Not impressed, will not go back. I certainly would not like people to think that represents OKC. It was noise, too.The only thing good about this hotel was the price. $89.99 per night. Office staff was dressed sloppy, they didn't get up to even help you. My room was not cleaned on Saturday, which was no big deal, but I needed clean towels and they would not bring them to me. The next day during checkout I told the ""manager"" and she told me we don't send anyone into the halls at night because it's dangerous. What does that mean? Halls smell terrible and the carpet is stained in every hall I was in. Never again will I stay in this hotel. It's not worth saving $20 per night.I would like to start out by saying, all these reviewers are complaining just to complain. I mean who looks behind the headboard anyway? We came here with a group of girls for the night since backstreet boys were in concert. Our first room had to be switched because we found food in it and a few personal belongings. Annoying? No. Odd? Yes. Our second room was fine. Yes the halls have a odd smell and yes the carpets were a little filthy but hey... you get what you pay for. Overall? It was fine. The room was clean, maybe not sterile, but clean. I'd argue that paying top dollar may not even get you sterile. Staff was friendly, no one busted our chops about anything. We opted to skip out on the breakfast and explore okc for a restaurant known for good food. Still not complaining. We were happy to get a nice breakfast outside of the hotel. It's an old building so don't expect the ritz. By the way, it is people who are disgusting, not the hotel. We watched the staff clean the bedroom next to us and they were scrubbing the floors. Definitely come here if you are looking for a cheap hotel for the night and don't want to complain about EVERY LITTLE THING.  Can't go wrong for $50. I've been in worse and paid a hell of a lot more.This place was the epitome of complete filth and nightmares!  Its almost like something out of a cheap gang banging horror movie (is there such a thing?). I look behind the night stand and headboard and someone's used press on nails were behind the bed along with nasty used Kleenex?  I can only imagine the FOUL prostitute play that might have gone on in this room.  Although a non smoking room it wreaked of old cigarettes and must, carpets werent even attempted to be vacuumed (and their pet friendly.. could you imagine the amount and pee and poo in the padding?!) and there was mold coming out of the heat/cooling register.  Within 10 minutes in my room I witnessed at least 2 drug deals along with an ample amount of homeless people with their shopping carts eating out the dumpsters.  Picture perfect place for my 3 year old twins on our family vacation!!  SARCASM AND UTTER DISGUSt!!  Pictures on Expedia couldn't be more INACCURATE!!  Checked for bed bugs.. Although I didn't ""see"" any I did spot their excrement on the wall (maybe dried blood).  I know theyve had problems with them before as its all over the internet.  Mattresses were stained with love?  I just threw up in my mouth reliving this experience. Left within an hour and now being refused a refund through Expedia and the hotel.  Is this some kind of a sick joke?  This was definitely not a place I'd like my 3 year old twins being anywhere near EVER AGAIN!!  This place needs to be condemned!!  Time to go get checked for herpes, hepatitis, HIV, and grab a tetanus shot after being at this dump!One of the worst hotels ever. Only one person at the desk while a line of customers waiting to get helped. The room was $59 for 1 night but not worth it. Security was loud and was banging on doors at 2am next door asking the people next. The room smelled like cigaretts and the decor was very old. It looked like this hotel was 60 years old. Still had old 1980's bulky tvs in there. I didnt think these existed anymore. People walking outside the hallways were load at 2am. Wish I would of paid a few more dollars and stayed at a different hotel. I would never go back to this hotel ever again.The foulest, dirtiest shanty hotel I've ever been in. This isn't a cheap room with little thrills. It's a room that was maybe nice when Nixon was president but has fallen apart and never been repaired and hardly cleaned. Stained comforter, thread bare carpet. Our non smoking room that reeked of smoke. The check in guy who took 30 minutes to check us in. Awful all around. 50$??? Should have been 29.99$Been here twice. Pretty good hotel. Have had the experience others have. Staff is friendly, they offer free wifi. It doesn't take much to please me. Overall it's a pretty nice place.There are no words to express how bad this establishment is, from filthy dirty, stained carpet in the hallways, stained, nasty mattresses under 'mattress' protectors. Dirty, stained, nasty bathrooms in the rooms, 'interesting' smells throughout the entire hotel. Cop cars outside all night with drug dogs going crazy outside and inside the hotel. Not to mention that they take your driver's license to copy it front and back when you check in (WHY???)...........they did not return the driver's license, however, they knew they had it. No attempt to put a note under the door of our room, call us on our cell phone (they gathered more information on me than my hospital or bank has on me upon check in). They also didn't try to find our vehicle to get the driver's license back to us. They add an additional charge to your credit card, you HAVE to check out at the desk in the morning to get the 'charge' taken off your card. Nobody left a message in the system to have them return the card when we checked out. When we discovered the card was missing (While trying to get on our cruise ship) They knew they had it, even read my hubby's legal name off the card to my sister. We were told we had to drive back to the hotel to get it........WTH??? The day we were driving back from Galveston after the cruise, I called to make sure somebody would have the card to give to me. NOBODY knew where it was, they denied they had it in their possession. So after calls to my sister to find out which hotel staff she talked to (REALLY??? LIKE WE HAD A NAME)it took them 3 hours to locate the card............get this, it wasn't in a secure, locked safe.....LORD. We were told at check in there was a free breakfast in the morning. However, they told us later at night that we booked thru Expedia, so did not qualify for the breakfast I also could not get a receipt upon check in because I booked thru expedia. The next morning I asked where the coffee was located, the girl told me (at 6:30 am) on 2/23 that I could not have coffee because I booked thru expedia. WOW. DO NOT GO HERE, it's nasty. we decided the breakfast was probably not safe to eat if the kitchen was as dirty as the entire place. So we left and went to a restaurant. This is a poorly ran hotel, staff is rude and not helpful. I called to get a corporate number, or a manager. THe manager was never in, or had just left. A one point, she was 'on another line' but when I called back to talk to her 15 minutes later, she didn't come in until 3pm. They told me they have no corporate office, nobody manages them. I cannot find a number to get hold of a corporate staff person. Believe me, this is not the place for you to stay. We would have changed hotels, but we arrived later in the day and had 17 people in our party. So we suffered thru it.One of the worst places I have ever stayed in if it was not for only one night and so late would have gone elsewhere. Room was old and not too cleanThis ain't the Taj Mahal. And that's what's so great about it. The Biltmore has perfectly fine accommodations, but it's going to be authentic down-home. You're going to see lots of trucks, horse trailers, etc., from all the people who attend the many horse shows in OKC. If you're in search of a good place to stay that offers an incredible people-watching and culture-absorbing experience compared to your local Marriott, this is the place.We went to the Biltmore Hotel tonight with a Groupon for the Brandywine dining room. Pure authenticity. Cattlemen and horse women were there from fairgrounds events. Three guys from the oil fields trudged in, branded in red corporate coveralls. A waitress entertained us with her charm, but also had us feeling that the check might not have exactly added up right in or favor (it was fine). She also gleefully handed us an extra to-go container to fill up on the salad bar before we left. When I thought I had lost my keys, other diners interjected friendly jabs when I remembered that I left my coat. If you have visitors looking for real Oklahoma dining, I'd recommend Cattlemen's, of course, and the Biltmore -- especially when there's a horse or livestock show in town. The Biltmore may have a name that bespeaks a certain expectation of accommodations. That is a disconnect that they have to deal with. But if you're an unpretentious, curious or adventuresome traveler, this is a great hotel if you want to get a sense of Oklahoma as a unique place.Not horrible, but doubtful we'd stay again.  As others have mentioned, the hotel definitely looks like it was really nice and high-end once.  It hasn't been updated at all and, at least in our room, that seems to have included the beds.  One was virtually unusable because of the busted springs -- the foot slanted down like a ramp when you sat on it.  (We let the dog sleep on that one.)  There was some horse show or convention or some such going on so the hotel was crowded and the walls are paper-thin.  We heard everyone around us coming, going, having sex, etc.  The room was spacious and clean, which was nice, but the heat was totally wacky and we went from freezing cold to boiling hot and back all night long.  The shower was very high (a plus when travelling with a tall man, like I do) but the pressure was pretty poor.They DO allow pets for a $25 fee (NOT for free, contrary to another review), which was our main reason for staying there, along with close proximity to the freeway and a place to park our rental moving truck..  <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHotels.com&amp;s=73eb800fa176ae06f0dc2c7d95ef8c3b0c49996e1f5dc5ceba7d2bf89dbfeade"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotels.com</a> was unaware of the two-animal limit when I made the reservation (we had a dog, three cats and two birds) but the front desk agreed to look the other way and let us stay anyway.  (Which is good, since I'd already paid for the room.)  The girl said she was upgrading us and giving us a nicer room that overlooked the indoor pool.  I'm sure her intentions were good, but our windows were literally RIGHT above the pool and we woke far earlier than we intended to thanks to kids splashing around  in the water.   We also had a lot of stuff to carry in (luggage and pet stuff) and our room was upstairs and a little bit of a walk down the hall which was a little inconvenient.  Not her fault, I suppose, I should have requested a downstairs room.We stayed here because the cheaper hotels in the area were booked.  I understand why.  Wouldn't stay again if we could avoid it.We were told the room was a certain price, then found out they charged $25 more. We needed ice after a long day of travel. We went to get ice and ended up going to 3 different ice machines. The first was broken and rusty, the second one wasn't even there, and the third worked but we had to go to a separate building.Walking into the building we noticed a thick haze of smoke. We had to walk up the filthy, gum stained stairs to get to our room. We noticed that the room numbers on some of the doors were nearly falling off.Our room seemed ok at first until we got settled in. The beds didn't have bed skirts so the outdated blue box spring is visble.There was some strange red/orange crusty stain on the ceiling. Pasta sauce? Blood? Who knows...The nightstand door didn't shut. The nightstand itself had scuffs, and burn marks in it. The wall had holes from former fixtures and they didn't bother to fill them in.The floor lamp had drink or food crust on its' base.The fridge was nice and cold but the door had fingerprints and dirt. The desk lamp was connected to a power strip that was dangling mid-desk. The desk chair and lounge chair were scuffed and faded. It was like Grandma's furniture circa 1980.Don't even get me started on the bathroom. You may want to wear flip flops in the bathroom/shower as the grip on the bottom of the tub was a lovely shade of DIRT from past guest's feet.The carpet. Oh, that lovely forrest green carpet that probably hasn't been cleaned since this place opened... There was a white crusty substance on the floor next to the window. That was an area we avoided.The pluses: They are pet friendly and pets stay free, the AC is great, the microwave was spotless, and it was a place to stay the night.","Stayed here one night with my son.  Keys to the room wouldn't work. Noted 2 reports of guest property theft at front desk by the time I completed check-in.  Room smelled terribly and the odor has permeated both my clothes and luggage.  Bathroom dirty with stains on counter.  Housekeeping entered room next morning at 8am and, after I asked them to leave, lurked outside room until we left.  Gets 1 star for front desk courteousness in resolving key issue.  Cannot recommend this establishment to friends, family, or complete strangers.  My son summed it up best when he said, ""Hasta la vista, crappy hotel.""Horrible experience. While the room was decent you could tell it's age. The sheets were stained and the bed spread smelly. Our non smoking room had clearly been smoked in before. The walls and doors are very thin and you can hear EVERYTHING in the halls and in the breezeways and rooms around you. It was very loud and sleezy. The pools were gross as well as the hot tub. You definitely get what you pay for. Management refused to give us a refund when we said we were leaving. DO NOT STAY HERE.Older unclean feeling room.  Ceiling tiles in bathroom were the regular drop in kind allowing access to the attic, and letting any psycho axe murderer types to come into your room in the middle of the night while you are asleep.  Door didn't lock easily and still didn't inspire confidence once it did.  The also do not allow concealed weapons, and the general consensus is you may need one.  Also, the security guard from the adjoining night club had id's and credit cards from customers booking rooms right in front of me.  Didn't know what that was all about, could only guess and when I did it creeped me out.  I would probably spring for the extra $10-15 and gave peace of mind with name brand chain.This hotel is a relic of a bygone era, and not a good relic. If I were to guess, this hotel saw its peak in the late 1970s. The rooms have large glass windows which face the parking lot. The doors are thin and you can see light pouring in from around the frames. Needless to say, you have no privacy and no soundproofing. Cars in the parking lot may as well be driving through your room. We checked in late through the hotel's website, which required us to wait until registration received a fax from a third party. Our bathroom featured a no-slip bath mat with black mold on the back of it, no washcloths, and no exhaust fans. The staff is courteous and polite, which is the one positive factor about this hotel. Save yourself the headache and stay in a chain hotel.I AM THE MOST IRRATE CUSTOMER RIGHT NOW! DO NOT GIVE BUSINESS TO THIS PREJUDICE HOTEL!!!! I booked a travel package on <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FTravelocity.com&amp;s=3f4a97ba730c914770c377a180e6bcef85750046a0d397f67128ddbf822b5d49"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Travelocity.com</a> for my business colleague, and he stayed at the Biltmore for 6 nights. The trip was then needed to be extended, therefore I resorted to travelocity yet again to make this booking. I spoke to the ""Manager"" shortly after making this reservation and she advised me she found the reservation and everything would be taken care of rest assured. Today, a day after, my colleague calls to say he has been locked out of his room because they did not find the reservation. After having had spoken to the manager. So I call to confirm that I made this reservation, the lady was very INCOMPETENT and couldn't find his reservation. They are trying to make him pay double, after my card has been charged. I called back after the lady hung up on me, this time with traveocity on 3-way, she said I was the problem and hung up YET AGAIN! I have been dealing with this for the past 3 hours today!!! RIDICULOUS! NEVER STAY HERE. THEY ARE RACIST AND DON'T FOLLOW GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES! 2 THUMBS DOWN!This complaint is about the Biltmore Hotel, 401 S Meredian Ave, OKC, OK. Their phone number is 405-947-7681. I was at the hotel this past weekend along with a number of friends. We were there for a conference in another location. Some checked in 9/19/13 while most checked on 9/20/13. This was the worst hotel I have ever been in health and safety wise. Our rooms had roaches, ants and I overheard one woman waiting to complain about bedbugs in her room. One of the conference speakers had black mold on the ceiling tiles in his bathroom. When he complained maintenance brought in other tiles to replace the ones with black mold. My room had several dead roaches. We spoke to a few other guests during the stay who complained that they were shown 3-4 rooms before accepting the one they did stay in for the weekend. They stated that all of the rooms that they were shown were full of roaches. The room I was to stay in Sunday night was horrible. It was 414. When the guests checked in they discovered ants crawling on the night stand. They called the front desk and maintenance came in and sprayed chemicals behind the night stand. The same thing occurred on Friday night. Saturday night the ants were not as bad. Then they woke up Sunday morning. There were ants on the nightstand, crawling on the beds, in the bathroom and worse. One person went to take a shower and discovered ants all over the shower. Then the other went into the bathroom and observed ants crawling on the vanity, on her toothpaste tube and INSIDE the cap of the deodorant. Upon further checking ants were discovered in just about everything. The ants were in the suitcases and boxes. We were unable to obtain better quality rooms at this hotel so did not stay by choice. The promoter who was running the conference where the speakers were was paying for the rooms and she spent countless hours trying to get better rooms. The State Fair was the same weekend so she was unable to move everyone to a different hotel. Another speaker was in room 420 and had his prescription medicine stolen from the refrigerator. I was in a room, 422, with another speaker. When she arrived in the room the smell of stale cigarettes, mold and mildew was so bad she had to get something to try and clear the air. It wasn't safe to leave the doors open to try and air it out due suspicious activity in the area, including males walking the parking lot with baseball bats for protection. We had dead roaches in our room, but I have allergies and had respiratory trouble the entire time I was there and am still fighting it. Another speaker had a room that was dirty, smelled and didn't even have spreads on the bed. Another one had trouble with her room as well as did yet another speaker. The chlorine smell coming out of the room where the pools were located and banquet type tables was overpowering and made your eyes water. We were told the hotel has a new owner and he purchased the hotel two weeks ago. We had one manager, Morris, who assisted us upon checkout because we did leave early and Ms. Jones did received a full refund for the two extra days we were going to stay - the previous Thursday and the coming Monday. He was helpful eventually however, while several of us were speaking with him an unruly tall, thin, dark-skinned Middle Eastern or Egyptian type of male burst into the manager's office screaming and yelling and pointing his finger at us individually in a threatening manner. We weren't intimidated like your average person would have been. When he burst into the room screaming I believed him to be a threat as he lunged toward one of us. I believed he was going to grab him by the arm while poking his finger in his face while screaming at us and calling us names. I told him to back up and take his finger out of his face. He was screaming that he's a manager and we were to leave the hotel. We told him no because we had not checked out and one of us was still discussing the refund with Morris. Morris told him numerous times to leave and that everything was fine but he wouldn't listen. He stuck his finger in a lady's face as well while shouting for us to leave. Morris physically put him out of the office and shut the door. Then he was able to discuss and give one of us a refund for the two extra nights we had planned to stay. When that was settled on person and I were in the room discussing the health issues with Morris and we tried to show him photographs of a room, but Morris said he didn't want to see photographs of any rooms and that it wasn't necessary. He apologized for the quality of the rooms which was too late. The younger manager burst into the room a second time screaming at one of us to leave. He created a disturbance and lunged at one of the females while pointing his finger in her face. He was so close I don't know how he managed to not assault her by striking her on the nose with his hand. She politely asked for his name several times and he refused to give his name.I feel bad writing this review because the supervisor was so helpful in refunding my money when we left after only a couple of hours but I feel compelled to warn others. Especially those traveling with kids and/or pets. The minute we checked into our room I felt like I was getting bitten by something every few seconds. Then I find stains, smears on mattresses, walls, etc. The mattresses looked new but everything else looked about 30 years old and was falling apart. And they told me this was one of their renovated rooms. I can't even imagine what the old ones must look like. Don't let the website fool you like it did me!Was at this hotel for an event January 2011Check in was easy.  Have been at this hotel many times. Bathroom was remodeled since last visit (2009)-well doneNew bed and sheets.  Old model TV not in good shape(upgrades w/LCD not costly).Had dinner first night in Brandywine room-VERY good steak-salad bar was not as good as 7-11--weird---soft ice cream machine -broken.Breakfast buffet is very good.  Morning server Sandra is the best.Lunch buffets were all OKHad dinner again Brandywine room.  Very good chicken fried steak--again salad bar -@###$&amp;^%%-but ice cream machine fixed.computer room needs overhaul.Meeting rooms were comfortable &amp; well appointed.Jay at front desk very good.Not the best--comfortable--will be there againIf it was an option, I wouldn't even give this place a star. This place is a dump.. We checked in at 4am after traveling straight through from LAX. We checked in, and went to our room, after paying $120 for us, and our two dogs (not worth the price).The carpet was FILTHY. The room smelled musty, and you could clearly see spots where past animals had relieved themselves. After 30 minutes, and an attempt at a shower, my husband packed our stuff and demanded for a refund! The manager was not pleased. We left in a hurry, with a bite on my leg, and a rash under my arm. It's safe to say that we WILL never stay here EVER again. They either need to renovate, or have the place condemned. Yuck. PS: we're still waiting for our refund.You have GOT to be kidding.  How is this place even still in business? It's a complete dump. After about 5 hours at the airport waiting for United to get their act together, a bunch of us got sent to the Biltmore. Yeah, thanks United. My room smelled so strongly of cat urine, as did the room of a fellow United victim, we elected to hang out on the slightly less-fetid couches in the lobby until our shuttle came. The one  nice thing was that the guy at the desk brought us pillows. This place was otherwise gross, disgusting and smelly.Hotel is a throwback to better times, if you consider 1975 better. We'll see how breakfast fairs in a/m. Heard it is decent.  Update:  breakfast buffet was very good!   All in all it was an OK experience.  I believe the property has in the past been a Hilton and I think a Radisson, so it was quality at one time. Remember, you get what you pay for.I liked the place!  I was there for a conference and I thought it was the perfect spot for it.  I was a bit concerned by the negative reviews I saw before I went but found I was pleasantly surprised.It is a big place spread out on what I would guess 10 acres.  With 500+ rooms and the old 2 story layout meant conference people were not crammed together.  I was on the 2nd floor and I think my room was a little nicer.  Many, especially those with mobility problems, prefer to stay on the ground floor and park by their rooms so I think the upper rooms maybe used less.I had a king sized bed, coffee table, couch, desk, fridge, microwave, iron and board, hair dryer soaps, shampoos, TV and strong wireless internet.  The room and sheets were clean.  The food was good and there were many many eating places nearby.Negatives:  stupid door lock card often took several tries to get green light and open.  On a couple of days of my 6 day stay it was mid afternoon before my room was cleaned.  Front desk was not that knowledgeable on local restaurants and bus routes.It definitely seems like a place that was really really nice in the early 80s, and they havent done a thing to it since.  I felt like I went back in time.  But for the very cheap price this place was a great value.  Not very many people staying there during our visit, but room was clean, comfy and big with plenty of room to spread out, and we could walk out our back door to one of the pools.  Lots of different pools to use with a very warm indoor pool if you like that.  So if you dont really care about trendy decorations give it a try.stayed here twice, cheap, and not as bad as others, but everyone has they're own opinionsTerrible customer service.  The Super 8 next door has cheaper &amp; cleaner rooms and a staff that seems to care you exist.Overcrowded during stay. Walls are thin so your able to hear everyone walking and talking up and down the halls at all hours and when it's quiet in the halls you hear the cars or sirens going outside. Yeah this place is somewhat nice in it's old time feel. But this is a one time kind of stay! I do not recommend to an outsider to stay here unless you like lots of people/kids roaming around and noise which never seemed to end. Thought coming here to an indoor pool for kids would be awesome since it's been around 40 degrees outside, well that's not true either. Yes the pool was heated but due to overcrowding in such a small area and so many kids not obeying the rules of the pool with no one to help enforce them, my kids didn't enjoy their time at the indoor pool. The photos on their website make it seem way nicer than it really is. From now on I'll stay at the Hilton Garden's in Norman. Same price but so much nicer by far.Wow.  If your neck isn't red, you might want to get a sunburn before you come in here.  I love it, but it's too deep a dive for most dive bar fans.  The Biltmore is an old Hilton that is the official hotel of every horse show and rodeo held in the city, and it seems like there's one every week.  The cast of wild, seedy characters here will change your world view if you've never known a real cowboy.  Staying at the hotel gets you a coupon for a free drink here.  Their only food item, a shrimp cocktail, was actually remarkably fresh, one of the better ones I've had in the area.  No smoking, but it doesn't matter because so many thousands of cigarettes gave their lives in here over the years.  The hotel has three bars and two restaurants, I think.  They are all memorable, and the place used to be nice.  I would stay here if I needed a hotel in the city, it's so cheap and has so much free entertainment.",,,"['looking', 'solid', 'economical', 'friendly', 'smiling', 'faces', 'greeting', 'check', 'head',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/sheraton-oklahoma-city-downtown-hotel-oklahoma-city,Sheraton Oklahoma City Downtown Hotel,3.0,$$,58,"Is this the best hotel you've ever stayed in? No...unless you stay at places that leave the light on for you.Is this the best service in OKC? Yes. Oh, you think the Hiltons are better? Wrong. The Marriotts? Not even close.You see, I put in the comments that 'I sleep better with Nicholas Cage watching over me.' What did this hotel do? They had Nick Cage there with a halo keeping me safe at night. Kudos to you OKC Sheraton staff. Y'all rock harder than Van Halen.""Meh. I've experienced better.""I've spent several weeks here and none of them are what I'd qualify as positive experiences.The staff on the main floor is very helpful.On other floors, nobody will help you. If you call to ask for... let's say, toothpaste, you'll have to call again. It took 3 calls to get toothpaste. Two calls to get cutlery.One week I checked in and thought ""Oh, they must have given me the wrong room"" because there was somebody else's room service remnants on the floor in front of the door. I had to actually push the tray a few inches out of the way to get into the door. That was my room and that tray of dirty dishes stayed in front of my door for 20-30 hours. I'm not sure when it left because it happened while I was at my 2nd day of work.Another time I got this room with a janky door. Every morning I got to fight it and repeatedly test if it was actually closed, again when I'd leave for dinner/activities at night. That was lovely. They ""didn't have any other rooms"" although it wasn't listed as Sold Out when I checked 30mins after they told me that.If you stay on the 2nd floor, that's where the gym is. That sounds good if you're into working out, which I am, but it's not. Any time somebody wants to workout, you hear and feel it. Yes, the ground moves and you get that lovely treadmill belt-scraping sound. I string of obscenities would leave my mouth when somebody went in for an 11pm workout.They did remodel the bar area while I was there and it's much improved.The Renaissance across the street was my preferred hotel for this project.I was a recent guest at the Sheraton for a weekend away with a friend. I paid for the 2-nights up front through a 3rd-Party website. The stay itself was very nice and the hotel was very nice. The staff I met were very pleasant. My issue comes afterwards. My friend who showed up to the hotel before me gave her CC for incidentals. After we checked out the hotel actually charged her CC for the 2-night stay after I had already paid upfront for the room. I notified the hotel the day after check out, they apologized and assured me the money would be refunded asap. I thanked them for their quick response and had mentioned that the sooner the better since their mistake had over drafted my friends bank account. Fast Forward a week later and still no refund. I notified the hotel the next week to ask what happened. The manager I spoke with apologized and said he had forgotten to ""save"" it last week when he entered the refund. He then entered the refund again and I received a confirmation email. What I noticed was the amount refunded was for about $30 less than the amount taken out. I called back to question and the manager reminded me that I had ordered 2 drinks through room service and that was the difference in the refund.Now I agree that I did order 2 drinks that cost $30, but my argument here is that the Sheraton screwed up twice, once charging my friend for the 2-nights (which put her bank account into over draft and charged her $40) and then second forgetting to input the refund initially and having to have myself call back a week later to ask again about the missing money. My issue is that with the 2 accidental screw ups (things happen I understand), would it not be a very minor issue for the hotel to simply ""comp"" the $30 worth of drinks. Maybe as a ""We apologize"" type gesture? Especially since my friend now has to pay $40 for the over-draft penalty. When I brought this up to the manager I was responded with a scoff and a ""I'll refund the drinks"" reply. The money is back now but after being in the customer service industry for quite a few years now building custom homes in Dallas I feel that the little things is what make a good experience. Things happen and I was not upset about the initial over charge. My issue is the way it was handled by the Manager I spoke with, J.St.Claire after bringing my concerns to their attention not once, but multiple times. -Chad RestovichThis location meets my basic needs. It is clean, conveniently located, has comfortable beds and reasonable rates. Other notables - rooms are spacious - SPG members get a free bottle of water - the lobby is nice - it has a large business center - free USA Today papersMeh, I have experienced better - the rooms are in need of updates (doors are very aged and chipping) - the hallways show aging- when trying to get assistance with getting a taxi, Concierge seriously shoves Airport Shuttle down your throat. I walked up on the hard sell to another guest who refused and when I asked for assistance with getting a taxi, I received the same spill. She supposedly went to check and came back to say the Airport Shuttle would be the quickest option. I told her I would get an Uber instead. When I walked out there were several taxis. Guess the commission or incentives for Airport Shuttle are better. Eek!I have good and bad things to say. I'll start with the bad. We asked and was charged for a king size bed. When we arrived to the room realized that they gave us a room with double beds. They also put us in room 718 that happens to be directly next to the elevators. We could hear the elevators being used all night. I put the do not disturb sign on door and it was ignored. There was a tissue holder without a tissue box in it. Not really a big deal but it's weird. Good things. The room was about $150 a night. Not a bad price for location. Staff was very nice. Parking was $10 for 24 hours. That's pretty good price and convenient. There was Starbucks coffee in the room plus two free bottles of water. Doesn't sound like a big deal but if you have some drinks the night before it comes in handy. Last thing is the bar it's pretty awesome. The bartenders were really great.I'm a Hyatt girl but this place makes me want to reconsider my life choices. Pet friendly hotels are limited at times and I didn't realize I could stay somewhere as nice as this with my child of another species. Front desk staff was amazing and my girl Linka was a huge fan of their hospitality with the treats. Rooms were excellent in the cleanliness factor. THEIR BEDS, OH HEAVENS GIRL. These may have been better than my top choice in hotel accommodations. I always have a problem of pillows being too fluffy, then waking up only then to have a sore neck. These? Say no more, friend. The mattress itself feels like it's enveloping you. To be honest, I was hesitant at first because I felt like I was cheating but I left one happy guest. Easy walking access to Bricktown as well.Sometimes I see three stars for a hotel and think folks are either being a little harsh or too generous on average.  The Sheraton in OKC earns a solid three stars.  Was it the worst hotel I've stayed in?  No.  Was it the best?  By no means.The good - the staff was certainly friendly and pleasant.  The club option is mostly what you expect, and the food they provided in the club was decent.  The breakfast in the restaurant downstairs has an omelette chef, and that's always a plus in my book.The mediocre - This hotel is full of mediocre.  While the staff was pleasant, they knew very little about what was and was not going on in the hotel.  We happened to be staying there when Obama was in town and staying at the Sheraton.  I understood some of the confusion while the president was around and the secret service was keeping everyone intentionally confused.  After he left, they had no reason to not know things.  We mostly struggled with when and where food was available.  Because they were taking up the top two floors of the hotel, we were reassigned to a different room.  I struggled for a week to get my bill corrected.  Poor communication was the biggest barrier to wrapping it up.  The pool is outdoors on the third floor.  That was kind of cool, and also extremely hot.  It was a pretty small pool.The bad - I never like saying anything negative about the cleaning staff, but this place was not the cleanest.  I don't know if the hotel was so full that they had that much to clean or if the crew was that slack on what they were doing.There are a lot of hotels in this area.  The Sheraton may not be your best choice for being close to the convention center or Bricktown.Had a wonderful stay. Extremely clean, friendly staff, wonderful food and fabulous location. Never had a single problem. Would recommend this hotel to anyone!Staff is awesome. Upgraded our room and gave us free breakfast and evening snacks. I think the young man at the front desks name was Colin, very nice. The rooms were not quite as good as the rest of the hotel but made up for it everywhere else.Checking in here was such a pleasant surprise. This has to be one of the friendliest hotel staffs I've ever encountered. If you are staying in downtown OKC and want to be near Bricktown, this is a well run hotel and staff. We were traveling with our dog and they had a nice dog area with all the clean up accessories. The neighborhood is the best place in the city if you are traveling for fun and leisure. We haven't been to the OKC memorial yet, but it is only a few blocks away. Austin, who tends bar in the Aria Lounge inside the hotel, was so friendly. Outstanding service! Great at making menu recommendations. The bar manager, didn't catch his name, was very attentive as well. Looking forward to visiting again!Stayed here a few times and enjoyed it. The only downside is the distance to the bar district is about a 10 minute walk. And in OK heat that might as well be 4 miles in the summer. The bar downstairs is nice and they have good rates, but I recommend staying closer to Downtown.Just pay a little more and stay somewhere else.Upon arrival the valet told us we would have to use them to park our car overnight to the tune of $25. Why? Because their garage was being renovated so they had no self park. Alternate option? Walk in the dark to the Amtrack station and park there for $10. Not knowing where it was or how far the attendant said we should valet. Went to check in and the check in person said it is only a block (still it is dark and you don't have parking because of your own construction) but no help there we had to get our car out of valet and trek to the Amtrak (welcome to Oklahoma?).Get to our room and I loved the shabby chic wooden front on the bathroom sink. Oh wait that wasn't meant to be like that (try a paint job folks, pretend you care) and then the awful bed with even worse pillows that were lumpy and gave me a terrible neck ache.I wake up to have a nice shower and that wasn't going to happen either as I turn to face the piercing shower head water I find pink bacteria/mold in the shower head. Let's not forget the peeling laminate on the tables in the bar....just say no.The location is perfect for any Bricktown happenings!  It's clean.  The lobby looks great if you are without kids: dining, drinking, computer access.It's an 80s updated hotel.  They can't help it.  There is only so much you can do for a hotel like this.  It's not a place to bring the kids.  2 double beds and no King suite available.  Good for them though for being 90% occupied and nowhere to move us.  If you grew up by an airport &amp; are missing home, this room is for you! Otherwise, DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO PUT YOU BY THE ELEVATOR. It sounds like jets are flying over all night.Youngest child decided the floor was a better choice than having to share a double bed with the sibling.- Housekeepers still cleaning rooms at 10:45pm and making a bunch of noise in the hallway outside my room.- Stayed here twice now (travel on business) and 2/3 showers had issues- Bathrooms are tinyProbably switching to the Skirvin Hilton for next week. (Update 5/10: Skirvin has banquet space on the top floor and parties with live bands are allowed to run well into the 11pm hour on week nights which is a total deal breaker for 12th floor guests, major fail for a business hotel. and 100% of my bed sheets had at least one hole in them.)Update 5/10: I took my business to the Ambassador Hotel (Marriott Autograph collection) and never looked back.  They are the best, almost like a throw back to good, caring hospitality. Ask for Karina at the desk and she will take care of you.The hospitality at this Sheraton exemplifies why I love the Starwood brand hotels. If SPG chose one hotel as a model to train all others on customer service, this would be IT. Upon arriving, the front desk staff noticed I had a rough day of travel and did all they could to make me feel at ease once I arrived. (Thank you Colin!!). Concierge staff was fantastic with advice on places to check out and restaurant picks. Hospitality staff was patient and helped us with our air conditioning and loaned us a wine cork so we could enjoy our bottle of wine. Thank you Sheraton staff, you are the reason why I'm a SPG fan for life!Lovely hotel but placed in an adjoining room with a paper thin door between us. The people in the next room started watching tv at 5am which we could clearly hear. It was at 5:30am when they started playing guitar and singing to warm up for the Voice auditions being held that day that I really got annoyed. The person on the desk just said sorryLove this place. It's in the perfect spot downtown. They don't try to rake you over the coals for parking either like some hotels we've stayed at. My only suggestion is a small fridge or larger ice bucket to keep drinks coldCame to see the ShineDown concert and stayed here. The staff are very professional and Kelly in the bar was great. The hotel needs some work. There was some loud noise just wailing from the plumbing or something. The front desk didn't know what it was. The curtains didn't even come close to blocking out the sun. The last thing you want the morning after a show is a big blast of sunlight. The dinning options are limited and they don't have anything that shows you what is around the hotel. Probably try a different one next time.For the money I'm paying to spend a few days here, I have to say overall I'm disappointed. First and foremost, there's no free wifi! $10 a day or $13 for ""premium"" access. Nearly every hotel in the country has free wifi, even the cheapest, yet this one does not. Also get ready to pay for parking. $10 a day self-park with only two free in and out passes, or you can pay $25 a day for valet with unlimited daily access. You don't know how frustrating it is to drive by miles and miles of open fields on the way to OKC only to pay for parking here. Le sigh. Okay, now the positive. The staff I met was friendly. The lobby is nice. The rooms are clean. The beds are comfy. Although the bathroom is tiny! Anyway, unless you HAVE to stay in downtown OKC, just find a nice Holiday Inn Express on the edge of town somewhere and drive in.DON'T USE THE VALET SERVICE!I was only here for a conference, so I don't have a full review of the hotel. The conference facilities were fine. The food was pretty good and the wait staff service was good. The room was very very cold, we asked twice for them to adjust the temp with no success. Bring a jacket, regardless of the time of year. The room would shake and rattle about every 4-5 minutes. I'm not sure what caused this, someone speculated it was due to the nearby construction. It wasn't a huge deal but it was a bit weird, almost like mini earthquakes. My biggest complaint is the valet service. You will have to wait 20-30 minutes for your car, regardless of time of day. I am not the only one that experienced this. There were 4 other people waiting and complaining as well. They have a text-to-retrieve feature that sounds cool, but doesn't speed up the process at all.  I strongly recommend not using them, it will cost you $15 plus tip and cost you lots of time and frustration.","Booked through hotwire for $105 for a Saturday night. The location was great . The lobby was very fancy, made someone who usually stays at the holiday inn feel a little out of place. Unfortunately, the room did not match the lobby. It was decorated very nicely and was very spacious. The white comforter had a couple dark stains on the top. The bathroom was tiny! To close the door you had to wedge yourself between the toilet and the sink. It was also very outdated. I loved being downtown and having the view. I also enjoyed the hotel bar. It was a little pricey but that is to be expected with hotel bars. They served a full menu 11am-midnight and had a small menu until 2am. We had a few appetizers and dessert there and everything was delicious!What is with all the negativity?  The people at Sheraton in town Sacra California right!  More people liking write negative!  They can tell my comments, as I one of only few writes positive, whether it be a hotel, a furniture store, a restaurant, a grocery store, so forth!Anyway, in 2004, was a Westin Hotel!  Year 2005 was switching over from Westin to Sheraton!  In fact, when I made the reservation for 2005, of course since I always send CASHIER CHECK from my bank, I had big overpayment since when was Westin was one price, when changed to Sheraton was different price!Being a Starwood Preferred Guest member, I know is either Handicap Room or Club Level access!  Cannot have both!  So when stayed 2007, ask for Handicap Room knowing for safety reasons, can buy my own meals!  Yet when checked in, maybe because I showed my Starwood Preferred Guest card, I got the Club Level access!  I think was also a handicap room, the silver support grab bars in the shower, by the toilet, by the bed!  They did provide a sit down shower chair!  Was room 1509, so fifteenth floor!  Only complaint and every hostess and every host at Club Level, year 2007, no hot foods at Club Level for hors doeuvres!  I use Club Level to my advantage, breakfasts and the hors doeuvres for suppers!  The Sheraton in Sacra knows this!  Every hostess and every host at Club Level in Sheraton OKC tell the guest when they fill out comment cards to ""BACK ME UP ON THIS,"" complain of no hot food!  I could not since I had not paid the extra to have Club Level!  Other that fact, this an excellent hotel!  As say, anytime I been to fun Child Friendly OKC, I always stay here!The parking stinks in this part of okc. Prepare to pay $25 for valet. I booked on hot wire for $85 on a Sat night which wasn't bad for bricktown. The rooms were decent. Bed was comfortable.  Outside our door was a room service breakfast tray that was there from 3pm to 10pm. We could hear the elevators roaring up and down all day, night, and morning.  That might bother some. Didn't bother me to much. There is no free Internet here. The lobby and business area was modern and sleek.  The rooms were sort of sleek. They were dated yet updated meaning they had the nice bed and new furniture, cool wallpaper etc, but ceilings are short with popcorn on them. That's to be expected for an older hotel. The view was awesome of bricktown.  We were on the 13th floor. This hotel is good but not great. It is close to the action.Horrible experience. Staff was unhelpful and the room quality poor. Asked if there was an alternative to the valet parking, was told their were no nearby (covered) self parking areas while the employee took a personal cell phone call... There's a public garage attached by a (locked) skywalk across the street... As for the room, the wallpaper was peeling, the shower's water never got hot, and the elevators reeked of vomit. Gross. Checked out a day early; just couldn't stand it. Definitely not returning or recommending.Not bad, but not great either. The room was clean and the parking garage was not available. We parked right across the street for half the price. The breakfast in the morning was good with several options. Fresh omelets!Not expecting the Ritz, but expecting something better from a Sheraton branch. Stayed here over the weekend for a conference, the conference rooms ranged from humid and hot, to the arctic tundra. Bring your jackets just in case!The staff acted uppity; I may look young, but it doesn't mean I don't deserve some semblance of respect. Check in was an awful moment, because the staff kept skipping over me for other patrons. My friend's sheets had stains on it. The vent was dusty and black in our room. The view was nice though, we were facing the Devon tower and on the the upper floors. The redeeming quality could be the close proximity to Bricktown, but even then.INCREDIBLE STAFFThey were amazing. Brian and Kia with banquets were amazing. 5 stars to themMinus 1 star for the worst parking options:(I ordered the chicken walnut strawberry salad with balsamic vinaigrette. It was awesome with a couple of glasses of Chardonnay . Service was top notch thanks to Tiffany and Austin behind the bar.Dingy, dirty hotel that desperately needs a face lift.  Beds were comfortable but carpets were gross and there were stains on the ceiling, etc.  I had a short stay there but I believe it's location is pretty good with some good pubs and restaurants close by.  Since my stay was so short I didn't get out and just had a few adult beverages at the bar and their chicken club sandwich, which actually was pretty good.Clean rooms with new amenities. Carpet is relatively new without odor and the air filtration system is clean and fresh. The concierge and staff was warm and advisable on places to dine within the local area. Starbucks coffee in the room as well as a proper store adjacent to the hotel. Reasonable and clean place overall.I just opened a Yelp account because of this hotel. I paid more than $150 a night and all I got was noise. I was there 3 nights and didn't sleep at all the first 2. First there was a nearby service door by my room and we hear every single move outside. Then there was construction work noise starting at 6:00 am. Yes, somebody drilling right above my room woke us up at 6:00 am. After calling the front desk and explained the situation they were very nice and moved us to another room (that still had some noise but at that point it didn't really mattered any more). As of March 2013 they were renovating and it was all bit messy.  If you are looking for a good night sleep I suggest you try something else.I stayed here for three nights. The lobby was clean mediocre. The staff was friendly the service was ok. However, there were Problems during my stay. The room smelled like chemicals and carpets was dirty and there were stains. One annoyance was the lack of a refrigerator which I found out I had to pay to rent. When I ask for refrigerator they told me they were out of it and told me to wait until one was returned. That was last time that I heard from them. I headed to the nearest Walmart and bought an icebox. Secondly, the hairdryer was in absolutely filthy condition. It was covered in a film of greasy fat. I was appalled and requested for a replacement. However, the replacement was ALSO covered in fat and rusty. I think it was even worse shape. I gave up and did not ask for more. Thirdly, the iron was stinky. It worked properly for about 10 minutes then it started to spew out brown liquid. It was disgusting. I was lucky that I wasn't ironing my white dress shirt at that time. Finally, during Friday and Saturday nights, the hall ways were filled with loud noises. You could hear everything from loud door closing, screaming drunk people running up and down, and flushing toilets all night. The building came alive during night time. It was absolutely incredible.Next time I will definitely stay at a different hotel. P.S. This hotel charges you for parking each day. I recommend to park on the street because the parking building is just a big nest for pigeons and smells gross. Also, the internet is not free. they will charge for each day.Full disclosure:  after cancelling my initial reservation, I was rebooked via Priceline, as this was a professional trip and I wasn't the one paying. Unbeknownst to me prior to my arrival, and I'm not entirely sure how this could have happened, nor was I ever given an explanation, but I've deduced that the hotel went ahead and cancelled both reservations, after seeing two in my name. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was probably an honest mistake, but it was how they initially handled the situation that left a bad taste in the mouth. Hooboy.To make matters worse, due to an emergency, I ended up missing my scheduled departure to Oklahoma City (Iong story). I didn't even pack. Activate contingency plan. I got in my car after literally throwing anything within sight into a weekend bag and sped for 7.5 hours half asleep, wearing clothes from the night before, arriving at the hotel only an hour behind schedule, impressive given my state of mind that day. Needless to say, I showed up in the hotel lobby looking like hell had spat me back out.  I just wanted to check-in immediately, shower, put on clean clothes, and pass out. No such luck.Front desk gave me an eye roll and attitude right off the bat when I showed them my Priceline reservation (great customer service, you guys!). I got even more eye rolls and attitude when they couldn't find me in the system (awesome!). I was then told that it was my responsibility to contact Priceline (at this point, fine, whatever). Got in touch with a Priceline rep in a foreign country, who called the hotel. Ended up getting told by the Priceline rep (not once, but on two separate occasions) that everything had been sorted out. Front desk told me otherwise (twice), and that they had no clue what Priceline was talking about, basically saying that Priceline was talking to someone who didn't work at the hotel and that I was SOL, despite me confirming with Priceline repeatedly that I had booked this OKC location and they were in contact with the correct hotel. Which resulted in me hanging out awkwardly in the lobby as I handed over my cell phone and forced both parties (plus an invisible manager in a back office somewhere??) to sort out the mess out for the next half hour, because I'm sorry, I did NOT just take an unexpected 500+ mile roadtrip to be treated like an unwanted guest, and to be given the run-around!In the end, because I was so frustrated, I explained to them I was in town for business, not pleasure, and expressed my disappointment with how the situation was handled so poorly. Their demeanor did change, and they did their best to make up for it with an upgrade to the Club Level and comped wifi/parking, which was appreciated given all the stress that weekend. They get a YOU TRIED! star (as opposed to one) for that. Amenities were meh. I think the hotel was supposedly recently redesigned, but the furniture, sheets, and walls are already showing a lot of wear and tear. The in-house line of Sheraton toiletries feel cheap and terrible, especially when other hotels are going upscale. They were in the process of remodeling the parking garage and there was a staircase from the basement that went to absolutely nowhere...don't get lost in there late at night. A warning sign would have been nice.By checkout, most of the frustration had receded and had been mollified, although I couldn't quite forget how I was initially treated by the front desk at check-in. Hence this review. Avoiding this place the next time I'm in town. This is not how you run a hotel.This place is not worth the money. Please let me explain.My husband and I were going to celebrate my birthday in Bricktown and wanted a reasonably priced hotel for the short night we would be in downtown OKC (we live in Norman). After looking at prices online and realizing the Bricktown hotels were pretty pricey, we opted for the nearby Sheraton. I'm not used to staying in incredibly fancy hotels or demand perfection, but this hotel is awful.First of all, I made our reservations online via Expedia. I booked a King size bed. Upon check-in we had a 30 minute wait and were told that only two Queen beds were available. Not a deal breaker, but not what I paid for. Secondly, the room was not clean. Everything from the carpet to the linens to the coffee cups were dirty. Wallpaper throughout the room was coming unpeeled (is that a word?) and the finishes and hardware felt cheap and were loose (door knob in bathroom, etc.). The room did have a great A/C, which was needed in mid-July, and a TV...but other than that, incredibly unimpressive. The bed wasn't necessarily uncomfortable - but wasn't the best, either. Our room was located directly across from the maid and/or maintenance storage room (it has double doors). Every single time someone entered or left that room, they slammed the door and it was LOUD. We heard all the commotion, including carts being wheeled in and out, loud conversations between the staff, etc. We tried to sleep in the following morning but our attempt was unsuccessful because of the noise and obvious disregard for the paying guests. Avoid this hotel. Trust me. Stay at the Colcord Hotel which is just across the street. That's what we should have done - it was only $20 more and would have been a much, much better choice.Know how we're always remarking about the need of the half star ?  This place is a good example of how our prejudices bump these places down, while others get the bump-up (see Cheevers review). This place shows signs of being updated.  You can only dress up one of ye olde 80s-style Sheratons so much though: Van Gogh had to work with a  palette too, right ?This is a perfectly clean, centrally located (Ford Center, Bricktown, business district), strong 2.5 star property.  I frequently stay with Starwood.  This was such a points reservation as events were in town and the nightly rate would have been ~$200.  First, that's way too much in OKC.  Second, there are nicer hotels (even Four Points off the Kilpatrick turnpike, North part of city, within the SPG system).  No bad news to report here; just underwhelming spaces.  Don't pay $200/ nt unless you absolutely need location; or unless you're dutifully staying on your company to keep earning the starpoints!This location is walking distance of downtown and the famous bricktown. Great location.The staff is poised and gives an air of a high end hotel. The concierge is helpful and friendly.The location of the computers for guest use is a bit awkward, right in the middle of the lobby, but it's free internet, so who's complaining?The rooms are nice. The bar is decent. All in all for OKC, good spot.So the good things about this hotel are REALLY good - like the customer service. I very recently made Starwood Gold Preferred and this was my first dalliance with premier perks such as a room upgrade, 4pm check-out and a free gift (extra Starwood points, a complimentary cocktail or free wi-fi). Because this particular property is upgrading all Gold members to the Platinum tier as a promotion during the month of May, I received the full monty - a sweet room plus complimentary access to the top shelf amenities on literally, the top floor (aka the Sheraton Club Level replete with a private lounge, free appetizers during happy hour, gratis drinks and a legit complimentary breakfast, too).Yes, I'll say it so you don't have to - I make a fantastic travel partner!The hotel itself is well-priced, clean, moderately large, simply appointed yet reasonably up-to-date (though I wouldn't say modern) and situated in a very accessible part of downtown, if it wasn't for all the crazy construction going on. But, not their fault and a solid mobile GPS app should get you there without a major meltdown. Also super: the bar rocks it 'til 1:30am and a limited room service menu runs through the 2am hour. Not too shabby!Now, for the not so good: Within minutes of entering my room around 4pm, I was stopped dead in my tracks as I organized my belongings. What the hell is that? Eeeks, the dude next door must be watching porn with the volume maxed out. Then the sounds intensified and I could only think they must be FILMING a porn complete with outrageously fake sound effects. Oh no no no, friends - the walls are just this thin and not equipped to deal with anything louder than mumblings of sweet nothings, I deduced, while fearing our shared wall would tragically tumble down. While I'm not advocating that vacationing couples should be denied the novelty of hotel room sex, the Sheraton needs to figure this situation out so it's pleasant for participating and non-participating parties alike. And judging by similar observations noted in preceding reviews, I don't have especially sensitive ears. Speaking of, I'm now back hours later and it sounds like the lady lover is coughing from inside my room. Nooo, not round two!Ear plugs: IN. Good night?This hotel was great for our business conference. They have multiple meeting rooms on the 2nd floor and a restaurant by the hotel lobby. However, the hotel leaves a bit to be desired. You have to pay for the internet in your room, unless you sign up for the hotel's reward program. Although the program is free, it's a bit of a hassle. There were several stains on the carpet in my room, which I found to be a little disconcerting and gross. The bathroom is tiny and a bit difficult to maneuver around in, even for one person. I stayed at the hotel for 4 days and every afternoon, when I returned to my room after housekeeping had been there, my room was set up differently. There were 2 towels one day, 3 the next; no soap on the first day, one the second and 3 the third (all new). I would not book this hotel for a personal stay as I'd rather stay at a Hampton or Hilton. But overall it wasn't the worst hotel experience I've had.My friend and I checked in at 1730 and one of our rooms was still not ready.  The A/C would only work on high and the room was still warm.  I called guest services and they sent a guy up but he did not fix the problem.  The bartenders are very friendly but have no clue how to make a drink.  Food from the restaurant is above average.  There are many better hotels in OKC in this price range.Hmmm...where to start. First off, I got a great rate for this place so I'm not in any way complaining about the price. I'm going to complain about a few other things. I'm not much of a complainer, but the circumstances of my stay here warrant some complaints. The room physically was fine, somewhat dated but very clean. The rest of the stay was pretty miserable. I want to give this place 2 1/2 but I can't really justify a 3-star,I was driving from Chicago to LA. My first leg was a 12 hour drive from CHI to OKC.After 12 boring hours of driving through the midwest I arrive at the Sheraton. The place is packed and it's a Wednesday night. But it's not packed with the usual hotel patrons, its packed with adolescent and pre-teen kids. Apparently there was a Texas church retreat at the convention center the next day, the hotel was a mad house.I checked in relatively easy but I did have to pay for parking (I think $7 or something).I asked the hotel clerk if I was staying on a floor with the convention people...he told me that I was on a separate floor because these kids were causing a ruckus. Long story short, the entire hotel was peppered with these convention kids and they were not being very quiet into the wee hours of the night. The walls were paper thin and when 15 kids were running up and down the halls of the floor at 1am (I had to wake up at 7am to start the next leg) a call to security had to be made. They calmed things down for a minute. Now I've stayed in many many hotels in my life, and this is the first time I've ever felt the need to call security. But it was clear the hotel held no regard for their guests by not putting the convention folks on specific floors. I'm not sure how I fell asleep, maybe it was the entire bottle of cabarnet I polished off that was paid in advance unbeknownst to me with a credit card over the phone as a surprise by a very very special woman back in Chicago. But it only took her 3 calls and my 2 calls to the concierge to track it down as she was very upset when she called me and asked if I was enjoying the wine. ""Wine? What wine!""Where's Jesus when you need him?","I don't have much reason to visit Oklahoma City.  Actually I've only been once, but this is where I stayed.  It's right by the arena and walking distance to a few restaurants.  Rooms are okay, lobby bar is okay.  Overall I'd say not bad.Not good. I have stayed here 3 times now on a weekend getaway because if you input 4-5 star in HOTWIRE (which rocks in my opinion) you will always get the Sheraton. The other hotels that are worth anything do not participate in Hotwire, just found that out. In any case the only good thing is you do get a great rate when using hotwire, enough about Hotwire. Not going to do that anymore. This place stinks. really, stinks like smelly stinky. Its old and needs total renovation. the staff is rude, rude. No amenities dirty rooms. Thin walls, bad food. Just really a waste. Go to the Skirvin, or Renaissance. If you dont just have to be downtown go to the Cambria. the Cambria is the best! There are also other places by the Airport that blow the Sheraton away. Dont waste your money here.This Sheraton was the home base for my festive night in OKC.  I got there after driving in from Dallas in my convertible...I was covered in sunscreen, wearing a hat over my sweaty hair, and just looking pretty hobo-ish.  Not a problem - the lady at the desk took my information and immediately got me into a room even though it was before check in time and didn't even give me the look up and down like I should probably be staying at a roadside motel!  Very nice.Room was nice but pretty basic.  Shower had the round rod so that you have more room to move around in there.  Beds were comfy.  TV was big.  Coffee maker with Starbucks coffee.  Oh and their hairdryer was greatness - full size, not one of those little baby ones.In the lobby they have a lounge area with a full bar and a restaurant plus a huge office center with a bunch of computers for your surfing and working pleasure.Best thing about this hotel is that it is conveniently located.  It is just a couple blocks walk to Bricktown for your drinking and eating needs and also a couple of blocks away from the OKC National Memorial.  Good home base for a fun time in OKC!Pros - Nicely appointed. Rooms are clean, reasonably sized with decent furnishings. Staff had great attitudes and over nice customer service. Room service menu has great variety and late night service. Restaurant and bar were good, too. Easy to access business center with free internet. Conveniently located. Oh, and the warm chocolate chip cookies and bottled water every afternoon weren't too bad either.Cons - Currently there is nearby road and construction work going on that makes it less than easy access and kind of a visual mess. But the BIGGEST PROBLEM is that all the walls are paper thin - could hear every single word of my neighbor's 3am conversation with the lover who was telling her that he was not leaving his wife for her...lots of sobbing and screaming, but I could hear even the low tense conversation leading up to that. After two nights of disruption, I had to request that the front desk address the problem, which they did.All in all, a nice place to stay.Lobby area is nice and modern. Staff was relatively efficient. The rooms however are dated and worn. The carpeting was dirty and matted. Nightstand was covered in some sort of dried liquid (icky!). Bathroom tub and floor were worn and shabby looking. Room was rather small and felt crowded by the two beds, desk, chairs, etc. The TV was a nice flat screen BUT it was only receiving a analog signal (terrible picture).  The TV remote was caked with filth. I used a alcohol wipe to clean it and it was gross after I wiped off the remote. Generally not the cleanest of rooms. I would have expected more from this property at this location.Room and AC system was deadly quiet! Slept like a baby. Free water for SPG guests and fast Internet. Breakfast staff was slower than the Dallas cowboys defensive line but this review is about the hotel, not the over priced, under serviced restaurant.I debated 2 or 3 stars for this hotel because the staff deserve some credit - they're very attentive and always helpful.Unfortunately, the rooms leave something to be desired. A lot of somethings.I've stayed here at least half a dozen times in the last 6 months.I'll start with some pros:- It's an SPG property and the only one in the downtown area. For a points lover like me, this is important.- The beds are decent (not great - kind of lumpy, actually)- The staff- The gym is large and has decent equipment with TVsNow the cons:- Bathrooms are WAY outdated. Not only that, but you can't move around in the bathroom without shutting the door. Also, the ceilings in most bathrooms that I've seen need major repairs.- There are crickets  EVERYWHERE. It's DISGUSTING. They're all over the gym even though I've repeatedly mentioned that the gym needs to be cleaned. Tonight I found 2 of them in my bathroom (and lucky me, one just went behind the bed). THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. I am on the 15th floor, please tell me how they got here??- Carpets are dingy and gross- Food in the lounge sucks - I keep finding expired yogurt in the mornings, which no one but me (staff wise) seems to find troublesoon (example - today I found a yogurt that expired on 8/16. It's the 28th. Wrong.)- BUGS!!!- There are no long mirrors in any of the rooms. I don't get it. Who wants / needs to look at just their top half? That's more an annoyance than anything, but it is annoying.- The TVs have horrible color and NBC doesn't come in well.- There's a scary ""ballroom"" area off of the lobby that I walk through to get across to another downtown hotel... it is dark, scary and I've heard people say that they've seen people sleeping in there.Need I go on?Unless you're an SPG die hard like me, I recommend NOT staying here. Trust me, if it weren't for the points... I could CERTAINLY do without the crickets. Bluch!Also, SPG, if you're listening, you may want to consider taking this hotel off of your list until it gets a face lift... it is gross.Very nice staff, and a modern, efficient lobby. The room was a little small, but not too much so. Very comfortable, but the chair is not placed so one can watch the telly. This always annoys me, as I don't want to lie in bed to watch. The bathroom was also a bit small, but the room was modern and clean. Let me tell what I really love about this hotel, and I'd really give them 4.5 stars based on this alone. I noticed while on the elevator, that they have a 13th floor! Now, of course, every building with more than 12 has a 13th, but they skip it and label it as 14; an old superstition that is well past it's time and quite silly. So thank you, Sheraton, for actually having a 13th floor! And note to the concierge: The Medicine Cabinet is in no way similar to an Eckard's Drugs. Please don't send me there again! Offer to take me on the van, and earn that last star!Parking garage is confusing and $10 a day is ridiculous. There is no free wi-fi in the rooms because they have a business center downstairs but that is just not convenient to me.  Who wants to get presentable to go downstairs just to use the internet ?  The TV is very confusing and has lots of options for everything except TV. It was too difficult to get the remote to simply find regular channels to watch. We were on the 6th floor and could hear everything above and below us in the mornings and at night. The bathroom was ridiculously small. You open the door and strike the knees of the person sitting on the toilet ! Even with the curved shower curtain rod, the shower felt cramped. The pluses were the convenient location to the Cox Center and walking distance to the Bricktown Entertainment District.This is pretty much a 3 star hotel. I think it was renovated fairly recently, so the rooms looked pretty nice, but there were a lot of small details missing that keep it from getting a higher rating. Such as. .  .The shower sucked. It took a long time to get the temp right (and by 'right' I mean, not boiling or freezing) and the pressure was terrible. But hey, I'm not expecting a waterfall shower head or a soaking tub. It got me clean, that's what matters. Plus one for the bliss shower products- I tried to swipe a few from the carts in the hall but the housekeepers were always looking.The TV was a nice looking flat screen, but the signal was. . . analog? Is that even possible? Isn't all TV supposed to be digital now? I'm not sure what it was, but the reception was terrible. I don't need HD ( I don't even have HD at home) but a non-fuzzy TV would have been nice.The bed was suuuuper comfy but the whatever kind of mattress pad it had kept bunching up, pulling the fitted sheet with it. Kind of annoying.I suppose the location is good- within walking distance of Bricktown and the Murrah memorial (which is really worth seeing), honestly there doesn't seem to be a lot going on in OKC. . . The nearby Skirvin is nicer but more expensive, and apparently haunted. So while the Sheraton may not be 5 star, at least I didn't get molested in the shower.This hotel is not worth the price. I went to the hotel for a business trip and although I did not have to pay out of pocket for the hotel, I still think it was a rip off for my company.My coworker and I missed our connection to Oklahoma City on Monday. We called the hotel and told them that instead of staying Monday and Tuesday night, we would be staying Tuesday and Wednesday night. The person we spoke to said it was no problem and that they would change the reservation to Tuesday and Wednesday. When we got there, the VERY rude manager told us whoever we spoke to was wrong and that they would charge us for all 3 nights. When we missed our flight, we were fully expecting to pay for all 3 nights but I HATE when I get different information from different people. Don't tell me one thing one day and another the next.The breakfast buffet for $15.99 was not worth it AT ALL. It had fresh fruit (which was not fresh at all), omelets station, waffle station, bacon, eggs, fresh toast, and some other items. But they think they can charge this high price because there is NOTHING around there besides other hotel restaurants. My hotel information book (which is in every room) said that they will provide robes and slippers if requested. When I asked them about this, they said that they never had this and I could go to the hotel next door because they have a huge gift shop. If you don't have something in your hotel, you need to update your information that you provide to your guest. They have a hotel pool but it was closed when I went there.... in the middle of May. Also - my hotel key didn't work after I came back from dinner. I went to the front desk, the lady redid the keycode (or whatever it is they do) on the key and it still didn't work when I went back upstairs. When I went back down, she told me to stop holding the key to my phone because it was desensitizing the magnet. 1st - If your keycards are THAT sensitive, you should say something to begin with. 2nd - After the 1st time it didn't work, someone should of gone with me to my room to try the key. 3rd - The key didn't work the 2nd time either after I kept it FAR away from my phone. My coworker and I had adjoining rooms and she just let me in because I didn't want to deal with the lazy chick at the front desk.There is also NOTHING around the hotel. It was a 10 minute walk to any good restaurants. There was also no entertainment around the place. The only place the bellboy could tell me about was a bowling alley and a movie theater. Really? I agree that the walls are paper thin. I could hear the people next door taking a shower and their tv.If I end up at Oklahoma City again, I would try another hotel.I had never been to Oklahoma and we came from California to attend Bedlam (for non football fans ~ Oklahoma vs Ok State).  I really enjoyed OKC ~ Bricktown, botanical gardens, several museums ~ and the hotel was nicely located for all the things we wanted to do including walking to dinner.  However, it was simply old and run down. The staff was fine and I didn't find it to be dirty, so we had a nice enough stay and it worked fine for us.  I would even stay there again in the right situation, however I was disappointed and there are several hotels right in the area, so I would try the others first.  I'm simply writing this review because I wanted more from the hotel and I'm sure many of you will too.It's a generally nice hotel. The walls are paper thin. You could here when the room next door flushed and turned on the shower. The worst was when we could hear the guests next door having sex.  Like I said it's nice, but not great. We won't be backThis place seems to be undergoing renovations. I didn't hear any noises in the hallway but that may be due to the fact that they weren't doing any sort of work on my floor.The lobby looks nice. It is decorated in warm tones and doesn't have glaring artificial lighting. The front desk staff was friendly and allowed me to check-in a few hours early. I ordered my room on Priceline yet they were still willing to try and accommodate my request for two double beds. I would have had to check-in later but I am grateful that the request on record and were willing to help me. The room itself is nice. It's spacious (perhaps I'm comparing it to an NY hotel but still), the furniture is your basic dark wood, with blue comforters and normal hotel colors. They have Bliss products which smell wonderful. The bed is super comfortable and I looked forward to sleeping in that thing every night.I ordered room service. The wings were meh but the sweet potato fries were a nice touch. They're not as crispy as regular fries but full of flavor. You are a short walk from an area called Bricktown where there are several bars, restaurants, and a movie theater. I didn't get to try the food here but from the looks of the people and the decor in various places it looks like it could be a fun area.Everyone I talked to at this hotel was super friendly and accommodating. They are truly what makes this a nice hotel. Now all they need to do is catch up on some minor repair work and finish the construction.The only downside was the shower curtain. it was obviously time to change or wash that thing. It's some sort of cloth material and they need to be washed frequently in order to prevent mildew.The A/C unit was louder than I'd like. I know they're not all whisper quiet but in comparison to the quiet in the hall and the city itself it can be distracting if you're a light sleeper.Mediocre!!! They want to look expensive with NOTHING substantial.I had to change room because you could hear the neighbors. The food at the restaurant was mediocre not to be mean, and you have to park your car at a public place next door for $10/day. Also, if you want the internet in your room, its nearly $10 too. LOL. Those corporate Americans hotels SHOULD BE BOYCOTTED, period.We got a block of 12 rooms for our 20 year class reunion on July 31st. We thought they would all be together but we were all on different floors.When we got there we didn't want to do the Valet Parking so we parked ourselves in the hotel parking that they told us to park. We were suppose to get a pass that we figured out later for our parking. We never got this so we paid out $7.00.When we got to our room the bathroom had a spray of some weird stuff on the wall and the bathroom smelled of urine. Tiny bathroom.My BF went to the ice-machine to get some ice and it was broken. It was so hot and I called to ask them to fix it and they never did. So we had one hot bottled water for the two of us. They put us by the elevator so we had to listen to the elevator going up and down all night like we were on top of a subway. Pops in the machine were two dollars. I just wasn't impressed. Marriott the next time for sure.I think we got the Hotwire rm: end of hall and 2 double beds and it said HTW on our key slip. $10/day for parking and no free wi-fi which was terribly disappointing. Breakfast at Aria Grill was okay- we chose the buffet which was best deal, $15/head incl coffee and juice. Large flat screen TV with bad picture quality. Beds nice and firm, not overly firm, with 10 pillows each. Location is okay. Would've rather stayed at Hampton Inn and Suites which is much closer to Bricktown restaurants/bars/canal. Also Hampton had great inside pool with fountain which was visible from street and Sheraton did not have an inside pool, only outside pool which was still covered on June 5  ?? Recommended only for business folks whose company is paying for rm service, parking, and rm.Not a bad spot ... Easy access to Bricktown.  You can get great deals on this place on priceline!",,,"['best', 'hotel', 'ever', 'unless', 'places', 'leave', 'light', 'best', 'service', 'yes', 'think', 'better', 'wrong', 'close', 'see', 'put',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-skirvin-hilton-oklahoma-city,The Skirvin Hilton,3.5,$$$,59,"We consider the Skirvin our ""home away from home"" and visit several times a year. The hotel is gorgeous and the service impeccable. Amy Nelms in the Red Piano Lounge is a true professional and makes our time there so much fun. The food is really good, too. There are just two little things I'd like to mention. First, it would be so nice if the rooms had mini refrigerators. Or at the very least, offered real cream in the room instead of Coffee Mate for our morning coffee/tea. Second, we were disappointed this past weekend to discover that they now have different pillows. These are hard and uncomfortable. I much preferred the ones they had before. Is it possible to request down pillows? Finally, I absolutely love the scent when you walk in the place and would love to know what it is. P.S. We really miss the limo service. Mike was a real treasure.First note: this review is based on a holiday event hosted at The Skirvin. We did not stay in a room. The good: The hotel is decorated to the nines at Christmas time. Just walking around the lobby and the second level was worth the trip downtown. It was magical for my entire group, and I may take another trip this holiday season just for some nice photos of the family.The bad: The event my group and I attended was Breakfast With Santa. I have attended fun events like this at Disney World and in Las Vegas, so it is likely my expectations were much too high. - The reservation for the event is over priced (more on that later). - The buffet breakfast food was ok, but definitely not something I would be eager to try again. - While the atmosphere of the hotel was amazing,  the ballroom itself left much to be desired. Considering it was a room full of children, it would have been nice for there to be some fun decorations for them to interact with. - The ""cast"" was a mix of pleasant and disappointing. The elves were the best, super friendly, sweet and entertaining. Everyone was nice, but it was obvious this wasn't a big gig to them (it wasn't on the same level as a Disney event). The organization seemed ok. Would have been nice for seating to have been assigned, especially for bigger parties, since there are limited seats per table. But things progressed timely. The ugly: - OK, maybe I am just a stickler, but gratuity traps really bother me. The price is $25 for adults and $16 for kids. However, when you arrive and prepay, they add in an additional gratuity! We ended up at 30 dollars a person, even with a few kids in our group! Why don't you just advertise it as 30 dollars a person and NOT add in these additional charges at time of payment. I just can't wrap my mind around the logic of that. I felt scammed, but I couldn't  say ""nevermind"" for fear of unwanted charges. So, will I go back to The Skirvin? Probably. Will my family attend this event again next year? Definitely not.I recently got married and decided to spend our wedding night at the Skirvin.  What sounded like a great idea at first was all down shortly after arriving.  Our group of about 30 arrived around 10pm to the Skirvin and visited the red piano lounge.  Asides our group there was a mere 2-4 other patrons so clearly we greatly contributing to the bars profit on what would of been a slow night.  We were easily contributing in excess of $1000 in just alcohol alone.After glancing at a menu which says food as served till midnight we were quickly told they are closing the kitchen down and would not do anymore orders for the 20 people(including my bride in her wedding dress) we were denied with not much worry and told we can speak to hotel management if we had a problem with it.  After making our rounds through various hotel staff members only to be dismissed to the next person and on to the next person. Several members of our party had to UBER elsewhere for food which is no easy task from the downtown area.  And then had to UBER back.  It became clear that the employees were more eager to get home vs. make more money for their company and accommodate the bride and the wedding party.  Copies of their menu clearly state food is served until midnight and can be found here:   <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.skirvinhilton.com%2Fpdf-skirvin-oklahoma%2Fmenu-red-piano-lounge.pdf&amp;s=a53de0f5576f4a0fef82797564dc4087a893ef68adbdd1cb263e2f7ce96d808d"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">skirvinhilton.com/pdf-sk...</a>After all this we gave up and went to our room feeling much like the maid that Bill Skirivin kept captive on the 10th floor who jumped out of the window since we had already paid for our room prior to arriving.  The icing on the cake was finding bugs in our bed the next morning.  I would avoid this hotel at all costs if it is a special occasion.Did you hear about the two bed bugs who met in the mattress? They got married in the spring.If Kyrie is spending his night there brawling bed bugs...than i'm not going back.Really cool hotel. Old school charm with modern touches. Lobby was breathtaking with red curtains, piano bar, chandeliers. Very clean. Room had a wonderful view and lots of windows. Comfortable bed. Overpriced. But our experience was great. And we loved our stay.My wife just wrote a review but I had to add my two cents, as well. We just had our daughter's wedding reception at the Skirvin and it was outstanding!Molly and the staff catered to our every need and delivered as we had hoped! All of the bride and grooms friends have already dubbed the event ""the best reception ever!"" Highly recommend the hotel and especially Molly!Have stayed at the Skirvin several times, but I hadn't stayed there for a few years until this week.  It's still a top notch hotel, and probably my favorite one in Oklahoma City.  On my most recent stay, I arrived pretty early, around 9:00 on a Friday.  I was able to check in and immediately go up to my room, so that was nice.  The employees at the front desk were very friendly.I'm reluctant to call a hotel owned by Hilton a ""boutique,"" but the Skirvin really is.  It's older, and I have been staying here when the elevators aren't working.  So, that can be annoying, but old buildings have character to them that I like.  The bed is comfortable, but the bathroom is on the smaller side.  The last room I had included a tub/shower combo that was average size.  There is free wireless internet.  There are a couple of chairs in the rooms which are comfortable but make the place feel more cramped than it is.  No minibar that I saw, but they give you a couple of Aquafinas.  Valet parking is $12 a day or $26 overnight.  The guys are pretty prompt and you can call down if you need your car and they'll have it waiting.  If you don't want to pay for parking, I frankly don't know a free place to park near the Skirvin.  It would be blocks away though, because all of the garages and lots near downtown charge.  So, I'd take advantage of the valet.There is a great bar downstairs, the Red Piano.  Additionally, the restaurant at the hotel is the Park Avenue Grill.  They've got a breakfast buffet and 24 hour room service, which is not the norm in Oklahoma.  I've only had breakfast at the restaurant, but it was good.  The lobby is comfortable and nicely appointed.  It's not trendy, but it also doesn't feel like you're in a 100 year old building (or however old the Skirvin is).Everyone I encountered was very friendly and frequently asking what they could do for me.  I'll absolutely stay here again.My husband and I stayed here for our wedding night. It was a gift to us and was prepaid, but as is customary, they asked for us to provide a card for incidentals upon check-in. The entire room was charged to us even though it had been paid for by our friends. We also asked that a refrigerator be sent to our room as this was done for other guests of the wedding staying at the Skirvin. We never received it. Our champagne wasn't chilled, which was also to be part of the ""romance package."" For one of the most expensive hotels in Oklahoma City, it was pretty terrible customer service. My mom stayed at the Colcord that evening. I would recommend that over the Skirvin ten times over. Very disappointed.Called ahead to ask for a decent room with a view and on a higher floor, the girl asked if I booked on Hotwire and I said yes...because why would anybody pay full price for something ever, if you had the chance to not pay full price? It was only $20/night off and I wish I had booked regularly to avoid the rudeness. She asked me to hold on, came back and said 'uuhhh there aren't any good rooms left, but we put you in the best possible'. Mind you, this was barely after check-in on a Thursday night (the hotel was dead when we got there). Checked in, went up to the room and it was almost level to the upper level of the parking garage with a huge spotlight shining into the room. We went back downstairs and said, never mind, just give us any room that doesn't overlook the parking garage, even an interior room. They got the 'you eat ass face' and gave us new keys without saying a single word. Not only did this room have a nice view and was a higher level, it was connected to the presidential suite. It was a bigger and better room. Way to discriminate against Hotwire users, when you have a deal. I used to work in a 4 star hotel in downtown Dallas and this is not the way you treat anybody. The rooms are very run down, in general. The carpets are dingy and always feel damp. The beds are uncomfortable. There was no mini fridge. There was a long, curly pube on the ground in the bathroom. This is all insane considering 3 star hotels in smaller cities right next to OKC (Norman to be exact) are 10 times nicer. I have used hotwire for 4 star hotels in OKC previously but never had the bad luck to get the Skirvin. I will not be booking through HW again for OKC because of the risk of us getting this nasty hotel again.Despite the odd name (Skirvin being entirely too close to scurvy and skeevy) this hotel was a beautiful place to stay. Built in the early 1900s, it's been through many incarnations, resurrections and devastation. Now it's a grand hotel with a bordello like feel, reminiscent of the old west (but without the shady characters.) It's also one of America's most haunted hotels. Effie, the ghost, apparently propositions men in the bathroom of room 1015. Guess which room we were in? Yep. 1015. Though we didn't hear her dulcet tones, the hot water mysteriously stopped working the day of check out. Effie or bad plumbing? We preferred the ghost story.Our beds were comfortable, the bathroom was huge, the room was oddly shaped but good enough for 3 people to roam around in without incident. The piano lounge downstairs is a little pricey drink-wise but then it's a hotel bar and a classic hotel bar at that. A great and affordable group hotel in the center of downtown OKC.It was a great hotel, very old and historic but not what I think of what I book at <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHilton.com&amp;s=ff48cb5a63451e585a11517cca71d84dbab39510ebce9045d1fc78d465f219b2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Hilton.com</a>. Several people told me it was haunted and it just felt awkward.Service was great, sleep was good and room service was awesome!Lost those other 2 starts due to the non Hilton like Hotel that's haunted and looks too old!It needs some TLC and a major renovation!I've never seen such a beautiful and historic place as I saw at this hotel. Is the hotel haunted though? I asked and you'll have to ask when you check in too!This hotel is beautiful and so worth the place to stay in Oklahoma City. The rooms are spacious.Valet parking is affordable and worth it, because self parking is literally 3 blocks away.My boyfriend and I were really excited to spend our anniversary here this past weekend but were sadly disappointed... He was insistent on us staying somewhere nice since I found out later that he was planning on proposing, which made me feel really bad for choosing this place... As we pulled in we waited for the valet to get to our car for at least 15 minutes even though there was only one car they were helping in front of us. I believe that if we are paying $26/day for the ""service and convenience"" of a valet they should at least be kind and attempt to expedite the process of checking in a car. This is also the first 4 star hotel that I stayed at with no sort of shuttle service. The front desk workers were the least accommodating I have ever worked with. Our room had a horrible view of the parking structure and even though we knew that they had quite a few rooms available they refused to check before telling us that there was nothing they could do. The staff acted as if they couldn't be bothered whenever we asked simple questions such as the hours of the pool and when we asked if it was possible for us to do a late checkout did not even bother to check the computer but rather rudely brushed us off. For the price of a 4 star hotel and staff quality and amenities of a 1 or 2 star hotel will we definitely opt to stay elsewhere the next time we are in the city. Even being used to staying at 4 star hotels in Hawaii and California I would choose the Hampton inn over this place any day.The main reason for a 4-star rating is the extreme niceness of all the hotel employees I dealt with during my recent stay.  Seriously, I don't think I've ever been treated better anywhere in my life!The hotel itself was pretty nice, and in general I was very pleased with it (a new shower cap was provided by housekeeping every day without having to ask for one - HAPPY DANCE!!), but there are a couple of things that would have made it even better -  such as a mini-refrigerator in every room, and more vegan options in the hotel restaurant's menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  There weren't really any vegan options to speak of (a banana or an apple doesn't really count as a meal, by the way), but some that could be made vegan, if you left out a number of non-vegan ingredients.  More and more people are choosing the vegan lifestyle, and any restaurant that accommodates us with a decent number of tasty and healthy vegan options will earn our loyalty and our recommendation.  I do wish more restaurants would wake up to this fact.  We're not going away - in fact, our numbers are ever-increasing - and we need to eat, too.  To leave us out of the equation as if we don't count is to treat us like second-class citizens.  Come on now, we deserve better than that!  Perhaps I shouldn't dwell so much on that point, as if it makes them different from other hotels - it doesn't.  The point is, this hotel is so much better on so many levels than other hotels I've stayed in, so I expect better from them.  If they would make a significant effort to improve in this area, the Skirvin Hilton would be just about perfect!What a grand hotel!  In for a national CFS meeting.  Guess my expectations were fairly low so what a pleasant surprise this hotel was.  The lobby and check-in were a breeze with helpful staff, great bellman, accommodating yet low key personnel.  The rooms were spacious, updated and well maintained.  The dining room was elegant and servers stayed in the background but were at your table the moment you needed them.  The meeting rooms were great and wifi everywhere with no problem when over a hundred of us signed on at the same time.  The ballroom was absolutely spectacular with beautiful chandeliers and great acoustics.  A lot of history, hauntings and hysterical stories that are shared by staff if you ask.  It is located in the center of town within walking distance to many places you want to visit.Would recommend this hotel for anyone staying in OKC whether for work or play!I travel to Oklahoma City for work and stay at this hotel almost every week (except when it's sold out, which is often). The hotel is beautiful and historic and definitely has an old timey but modernized look and feel too, having been renovated within the last decade after having been abandoned for many years. The rooms are spacious with beautiful fixtures and luxurious bathrooms. The piano bar on the first floor adds a nice ambiance to the location. The other amenities like the fitness center are quite nice as well and it conveniently connects to the city's underground tunnels, which I can luckily take to the office I work at when it's very cold.I've heard and read of its history as a haunted hotel and have been accordingly receptive to any strange goings-on. I can honestly report that I haven't experienced anything strange in the slightest. The hallways are spacious and often empty which gives a somewhat creepy ""The Shining"" hotel feel, but otherwise, the hotel feels quite normal. No strange sounds, mysteriously moving objects, or ghostly apparitions joining me in the shower. Just a lovely old hotel.Highly recommended for your next stay in OKC!This is definitely my home away from home.  In entering the building you walk back in time into an era where class and elegance were abundant.  The desk staff are warm and courteous and anxious to help. Once arriving in your room, you cannot help but to feel right at home. When you climb into bed you'll find that the bed actually embraces you.  Or could that be the token ghost?  The continental breakfast is superb, as everything that comes out of the Park Avenue Grill usually is.  I have stayed many, many times and have yet to find something to complain about.  This hotel comes highly suggested!This is one of the best Hilton Hotels in The United States.  Just completed a two day speaking program at this location.  The lobby is wonderful and the bar is a relaxing place at night.   The hotel is reportedly haunted with the cab driver trying to scare me on my ride in from the airport - he gave up when he discovered I was laughing at him. My room was wonderful clean, quiet and the maids spoke English. I could have moved into this hotel to live for a long time.  The staff is friendly professional and willing to help you at anytime with room service available 24/7.  You are located just a few minutes walk from Bricktown and museums this hotel gets my top rating!Such a magnificent hotel! The architecture and design of the building is simply breathtaking. Such incredible detail and integrity was involved in the restoration process. Every aspect of our stay was simply superb. Our rotunda suite was pristine and every aspect of cleanliness was adhered to fully. The furnishings are reminiscent of the era and the lobby is incredibly glamorous! The hallways and elevators are grand!!! Room service for breakfast was impeccable. We will definitely return when visiting the area!!!","This hotel is by far the best Hilton I've had the pleasure to stay at. It made a great stopover with easy access to bricktown. The rooms have new but locally elegant furniture rather than the same old hilton wares. The Lobby is beautiful and the staff are friendly and want to Help.Came here for an Xmas party, I did not stay the night..  Visually, the hotel is amazing! Definitely one of the nicer ones in Bricktown. I give it 3 stars because I was not impressed with their service or food.I love the Skirvin!  Just like the proverbial Phoenix rising from the ashes this historic hotel has gone from empty and barren when I was a kid to one of my favorite hotels in the country.  The only comparable hotel I've found on par with the Skirvin for historic value, luxury and modern amenities is the Hilton Presidential in Kansas City although the Skirvin trumps it. On average I stay at the Skirvin around 8-12 times a year.  Always for pleasure - for a random in-town vacation or on nights when I'm out late and rates are reasonable and for my now five year tradition of staying several days over New Year's.  As a cultural refugee living 30 miles away in Shawnee because of my business I have to stay at hotels frequently when I'm going out on the town.  Oh, I have plenty of friends in the area that would take me in but I'm not the stay on the couch kind of guy anymore so I tour all the hotels in OKC but will jump at the chance to stay at the Skirvin anytime it presents itself.  Every room is exceptionally appointed, from the suites to the regular rooms.  You really can't go wrong with any selection.  The suites are located on the front of the hotel in the rounded turrets of the building on each floor.  They are enormous for a hotel of this age but unfortunately missing a tub, although the bathroom is huge and the shower is great.  Most suites come standard with both but that's a first world complaint of the highest order. The hotel has been wonderfully renovated yet still maintains its turn of the century and mid century charm and architecture.  There are some wonderful art deco aspects to the hotel from the lobby to the beautiful the tile mural in the restaurant.  You feel as if you have stepped back in time when you are in this hotel - just with flat screen TVs and beds from the future!  Ahh the beds.  I wish I knew just exactly what brand these beds were as I'd have one delivered directly to my house.  They are amazingly comfortable.  Some hotel chains, like the W for instance, basically allow you to order everything in the room if you should so desire including the bed and bedding - if Hilton offered this at the Skirvin I would do it! The scent of the Skirvin is also majestic.  I started noticing the signature scents of hotels several years ago - mainly at places like the W, which can be overbearing.  The Skirvin's signature scent they pipe in is subtle yet gets me on some kind of emotional level.  Yeah I know, I sound like a maudlin fool.  They say scent is our most powerful sense and I believe it as I look forward to basking in its essence with every stay. Their signature scent is a trade secret so don't bother asking as I've been rebuffed every time I've asked.  The basement gym is fantastic.  Its not too large but has enough weights and cardio equipment to get the job done and is conveniently located next to their hot tub and smallish pool.  They say the Skirvin is haunted and while I don't believe in such nonsense I've been down in the pool by myself a few times and without anyone else around it is kind of unsettling.  And of course, the infamous stories you hear about ghostly crying babies and Effie the maid who committed suicide by jumping out a window are just that - stories and I've never once in my many stays encountered any paranormal activity.  Supposedly Effie will appear nude and proposition men in the shower but nary a naked succubus have I seen.  Nevertheless it makes for good stories and adds to the ""history"" of this legendary hotel.  The only minus - and this is a huge one - is the abomination of a restaurant that is the cornerstone of their property - the Park Avenue Grill.  I so want to like this place and have been here often but I've always left disappointed.  They have been through several supposedly high profile chefs since I started frequenting this hotel and I try to give them the benefit of the doubt but it's just bad, really really bad  - and overpriced!  You would think a world class hotel like the Skirvin would have a world class restaurant, but it is just not to be - yet!  Another downside is their valet parking which suddenly shot up from $20 to $27 within a two year period.  I understand the enormous costs associated with the upkeep of this hotel but be careful the Skirvin will nickle and dime you at every chance it gets.Forget about the rest, the Skirvin is the best. The Hilton Skirvin hotel is not only the best hotel in OKC it's one of the best Hilton hotels in the world.  The rich history of this hotel and its hauntings, yep, hauntings, makes it stand on it's own as one of the most beautiful, legendary,  unique, haunted hotels ever. Legend has it that back in the day Mr. William Balser ""Bill"" Skirvin had an affair with a young, beautiful, african american maid named Effie.  Reportedly Mr. Skirvin knocked her up, then locked her up, in a suite on the 10th floor (originally the top floor) of the hotel to avoid scandal as he was a married man. Mr. Skirvin still would not let her go free even after she gave birth thus driving her completely mad/crazy being locked up for so long. So, one day she just snapped, took her baby and jumped out the window killing herself and their love child. Over the years its been commonplace that guests again &amp; again complain about not being able to sleep, due to the incessant sounds of a child crying. According to some, a nude Effie is known to appear to male hotel guests while showering, and her voice can be heard propositioning them. One dude even reports being fondled by her as another claims he was sexually assaulted!!! Many staff members have reported everything from strange noises to things moving by themselves.In January of 2010, the New York Knicks basketball team told the New York Daily News they were unable to sleep the night before a game with the Oklahoma City Thunder. ""I definitely believe there are ghosts in that hotel,"" said center Eddy Curry. Forward Jared Jeffries added, ""The place is haunted. It's scary.""I have been stayin at the skirvin on and off for over a month now as my hubby &amp; I recently relocated to OKC.  It is truly a beautiful hotel there is no doubt about that. The first week we were there we were on the 10th floor.   My hubby &amp; I had the craziest dreams ever while staying there.  At that time, I did not know of the stories of Effie. One night we were in our room on the 10th floor &amp; I woke up around 4am from a nightmare about my mothers recent tragic passing.  I swore I saw this shadow of a woman in the dark float across the room and out the window, but I thought it was my imagination, as I had several drinks at the Red Piano Bar in the lobby earlier that night.  Someone then told me in passing about Effie. That next week the dreams continued as we were on the 9th floor. One evening late I was looking out the window as I went to shut the curtains, I looked up at the 10th floor and saw a woman holding what appeared to be a baby in the window. I went and asked, the room was vacant.   The strange dreams continued for the entire months stay. We even checked into another hotel and the dreams stopped.  We would check back into the Skirvin as we both love the hotel and again crazy dreams. The pool in the basement is a bromine pool (salt water) The hot tub is as well. They keep the temp of the hot tub at 105. The gym is amazing. The beds are super comfy.  The linens are fantastic, the Peter Thomas Roth bath products are fantastic. All the rooms have terry robes. The rooms are around $250 a night, beautiful furniture, well appointed, fantastic service, from the front desk to the house keeping.  Even the pool guy was super cool as I spend a great deal of time in the pool, hot tub and gym. The Red Piano Bar in the lobby is amazing and all the servers were super friendly &amp; professional. I had a beautifully cooked salmon Cesar salad at the bar several times.  It was all fantastic.  However, the room service has a 20% upcharge for room service and the valet parking is very expensive.  Better to eat downstairs and park yourself in the garage behind the hotel and walk back around it's only a half block. I do want to say thank you to the entire staff for making our stay a most pleasant one. ""Thank you all, your hospitality is unrivaled. Your hotel is magnificent as well as your service. Our whole stay was flawless we both truly enjoyed it. Well done!"" Every member of the staff was so kind &amp; wonderful to us making it our home away from home while we searched for and moved into our city flat.  We very much enjoyed our stay. I absolutely love this hotel I would totally recommend it for its quality, service and fantastic amenities.  I will most def stay again in the future.  But, I will never, ever, again stay on the 10th floor.BEDBUGS! Recently stayed here this past weekend and attended a wedding. Will not be staying here again and definitely not recommending this hotel to anyone I know. We had a room with 2 double beds and one bed had bedbugs crawling all over it. When calling the frtont desk, they sent someone up to my room who agreed with me and said that this was a big problem. I didn't expect this at the Skirvin so something like this only tells me that the cleaning crew does not change the sheets and probably not wash them. If you choose to stay at this hotel, turn y our room upside down and check for anything crawling around! The pictures attached to my review don't even begin to show how many were crawling in the bed!My new hotel in Oklahoma City. Old school nice, kind of steely, wide hallways big rooms, well appointed, clean and quiet.  Great restaurant downstairs, and the piano lounge is a nice stop that can make the end of your work day a joy.  My choice for here.Last Saturday night, an old high school friend had a surprise party at the Skirvin Hotel. On the second floor, there were 3 hostesses that directed us to the banquet room. There was a wide selection of food: Alfredo penne pasta, green beans, carrots, meatballs, etc! The meatballs were to. die. for. Inside it was an open bar - the bartender, J (I'll refrain from using his full name), was incredibly sweet, attentive, and friendly. The entire staff was WONDERFUL - they surely deserve 5 stars!!I give 4 stars because I felt the food was taken too early. . .after all of the drinks from the open bar it would have been nice to have some food after. ;)Unsure of how the hotel service is if you grab a room, but the food, company, venue &amp; employees made the night awesome!The debonair Skirvin is certainly a throwback to a different era with its ornate lobby fully decked with plush charm between its crazy high ceilings and huge, Alice in Wonderland-esque chairs. The staff was also wonderful, and the super soft bedding lulled me into one of the deepest slumbers I've had all month.However - the thread count of your sheets won't guarantee heavenly rest if the walls are built paper thin. I was up before 6am (1.5 hours before my alarm was set to go off) due to two different alarms going off within minutes of each other, down the hall from me. If you're a moderate-to heavy sleeper you'll fare just fine... but, you're straight out of luck if you're a lightweight in the zzzzs department. You can also hear people talking in their rooms/on the phone, though it isn't so creepy that you'll be able to understand them. Probably not the place you'd stay at for a romantic getaway... privacy is a good thing, no?Good night, guys - gotta catch up on some sleep!While I typically like to check out boutique hotels when exploring new cities, sometimes it's nice to stay at the well known chains because you know what you're getting. When we first booked the Hilton I expected good service, a clean spacious room and an adequate gym. I got all that and more during my 24 hours in Oklahoma City.I didn't spend very much time in my hotel room, but was easily able to catch up on some ZZZ's in their cozy bed. Fortunately, I didn't hear until the next day that the Skirvin is supposedly haunted cause that would have kept me from getting such a good night sleep. I woke up to no ghosts and ventured down to the basement to the gym filled with all sorts of cardio and weight equipment. And I had it all to myself.  You have to pay for wifi in their rooms, although they do offer complimentary wifi in the hotel lobby. The plush couches in the lobby became my office during my short stay.I wasn't thrilled with the location because there didn't seem to be many dining options within walking distance. My colleague and I enjoyed 2 meals at the restaurant at the hotel, but ventured out for a long walk in the cold for our 3rd meal in OKC.  I wouldn't hesitate to book the Skirvin again, but next time I would also look for a more centrally located hotel...or rent a car.The ghost tour at 10:30 is interesting.I was very happy with my unexpected stay the hotel had great serviceBeautiful hotel.... Paper thin walls.... This place was remodeled a few years ago &amp; I must say the place is really nice...  But the should have put a little more into the walls.  Both nights I was woken up by the guests next door.  I let the hotel manager know after day 1, but nothing was done...  It was still far from my worst hotel stay &amp; other than the noise, the place was great. I will be back.This is a beautiful old hotel that's been masterfully restored with a modern kick. If you can find a good rate, stay here! Valet parking is expensive, but there's a public garage adjacent that's only $6-7/day. Staying in downtown OKC is fun for a change. Try it when you're planning an evening at the Civic Center. We've done that several times. Have a late night drink in the red piano lounge, but try to ignore the out-of-tune red piano. It's there for color only.The sleeping rooms are big-city small but luxuriously appointed. Large meeting rooms on the 2nd floor are typical, and the ones on the top floor have lots of character. The banquet and A/V staff are fantastic! FAN-TASTIC, in case you didn't get that. If you're planning a conference or large event, they will make your guests happy.This was a great wedding location. The hotel staff did a great job and the Grand Ballroom was perfect for the reception. The food was good and the hotel room was perfect!  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet after our comfy night and a generous noon check-out. Great job Hilton!I stay here about once/month for work and every time I do, I'm reminded why I love this hotel so much. As I sit here enjoying my hotel room, I thought I'd update this review once more. I'm adding a star. Gorgeous. Inside and out. Such a great historic building downtown. The exterior, lobby and individual rooms are so classy and have just the right amount of ""over the top"" luxury chic.Best. Beds. Ever. I could sleep for 14 hours in these amazing beds. And I can't forget the comfy robe, one-cup coffee maker, great bath products, and soft towels. It's also walking distance to almost anywhere downtown and Bricktown, which I enjoy.It's worth every penny :)This is without a doubt my favorite hotel to stay in, anywhere.  I am a Hilton Diamond member (I stay in a ton of Hilton-brand hotels for business), and this one trumps all the rest.  In addition to being a historical location, the tasteful renovations to this property throughout the years give this place an 'old time' feel with modern amenities.  All finishes are absolutely top-end, and you really feel like are taken back in time (in a good way).As other users have stated, the location is downtown OKC- great for business travel or for personal travel (Bricktown is walkable, likewise with the OKC Memorial- a must).  From the minute you walk into the property, there is a grand feeling with chandeliers, rich cherry/mahogany wood everywhere, large floor to ceiling velvet curtains, a giant fire red grand piano, and lots of 'original' yet restored touches.  The mail drop is original to the property, and the walls are lined with historical photos and memoribilia from the hotel's past.  I'm not much a history guy, but the photos of royalty, presidents, and famous actors staying at the property are really pretty neat.The restaurant attached has an excellent breakfast buffet with omelet chef.  I get free vouchers to eat there due to my Hilton status (thankfully, because for 2 people its like $40 normally).  I've never had dinner at the restaurant, but I've heard positive reviews... like breakfast, I'll assume its pricey.I have stayed at this property I think 6 times and have had a standard room, a suite, and the presidential suite.  The standard room is as large or larger than a normal standard hotel room, and the bathrooms are very nice- has the granite counter, dark wood counter, and really cool tasteful wall paper.  The shower heads are large, and like all Hilton properties it has the curved shower rod.  The king beds are plush with excellent bedding.  All of the furniture in the rooms is new- I think from an 08' remodel.  Just about all rooms in the property have some view of downtown.The suite is really neat with a large red sofa in the TV room with great views of downtown.  There is a separate bedroom and bath area with similar excellent high-end finishes.  No expense spared by the interior decorator.  The presidential suite is huge.  I've only stayed in this unit once, but it encompasses 3 standard rooms.  The shower has 6 body sprayers on it, an overhead rainfall head and a standard shower head.  The mirror in the bathroom has a TV built-in.  The whirlpool tub is standard.  All of the other rooms are luxurious like the standard room and suite room.  Awesome.The staff has always been very friendly with me, and is usually pretty knowledgeable about the area- they'll provide dining recommendations etc upon request.  This place is highly recommended, and I'm certain I will stay there again in the future.  Room rates vary greatly- some time its $119/night, sometimes its $169/night for a standard room and higher.  I have no idea what the driver is for the rates.  If you use Hilton points, I think its 30,000 points/night.  Internet is free for Hilton Gold/Diamond members... not sure if you have to pay otherwise.We've spent numerous special occasions at the Skirvin. Bachelorette parties, Easter brunches, drinks with friends, and even our wedding reception.I fundamentally believe that the Skirvin offers the most service, amenities, and style than any other Oklahoma City event venue, Hotel, or hotspot.And you HAVE to check out the Red Piano bar. It's my favorite late-night drink spot.I've never been homesick for a hotel before.  Oh my goodness.  The minute we checked out, I was missing it already.It was love at first sight with the dark wood, intricate chandeliers, and luxurious red velvet curtains in the lobby.  We had been delayed arriving, but a quick call to the front desk en route was all it took to get everything squared away.  They pre-checked us in and had our keys waiting when we arrived.The doors to the elevators are gorgeous antiques -- take a moment to admire them.  This entire hotel has been around for almost a century, and it was renovated and reopened in 2007, but they simply restored rather than replaced, which means that this hotel is a beautiful mix of old-world charm and new-world accommodations.  (Let's talk about the heated, anti-fog bathroom mirrors.)  The hallways are simple yet elegant, and the rooms (even the basic ones!) are divine.  I slept better in that bed than I do at home.  No lie.There are a bajillion cable channels to choose from, but the wireless internet isn't free, which is part of what contributed to a 4-star rating rather than a 5-star rating.  Another tiny mark down for the cost of parking ($10 a day) -- but here's a BIG tip...if you're there on a weekend, the meters in front of the hotel (about 10 spots) are free.  So, we didn't have to pay for parking, but normally we would have.  Also, we only had to pay $25 per room, because I was traveling with a friend who works for Hilton.  That definitely helped me view this hotel more favorably.  If I had been paying the regular rate (I think $150?), I might not have been quite so over-the-moon.  Thus, only 4 stars instead of 5.  Still, though, it was close.A lovely, lovely spot if you ever find yourself traveling to Oklahoma City.  We were even traveling with the primary intention of visiting Norman, and the commute (20 minutes) wasn't too bad.Truly a nice hotel.  Classic charm and feel.  Not sure what the regular rate is since I was on the corporate plan but worth it.I was a little nervous staying in a older hotel.  Not because I was worried the hotel wasn't updated, but because of ghosts.  I think I would like Casper the Friendly Ghost if I met him.  But when I want to sleep, I want to sleep.  I'm happy to report there were no spirits in the hallway (just the liquor spirits in our room, ha ha ha).This hotel is a great hotel right in downtown Oklahoma City, within walking distance to Brickyard and other bars / restaurants.  You have to valet to park there, but that is pretty common in any downtown hotel.  The architecture was amazing.  Completely reminds me of older buildings that have since fell to the wrecking ball.  The lobby was very ornate.  Lots of dark wood and soaring ceilings.  Made me feel like I was one of the great Gatsbys.  The rooms were very modern and comfortable.  We had a corner room that overlooked a part of downtown.  Our room had a big TV and an iPod docking station.  If memory serves, I believe they have WiFi in the room.  However, I cannot remember if we had to pay for it.I highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in the downtown Oklahoma City area.The 411-------(Source: WSJ)Located at One Park Avenue, the 14-story, smoke-free hotel is comprised of three separate towers with 225 guest rooms, including 20 one-bedroom suites and one Presidential Suite. Hotel amenities include the signature Park Avenue Grill restaurant, which retains the Art Deco look of the hotel's former interior design, the Red Piano lounge, a fitness center, indoor swimming pool, business center, 18,500 square feet of meeting and pre-function space and a Hiltons HHonors lounge. History Lesson--------------The original Skirvin Hotel was Built by William Skirvin, who participated in the Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 and later made a fortune in land and oil. The Skirvin is near railroad depots and is an example of the grand hotels that prospered during the golden age of railroad travel.It is said that back in the day ""If you were in the lobby of the Skirvin Hotel, whatever was going on in Oklahoma City would pass right in front of you.""The recently re-opened Skirvin has a renewed luster, after being hidden away for almost 20 years as it sat boarded up.The New Standard----------------The Skirvin will now set the new standard for hotels in the downtown OKC area. When you walk in the front door you feel as if you have stepped back into the early 1900's to a brand new hotel - now with all modern ameneties.As I checked in I could feel the attitude towards impeccable service that the staff were taking. Even though I was being assisted by one gentlemen I was introduced to the other two at the front desk. This was done for everyone that checks in.There was hotel staff in the lobby just to assist with questions and comments. The check in process was quick, effecient and warm. I almost felt like I was checking into a B&amp;B.As I wandered to my room I could not help but take in the commitment to the restoration and the quality of the workmanship throughout the facility.I was overly impressed as I walked into the room. The furnishings were wonderful and it felt like an apartment. The bathroom was very modern with a a walk in shower and a mirror that does not fog.The Caveat - Please remember I do ALL my corporate hotel stays with Hilton so the pictures of the room below are from a suite that I was upgraded to because of status.However, I did have an opportunity to view a standard room as a maid was servicing it and that room had very similar appointments.Cocktail Hour-------------It was time to head to the Red Piano Lounge. Yes they do have a Red Piano. On this evening a guitar player was strumming and incredible array of music that kept the bar upbeat.The service continued to be Stellar and the prices for cocktails were not unreasonable. Beer: $4.25 avg. Cocktails: $7-10 avg.--------------The remodel and impeccable service has kept the Skirvin to its heritage and I can say that I have a new hotel to stay at in OKC.","Beautiful place!  Rooms, hallways, accommodations are great!  Plus, I have used this hotel for OKC bachelorette parties, the room was a bit pricey, but you get a comp stretch limo and you just tip the driver, goes anywhere in Bricktown. We took him to eat, back to hotel for festivities and then our, back in limo before 2 am and it feels like a lux party!  My brides loved it and so did I!  Parking you must pay for though bc it is downtown, only free is on the street which is non existent usually.  Great staff, although very proper, not stuffy, had no problem with out fun and kept everyone safe!Very nice hotel with above average service.  Comfortable, nicely decorated rooms.  Other than the loud HVAC fan, room was quiet and seemed well sound-insulated.  Stayed on 8th and 10th floors and nothing went ""bump in the night"" for me.  Lunch buffet is very good.  Food in the piano bar was ok at best; better just for a pre-dinner cocktail.The best Hilton property in the world!!!!!!! The staff is such a delight, always. There are staff whose parents worked here for fifty years. I love everyone I come across whom works for this hotel. From the front desk clerk who always hooks us up as diamond members to the maid in the hall. And then the maid in the next hall. They are all so awesome and you will have a delightful conversation with all of them. We stay here around three times a year for the past five years and it is always consistent. Thank you for being the best Hilton Skirvin!!!!!Great, old-world-feel hotel. Plushy towels in rooms and decadent bathrobes. Beds are comfy, although the rooms w 2 beds are only doubles, not queens as in other hotels. Overall a good experience. The ambiance is first-rate, if you're looking for classiness.Charming and nicely restored. Great staff. Big rooms with all modern amenities. Fourteenth floor meeting space is great. Walking distance to museums and bars and the arena. Too bad there is not more shopping. Stay here to get a flavor of turn of the century(19 to 20) Oklahoma.Had Sunday Brunch here; the service was mediocre and the food was substandard.  I ordered the Salmon burger but a Salmon Croquet was my burger - not expected from the menu description and the Croquet was underdone and under seasoned.  Been there twice, first and last for brunch.Recently renovated, this was easily the nicest hotel I've stayed at in a lonnnng time. I checked in late and left early so I don't have much to share but:The room? Clean &amp; updated but I got a low-level floor with a view of a cement wall.The bed? Possibly the most comfortable hotel bed EVER. The valet? Totally freaking nice.I have the say the name is a bit odd - but yes, I understand the gentleman that originally built the hotel's last name is Skirvin... Other than that, this hotel was terrific!I'm on the road throughout the summer traveling for business and was not necessarily excited to be visiting Oklahoma City in the heat and humidity ... Hesitant on the hotel. What do I expect? Kept chanting ""there's no place like home. there's no place like home...""To my surprise, the hotel is quite large, newly renovated, and pretty darn comfortable!  I had a wonderfully large room with a fluffy bed, new flat screen TV and extra large bathroom.  Even though I was only there for 1 night the girl likes to pack ... (and in my defense, was off to Austin for the remainder of the week) ;)So, if you find yourself in OKC -- for whatever the reason -- you may want to settle yourself into a spacious room at The Skirvin.  It won't disappoint.This was my first time visiting Oklahoma City, so I chose the hotel because of its central location.  I can't stress how impressed I am with the hotel.  The large room, nice bathroom with the deep bathtub, and the comfortable beds were very enjoyable to me, and the workout room had everything I needed.  I was very happy to see that everything in the hotel was new and clean, and that not an inch of the hotel went without renovation.  The pool here was very small, but the hot tub was large enough to fit five people.  Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Skirvin Hilton and in Oklahoma City.Very nice to see such a historic building in such beautiful condition!Difficult, unfriendly staff. Justin checked me in and came off poorly. Horrible attitude... Horrible customer service. My room smells like mildew. Room service would not serve me wine despite my request falling within the hours the menu states wine is available.The Skirvin Hilton looks great, but the details and lack of polish with the staff let it down. It doesn't help that Oklahoma City has an extremely boring downtown that literally empties out after 5:30PM, and there is absolutely nothing to do within 5 blocks of the hotel after dark (and not much going on in the dayltight either). The hotel is freshly renovated, nicely furnished, and not quite as blandly corporate as the usual downtown Hilton would be. They did the nicest job on the small but elegant lobby, bar and restaurant. Sinatra playing in the elevators, and lots of old photos on the walls gives it a snazzy touch. And yet, the facility is let down by its staff. The staff overall was not rude, not disastrous, and yet clearly not polished or profesional enough, especially for the prices charged in their elegant looking hotel. The Valet/Doormen staff out front were the worst and sloppiest; and they all need to be sent to the barbershop, told to shave every day, taught some manners, and told to not lean around talking about parties and ballgames and ignoring their guests entering and exiting the hotel. The bar staff, restaurant staff and front desk staff were only marginally better, but the polish expected from this level of hotel is just not there. The staff of the Skirvin Hilton is definitely not ready for prime time, but for a Howard Johnson's near the airport they'd be great. As for Oklahoma City nightlife.... if your idea of a big Saturday night is going to eat at a Hooter's or Rib Palace (6 blocks away) or a stinky college-kid party bar in Bricktown (5 blocks away), then OKC is just for you! Otherwise, there is nothing within walking distance of the Skirvin for meals or anything else. The nearest Starbucks is almost a mile east of the hotel, which should give you an indication of how welcoming the neighborhood is around the Skirvin. Be prepared for many vacant storefronts and abandoned streetscapes around this hotel. And don't expect the Skirvin doormen to do much as you approach the front door, either.I stayed at the Skirvin Hilton 3 weeks ago while in town for an advertising competition.  Upon check-in I was required to put down a credit card for incidentals, but was assured it was just a formality as the room would be paid for by the head of our group upon checkout.  I ordered no room service and did not charge anything to my room and when we left, my adviser assured me that he had paid for all the rooms for our group.Last week, my American Express bill arrived and lo and behold, the Skirvin had charged me $360 for 2 nights in my room.  I double-checked with my adviser that he had paid for my room and he emailed me the confirmation number he received when we checked out.  After 3 days of calling and leaving 5 voice mails without any response, I was forced to contact American Express to file a dispute.  Bottom line, the customer service is terrible and it made me forget all the positives of staying at the hotel.  Not that I plan to return to Oklahoma City, but if I ever have to, I will NEVER stay at the Skirvin Hilton again.Some things were fine, however the valet wouldn't help us take in our luggage, rude, and lacking in professionalism. This is the second time I one month where we had a similar issue. Definitely not a one time experience. Management called to apologize but didn't really make us feel like the problem was resolved.I stayed here 2 weekends ago for my first visit in Oklahoma City.  I have to say, it exceeded my expectations in every way.  First, the staff was top notch.  We got there around 10 pm on a Saturday night, and there was a lot of staff on hand to help check us in, get off to our room, and direct us to the nightlife around town (which there is quite a bit).  We returned back to the hotel a couple hours later, and remarked to the staff at the front desk how grand and impressive the original hotel must have been, since it is evident that a lot of money was used to preserve this place.  So they offered a few comments, and then asked if we'd like a personal tour...at midnight on a Saturday.  Being architecture geeks, I couldn't say no - and off we went around the building.  Go to the 14th floor and check out the rooms and views yourself and you'll see what I mean.Anyway - this place is awesome.  Really makes Oklahoma City probably one of the most underrrated downtowns in the US.  I came to the City with no idea what to expect, and really thought there's a lot going on.  Oh - and be prepared for crowds and getting a bit dressed up - most places around won't let you in if you grunged down.This is the hotel my parents had their honeymoon in! The owners have done a great job restoring it. You feel like your walking into a true treasure in downtown OKC. The lobby is beautiful! Go into the bar and grab a drink and listen to the piano. I attend a luncheon here once a month and the rooms are great, the staff is professional, and the food is tasty for mass food!I stay here everytime I'm in OKC, which is about every 3 months.  The ambiance and decor is rich, luxurious and makes me feel like I am back in the victorian era (not really good on my historical decor, so work with me on this!).  The beds are super comfortable and the hotel staff has always been friendly and overly helpful, with the exception of two girls who work the front desk in the morning.  I must catch those 2 ladies on a bad morning everytime I'm there!  This is the only reason I gave the hotel 4 stars instead of 5.  Otherwise, everything else is fantastic!  (Oh, with the exception of the usual Hilton Crabtree &amp; Evelyn tolieties.  Hilton, these smell like cheap old lady!!  Get something new!!)Nicely renovated historic hotel.  Very friendly, smart, knowledgeable staff.  I requested a view; they obliged with a good city view including the state capitol.  I love the old photos in the hallways.  Not sure how I feel about the mix of old and new (some of the hallway furniture seemed oddly modern juxtaposed with the other elements).this is a great spot down town OC.. Old building but with great upgrades... Hotel staff has stories about this place being haunted.. really good service for sure... this is defintly a upscale hotel.... outstanding resturants within walking distance if you valet your car,,This hotel, finally restored and reopened after nearly 20 years of sitting vacant, is immaculate.  The lobby has stunning wood paneling and huge pllars.  There is a nice lounge with live jazz, and a great upscale restaurant.  I haven't stayed in a room, but the rest of the building is great.",,,"['consider', 'home', 'away', 'home', 'visit', 'several', 'times', 'year', 'hotel', 'gorgeous', 'service', 'impeccable', 'red',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hilton-garden-inn-oklahoma-city-2,Hilton Garden Inn,4.0,$$,23,"I have stayed at this location several times and enjoyed my stay. The staff have always been friendly and helpful. The little pantry they have is always well stocked with lean cuisine meals and other microwave foods for those late night checkins or munches. Plenty of other snacks and beverages as well. This location does not have the usually American Grill they have a seperate brand called the 809 Sports Grill which usually have pretty good food. I love their chili its a thick and hearty chili with a touch of dark chocolate added for a little sweetness. It's amazing. The room is the typical HGI setup and amenities. I like that they do not lock the TV's so I can connect my iPad and watch my shows. Some of the Hampton properties lock the TV so you can't change the input.There are several shops nearby if you forget something and need to stop into a Target for example. Overall it's a good stay and I will be staying here again in the futureOverall I had a good stay the hotel and was happy with my visit. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly.There was one thing however that came up in my stay. I ordered room service while I was there and used the menu from the hotel room. Well, I placed my order for the food and the bill came with the food. Normally I don't usually look closely to the charges on the bill, but I noticed that the prices from the menu differed from the bill I received. All the items on the menu were a dollar less than the bill. I called downstairs to speak with the manager and told him the situation and he said the prices have gone up and the menus have not been updated. I asked him are the menus going to be updated anytime soon because I'm sure other guests will notice. He said yes they will be and that the bill reflects the new prices. At that point he did not suggest or say he would accommodate me with the old prices since it was the hotels mistake. I had to ask him to change it. He gladly said he would fix it, which I appreciated. However, I was just surprised he didn't suggest accommodating me since it was the hotels mistake.I did receive an email from the hotel today asking them how my stay was. I did appreciate the follow up with the hotel. I will for sure let them know.5 stars again for this awesomeness as a hotel.  Wonderful service, location, clean rooms, great rates.  My previous review on The Hilton is pretty much the same nothing to change.  Its hard to come back to a business twice and get the same results but the exceeded my expectations.  When we come back to OKC this will be the hotel we will stay inOMG, Paula is the best over here at HGI OKC Midtown.  My fiancee had wedding planned for earlier this month so started wedding planning last year Dec.  Well, my dad found this hotel near the church and reception dinner.  Paula was able to setup a wedding block for our guests and include free breakfast as well.  The wedding rate was pretty competitive and was better than our company rate.  Plus, Paula was able to secure 2 rooms across from each other since my sister brought her daughter along.  Also, my best man and uncle's room were relatively close by each other.  We enjoyed every morning with our vouchers.  I had omelet the first 2 days and then decided on fried eggs on the last day.  The waiting staff was very accommodating and took omelet orders very quickly.  For our wedding night, we had a Jacuzzi tub upgrade so it was nice they everything was setup very quickly.Great sports bar in lobby, friendly staff...my only complaint is my room, which was otherwise spotless, had wet carpet and a funky smell (room 302) upon arrival. I blasted the air and the odor was controlled. Also called room svc at 8pm Wed night and was told it would be 1hr 15 min for a club sandwich....too late to eat. Girl said they were understaffed.I have stay here over 35 nights during  2014 and every time they seem to be better  and better  their staff  always  go the extra mile to make sure you feel  comfortable great amenities, very clean,lobby is always  clean and nicely  decor. The room service is a plus and the food is overall  good but the staff is the differenceThis was a great place to stay! We got in exhausted after a long day of driving on the way back to Ohio, and we were treated with great customer service at 1:30am or so! I was dead tired, but Chris at the front desk was a great guy, and made our check-in experience the best it possibly could have been, given how exhausted we were.This hotel was really nice, and it was very reasonably priced. The only downside was that it was a little off the interstate; but everything else about it made up for that. The room was clean and comfortable, and had a mini fridge, which was great to stash the snacks I was carrying in a cooler. I would also note there was no complimentary breakfast; but that didn't bother me - good excuse to try a local OKC bakery in the morning!This place was reasonably priced, had such great service, and a really great room that I would seek it out again if I was staying in OKC for a night. I highly recommend it.Was in OKC for a concert last week and all the downtown hotels were outrageously expensive. HGI Midtown seemed like a close enough alternative that was both nice and reasonably priced.Overall a great stay - staff was friendly, there's a bar/restaurant onsite and it's not too far of a drive to downtown. Really nice rooms - clean and modern. Appeared to be great breakfast choices as well, though I stuck to coffee.I've stayed in numerous HGIs and they're always above average - this one was no different. The only snag we hit was when our TV stopped working. We let the front desk know on our way out, but it was still not working when we came back. One of the staff members came up, reattached some cables and we were up and running again.Was in OKC for two nights and whenever I pick up a new territory or state, I usually try multiple locations out, always Hilton or Hyatt, to see where I want to stay in the future. In OKC, it will be the HGI here!  Easy to get into, great location, clean, comfortable and excellent service.  Was greeted warmly at the front desk, acknowledged I was a Gold member and thanked me.  Had two bottles of waters chilled and ready and with a nice touch, had the welcome note on the bottles wrapped around it with my name, room# and contact info for the manager. Also wanted to know if I wanted bkfst the next morning or points. As I was leaving at the crack of dawn I took points and she immediately asked if I needed a wakeup call etc.  Room was typical HGI, clean, comfortable, neat.  It was missing the channel listing and someone ran up one in about 2 minutes with a free drink coupon for the trouble.  Bar in the hotel is a sports bar and was just fine to grab a beer and a snack before I went out.Very pleased by the level of service, nice amenites onsite and overall feel! Will be the Hilton of choice for myself and team in OKC!I stay here at least once a month .. Sometimes twice a month .. Front desk is always very professional and helpful .. The lobby is very welcoming .. The bar/lounge/restaurant is very nice .. Very intimate ... The rooms are always clean .. Comfy bed and mattress ... There's a nice little bar area with a fridge and microwave .. I would highly recommend this place to everyone :)I stayed around 60 nights in this hotel in 2014. It's a great hotel! I was predominantly a Marriott girl before this, and so are all of the other consultants in my company who travel like I do - but the OKC options made me turn to this hotel and I couldn't be happier. Now I go to HGI often.1. The service was great! I heard that it used to be bad, but they hired a management company to come in and help, and I must say it shows. I had zero issues with service and housekeeping was good. Lobby is updated, they offer cookies :)2. The Keurigs in every room really sealed the deal for me, love it. Makes it hard to go back to the old fashioned coffee pots when I stay at other hotel brands.3. This is the only HGI I've been to that offers complimentary loofas. As a woman I appreciate that, other HGI's so far don't offer them. Still can't tell if they should be or if that was something unique to this location.4. The 809 grill was fantastic. I've had everything on the menu - make sure you order the pizza at least once, it was so good. Sit at the bar for better and quicker service. Locals actually come here to eat often and I can see why. There is enough variety on the menu that you would be good to eat here every day if you wanted to. I had the Baha Chicken Wrap several times. Loved ordering room service when coming back to the hotel after a long day.5. It seems like a newer hotel, everything is updated and I found it very inviting. I see some complaints on the dial beds - I don't mind them. I find the beds to be soft and I like that they use the white coverlets that are washed regularly instead of the old school blankets that hotels used to use.Stay here! :)First time in OKC, my suite was very clean and comfortable.  I'm not one for super crowded/high traffic hotels; so this location was perfect.  There is a pool, restaurant/bar, and gym.  It is not too far from downtown and only minutes from Lake Hefner.  The staff was super friendly, parking was free, and Wifi was complimentary.  If I'm ever in OKC, this will be my ""go-to"" location.Subpar for a hilton, more what I expect from a Hampton Inn. The hallways and lobby were clean, fresh and lovely. The room was decent sized but felt cheap. The linens are thin, the bed has an adjustable knob for firmness (really) that does nothing. And THE NOISE! If you need quite, go somewhere else: loud fridge, high pitch whine from AC unit (no central air) and a loud noise that sounded oddly like a tornado siren (but wasn't). The bathroom was small, with the towels stored in the shower. The faucet covering didn't completely cover the hole in the tile for the plumbing.I stayed here last weekend for a girls' night and while I can say it met the objectives for the evening, I was pretty underwhelmed overall. Pros: Clean lobby and rooms, comfortable beds and central location.Cons: Service left me feeling very 'meh'.  Here's two stories to illustrate just how 'meh'. Upon arriving, we wanted to toast our girlfriend's recent engagement.  We called and asked for champagne flutes, they said 'sure' and then called back and said 'but you have to come get them yourselves.' OK, not the worst request... but when I went to the front desk they said, ""Oh, you have to get them at the bar"".  {frustration rising a little} I waited a solid 5 minutes at the bar before anyone helped, and what is most frustrating is that I could SEE said glasses just waiting behind the bar!  Finally someone from back of house came out and gave me the glasses.  When we started getting ready to turn in, we realized we were woefully short on pillows and bath towels, so we called and asked for a few extra of each.  Phone rings after the request and guess what? We need to go get them ourselves, because the front desk person was alone and needed to cover.  OK, that's reasonable.  My friend waited another 5 minutes once down there, and strangely enough, there were multiple people working the front desk! She was given 2 pillows and 3 hand towels.  I don't know about you, but I don't usually bathe with a hand towel! So long story short: I realize these are first world and possibly lazy person problems, but if you know what we've requested and you ask us to come get them, at least have them ready.  I know it was a busy weekend and most hotels in OKC were full of NCAA wrestlers for the tournament, but having rooms full of guests should be a good thing and not a surprise you don't know how to handle.  I probably won't be recommending this place to out-of-town guests anytime soon.I still don't get the HGI beds. The adjustment never seems to work. They're not necessarily uncomfortable but they don't have much give. The breakfast waiter guy with a buzz cut was very accommodating to me as well as to other guests. This was one of the best hotel breakfast staffs I've run across in my travels, mostly at Hilton properties. As mentioned by others, the hotel is close to creature comforts, decent restaurants. I wasn't doing business downtown so didn't need to be close to there. OKC just isn't that large so even though this is in NW OKC, it's not far from the airport or anywhere really.I stayed here for the past couple of January visits and will probably do the same next January.The Hilton Garden Inn proved to be a great choice last weekend when I was in town for a concert.  We had hoped to find a place to stay a little closer to the venue but they all turned out to be on the pricey side.  So we saved a couple hundred bucks and stayed in midtown, and just cabbed it to and from the show.  The room was very nice, with large comfy beds and a flat screen TV.  It also had a decent sized fridge and coffee maker.  They serve a free continental breakfast and prepared ones for under ten bucks.  While we didn't make an appearance, there is what seemed to be a decent sports bar in the lobby.  The WiFi hooked right up, at least for us on the top floor.  On a side note, it is a smoke free facility, which (thankfully) is more the norm these days.  As an ex-smoker I thought the Smoking Oasis was a nice touch.  It had a few tables and a heater, to go along with some ash trays.  It was also nice to not see a pile of butts out near the front door!I've stayed at this exact hotel 3 separate times before this trip, and from those 3 past trips, I'd give the hotel 4 stars. It was the most recent that brought it down to two, mainly because of how many negative stars this past stay should receive. In fact I may have written a review of this hotel before that was very good.I checked in around 8:30 on Sunday to a less than enthusiastic front desk person. No ""Welcome to the HGI"" or ""Thank you for being a Diamond member"" or ""Welcome back"" (Hilton guide book tells employees to say welcome back to returning guests - it's noted on their reservation).  Not anything terribly concerning, but off-putting overall.  The room was nice, and clean, as they always have been each time I've stayed here. Two qualms - the bedframe was coming apart - it was secured by brackets, but you could see the pieces of wood coming apart, which made it creaky. The second was the refrigerator - it kept anything you put in there at a perfect 96 degrees Fahrenheit and was mouse-quiet - until 3AM when it decided to play what I'm guessing was a refrigerator's version of a rock concert.The first morning I decided to take advantage of my complimentary breakfast - the food was good as was the service, which, besides the cleanliness of the room, was the sole highlight of the trip. The second day was a tad different. I was greeted by some guy wearing a non-uniform shirt, no nametag, and I had no idea he was supposed to be my waiter. For all I knew he was some guy.That night I had a lot of work to do so when finished I decided to order room service - ordered a plate of their nachos (had them the last time I stayed here - very good!) and a salad. Guy on the phone said 20 minutes. I waited until an hour went by, called back down, and they never put the order in or had any recollection. The supervisor told me I was going to get 5000 Hilton Points as a recompense, but I did not receive them.My final night I had a delicious dinner at Cattleman's and as I was flying out the next day I decided to have a nightcap at the bar. This went well but what was off-putting was that the two bartenders were eating behind the bar, walking around, pouring drinks, with food in hand. Besides how unsanitary this is, it's just plain unprofessional.Finally, when leaving in the morning, they didn't slip the receipt under my door! Every Hilton I've ever stayed at in the past 5 years I've received this. I guess they slipped up again.In conclusion, I'll be staying at the HGI in Bricktown next time, or the Skirvin. I'd recommend the same.Curtis at the front desk was awesome!! He was very friendly and said he was there to help with anything we needed.  He went out of his way to answer questions and give directions and was great!  The hotel lobby is beautifully decorated. You are offered amenities like complimentary  lemon water, coffee and cookies. Rooms are clean and very pretty with everything you need.  We stayed at a different hotel the previous night that was $80 more than this one (way overpriced)!  Overall, very impressed!Brand new hotel built to meet the needs of overflow from the other hilton. Much cheaper than the one just 5 minutes into the city, great access to the highways too.Friendly staff, and sleep number bedsNice Hilton Garden Inn. Hot breakfast was not even warm unfortunately. Otherwise, good stay. I thought the decor and overall design of the hotel was a step up from most Hilton Garden Inns I have stayed at. Nice big rooms.","Nice placeOne of the best hotels on the North side of downtown Oklahoma City.  They call this the Hilton Garden Inn Midtown but that is a stretch as it is located on Northwest Expressway and May Avenue. This Hilton Garden Inn is very new, exceedingly clean and has an ultra hip modern, stylish decor that is more like that you would see at W hotel than a Hilton Garden Inn.As a Hilton Honors loyalist and for the fact that I live 30 minutes east of Oklahoma City I stay at this hotel quite often and must say that this is one of the best Hilton Garden Inns I have stayed at in the entire country - and boy do I stay at a lot of hotels.  In addition to the hotel there is an attached sports bar called the 809 Sports Grill.  Usually, I steer clear of hotel restaurants but this one is super clean, ultra modern, has plenty of flat screens and a really cool laid back ambiance and it is thankfully just a walk away from the elevator should you have a few too many and need a room.  I'm not sure who actually comes here besides people staying at the hotel but that's a shame as it is very nice, has a great selection of food that far surpasses anything I've ever found at a Hilton Garden Inn.  If you're ever in the area and want to watch a game without annoying smoke in a clean, ultra hip environment be sure and check out the 809 Sports Grill. As a result of my job I travel quite frequently and feel confident in my knowledge of the best hotels in most major cities.  And, as a total hotel loyalty points whore, I collect free nights and vacations like they are going out of style.  Remember George Clooney in Up In The Air?  I can totally relate! - and why not?  All of my stays for work and leisure pay for me to take fabulous trips for free so I consider it basically another perk of my job.  Some idiot in Congress attempted in vain to try to get a bill passed several years ago claiming that hotel and airline points should be taxed as income!  The nerve! Thankfully that didn't even get off the ground as no doubt that would elicit riots in Washington.  As a general rule I eschew chain restaurants, opting for local as often as I can, but when traveling I'm much more comfortable with a known chain entity save but for a few boutique hotels and others that have stellar Yelp reviews in select cities.  After staying in all of the major chains across the country for years I have pared my loyalty down to Hilton and Starwoods properties.  Since OKC is a Starwoods wasteland, Hilton it is for me.  For those not familiar with OKC this is kind of a curious area for a hotel like this as it is near quite a few creature comforts but just far enough away from our so-called major attractions.  It is also literally on Northwest Expressway and conveniently located to either I-44 or I-240. It is also very reasonably priced from between $99 on a slow weekend night to $149 for a weeknight.  And unlike another reviewer who mentioned that breakfast isn't free, well it is, provided you are a super duper Hilton member (Diamond) like me, but most hotel breakfasts universally suck anyway so you're much better forgetting any breakfast even if its free and finding a local gem while you're here. Actually, this is very much like an Aloft Hotel, which is thankfully opening soon in downtown Oklahoma City so we will finally have a Starwoods property.Great hotel.  Breakfast is ok, but not free.  The rooms are clean and new and comfy.  Great shower.  Bar/restaurant on-site.  Stylish lobby.  Pool.  Exercise room.  Bars/restaurants/shopping nearby, but not walking distance.",,,,"['location', 'several', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'staff', 'always', 'friendly', 'helpful', 'little', 'pantry', 'always', 'well', 'stocked',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/courtyard-oklahoma-city-downtown-oklahoma-city,Courtyard Oklahoma City Downtown,3.5,$$,28,"Slept like a rock at this hotel. Beds and nice and big, and love the pillows. I think they're feather/down pillows. The location of this hotel is pretty good as well. Short walk to Brick Town and the Oklahoma Memorial. What I love the most is the customer service! I stay at hotels frequently so I know and feel when I really have good customer service. The people that work here are super nice! It was very easy to relax and enjoy the stay here.I am a longtime Marriott fan and loyal stayer having logged almost 1200 nights with them over the years.I stay in Courtyards a lot of the time for business based on location and rate. This time I booked a combo rate including self park and breakfast.Check in is not easy for self parkers as you park out front, come in leave bags and check in, leave bags there, get back in car to park in high rise garage and walk back down into the hotel. Reverse that leaving BUT don't turn in key yet as you leave or you can't exit garage. Hated that.At check in there were three ladies working the desk and all three worked on one lady guest for over ten minutes while I stood by in amazement. One even left the front desk with her for an extended period to help her find Advil or something in the little sundry area by the desk while the other two continued doing something to check her in. Weird. When finally my turn I laughed and asked if that was Donald Trumps wife or something.Room was nice for me and room service burger good but pricey at $26 plus. Too tired to venture out although this is a great location for arena and Bricktown walking. Breakfast in AM was good but confusing as other than telling them my breakfast was in the rate I had nothing to show. Server had to get a manager to confirm it. Weird.Then to top off they tried to post bill me for the ripoff in room water at $8 plus, my worst pet peeve being post billed due to my business reporting. I called and was dealt with curtly by a front desk lady, I assume one of the three I encountered on check in. She said a refund was coming and pretty much hung up.Would likely try them again and hope for a tad better experience in the next trip when I do.There is a Renaissance a block away I stayed in first night but rates are higher since it is full service.BEWARE!!!! I booked my room through Hotels.com's website, for a two night stay. The weekend of my arrival, I was unable to make it the first night, because a grandchild had become ill, so I called to let them know. They said it would be fine and that they would keep my room on hold. The next night, he was feeling better, so we got in the car and drove 100 miles out of the way. Only to discover that they GAVE our room away. Our room that we already PAID for. They also refused to refund me for the night. Not to mention, the hotel staff and manager were very rude and uncooperative. I will never pay another dime to stay at a Marriott hotel. They are thieving imbeciles that are lacking a good customer service team. Very disappointed with my overall experience.Very disappointed in this Courtyard.  I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and would think a downtown location would be one of its best. Location was nice but hotel needs updating. Room were old, rust in shower and felt dirty. The nicest part of hotel was the lobby. I didn't find staff to be particularly helpful either. Will stay somewhere else the rest of my trip out here.Food selection in the market is horrible. You can't get into the parking garage until you check in and get a room key. Makes for a frustrating experience when you arrive late in the day. Decent enough hotel, but the staff was lacking as i stood at the desk for a couple minutes before someone finally popped out of the backroom.  The room was clean and I was on the end so that was a plus.I wouldn't stay here if it weren't for the Marriott points.  Nickel and dime you for everything.  Bathroom smells of sewage.Nice clean great location. Self parking in garage..just tell valet to let you in. There is a charge for parking but wasnt surprised for being in city with this kind of accessibility to everything. Got a chicken noodle soup from bistro, big, hearty and daughter liked it. Drinks were good as well...server was friendly and made sure I liked my appletini or wouldve remade it. Breakfast was big buffet style..service was confusing..had to grab our own utensils...salt n pepper coffee condiments ect. Then wasnt sure how to pay at the end. Food was typical breakfast items but seemed overpriced.The only thing I can really ding is the parking charge, I think it was $15, added to our one-night rate. This wasn't discussed when I made the reservation and it sort of sprung up during check-in. There's no option in the 'hood to park on the street, so it would make more sense to just include it in the room rate. But then again, that would make the downtown rate seem like less of a steal. Great rates for great rooms here. And it certainly helped to have a roof overhead of the truck, as well as my noggin, for one of the worst ice storms in recent Oklahoma City memory. What a way to ring in the holidays, mother nature. When we awoke every twig, plant, tree and sidewalk was covered in a thick sludge of frozen H2O, and by contrast the Courtyard was pretty cozy. Nice bar/restaurant with a breakfast buffet that stays open late into the morning, including an omelette bar. Our room had a mini-fridge, which I consider something of a must if you're dropping anything near a century of bones. The pool was open early, a nice alternative to the exercise room, which was spacious and loaded with newer equipment. For the cost, you can't go wrong at this place. It seems like an ideal spot to plan a stay after a Thunder game and a night on the town. I'm really glad the Yelp Community Manager suggested this shelter from the storm. Thanks, Julie!My friend and I stayed here for a few days for the OKC Thunder game.  It is only a few steps away from Chesapeake Energy Arena and within walking distance to Bricktown restaurants.  We paid $180/night for a 2 Queen bedroom on the top floor with a view of the arena.  The location was very convenient and is the main reason why they earned 5 stars.The room was nice and clean.  We were able to get a good night's sleep while we were there.  They have Paul Mitchell toiletries.  The staff don't smile much but they were ok.  They have 2 elevators, a pool, jacuzzi and a gym.  They need to put darker tint on the gym windows though.  They have a limo that can take you to Bricktown but why even bother when it's only across the street from the hotel?  Finding a cab is rare which is normal even in downtown OKC I guess so you'd have to call for one or have the front desk agent call one for you.  It takes about 20 minutes to get a cab.I would definitely stay here again if I go to another OKC Thunder game.2 stars for location. Fortunately, there are other hotels in the immediate area, We Would never return to this hotel!So here's the ""stuff"":1. Booked our room. Traveling with two teenagers and a baby, we definitely needed to make sure we signed up for the right room. We requested a roll away in addition to our dbl queen. Roll away Had to be approved by the manager,. it was approved and notated on our account.We were driving from out of state and would not arrive until very late. Called to let them know. Ok, no problem they said. I asked if they would like to go ahead and put the extra bed in the room. They said no, when you come is perfectly fine. We arrived, tired and weary from our long drive. Night concierge said give me a minute I have to find your reservation as  she's already ""closed the books for the day"" so she doesn't know what room was assigned to us. (?) Spends the next 25 minutes looking through a paper document and computer. Finally she says,  I think I have a room I've got to go check on it, make sure ""it's clean' (?). She comes back, and gives the key cards and such, I remind her of our requested roll-away...Concierge: oh, well, we can't get the roll away to the room as it needs to be approved by a managerMe: oh that's great because it was approved by a manager, (manager) earlier today said OK, check the account, we were told they would put a note on it.C: oh, there is nothing here and (manager) is not hereMe: blank stareC: I also don't have anyone to deliver the bed at this timeMe: stare continuedMe: well that is unfortunate, however, not our problem... I've called about this very issue twice today and this is very important, that we have this bed.C: oh I'm suuuuuure it's very important (said very loudly)C: I will do my best to get a bed to your roomMe: I've got an able husband and two teen boys that can take the bed up there just show us where it is.C: I can't do thatEventually a bed made it to the room and everyone was able to fall asleep, eventually.2. Room details-handicapped room (would have been fine however it should have been disclosed)-when taking a shower the WHOLE bathroom floor was soaked, bad drainage, sink also had a broken plug which drained the water like molasses. -stench. I really felt as if I was traveling in a third world country and this was my Third world shower/toilet bathroom combo. -carpet was damp and sticky. So nasty. I have a ONE year old.3. Our room was not  visited by housekeeping the following day. It was about 3pm that I brought it up as I thought, you know, they would have come by then or tried to...nothing. So I went downstairs and asked them if someone could come by.Me: hi, I think you guys might have forgotten our room, can we get housekeeping to the room?C (different Concierge): oh well I think they have left for the day. Are you sure you didn't have the sign on the door?Me: yes, I am very sure.  (Thanks for asking??)Housekeeping did not come however I was able to request trash pick up and more towels. Which they semi-promptly delivered. But not any of he above issues come close to my biggest issue.... That the blatant lack of graciousness and caring and BASIC hospitality is just severely lacking. It makes me feel as if these indifferent employees work for a company run by even more indifferent supervisors/general managers/owners. Maybe we came on an off weekend. Maybe they do have a certain level of indifference based on the level of patron ""security"" that being in the location they are in affords them. Maybe I expect a certain level of professionalism and graciousness from a hotel... One thing  that NOT a maybe...  We will never give this or any other CY Marriott's our business again!The valet is absent but the hotel staff is friendly. The room is clean and comfortable. The bed is good. The air conditioning is loud and squeaky. The cable is lacking. The hotel seems pretty empty right now. Guess it's not peak time since the Thunder are out of town. Overall a decent place to stay on a short business trip. This room doesn't have a fridge or microwave, and I'm not sure if any do here.It's a good hotel, gets points for location and price.  It's clean, has a nice and basic restaurant and other than Thunder nights, pretty quiet.  Good family hotel, not fancy, just clean, friendly and safe.  But average.Having stayed, eaten and socialized st various times and have always been very pleased.   Today we went free valet, ate and socialized for few hours.  We went to tip valet and receive our car.  Valet requested 60 dollar park fee for 4 hours.  We had just spent couple hundred in rest/bar and also had room reservations for the next evening.   There needs to be a sign that says valet does not count for bar and restaurant use or 60 dollar fee if no overnight stay.  I cancelled my room for the next evening.Nice location, friendly front desk!  Close to a lot of touristy restaurants.  Gym is mediocre at best.  The bartender sucks though... No acknowledgement whatsover, waste of space.   Go to one of the local bars in the area for better service for sure.Great location- food, drinks, entertainment.  Rooms are clean and accommodating.  Only  two complaints- One, coffee pot in room vs individual cup coffee dispenser.  I've heard from too many people claiming to know people who have cleaned their pantyhose in the pots.  Yuck!  Time to update from coffe pots to cups in room.  Two, the front desk couldn't get the wake-up call correctly.  It was set the day prior (at check-in) for 5:30am.  The desk called at 5am.  After answering and not complaining about the incorrect time, the desk called back at 5:40am with a wake-up call.  Not professional.  Other than two cited complaints, I would have possibly given a four star....Staff is very friendly but room noise on courtyard side of hotel is horrendous. Makes for terrible sleeping conditions. I was on 8th floor and the air conditioner or transformer or whatever that thing is hums loudly constantly and although is at street level penetrates the closed windows. Sold out so could not change rooms. And they have the absolute slowest internet. If you want rest I would not recommend this hotel.We enjoyed our stay here! The staff was super nice and very helpful! Thank you Ashley and Gayla @ the front desk and Jason in Valet Parking! People like u are the reason this place gets good ratings! Keep up the great work!! =))Great hotel!! Couldn't have been a better Mothers Day weekend by the river for a Regatta....they are WAY dog friendly (we have a Great Dane &amp; she couldn't have been more welcomed or loved on by the super friendly staff!) The room was great- movies on demand- had a wonderful breakfast buffet (with an omelet station!) a pool, work out room &amp; one of the best bloody Mary's I've ever had! (&amp; I'm a pro at them!) located in Bricktown you're right in the middle of a ton of great restaurants (try Zio's if you're looking for really good Italian for the whole family)....&amp; we ended just as we began...with the friendly &amp; helpful valets at the front...(thx, Josh!) we'll definitely be back!I love the customer service here. Housekeeping goes above and beyond to make you feel at home. The location is prime but the main reason I come back is because of the service and friendly atmosphere.I love this place! The service is fantastic, the BAR is amazing and they have a gym, pool and business area! I travel to OKC often for work and i love how close it is to the Thunder stadium, Bricktown and highway! Bartenders here are friendly and do a great job! The breakfast buffet is a great start to anyone's day! Always will be back!","Great hotel! Nice location. My boyfriend and I walked everywhere! Bricktown is just a block or two over where there are a ton of places to eat.I stayed here last July for about 2 weeks with my BF, who was taking a class in OKC at the time. The room was very clean and comfortable. The staff was great and the pool was refreshing. You just can't beat the location. We were able to walk or bike (dependent on how stinkin' hot it was) to Bricktown and the surrounding areas in minutes. Downside is that there is no free wifi :(Great hotel! We've stayed here twice in the last few weeks. Both times rooms were spacious and clean. Very comfortable stay. Hotel is easy to get too. Staff is friendly. You're right next to Brick Town. I would definitely recommend this hotel.It is unfortunate that a facility this nice has an outdated billing system that is completely dysfunctional.  The staff was apologetic, but unable to correct the billing issue in a timely fashion.  After repeatedly emailing forms, and then filling them out and faxing them back to the corporate office, my company discovered that the corporate forms are not accepted by this local branch.  This has gone on for two days with multiple employees.  A call to the customer service line yielded equally dismal results.  The operator's solution was to call the front desk and confirm that this billing issue could not be resolved during this stay.  Epic customer service fail, Courtyard by Marriott.  This will be my last visit.Definitely unlike any other Courtyard I have stayed at before.  The location is as good as it gets- next door to the Ford Arena and across the street from the Cox Myriad Center.  I was checking in right as a Thunder game was starting so valet was definitely the way to go.  After that, we were able to walk everywhere when visiting Bricktown and the OKC Museum of Art.  The lobby has a very upscale feel and the room was a bit larger than your average king room.  Very clean and full of cool urban touches.  Even though I was visiting during spring break, we very little noise issues with hearing other guests in their rooms or kids running around unsupervised.I stayed here so much that it got me status with the Marriott chain. I like this hotel - it's clean and friendly. The parking is retarded tho. You need a room card to access the parking garage that costs $10 or $15 a day. When you check you, you have to take a room key and keep it forever cuz you need the card to swipe out of the garage. Great gym!Close to Bricktown.  Good rates.  Nice rooms.I am surprisingly pleased. At first thought I gave this hotel 4 stars but then I reflected a bit more and realized, it really actually deserves five. There was nothing about this hotel that turned me off in the slightest. It was a bit pricey for Oklahoma City in my opinion. I'm not sure what the going rate usually is but let's just put it this way, my hotel room here was more expensive than the hotel I stayed out in New York City. Odd.Anyway, the room was very clean and roomie. As usual, my 'nice room' karma kicked in and I got the corner suite. The temperature was good; not too hot, not too cold. The beds were comfy. Bathroom, clean. The TV was a godsend. It had like every single important channel. The MOST important was ESPN 2 due to the Australian Open. Unfortunately, it only brought me bad news. Roger Federer, the world's number 1 for three consecutive years; has been in 10 consecutive grand slam finals; LOST in the semi-finals to an upcoming young talent, Novak Djokovic (he's quite handsome too but not as cute as his younger brother who looks like he's about 15....is that wrong?). Luckily I know Roger and he'll bounce back. You can't win 'em all. Keep strong, my love. Regardless of the unfortunate outcome, I was able to see the match because I had such a lovely selection of channels.The restaurant was also quite nice. Maybe I will review that in a separate review....Regardless, they had a few things I knew I'd like. The first night I went for the mac n' cheese. Much better than one would have expected from a Marriott hotel in Oklahoma. The second night was the chicken fingers night. Very good. Professionally crisped to perfection with ample dipping sauce and savory spiced fries. I also gained a number from a nice gentleman who was in college. He was an English major and was obsessed with the fact that I was reading ""A Million Little Pieces"". Then he asked me what else I read. Well, luckily I have been a reading machine these days. No cable=an unprecedented interest in contemporary and historical fiction literature. So I rambled off the last ten books I've red. Instant connection. I gained a number. So, the next time I have the unfortunate luck of finding myself in OKC, I may just give him a ring and have an entertaining evening with a nice guy. (FYI,  did you know that according to the New York Times, 40% of Americans have not read one book in an entire year. What has the world come to?)Anything else??? Oh the guy at the front desk was a flake when I checked out. Um hello....why didn't you tell me I needed my key to get out of the stupid parking lot? Ugh. Oh and I spilled coffee in my rental car this morning. Not good. I was so distraught over the Federer upset that it took me a while to get into my groove.Stay here. It's nice. The people are nice. And you don't have to venture into OKC to get food.",,,,"['slept', 'like', 'rock', 'hotel', 'beds', 'nice', 'big', 'love', 'pillows', 'think', 'feather', 'pillows', 'location', 'hotel', 'pretty',

http://www.yelp.com/biz/embassy-suites-oklahoma-city-will-rogers-world-airport-oklahoma-city-3,Embassy Suites Oklahoma City - Will Rogers World Airport,3.5,$$,31,"I've been to OKC 5 times now, always stay at this hotel.  Doesn't look like much from the outside, and incredible from the inside! Greatest part (hands down):  THE SERVICE! The breakfast and restaurant crew are so genuine and nice. My stay wouldn't have been as incredible without them.I wanted to love this place. I did. But I am really particular about where I lay my head - literally! Overall a nice hotel. Not what I expected as its more in line with a Springhill Suites or Residence Inn. They offer free breakfast and free cocktail hour in the evenings. It is close to the airport with friendly staff and quick service. But...both my coworker and I had issues with clean linen on the bed and we were on two completely different floors. She inspected her bed and found hair.....nuff said! I inspected mine and found blood. They sent someone immediately but here is where I deduct stars. I know the ins and outs of hotel stays so I know what to expect. However, I found blood on my bed. Yep, blood! They sent someone immediately and she asks me straight away if I began my stay that day. She was building a case I suppose to say it was my blood. But, not me ma'am! I'm not bleeding and have zero cuts or scratches!! She insists that its fresh but I've not been anywhere near the bed and found it as I was turning the bed down. Why are you trying to convince me to sleep on these bloody sheets? Will the linen fairy doc your pay if you change my linen before I've had a 24-hour stay? I don't understand. Anyhow, she finally changes my linen and asks me if I'd like it changed each day. Uhm, that's a no brainer! The hotel was just okay. The furniture is new but a bit old fashioned. The food (I only had breakfast) was actually really good. The only reason it received 3 stars and not two. I bring my own Clorox wipes and Lysol. I disinfect anything I have to touch. But I was dismayed to see urine stains on the side of the pot. Disgusting! There were food crumbs on the floor by the desk and an old bobby pin that says they don't vacuum. I don't use bobby pins - my hair is super short! So the room was not thoroughly cleaned and again, it's just okay. I cannot say I'd go back if in the area again.Don't eat here. The happy hour bartender opens your food with her mouth and eats directly from the snacks laid out for the guests. Gross! Just imagine what goes on in the kitchen when they're not in plain view of the guests! Couldn't hear the Super Bowl over the bartender and another employee laughing and having a loud discussion at the bar.So far, so great! Every Hilton resort I have stayed at has been fabulous. Unfortunately we got 2 rooms on the 2nd floor where there's smoking rooms in the corner and they smelled like cigarettes, bad! They were sold out so there was nothing they could do about it. So we were given fabreze. The mattresses were also very uncomfortable. Open bar from 5-7 was awesome! Hors d'oeuvres were delicious and breakfast was amazing! Kash &amp; Kelsey were very sweet and helpful when checking our family in. I did leave my bathing suit and cover up behind the bathroom door &amp; no word yet. I have to contact ""Lost &amp; Found"" which is inconvenient. Hopefully I can get them shipped. I will keep you updated!!Food: 2/5Service: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Decor &amp; Style: 2/5The free food they serve in the evening is not regular food, just snacks. At least it is free and at least they serve free beer. Unlike other hotels, there is a bartender at this hotel so a tip is expected whereas others is self-severe (no tip). The restaurant on the main floor serves descent food (see The Landing Bar &amp; Grill). Service is decent, and it is overall pretty clean. The rooms looks pretty good, but the entire layout of the hotel is old and needs updating! I do enjoy that the hotel is very large and gives it a more ""vacationie"" feel.We stayed at this location Embassy Suites OKC Will Rogers World Airport during a cross country move. Because every time we stayed in a hotel during this move we had to unpack our uncovered truck bed we decided to treat ourselves with staying two nights in one location. And what a treat it was. After arriving very late/early morning tired and in need of rest we were looking forward to a welcoming Hilton Brand hotel. We had come from a gorgeous Embassy Suites in Albuquerque so we were excited about staying in another Embassy Suites. The excitement was short lived. Because we arrived so late we couldn't cancel our reservation for the first night. After seeing the lobby &amp; our room we tried to call the Hilton World Wide Reservation number to cancel the second night only to be told the system was down and they couldn't help us for approximately 3 hours (4:AM) It might not be fair to put this Embassy Suites OKC Will Rodgers World Airport in the same category as Albuquerque Embassy Suites because OKC is probably 25+ years older. We asked an employee if this hotel was built as an Embassy Suites they told us no. They informed us this hotel was built over 30+years ago. This hotel is tired. Very tired. This hotel is called Will Rogers World Airport but we never heard an airplane. I do not know if they offer free shuttle service from the hotel to airport terminal. The hotel has a Chili's restaurant right across the street as well as other restaurants. Parking was free. Coffee, tea or iced water are not left out in the lobby. This is new to me. This hotel is definitely not for me but it could be for YOU. If you like to walk past smokers to get in to the hotel, if you love to not be greeted when you enter the lobby, If you like hot stuffy dark lobby's, if you love low ceilings. This hotel is for you if while getting settled in your new room you love finding a dirty towel hiding on the floor on the side of the bed, if you love finding dirty cotton balls in the trash can. This hotel is for you: if you love finding gross hairs in your shower that hasn't been used by you, if you love bathrooms that are so small it is uncomfortable for 1 person. If you love standing in water while taking a shower this hotel is for you. This hotel is for you if you love a room where the air conditioning doesn't work properly, if you love having to move rooms because of air conditioning issues, if you love small elevators that feel more like a hot sauna. This hotel is for you, if you love to go to breakfast to not find a clean table &amp; have to clean your own. This hotel is for you if you love to swat flies with one hand while you are eating with the other (this takes talent). If you love seeing the employees with sweat dripping down their faces because they are also hot. This hotel is for you if you love the feel of springs poking you in the back all night while trying to sleep in the hide a bed. The list goes on. If you love Best Westerns or Drury Hotels this hotel might be for you. This hotel is called Will Rogers World Airport but we never heard an airplane. The hotel has a Chili's restaurant right across the street as well as other restaurants. Parking was free.In the future even if a hotel is a Hilton Brand I might rethink making reservations sight un seen.So far not so great.  Checked in and felt less than welcomed, no water, or snacks given (which I'm accustomed to as Diamond member....  Room clean so that working in their favor.   More in am as need to attend bkfstThis place is great rooms are large and very clean.  Free breakfast and free happy hour. YeahI stayed at this hotel for a women's conference.  Rooms were clean.  Food was good.  I never had to deal with any customer service because my roommates had already checked us in so I don't know how their CS was.  I'm sure they were friendly otherwise my roommates would have said differently.  The beds were smaller than I would have expected a suite to have.  They were double beds.  I know I'm used to sleeping on a king size bed but I would think that for the price of the rooms and the fact that every room is a suite, they would at least have used queen sized beds.  Also, there was so much chlorine in the pool that my eyes started burning after just sitting by the pool for awhile.  I did not go swimming.  The chlorine was definitely potent.If you like Embassy Suites, avoid this one.  Rooms on the East side are very hot. Our 1st room was also dirty. Rooms in the SW corner are closest to the AC water chillers and cool down nicely.I love this place.  Every room is a suite (thus the name of the place) but what's fantastic is the fact that they'll take pets (for a $50 charge).  What's nice is that they don't discriminate pet owners and give you the exact same room as any other guest.The rooms are super comfortable as you walk into a living room area that you can close off with a sofa bed, microwave and mini bar area.  A large LG LCD tv is here too with very modern furnishings.  As you go into the actual bedroom, there's another LG LCD television that faces two beds.  Usual accommodations that you'd expect.You're also given tickets to the breakfast in the morning (which I didn't partake in) which is pretty nice especially since it seemed like a bit more than your usual continental breakfast.This hotel is down the corridor where the airport is, but I didn't hear any aircraft noises.  YMMV here.   The only thing that was a nuisance was the entrance to the hotel area via the street was a very small entrance way and difficult to navigate.  All other entrances are barred off which makes you wonder whether or not they filter traffic due to crime, or if there was some other reason for it.Regardless of the nuisance, this hotel was a joy to stay at and the staff was friendly and the place seemed very current and nice looking.  Very comfortable staying here at an affordable rate and would definitely recommend to anyone that's passing through and looking for a place to stay as we were.Good location, old building but seemed clean. However the prices were awfully high for whatever reason. And the walls near the room door are these strange frosted glass panels as opposed to the usual windows with curtains like Embassy Suites typically have. As another review posted, these frosted glass panels glow rather brightly from the lights outside the room and are not very sound proof. I would imagine trying to sleep in on the couches in the sitting area would not be very easy. It was so bright, I actually closed the door to the bedroom at night. They are in the process of building a new Hampton Inn after the original one on Meridian closed recently which was the cheapest of the Hilton property hotels near the OKC airport. Looking forward to seeing this new Hampton open to offset the high price of this expensive Embassy.It is a very nice, clean hotel that has very good breakfast and everyone that works there seems to be nice also. The only reason I give it four stars is that in the place with the pullout couch is kind bright at night, if you are going to sleep in that room. Overall very nice pretty clean hotel.This place is timeless. I started coming to Embassy Suites when my children were little. They are now pushing 40 so we've been staying at this hotel occasionally for 30 years. The facility shows a little age, but they've been able to maintain it to a pretty high standard for a long time.Mrs Eva was attending a seminar here so we not only roomed, but they catered a dinner for her group. We had steak and the regular trimmings. It was pretty good although not a place that I would seek out for a night on the town.Their foodservice really shines at breakfast where they have a great buffet with all the good breakfast items. It's easy to get overloaded with the large selection. They do have some fresh fruits and a nice cereal bar so there's something for everyone.It is a comfortable and reasonably quiet place to stay. The suites are large with two rooms separated by a door so you can close out the noise of the hallway.A nice place to stay.My family had a great stay at the Embassy Suites in okc. I've been to several ES hotels across the country since I was a kid and this one had the same high level of service as the others.  This Embassy suites seems to be a bit older than others I've stayed at.  The atrium is beautiful by any standards but not as updated or fresh as other ES.  Breakfast was great each morning as well as the complimentary drinks and snacks in the evening when we got back from the days activities.  It was nice to relax and unwind a little each night at the reception.  The pool and hot tub were clean each day and there were plenty of towels each time we were there.  Front desk was great... Actually the entire staff was great.  I'm sure my kids will remember our vacations staying at Embassy suites as much as I do from when I wad a kid.Started off with some maintenance issues (bad tv remote, stuck balcony sliding door, hot water issue) but the sales manager read my previous review and immediately had somebody come to my room and fix everything. She personally made sure my stay was better than ever - I have never had customer service like that before.The beds and rooms are very comfortable and dark. However, if you do have a guest using the foyer, the fogged glass does let light through from the main hotel area so if they prefer a dark sleep, it may not be the best for them. The balconies are tiny and don't offer much excitement.The Manager's reception is very nice and the bartenders are very friendly (they pour well, too.) The snacks provided are party snack mix, a nice variety of veggies and dips, salsa and chips, as well as non-alcoholic drinks. Perfect for an evening snack escapade.The breakfast is amazing - full cooked to order omelettes, including egg whites! Oatmeal, cereal, scrambled eggs, biscuits, bacon, toast, french toast, pancakes, sausage, coffee, juice, hot cocoa, fruits, donuts and pastries. What more could you ask for!I also really appreciate the complimentary airport shuttle - even after hours, you use the blue/yellow airport express vans and the front desk will cover the fare. I used the ATM in the lobby to get some cash and then broke my bills into singles at the front desk.Overall, I had a very nice week and a half stay and I'm glad to have chosen Embassy again. If you are attending the FAA Academy or need transportation to the facility, the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center provides a daily loop bus that stops at the next few hotels south of this hotel, convenient. Check the FAA website for the schedule.Horrible.  If you are looking for a suite-type hotel (meaning a hotel room with an extra sofa-bed in another room) this is NOT your place.  The ""suite"" part has ceiling to floor windows without curtains into the hallway.  They are fogged so privacy isn't a concern but the light is.  There is no way to reduce the light intrusion into the room and they are on all night.  The end result - forget about sleeping in that part of the suite.  The windows do not block noise either so you can hear even the slightest conversation in the hall. SEE PICTURES I POSTED.11/23/2013 UPDATE: The hotel apologized and rectified the situation very quickly.  My husband travels often so if his next visit goes smoothly then I will re-update with 5 stars.  My husband (Robert) is part of Embassy Suites' reward program and made special arrangements a week in advance to check in late as he would be flying all day.  He reaches the Embassy Suites in Oklahoma City, again, after flying all day, only to be told they don't have room for him and asked him to go down the street.  They gave him the wrong name for the hotel, so my husband was in a unfamiliar city, past midnight, tired, searching for a hotel that doesn't exist.  This is unacceptable!The hotel over all is nice. Front  desk staff is very helpful and friendly. I don't normally get the opportunity to use the pool or jacuzzi and I was looking forward to a nice soak. Not only was the jacuzzi lukewarm, but the water was more than questionable. And I know using water glasses is never suggested in hotels, and I won't use the ones here either. One of the glass' had a drop of leftover soda in it. And later that day after house keeping was there, still there with a new lid placed on it.Okay, so I asked the cab driver to take me (from the airport) to the row of hotels, this just before he claimed that I told him that some random right offramp was what I wanted (he charged me an additional 20$ for the unauthorized detour). Then the girls @ check in told us @ 1:30pm it would be another hour, only allowing us to ""register"" for a room that night and then couldn't place us in a room until after 4pm (something about them having given late check out to a large party the night before). The ""gift shop"" doesn't have ANYTHING (but sodas &amp; suckers) that one might need in an emergency AND since the streets of Commerce Ave are void of sidewalks, I was at the mercy of the local cab scammers or the Embassy Suites shuttle driver in my attempt to find diapers for purchase. So, after taking 2 kids (and a stroller) on an off road adventure to the nearby Sinclair (only to find maxi pads that I tried combining with a swim diaper~ by this time we also needed umbrellas &amp; bandaids for blisters), I called the front desk with my diaper (now with added RASH) crisis. She said that the shuttle driver could pick up diapers for me.....no surprise that it took him 2 hours to squeeze that in. The Embassy Suites in Hot Springs Arkansas is our favorite summer fun destination and the differences between the 2, make OKC and Embassy Suites look awful! The key cards are new though, and really cool.","Great service, friendly staff!! Room service was great. Front desk helped me return my rental car by following me in the shuttle to bring me back from Hertz. All around great hotel to stay at!!!Nice place.  Great service.  Only complaint is the 50.00 non refundable fee for bringing a pet.  I can see putting a hold on your card, but non refundable?  Either you are a pet friendly hotel or not.Good- They have a great breakfast bar and the rooms were large for the price. I liked the fountains and the plants in the center courtyard/atrium.Bad- Very slow elevators, TV kept cutting in and out. Not enough luggage carts to go around.Wonderful first hotel on a long road trip. Staff was helpful and space was nicely located for us since we were just passing through. We missed the Manager's Reception (aka complimentary happy hour) but it looked like a nice way to meet people. Room service was quick and reasonably priced.I really like this place, service, food, other guest's mannerism, etc.Nice hotel. Pet friendly. We were on a cross country road trip with two dogs, and this place worked out quite well. The only problem is that if you have dogs it can be a long walk from your room to an outdoor grassy patch. Breakfast was good, the staff was friendly, and there were no issues during our stay. The room was clean and well kept.Whoooo Hooo! Free breakfast &amp; Happy Hour plus a pool!  It don't get mo betta!Pretty clean, quick room service.  Nice to have a hotel that still has a few smoking rooms on the top floor.I've always been a fan of Embassy Suites.  This location was very accommodating: provided a large variety of hot breakfast items and good cook-to-order omelets/eggs in the morning (thank you to the breakfast cook!), a FREE ice scraper (I really needed it one morning and the desk rep was very nice not to charge), quick check out, and clean, spacious, and warm rooms.  My only grip was that there was no hot water for the shower late at night.  I ran it for 5 minutes and it was luke warm at best.  I had to wait until the morning to take a shower.  One less star for that!This is a good mid range priced hotel near the airport in OKC.  Nothing special and nothing different from any other Embassy Suites that we have stayed at.  My favorite part of staying at Embassy Suites is the hot breakfast bar that is included in the price of the room.  Everything from Omelets to pancakes to muffins or whatever you could want.   The rooms are pretty nice and the overall service is above average.  Another nice thing about this particular hotel is that there are four or five restaurants within walking distance.Overall, it was a good stay but not great.  I would stay there again if we were flying out of OKC under the same situation, but if coming to OKC from somewhere else i would stay closer to downtown.  There are several nicer hotels and you would be closer to other event venues and restaurants.Fantastic hotel. Clean, nice staff, and no added fees. The breakfast was excellent and the staff was warm and helpful to our three kids. We stayed here twice during a cross-country road trip and were very impressed.",,,,"['times', 'always', 'hotel', 'look', 'like', 'much', 'outside', 'incredible', 'inside', 'greatest', 'part', 'hands',
